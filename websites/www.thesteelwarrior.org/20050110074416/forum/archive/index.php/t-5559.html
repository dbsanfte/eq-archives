oriented, I'd be grateful )<br />
<br />
( Yes, I've already posted this same message at a few other sites ... I'm an a$$ ^_^ )<br />
<br />
Warning -- this is a Religious Rant!  It is long, incoherent, rambling and boring.  Proceed at your own risk.<br />
<br />
-<br />
-<br />
-<br />
<br />
John 3:16<br />
<br />
No, it's not in reference to a computer virus.  But this passage did get me into a philosophical frame of mind, once or twice.  John 3:16 gets me thinking about a Tree and a Monkey.<br />
<br />
A Tree?<br />
<br />
The Tree of Life<br />
== According to the writings, Man has tasted fruit from this Tree.<br />
== Suppose this Tree is loosely related to a &quot;decision-making tree&quot;?  i.e. Tree of Choice = Tree of Life?<br />
== Each branch of the Tree could represent choices to be made in life.<br />
<br />
But Khemo ... where'd the Monkey come from?<br />
<br />
Introducing at least three aspects of every human being<br />
== The Old Man (or Old Woman) ... we will affectionately refer to this aspect as &quot;The Monkey&quot;<br />
== The Soul<br />
== The New Man (or New Woman)<br />
<br />
FIRST ASPECT -- &quot;The Monkey&quot;<br />
== The Monkey is the &quot;Id-Ego-Superego&quot; that makes up the &quot;You&quot;, the current perception of the self ... he/she is also the person everyone else sees<br />
== One of the primary functions of the Monkey is to make choices and decisions.  The Monkey makes choices by selecting different branches on the Tree to swing from<br />
== The physical form of the Monkey is perhaps a temporary housing/vessel for the Soul?<br />
== The Monkey is a descendant of those who have eaten fruit from the Tree<br />
== Is the Monkey a glorified selection and sorting tool for the Soul's &quot;final destination&quot;?<br />
== Being a creature of time and mortality, there is no &quot;life after death&quot; for the Monkey.  Death obliterates the Monkey aspect.  However, choices the Monkey has made in its short lifespan may have been imprinted somehow on the Soul.<br />
<br />
SECOND ASPECT -- &quot;The Soul&quot;<br />
== the bridge between the Monkey and the New Man/Woman<br />
== the Monkey is vaguely aware of the presense of the Soul ... but the Soul is beyond the Monkey's meager senses to perceive with any certainty.<br />
== The Soul is eternal, enjoying an existence beyond the concept of time ... it always will be and, perhaps, always was.<br />
== The Soul requires a vessel to interact with a physical plane<br />
<br />
THIRD ASPECT -- &quot;The New Man/Woman&quot;<br />
== The New Man/Woman is NOT a descendant of a &quot;taster&quot; of the fruit from the Tree of Life.  This new being is a brand new creation generated some time AFTER the passing of the Monkey.<br />
== This new being is built to last ... he/she is imbued with the ability to survive eternally in any environment ... in a &quot;life after death&quot;.  A perfect new home for the Soul.<br />
== After the New Man/Woman inherits the Soul from the Monkey, is this new being able to make decisions?  If so, do these decisions appear to matter or change anything?<br />
<br />
-<br />
-<br />
-<br />
<br />
Ok ... so's I'm a Monkey swinging from branch to branch on the Tree of Life, making choices.<br />
<br />
What's John 3:16 got to do with the Tree of Life and the Monkey?<br />
<br />
John 3:16 represents a branch on the Tree.  This branch is the critical one that CAN determine the final distribution of the Soul and the New Man/Woman in the hereafter.  The Monkey can control this distribution by deciding whether or not to swing on that particular branch of the Tree of Life.  Eventually, when Death slaps the Monkey out of the Tree, the Monkey is forever dead and gone ... unable to make any more decisions ... forgotten and unlamented by everyone (except perhaps other Monkeys).<br />
<br />
So ... if all this bullcrap has any validity or truth, MY question is:<br />
<br />
     What's in it for the Monkey?<br />
<br />
     What's the primate's motivation for swinging from the Tree in the first place?<br />
<br />
     WHERE'S MY GAWD DAM BANANA??!?<br />

<br />
A.  A Bad thing happenned to me or someone I am close to<br />
<br />
B. Therefore I can exclude the possibility of a source of life greater than my experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
It just doesn't follow, I mean, perhpas you could say &quot;Because this thing which I view as cruel occurred, I have concluded that if a god exists, he doesn't prevent pain&quot;, then ok, it's logical, but the above is pretty illogical, it's taking two unrelated things and trying to force a relationship that doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could better say &quot;Because I haven't experienced god, I choose to believe that he either doesn't exist or is impossibly difficult for me to understand&quot;, but it's the height of arrogance for anyone to say &quot;It is a fact that no diety exists&quot;, because one would have to posess all knowledge, in essence being god himself to make such a claim, which would then be false anyhow.   <br />
<br />
I won't argue theology with you, but I will argue logic, and statements that are illogical will be challenged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then does it not also stand to reason that saying &quot;God does exist&quot; is also the height of arrogance?<br />
<br />
When a child has an imaginary friend, they say he's creative.<br />
<br />
When a man has an imaginary friend, they say he's crazy.<br />
<br />
When the same man names that imaginary friend God, they say he's Religious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I'd define faith a little differently and certainly less inflammatory.    Faith = Belief without unerring proofs.<br />
<br />
It's kind of a big difference.   <br />
<br />
I have faith when I go to the local 7-11 and buy a 6-pack of Budweiser that I'm getting 6 cans filled with beer and not 6 cans filled with urine.    I have no clue what's on the inside of those cans, but choose to believe that the Anheuser-Busch corporation and the Southland Corporation (The company that owns 7-11) wouldn't supply me with something which is different from what they labelled it as.  I don't demand that each bottle be opened and I do a chemistry analysis on it prior to my purchase.<br />
<br />
When a waiter comes to my table and asks me what I'd like to eat, and the cook prepares it and they bring it to me, they accept by faith that I have the ability to pay for the meal, they don't ask to see my wallet prior to serving me.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the only &quot;faith&quot; which people hold to a higher standard, one of aboslute exclusion of all other possibilities, is religious faith.    There is no other type of &quot;faith&quot; that people spend so much time and effort arguing against.   Probably for good reason, because in the name of such &quot;faith&quot;, many horrendous acts have been performed, another interesting concept, since also in the name of such &quot;faith&quot;, many incredible acts of humanity have also been performed, which opponents of religion seem to conveniently ignore.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, I haven't seen any of the arrogance that you described (i.e. Declarations of the absolute existence of a diety), yet I've seen at least one declaration of a dietie's non-existence, and an implication in another.    I would agree that it is as much arrogance to, without unalterable proof (of which none exists) delcare the absolute existence of a diety to the exclusion of all other possibilities.<br />
<br />
No one's done so in this thread though, so it's a little hard to corner someone on it if it hasn't been done.   The only people who seem to have really spoken up on the thread have been people who arrogantly assume that they are &quot;too smart&quot; to believe in a diety, yet do not deliver anything of substance to defend their position outside of arrogance and &quot;I know better&quot;.   This is a serious topic, one which I don't believe belongs here, as it's too personal and too volatile for this forum, but if someone's going to trip over themselves to show off their &quot;enlightened state of non-belief&quot;, then I'm gonna call them on it.<br />
<br />
You yourself have implied in your little &quot;proverb&quot; that people who believe in the existence of a diety are either crazy or have a childlike intellect, both of which are silly notions, but heck, it sounds both smart and smug, so why not?    <br />
<br />
As I said, I'm not going to argue dieties with you, but I *will* argue logic and substance, and so far, I've seen little to none.</div></div><hr />

Ayer, author of &quot;Language, Truth, and Logic&quot; and head of the logical positivist school of philosophic thought, was an atheist.  And went to great lengths to convince his contemporaries that God did not exist.  <br />
I'm not going to go in depth on his reasons, it all has to do with what can and cannot be proven, read the book for more details.  Anywho,  late in his life he had a near death experience and described the classical &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot; experience.  Later, upon being asked if he still thought he was indeed right in his earlier assesment that God does not exist, his reply was. &quot;I'm not so sure, but I sincerely hope I'm right.&quot;  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
God pointed out two trees to Adam in the garden of eden.<br />
<br />
The first tree was the Tree of Life. God gave Adam permission to eat from this tree. The second tree was the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil and God forbid Adam from eating fruit from that tree. <br />
<br />
The second tree is the one that Adam ate from and as punishment God kicked Adam out of the garden so he couldn't eat fruit from the Tree of Life as well.<br />
<br />
But yes, the tree who's fruit Adam tasted is the tree of choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your anologies of faith are somewhat lacking, unlike with God, I can open a can and smell the piss.<br />
<br />
I am not here to question anything or argue anything.  I mearly pointed out you were arguing against a flawed statement by issueing a flawed statement of your own.  You said it was arrogant to make a conclusive statement that there is no god and I merely pointed out the fact that in making that kind of statement, you have to account for the other side of the argument.  I am obviously not the only one that conviently ignores things.<br />
<br />
And you are correct, there has been great things done in the name of God, just like there have been great things done without the benefit of a deity.  Likewise for horrible tragedies.  People don't need the aegis of a supreme being to be good and do good works, religious people tend to ignore that fact as well.<br />
<br />
No one's done so in this thread though, so it's a little hard to corner someone on it if it hasn't been done.

<br />
Nice veiled attempt to belittle my intelligence.  Does it prove your point?  Or just make you feel better?  Oh, it must be that your are just truly the the enlighted one.  See, I can degenerate in to petty under cutting too when someone questions my beliefs.<br />
<br />
Like you, I have not made a conclusive statement of my beliefs, but I can also read between the lines of your posts and extract what I want, you're not alone in that ability.  And like you, I am equalling willing to call someone on there arrogant assumptions. <br />
<br />
<br />
As I said, I'm not going to argue dieties with you, but I *will* argue logic and substance, and so far, I've seen little to none. <br />
<br />
Again, I agree with you, I will not argue the existance or lack their of, of a deity.  However, I will tell you that I and those like me do not need your faith, doctrines and dogma.  I ask that you keep your beliefs to yourself and I will do likewise and this thread can die right here.  Nothing I can say will shake your beliefs and assure you nothing you say can shake mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While your concept of a &quot;flaw&quot; would have merit, had I denied the arrogance of the inverse, I actually agreed with you from the getgo that the inverse would be equally arrogant.   The reson it's not &quot;flawed&quot; is because one does not need to counter arguments which have not been made, and the argument of an absolute existence of a diety hasn't been made on this thread to &quot;counter&quot;.   Only the absolute denial of such existence has been proposed, and that is the position which was argued against.  Had someone made the opposite argument, or argued from an equally flawed premise, I'd have called them on it just as much.    <br />
<br />
The thing is there's no mandate to counter arguments which haven't been made.</div></div><hr />

I'm with the crowd that sincerely hopes the concepts of &quot;God&quot; and &quot;afterlife&quot; are just productions of Man's ego.  That concepts of good and evil are simply adaptive mechanisms geared to ensure the human race does not simply self-destruct.<br />
<br />
Our knowledge will always be limited, but the questions posed of the universe seem limitless.  Continually asking &quot;Why?&quot; in a progressively investigative response to any question imaginable will cause even the most intellectual mortal being in existence to eventually respond &quot; I don't know. &quot;.

The Bible is very interesting, even if you're not a Christian/Jew, for the simple fact that it is wide open to interpretation and extrapolation to our modern times.  I would never be so arrogant as to say that I have all the answers, so I find it curious that so many people claim to &quot;know&quot; what the Bible is saying.<br />
<br />
Like many world religions, I think Christianity/Judaism has more to do with one's own interpretation of the writings than it does with extracting any solid facts.  If you read the Bible and draw conclusions from it, then congratulations - you're doing exactly what Biblical scholars through the ages have done... and it's unlikely that anyone can prove you wrong unless your conclusions are directly contradicted by other parts of the Bible.<br />
<br />
Want to believe something?  Go nuts.  That's the joy of being human and having an advanced brain.<br />

Personally, I'm going to stick with the notion that the world was created as a franchise of a &quot;Popcorn Human&quot; restaurant chain that spans thousands of galaxies.  Just wait till the &quot;customers&quot; get here... we're all gonna fry!  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm interested in this since I made a response to something which was posted (i.e. an illogical statement that &quot;because something I don't like happenned, there is no god&quot;), and the conclusion that one can know that there is no diety (impossible, it takes as much faith to believe anything regarding the purpose of life), and yet when someone brought up a reasonable response (wouldn't that mean that it's also arrogant to make a declaration which is the inverse?) there was no dodging, no backpedalling, I completely agreed in the next response.  This was the statement I had used in my FIRST response to the question raised.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, I haven't seen any of the arrogance that you described (i.e. Declarations of the absolute existence of a diety), yet I've seen at least one declaration of a dietie's non-existence, and an implication in another. I would agree that it is as much arrogance to, without unalterable proof (of which none exists) delcare the absolute existence of a diety to the exclusion of all other possibilities.<br />
<br />
I've been quite consistent on this matter the whole time, no backpedalling required.   I'm afraid that if someone saw backpedalling, it was an illusion, since my position has been consistent.   My position is simple, VERY simple.<br />

-There is no possible way to verify or discount the absolute existence or non-existence of a diety, therefore anyone's ideas regarding them is based on faith and speculation.<br />
<br />
- Religionists have a tendency to be overbearing and boorish, and attempt to dictate discussions with an unwilling audience, and don't understand or want to believe that anyone who is going to change their world-view regarding the existence or non existence of a diety is going to do so on their own time based on their own needs, and not based on their &quot;preaching&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Atheists, or Anti-Religionists have a tendency to be arrogant and condescending, and refuse to believe that their world view regarding a diety of lack thereof is based on as much faith as those whom they decry as &quot;simpletons&quot;, that the &quot;faith&quot; is simply faith in a different era in which their information comes from, i.e. their &quot;faith&quot; is in people from the 18th to 20th Century, whereas Religionists have &quot;faith&quot; in people that ranges in date from around 2000BC to today, mostly in an era from the time of David to about 600ish AD.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the only intellectually honest people are those who either<br />
<br />
A. Declare that they have faith in their world view that's based on personal experience, and not on existential deduction or anything other than a desire to believe and a willingness to overlook inconsistencies.<br />
<br />
B. Agnostics, who readily admit that they don't know and don't want to decide.</div></div><hr />
