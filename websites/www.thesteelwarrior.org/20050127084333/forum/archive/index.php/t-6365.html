<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would start by upgrading your legs, possibly with Blessed Full Mithril or Full Mithril, whichever is cheaper.   Kylong greaves from Veksar would also be a nice upgrade, as would Greaves of the Orcish Master from LDoN *can buy them in the bazaar*.  Then, move on to the bracers, and use smithed cultural there as well, or, do the Bracers of Benevolence quests.  Arms would also be ok with cultural, as would boots.  Boots you can also upgrade with LDoN drops, either by adventuring yourself and gaining points, or by winning/buying some of the droppable boots found in LDoN.  If you have the time actually, any of your main visible armour slots(BP, legs, arms, bracers, gauntlets, greaves, boots, helm) could be nicely upgraded with LDoN points gear, either from Everfrost camp, or North Ro if you have a LOT of time.  That would save you some pp for other upgrades such as jewellery, etc.   <br />
<br />
Alternately, another route could be to get some friends together, and go and hit Veksar for some Kylong armour.  A lot of the pieces are pretty nice.  You can also purchase the stuff in the bazaar as well, but be sure to get the Kylong gear from Veksar, as there is some older Kylong gear in game from.. Howling stones, I think it is, that isn't as nice.<br />
<br />
One thing I would say tho, is this.  If you are buying your upgrades, buy the very best gear you can afford, even if it's only 1 piece at a time.  That way, you're done worrying about that slot again, until you can upgrade it by raiding or something.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
