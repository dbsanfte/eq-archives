<br />
I am looking at upgrading weapons soon and would like to know if this new toy is worth looking at?  Or should I just go for the standard issue CHoS and SotBS cookie cutter combo?<br />
<br />
Currently I wield a SBoZ and HoH, but at 49 am starting to look for something new.<br />
<br />
Appreciate any advice here</div></div><hr />

For dps, use a 2hand.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the selection of 2hand weapons at that level is what you mean.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most decent ratio 2 handers have recommended or required levels on them &gt; 49.  This lowers the ratio or eliminates them entirely.  Also, the damage bonus at this level for either 1 or 2 handers isn't real high yet.  The same may hold true for 1 handers as well about the recommended/required levels, it has been a while since I have been 49 and that was before the 2 hander revamp.<br />
<br />
I haven't parsed it on a lvl 49 warrior but would think that a decent pair of one handers like CHoS, smithed Ykesha's, Frostbringer, SBoZ, etc. would outdamage most 2 handers available at that level.<br />

I seem to get a ton of procs off the CHoS and it is also auged with heated blade...  those 179 and 50's seem to add up nicely and rarely are resisted.  I only use my WMBS to keep 2HS skill up.  Am I just misperceiving that my DPS is just as good with the DW combo?</div></div><hr />

Recommended level is uhh, ahem, broken.<br />

Keep it under your hat and go get a windblade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT ... <br />
<br />
&quot;Personally I can't see how you would be doing more damage with 2 1hand weapons at level 49 than with a good 2hand weapon. &quot;<br />
<br />
Two words: DAMAGE ... BONUS.<br />
<br />
Look at your damage bonus prior to level 55. It sucks with 2handers. It's not so hot with 1handers, but prior to level 51, dual wield options tend to be a far better DPS choice than most 2handers. But that obviously varies depending on what you have available (A Reaver is probably going to outdo a Wurmslayer and a Centi Shortsword).<br />
<br />
Monks are in a slightly different boat than warriors. Their dual wield skill caps at 252 in their mid 30s. Monks will get more out of a dual wield setup than a &quot;comprable&quot; 2hander setup until at the very LEAST level 55, but more than likely level 60, where they get a damage table upgrade AND triple attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, damage bonus in the low 50s is pretty pathetic.  2-handers get a good boost around 60ish, but as usual it's hard to predict your dps without parsing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leafstorm</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But, what abou the LSoY? We didn't answer his original question yet....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RavenHugin</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up one of these for lik 7K when Ldon first came out.  Put a proc augment and it is fun to play with.  It actually looks like a 2H graphic on it it is so large.<br />
<br />
No way I would pay 30K for it tho.  What are you looking to do with the weapon?<br />
<br />
Get agro or deal damage and budget  is the questions you need to ask then base what you buy on thiose factors. Now if ya have the plat to spend it does look diffrent.<br />
<br />
If you looking for good 1H weapons look at the Copper Hammer of flattening and sword of the bloodsworn.  They tend to be decent and run in a good price range.  Or you can even camp them if ya have a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to comment on 2H vs 1H for DPS.. vs. Katta banker, I parsed almost identical DPS with WMBS, 58.3 dps vs 58.7 dps for BoC mainhand and CHoS offhand combo.  Haven't had a chance to parse yet with CHoS main and BoC in offhand, to see if that makes any difference to DPS.<br />
<br />
-Edit- forgot to add, that the 1HS combo also includes full proc DPS from the CHoS.  That's somewhat misleading then, as the proc is resisted a fair bit in real combat, which was not the case in the parse.  Silly me, didn't think of that until after I had deleted my parse logs, so I'll be redoing that to just check melee dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mytemo</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, well prices are crazy on my server atm (the 7th hammer).  Personally I dont have 30k for a new toy.  But the heart of my question is:<br />
<br />
Would the dmg/delay be sufficient to generate both agro and high DPS?<br />
<br />
  More hits mean more agro and the dmg per hit on this seems to be quite nice for a dropable 1hs that is warrior equipable.<br />
<br />
Does the smaller delay outweigh the lack of a proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">robertburch</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it wont.<br />
The stun proc on both the hammer and the bloodsworn sword will get you your agro, ok dps from yak sword with no proc will not. <br />
Oh yes, and get a GSoT for twohand. :)</div></div><hr />
