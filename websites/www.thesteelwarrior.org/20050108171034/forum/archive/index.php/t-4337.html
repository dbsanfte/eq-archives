<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pand2224</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my main is now a 65 druid and i regulary heal for both a 65 pally and a 65 warrior.ive found the difference between the 2 classes ability to hold aggro startling.example.when the pally tanked the mob at 95 percent i snared and put 500 hp of dot damage on the sun revenant in the grey; he didnt budge from the pally.when the pally left and was replaced by a 65 warrior weilding epic swords i snared at 95 percent and doted with the lowest dot i use the drones of doom 34 hp a tick.i was amazed to see the mob taking off after me.it wasnt until the mob was at 60 that the warrior had secured aggro.i then added more dots but was never able to do the same damage i could have done with a pally tanking.if you dont believe me you can do the same test.warriors are broken and its no secret except to sony.i heard a guildie remark last night how a 62 pally was chosen to tank for them over a 65 warrior in a tier 3 dungon.perfect example of a gimped class.i retired my well equipt 58 warrior months ago when a lesser equipt 56 pally drasticly out preformed me holding aggro.my heart goes out to those of you who have leveled to 65.until something is done in the programing room your going to be lfg alot.spam the feedback maybe someone will wake up</div></div><hr />

Thanks pand2224, we appreciate the support. Some of us are just so frustrated by this - I mean, it's obvious, and SOE deliberately ignores it - that we sometimes let it get to us.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for that precious insight nephew. But I believe that when you do learn English, they teach you Capitilization, and most importantly, paragraphs!</div></div><hr />

Hi!<br />
<br />
<br />
I am a not a grammer nazi, but if I going to read something, I expect:<br />
<br />
1. Some coherency<br />
2. Punctuation<br />
3. Not total gibberish<br />
4. Not alot of |33+ $p33|&lt;<br />
<br />
Also, if you look at my posts, you will notice that I do not use leet speak unless I am poking fun. So next time you decide to call someone for &quot;leet speak&quot;, I advise you know what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS this is extremely fun duoing in PoEarth too (minus the running part) just hope for a proc before you go splat from it! :p</div></div><hr />

We all know what a pain it is to try and grab aggro on something that is running around .. especially if it runs at SoW speed .. gahh.</div></div><hr />
