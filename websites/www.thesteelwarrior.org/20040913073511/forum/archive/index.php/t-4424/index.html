<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sam Deathwalker originally posted this in the Tavern - It's taken from: EverquestLive (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=59510)<br />
<br />
Some pretty large changes are coming to the melee system:<br />
<br />
You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com<br />
<br />
<br />
 Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting<br />
 Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes<br />
 Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat<br />
 Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay<br />
<br />
Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill!<br />
<br />
Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats).<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a combat example:<br />
<br />
A warrior is serving as the tank for his group, standing in front of a goblin. While battling the goblin, the warrior makes an exceptional parry and is presented with an opening. An indicator appears with the &quot;opening icon&quot; and the word &quot;Parry&quot; next to it (this information also appears in the chat window).<br />
<br />
Now is his opportunity to strike back after the exceptional parry! Only certain combat skills can be used to react to a parry opening. Other types of openings will allow the use of other skills. Some skills may be usable in response to more than one type of opening. Also, your position in relation to the target can change the effectiveness of certain skills.<br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior knows that he can use one of three combat skills, each having some merit. One might stun the target, one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds, and one might make it easier for everyone to hit the NPC.<br />
<br />
In this case, our warrior elects to try to stun the goblin. He presses the appropriate button and luck smiles upon him as he successfully executes the strike, leaving the goblin standing dumbly for a combat round.<br />
<br />
Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills<br />
<br />
<br />
 Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool<br />
 Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills<br />
 Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose<br />
 Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters<br />
 Disciplines will be transferred to this new system<br />
 Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer<br />
 Disciplines will require an Endurance cost<br />
 Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
<br />
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward.<br />
<br />
This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This sounds like it could be fun and would make us Warriors think about during battle but finding this maunals<br />
<br />
How offen can we get a maunal?<br />
How fast once the system is up and running until we have all the skills?<br />
Will I have to retool my gear now?<br />
How will this correct the Tanking issue?<br />
<br />
Just some of my concerns on the post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait till the 24th to find out.   This was just a blurb, this is a MAJOR update and BOOST for us.  Be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am I know this was just a blurb.<br />
<br />
I am going to be patient and hope the best.<br />
Either way this will be really fun.<br />
<br />
This is going to be a Major Boost for us and I for one cant wait.<br />
<br />
These were just questions that came to mind and might need to be asked come the 24th</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hope all those people bitching about the postponed Stand Down will shut the fuck up now.<br />

This could potentially be a great addition to the game.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
Coincidence that this announcement came on the 18th? /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All in all this is quit interesting, and its apperant they been listening to us, or at least reading the suggestions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting<br />
 Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes<br />
 Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose<br />

<br />
Playing through Itemization is bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

 Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines<br />
(Whats good for the Coffemaker is good for the Espresso/Caffe/Latte machines.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm this could be taken several ways, still confused how chain casting stun is skilled playing. /shrug<br />
<br />
one might increase the hate generated by the warrior for a few rounds This one Scares me ! if this is all they have considered for warrior aggro.<br />
just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Quetazl Coatl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with Garoar, playing through itemization is bad. And to assist in aggro, I now have to farm for some manual, take it to a trainer while other classes mash a hotkey..<br />
<br />
I know this is just a blurb, but to me it sounds like Beta Testing the combat system for EQ2. How else do we go from &quot;We don't have anything at this time&quot; patten response to this whole new system?<br />
<br />
Also concerned with these small WINDOWS of oppertunity. As buggy and laggy the game can be for me and I'm sure hunderds of other people not playing on optimal systems, gonna really suck if I miss those becuase server lag or my ludicrisly unreliable local ISP (no competition sucks in the ISP / Cable market).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lag has always been dangerous....<br />
how does the Auto-Attack deal with lag spikes?? When the mob is inc, if you lag, the cleric or the shaman gets it.<br />
<br />
When they say Small.. it's incredibly relative... Small could go from 1 second to 10 seconds....<br />
Personally I'd bet on different possiblities for different skills.. some of the more frequent &quot;openings&quot; would last maybe 2 seconds, while the rarer ones last 10 seconds....<br />
<br />
the goal is for the player to be stressed about pressing the right skill, and having to think fast...<br />
10seconds is good enough to achieve that goal... doesn't allow you to &quot;memorise&quot; a new skill, nor to ask your group for advice on which would be best....<br />
just enough to make a decision, find the skill and click it...<br />
<br />
<br />
Though I am a bit disappointed on the idea of having the openings AND the chance of skills landing, both random...<br />
We should have some random openings, a couple semi-controllable ones, and have the skills always work.... Resistance is another matter though.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the fear most people have atm... they've only given examples...<br />
like that &quot;one might increase the hate generated by a warrior for a few rounds&quot;.... there is NO reason to be scared that its the only idea they have...<br />
it's not even an idea.. you might never see that particular skill in-game.<br />
<br />
It's just to give us a general idea of what they've got planned... and they did say there's more to come...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kieeyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">cool a casting system for melee!!</div></div><hr />

cool a casting system for melee!!  <br />
<br />
If you cant beat em join em</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kieeyy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thats what it sounds like <br />
<br />
using multiple disciplines then taking a endurance cost for each one, lowering our new endurance bar aka timer <br />
<br />
there making us in to caster people!!!<br />
<br />
but really it sound some what of a caster spell system but not <br />
it may be good yet it may not guess we'll have to wait and see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lol how quickly people are with shouting &quot;we are casters now&quot;<br />
Using a bar that recharges for special attacks is not the definition of a caster,  you know?<br />
<br />
I guess some people were just too happy with Auto attack on, afk 30 secs reading steelwarrior...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It is funny to me how folks are jumping to one side of the fence or the other as far as this and the standdown goes.<br />
<br />
IF this addresses our issues, I will be pleasantly surprised. <br />
<br />
It's a change.  Changes like this will calm unruly masses, for a time.  <br />
<br />
What has been proposed in the announcement still does not address a lot of issues.<br />
<br />
We will see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This was just a blurb, this is a MAJOR update and BOOST for us. Be patient. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry but what is your optimism based on?<br />
<br />
Nothing I see about &quot;playstation style&quot; moves addresses:<br />
<br />
1. Taunt (well I guess twitch fests might help if you have the sugared up attention span it takes)<br />
<br />
2. Generica itemization (aka all sizes fit all classes HP homogenization)<br />
<br />
Of course we will all play wait and see...and I agree with those who say this came as a direct prompt of threat of the standdown...a very disappointing way to get changes made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Initially when they mentioned melee changes a few months ago, one of the items mentioned was improving melee weapons along with new damage dealing abilities/disciplines.  We shall see.. I'm sure the question on itemization will come up tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Soulflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What was suggested on the EQ Live board really doesn't tackle the problems warriors need.<br />
<br />
 1) Agro - Snap Agro from the start and maintaining agro w/o the use of procs or random abilities. <br />
<br />
 2) Damage Mitigation -  While knights should be able to tank and I have no problem with them being able to do so, the warrior should be the king of mitigation. <br />
<br />
The 4% mitigation on test server is a joke, if SoE is calling that the mitigation upgrade. Remove our Evassive and Defensive skills and give us a innate 20 - 30% mitigation. Monsters in EQ won't gain this skill as it will put melee into more of a despair vs casters in terms of DPS.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery 3 should allow the warriors to see very few riposte thrown back at them if any. The skill is next to useless and a waste of points. Duel Wield was supposed to be an advantage vs 1H or 2H, instead its a disadvantage due to Ripostes.<br />
<br />
 3) DPS - Either raise ours ( and other pure melee ) or nerf the knights. Furor provides some excellent 9 hour + logs that show how skewed itemization is in the game. <br />

Always good to know that knights can do as much damage with top end 2H weapon vs a Warrior with a top end 2H weapon. Note that Behemoth had a +50 attack over Kreugen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 4) Itemization -  The main reason why classes are out of balance. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These are the 4 hard points that really need to be tackled. Will Sony address them? I highly doubt it. Its more likely they will throw a bone, the illusion of something new that will side track us from our existing cancer. Absor is a PR representive for SoE. His job is to blow smoke screens, hide the real issues, and give the illusion that he is there supporting your class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, since I don't think my list of 4 hard topic will be addressed by SoE, lets talk about their bone they are throwing us.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see:<br />
<br />
1) COMBO's   Keep it entertaining for the auto attack melee and see them string some combo's together. Man give the monks Ken's helicopter kick, Dragon uppercut, Flash kick etc.<br />
<br />
2) Sound Effects  Fek I want to hear things like &quot; King Combo&quot;, &quot;Monster Combo&quot;, &quot; Combo Breaker&quot;, Ultimate Combo&quot; with the big booming ominous voice. Yea I was a little taken by the game Killer Instict ( Arcade Version ).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if you think the last two points are ludicrous and don't belong in what warriors are asking for, then your half way to understanding the value of the bone SoE is throwing us. <br />
<br />
Since they are going to throw us the bone and rip other companies off, then take it further ( ripping off a few more ) and at least make it entertaining.</div></div><hr />
