Are these the first 40 raids?<br />
Should any be moved up or down a level?<br />
Am I missing any?<br />
Should some not be on the list?<br />
Please let me know!<br />

This post is going to go on for about 1000000 years.<br />
<br />
A bunch need to be moved up and down. I would say just start trying them out and if you wipe on one, do the others some more :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Korocust should be higher on the list, his AEs make him pretty nasty unless you totally zerg him and kill fast<br />
<br />
rumblecrush is easy, fully slowable, should definately be behind vindi<br />
<br />
doomshade is also easy, hit for like 400 just really fast, easier than vindi<br />
<br />
arch lich is harder than XTC, arguably harder than cursed (but until you learn cursed he'll be much harder)<br />
<br />
Va'dyn should be very very low, fully slowable and doesn't hit too hard anyways<br />
<br />
not familiar with sleepers tomb so can't advise you on anything there, but other than the above points it looks fairly good.</div></div><hr />
