<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so we  went to SSRA after the pach the other day. We first went down to cursed to do him untill we had enough to do EMP. The raid is going great and as cursed spawns we have enough to do EMP now so after we drop cursed we going to doe mp.. I am tanking as normal. Cursed is at about less than 50% when we get a casting bug where nobody can cast any spells at all. Camp a cleric as the rest of us die or /camp So cursed is down but no loot for us. We all petition and they say <br />
&quot;send us a bug report and sorry you got screwed out of your mob becuase our game is full of bugs that hopefully will piss you off so you give us more $$ to play EQ2&quot;<br />
So we go and down EMP... flawless. Was a great night other than Cursed part and that was SOE not us...<br />
So lastnight I loged on to find cursed back up and EMP..... We have a guild thats going to be merging with us and they were keying when they must have mass evaked or something because the zone crashed spawning all mobs.......... This will be the 3rd time we have done back to back cursed/emp raids. So if anybody wants to do back to back   cursed/emp raids its rather simple. Take your guild and do XTC or HP. Then mass evak to entrance. Most of the time the zone crashes respawning emp and cursed. This is not 100% but so far we have had it happen to us 2. The other time we did them back to back was becuase of downing it then caching a pach.</div></div><hr />

In fact, the only times the zone has crashed is when I'm 3 boxing and am the only one in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a warning, Intentionally crashing zones to repop mobs is considered an exploit. Guild on my server used to do it in ssra to repop emp by all zoning in at the same time and causing a zone crash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we didnt do it on purpose.  We still dont do it. I was just stating that it has done it to us 2 and once to our allies. I think its from the major zoning that crashes it. There is also the casting bug where nobody can cast any spells. The entire zone lags out for a few seconds then you cant cast and have to log out... <br />
Payn I was talking about doing cursed then doing emp. Then the next day you kill them again with no pach to reset the server? Thats what I am talking about. If you did this then the zone was crashed if not by you then somebody els. Its a bug and from what I can see its been around for a while and they are not fixing it. I am not about to tell them about it with the way the GM's handle issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ssra has always been a buggy zone. Not much else to say but try and try again... sooner or later you'll get your kills done and be able to leave it behind (and be thankful that you did :p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lesiter</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has happened for years.  When more than 100 people are in the zone, there's a chance that all the named mobs stop meleeing and nobody can cast any spells.  When 120+ get in the zone, it's a good chance that it'll crash.  Ssra has always been terribly buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol we have never had more than 60 in the zone at once thank god. But ya I was wondering if this was a new thing or if its always been like this. I know now thanks guys. Tried our hand at some wingbosses in VT but got trained by the other guild thats in VT....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbahansen</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SSRA has crashed many times on us and this usually involes all the mobs despawning well we can still walk around.  When we finally get the boot from the zone and it comes back up we almost always lose 1/2 the raid  because all the mobs are back in place and about 1/2 are of us are at ZI and the other 1/2 are standing wherever we were when the zone started to crash, usually on a snake that repopped.</div></div><hr />
