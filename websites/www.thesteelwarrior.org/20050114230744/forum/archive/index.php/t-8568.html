<br />
I was wondering if i could get some assistance as what to use for the best aggro control at level 46.  My CHOS will not yet proc obviously, so I am mainhanding the sotB.  Now as for my offhand what would be advised for me to use?  I have a few things in mind for offhand, Barnacle covered axe (nice and cheap looks like crap tho), bloodguard wand of walking dead(equally shitty graphic I have not personally tested this one), reinforced sandstone sword(stun proc works at my current level).  Upon dinging 50 the CHoS will go MH ill assume over all of the above with the sotB in offhand.  But oh, what to use until then?  Am i missing other decent possibilities?  Thank you in advance, magelo below:  <br />

Upon dinging 50, CHoS primary would be the way to go. I had the BCA on a twink for a while and never really liked it much, your mileage may vary. Same deal with the wand.<br />
<br />
Pre 50: Sandstone pri, either droga offhand.<br />
50+: CHoS/SotBS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neksnappa's suggestion seems reasonable to me, but yeah you'll be in droga territory soon enough I'm not sure I'd worry about it, as your 46 weapons are pretty darn good.<br />
In fact, you'll get more milage now simply paying very close attention to when, how and to whom you lose aggro. In my 40s (and I didn't have nearly as good gear as you do) I used to track such things: by melee/caster, by which classes I lost aggro to, by what part of the fight (early? late?), by mob type, by what I'd done to increase my aggro up to that point, and what if anything I might be failing to do. I'd try to assess whether I was losing aggro to someone because he was not playing his class very well/intellegently, or whether the basic problem was that the class was having to take unusual steps to throttle back on dps/spells to let me keep aggro or whether I was failing to do everything I could to acquire and hold aggro.<br />
Also, ponder your Dex--it's reading something like 130 pre-lvl 50, right? With 130 dex you won't exactly proc like a .50 calibre machine gun. As you level, keep an eye out for dex improvements; they'll never be on the same level of importance as AC/hps, but after you crack 200 dex your procing weps will get better.<br />
(Now it occurs to me you know all this, but just in case...)</div></div><hr />

My dex also concerned me and I figure in time as my gear evolves, that will go up on its own.  Thank you both for the help!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atkins</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a specific reason why the reinforced sandstone should be in the primary over the SotB for  under level 50?  Or does it not really make a difference?  I am curious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the bloodsworn won't proc.<br />
<br />
In all fairness,  you don't really need an aggro proc under 50 to hold aggro.  Get a wurmslayer and you'll do fine.  In fact, you'll do fine with just about anything that's halfway decent in the damage department.<br />
<br />
It's over 50, and approaching 60 that you need to worry about.</div></div><hr />

I keep agro decently, in most situations, with sotb (20dd aug'd) and Lsoee and any of my other weapons for that matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it does. I can't be bothered to keep track of all these nerfages...all I know is that they don't work on my level 1's anymore :)</div></div><hr />
