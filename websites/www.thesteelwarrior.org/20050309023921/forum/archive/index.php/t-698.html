<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i just got my epic and have a small problem with it. It's an excellent weapon unlike many have said, and it's more then just a weapon to me...But, it sometimes appears on the screen and gets in the way, and causes minor lag while running. This doesn't happen very often, but when it does it's quite annoying. So, i was wondering. Is there a way to fix that or to prevent it from happening besides turning the particle effects off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I deal with it in two ways:<br />
<br />
1) De-equip and re-equip my bow really fast. Then I don't have the trouble.<br />
<br />
2) Turn particle effects either OFF or WAY down. When it's really annoying me, I just turn them off, and I get no lag whatsoever. When I'm feeling all uppity and still want my LIGHTSABERS to look like LIGHTSABERS, I just put on the lowest possible settings to still get them to glow. Then the lag is barely noticable and I can still function.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, then there's the third things I do: Summon my horse and ride away. No lag there. Heh.</div></div><hr />

It can be real annoying, especially when your pulling all the time.</div></div><hr />
