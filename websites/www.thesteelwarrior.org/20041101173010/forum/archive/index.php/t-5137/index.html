<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i recently got an earthshaker and ramp and was messing around with it. For the first try i went to KC. Brought alot of mobs to the zone, but probably not enough. Kinda hard to pull a really big train there. But i did kill a good number of them with rampage. Then went to kael...pulled pretty much everything from WL to EW, including bank and stuff, rounded them all up...didn't kill any. Bah! Tried PoD and HoH since there was not many people there to find my trains deadly. Anyway...pulled whole zone, we tried it 3 times. Basically i bring crapload of mobs, either go furious or cleric friend DAs me, can't really take a beating from that many planar mobs. And i had a lot...maybe still not enough for rampage. Anyway, i don't like PoD much so we headed over to HoH. All this time(except kael) i had my cleric friend and her shammy friend to slow me. Took all the haste items off of course. Only bad thing is that just happens to be my BP. Anyway...In HoH i ran invis to RD area, took invis off, trained through the whole place there, by HoHb zone, then to the section by zoneout and went around the whole thing to round them up. So i had a pretty big train...Once again, furious, when they all get here rampage. Not sure how far down i got em but cleric said she saw 11 mobs casting gate, at least. <br />
Anyway, gonna try some stuff again today, any suggestions? I'm thinking i'll get another warr in HoH and we'll both rampage. I mean...if i got 11 mobs down to low hp, perhaps 2 of us will kill em all? Looking for some advice on this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamiccolo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think being slowed alone would cancel the haste off your breastplate, so no need to take it off as far as I know.  As for the rampaging I haven't been able to kill many trains with it :/<br />
<br />
edit: There was a post about some warriors rampaging in fire, which does sound pretty interesting =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, i heard about warriors AEing fire...that's almost disturbing :P<br />
Gonna get some practice in HoH first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe you needed more mobs. I think the thing with the Earthshaker and Rampage is the more mobs the more distributed damage. <br />
<br />
It makes it more difficult because the more mobs you get the more likely you are to be killed before you can even hit Rampage.  If you can figure out the # of mobs to damage ratio you should be able to decifer a good benchmark how many total mobs you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can someone explain the purpose of slowing yourself? I have read several posts about wars doing this and each one mentions that they were slowed.<br />
<br />
If I understand correctly, proc rate is tied to some sort of timer, and not per swing. But, how does being slow make a difference? Repostes? Doesn't make sense to me.<br />
<br />
Anyone that can shed some light on this for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's been noted that when slowed your weapon has a higher chance to proc ( something to do with swings per / &lt;interval&gt; ).<br />
<br />
So by slowing yourself you limit yourself to less swings / &lt;interval&gt; which theoretically should make you have a higher chance of procing on the first swing. <br />
<br />
I think  that's the reason at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, basically, but with rampage of course it's not only on the first swing but on every swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rampage only goes on one swing right? Just that one swing hits all the mobs in the area around the person. <br />
<br />
Do I have this wrong? Does rampage go off on more than one swing? For like 5 seconds or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rampage is one swing per mob so 50 mobs=50 swings=50 chances to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">each hit to a mob counts as a swing. so 100 mobs would be 100swings + any dubble tripple flurrys<br />
<br />
it's been worked out to about 9k max per mob in most places per warrior average.<br />
<br />
the slow just seams to work increasing the chance to proc on the first swing.<br />
<br />
alot of time i run into the mob being out of range of the aoe/ramp you basicly have to wade into the midle of the pull to get all of them and since their solid it can be hard.<br />
<br />
the kael problem is the pbaoe proc will not fire if the mob you hit is out of pbaoe range. they also dont stack well and will stop running to you soon as they can hit you. only a problem on big stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I do belive the code in HoH is that you can only have agro on about 10 mobs. After that many they gate back to spawn. That may be your issue there. (aka the bard nerf)</div></div><hr />
