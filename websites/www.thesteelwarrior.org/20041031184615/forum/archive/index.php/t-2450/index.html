<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im currently wearing an Earing of Endless Speed and am having a dilemma.  Im normally my guild's MA when Im on and Im trying to beef up my HPs for Emp and Lord Ssru, both of which we'll be doing relatively soon.<br />
Im thinking about switching out my EoES for a tear of the rainmaker I won in BoT a week or so ago, to go along with my Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement.<br />
In your opinions, would it really make that much sense to lose the 41% earing and buy a CoF or similar highish-end haste item?<br />
I know I'll eventually get a better haste item, but the low stats on the EoES is driving me nuts atm.<br />
Thanks in advance for any suggestions...my profile is linked below if you care to take a peek.<br />
<br />
btw, i have about 80k tops i can spend right now, so i guess if i bought something, i'd be looking in a CoF range or below unless there are new items in a similar price range Im not aware of.  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speed of Vallon = 68% haste<br />
CoF = 36% haste<br />
<br />
That combo puts you at 104% haste ( although I believe max haste for a warrior is 100% without bard stacking ).<br />
<br />
Basically you could wear an RBB (32%) and still be at haste cap if you are buffed with SoV or Anya's Quickening ( isn't that the short duration 70%? ) . Since you are doing this specifically for raid targets you should always have atleast one chanter who can get you to max haste.<br />
<br />
Amazing that CoF has lasted this long as a solid haste item, but gotta give Verant credit on making an old-world drop so good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You also have to give them credit on the last few expansions spreading the haste around. Now you don't have to choose whether to use belt or back haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, had the same dilemma for a long time, I had a good belt and a good cloak but had to sacrifice one of them to get rid of that low hp earring. Ended up replacing my Wormhusk Harness with a Cord of Midnight, lost 15hps but easily made that up with a Tear of the Rainmaker that had been sitting in my bank for weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I agree with you two.  Suppose I'm just thinking out loud as to whether I want to drop 50k for a few more HPs and some better saves (granted I'll get it back since CoF has held value well) or whether I should invest that cash in upgrading another slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kill Yeli anymore? Get GoDS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From looking at your magelo, I would suggest getting the haste neck from the PoI dragon. Easy and fast kill :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From looking at your magelo, I would suggest getting the haste neck from the PoI dragon. Easy and fast kill.  <br />
<br />
If you can do NToV, you can surely do the PoI dragon.  However, I believe it's a more rarish drop.  Like Dain, Yeli always drops his head (Heh, why wouldn't they? :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I understand your pain, and unfortunately feel your pain at this time. Ideally, I'd like to upgrade with a breastplate of speed; however, the rareness of the breastplate is handicapping my wishes. If you have access to Sleeper's Tomb, there is a breastplate that drops off of the ancients called &quot;Clawed Coat of Tyro&quot;; it is similar to a vindi breastplate, but has 39% haste instead of Aura of Battle.<br />
<br />
Another thing - if you can, you may want to aim for belt of the destroyer from Dagarn, and quest the Loyalist Shield of Honor in luclin (50 AC, 75 hp; back slot).<br />
<br />
Good luck in your - and my own - prediciment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aramelus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well if the 25hp on the Doomshade earring vs. the 70(?) hp on the rainmaker earring is going to make or break your emp/seru fight, you've got bigger issues at hand to worry about.  ;)<br />
<br />
I kept my earring of endless speed into Vex Thal.  Once you're in VT, there's quite a variety of haste items easily available.  Now I've got the Gorget of Superiority, which is decent.<br />
<br />
My guild is now in elementals, so I'm hoping to pick up a haste bracer from earth, or a band of swirling air, or a moss mantle, but the gorget is still quite viable for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bear with me a little bit, gonna do some math.<br />
<br />
You have:<br />
EoES - 3ac 3sta 25hp<br />
Hiero - 10ac 4sta 75hp<br />
Total - 13ac 7sta 100hp<br />
<br />
You are considering switching to:<br />
TotR - 7ac 80hp<br />
CoF - 10ac 50hp<br />
Total - 17ac 130hp<br />
<br />
So in essense, you are going to spend 50k to get 4ac -7sta 30hp.<br />
<br />
In your position, I would upgrade something else that will give you more bang for your buck. It looks like to me that your weakest slots are your bracers. If you have 80k to spend, you could do this instead:<br />
You have:<br />
BoB - 17ac 8sta 30hp<br />
BotM - 22ac 5sta 15hp<br />
Total - 39ac 13sta 45hp<br />
<br />
You could get:<br />
Kizrak's - 28ac 6sta 45hp<br />
Kizrak's - 28ac 6sta 45hp<br />
Total - 56ac 12sta 90hp<br />
<br />
This upgrade would net you 17ac -1sta 45hp nad would give you the bonus of Vengence II on both bracers. Another option would be to try and pick up a Crystallized acid bracer. The last one I got went for 100k, so it's a little more than you have to spend right now, but look at the difference it would make:<br />
You would get:<br />
BoB - 17ac 8sta 30hp<br />
CAB - 25ac 8sta 100hp<br />
Total - 42ac 16sta 130hp<br />
<br />
So saving your plats a little longer would net you 3ac 3sta 85hp and the upgrade would last you until you get Raex's.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there is one other consideration to make because of the recently falling prices of elem bows. Right now on our server you can get anything but a stonewood for 80k, maybe a little less if you catch the people online. This would be a huge upgrade that again would be very long term.<br />
<br />
You have:<br />
Bow of Doom - 10sta 50hp<br />
<br />
You would get:<br />
Featherwood compound bow - 10ac 10sta 100hp<br />
<br />
You would net 10ac 0sta 50hp and you would have a bow that would last you until you get into the elems.<br />
<br />
The choice is yours to make, it just depends on what you think will be the best long term upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/cheer Wandor<br />
<br />
I wish I did these kinf of sums at dkp bids - instead of plucking a figure out of my @rse like I normally do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I totally agree with you Wandor.  I was really just bouncing the idea around to see if maybe a solution I hadnt thought of presented itself.  I've decided to do nothing since we'll be doing Emporer (and thus VT) very soon.  Also, I refuse to spend 50k on the ornate bracer since i group in BoT so much anyways.  My dice will get hot at some point Im sure.<br />
Upgrading to an elemental bow is a temptation but my fiance is a Ranger and she'd kill me if I got one first /laff :)<br />
<br />
/wave@Truelove -- pulling dkp bids out of your @rse?  A troll after my own heart i tell ya =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Drop the Myrm guants, get Yelinak Guants.<br />
(since your stats are not maxed im gunna list agil/dex/str/sta)<br />
<br />
Myrm guants- 27ac 90hp 8 dex<br />
EOES-  3ac 3agil 3dex 3sta 3str 25hp Effect: haste<br />
Total: 30ac raw, 3agil 11dex 3stam 3str 115hp effect:haste<br />
<br />
GODS- 30ac 9str 75hp Effect:haste<br />
Tear- 7ac 5str 5dex 5agil 80hp <br />
Total: 37ac raw, 5dex, 14str, 5agil 155hp effect:haste <br />
<br />
You would gain, 7ac, 11str, 2agil, 40more raw hp, and you would lose 6dex and 3stam. You would also gain some resist, you can afford to drop the stam as well, 3 stam would run about 12 or so hp since your already over 255stam unbuffed.<br />
<br />
You Prolly should try to score some Boots of the storm off King Tormax, get 100hp neck off CT, 100hp cloak off CT(15stam on this as well). Two Kizrak bracers would help a lot too, but the Blood of Ssra(the mob right before Emp) also drops a 75hp bracer? Anyways Goodluck on the emp :) I hope some of this info has helped you.<br />
<br />
Oh ya Um you could  also try to get a Silver Braclet of Speed but its a pretty annoying quest, esp if there are lower guilds on your server that camp dozekar and the named drakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Upgrading to an elemental bow is a temptation but my fiance is a Ranger and she'd kill me if I got one first  FYI - prices are dropping fast, picked up a Featherwood for a friend for 80k. There is at least 1 other bow in the baz right now for 80k or less and a couple of Obsidianwood bows that should come down in price as soon as the retards selling them figure out that 100k is too much for the worst bow in the bunch.</div></div><hr />
