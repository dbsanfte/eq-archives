Does the effect of the &quot;curse&quot; line of spells reduce END regeneration?  Last night tanked AL, incite 2x on perma root, hit evasive, 10 min later after hoarding my END (very few incites) I still had very little available when evasive came ready again.  I got spam cure of the curse but still little END regen it seemed.  Curious if this is working as intended....tanked HP Sun night and had no such issues.  Anyway any insights would be appreciated...if this is the way it supposed to work its a pretty nasty nerf.</div></div><hr />

On AL I tend to bio orb his constantly till I have enough agro that a wiz could stand next to him chaining highest dmg nukes crit and not move him, hit evasive then whack away till either he is to low to wait on evas repop and fellstrike him or evasive again if low on healers.</div></div><hr />

Also, If your attacking your endurance wont regen as fast so have to be very careful going disc wild.<br />
Remember incite does suck a lot of endurance</div></div><hr />

Thankfully there are relatively few endurance draining effects in this game, but they do seem to be abound in Gates.  Hopefully we'll hvae a bigger enduranec pool to compensate because not being able to disc sucks.  I heard you can use defensive without having endurance but I sure wasn't able to get a second evasive off with no endurance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope you can't.  I tried that night.<br />

<br />
No, not if you do it with 20 non uber people.  Whats your point?<br />

<br />
Sigh, as stated above in my original post; very few incite and no other end skills used during the period.<br />

The stun/tossback on AL drains endurance and since it's unresistable there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. <br />

Bingo...thank you Phant :D   so it is the damn KB and not the curse.</div></div><hr />
