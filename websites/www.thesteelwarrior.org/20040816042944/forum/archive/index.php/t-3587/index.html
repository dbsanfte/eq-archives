<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was bitching on my guild's board (about a 60th paladin who maintains that AA &gt; level) and the fact that getting 34 AP for an adventure really hurt when the groups average level dropped below 63. (Which is too easy to do with a 60 or 2 in the group.)<br />
<br />
A bard friend commented that having to do 6-7 missions (mathmatically it's 8) to get Melavolent armor as an upgrade to Ornate really sucked. Where as it seems all other plate wearers have 2 levels of upgrades over their Ornate armor, we warriors, becuase they actaully itemized Ornate armors correctly, only have one, as all the 760 plate has less AC than Kizrak's.<br />
<br />
You want to get armor with a type 3 slot and have better AC than Ornate...you have to go 1492. And I think any 65 warrior could camp a set of Kizrak's with equal or less effort than a set of Royal Attendant.<br />
<br />
Please, SOE, do the armor's right, and make them class specific. Not like you don't have the templates for them around already...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It could be worse. You could be a leather class.<br />
<br />
Where the 1492 point armor isn't worth the added cost (bracers for instance ... 15 AC versus 13 AC, minimal HP difference, and the real cost sink is which type 3 aug you put on the item).<br />
<br />
I'm actually considering Mistmoore 760 point armor for my gear upgrade needs on all the items except the tunic.</div></div><hr />
