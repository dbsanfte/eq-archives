I have run out of pp to twink my warrior and I'm looking to farm items and PL the war. Droga is on my list to get the 2x 1handed weaps, is there anywhere else I can go to find upgrades?<br />
<br />
I have a 56 war + 65 (200aa) shaman dual box accounts<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mask: There is an easy LDoN drop in Everfrost that has 15ac 45hp and some other stats.<br />
Ear: You could go for another Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement for a few more hp/ac.<br />
Feet: Kingly Boots of Splendor.  I'm not sure where they drop, exactly, but that *should* be a single group or less to camp (I'm thinking Droga as well?  They came out about the same time)<br />
<br />
I know a lot of that isnt possible to duo with just your shammy and warrior right now, other than Droga (like you already mentioned) -- most of the gear that are upgrades for your warrior now are either bazaar-bought or one-grouped, like LDoN farmed (Hard LDoN will open up a multitude of gear upgrades for your warrior, including a few droppable slots)<br />
<br />
Maybe some others know of some easily attained upgrades, I admit I don't know many duo encounters</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making the switch to Kingly boots of splendor with a shaman healing you is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
You'd lose 13 raw AC, and your max HP doesn't matter when you're getting healed by Quiescence.<br />
<br />
You're pretty much at the top for what you can do with an Agnostic duo.  Anything else you could do yourself would be minor at best.  Best to find something expensive you can farm (IE : droga stuff that sells for good cash), and start buying bigger stuff...ornate, boots of the storm, etc.</div></div><hr />
