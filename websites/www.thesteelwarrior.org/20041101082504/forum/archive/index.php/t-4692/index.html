<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi every one, I am a 39th season warrior on FV, I worship tribunal.  From reading the previous posts, I think I should wear the whole Helanic set except for the cloak and another piece(can not remember).  I was wondering if anyone on the website who is actually a GM smith who also happen to be a barb and be able to make Helanic for me.  I have played EQ for 2 month now and I have save about 2.5 k, and if anyone can help me on that server, I would appreciate it.<br />
<br />
As far as magelo goes, I do not have anything that is good one me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really sure why the cloak would not be good unless you had a haste cloak instead. If I remember right it's 16AC 5 sta and 80 HP. I wear the cloak because I have belt haste myself, but if I had a cloak of flames, then I would wear that and HT girdle/belt whichever it's called.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I saw the boot for 1800 PP and vambrace for 3300 PP the other day in Bazaar,  I should have bought the boot then since I had 1860PP.  Now I feel like I lost my chance, I will not have a chance of owning a piece of the helanic for a while.  The brestplace was selling for like 50k PP yesterday in Bazaar.  No many people seem to be selling those in Bazaar, and I am so itchy for it.  My guild &quot;Hierchy of Equality&quot; does not have too many High Level guys in there, and no one seem to even know about cultural armor.  errrrr, i have 2.5 k right now, is it enough for even one piece????  Personallu I would like to start from the greaves first, since it has high ac and life and there are not that many good greaves out there, from what I read.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Something you might wish to try, is to go to Eqtraders.com, and visit their message boards.  There is a specific forum for each server's tradeskills, and you might have good luck posting for a barb smith on the FV board there.  <br />
<br />
In any case, check out the bazaar now already, collect whatever you can of the materials used to smith that armour.  There is a lot that you can farm yourself, such as velium *large bricks or blocks*, leather padding or the materials used to make padding, ice goblin blood from Permafrost, etc.  Check out the same site, eqtraders.com, under the &quot;recipes&quot; section, then &quot;cultural armours&quot;, and so on, to see exactly what is needed.  Keep an eye on the bazaar for cheap essences of winter, blue diamonds, etc.  I know when someone asked me to smith some gear for them, if they were a person who had already done some research and collected materials ahead of time, I was a LOT more likely to be favourable towards them.  *Note- getting /tells such as &quot;Yo, bish/d00d/man, come smith me some of that 000ber ph4t l3wtz gear you can make kkthx~&quot; does NOT work very well at all*<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

Im Still wearing my Helanic armor, and your gonna need a lot more than 2K to buy a set, cost me almost 40k..thats for all cept for visor &amp; cloak..(Prexus)<br />
<br />
Ive applied to a Flagging guild so hopefully I will start the slow process of upgrades, But is damn good armor to have, had it since mid 50's and still using it in the 65's<br />
<br />
I have Keal (COV) faction plate peices, but they IMHO suck against helanic peices, yeah you get resist but casters/bard usually take care of that in raids &amp; groups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi all , I am so lucky.  A stranger at bazaar gave me a Helanic BP for my large acrylia BP, he was just being very nice to me.  I have have 3k left to play with, figure to buy a boot as soon as i can :)\<br />
