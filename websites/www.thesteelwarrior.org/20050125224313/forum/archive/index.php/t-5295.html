<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenixone</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here is yet another thread about equipment. I never get tired of them because I love looking at loots and want to hear some better things to get.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=678889<br />
<br />
That’s my magelo profile. I know he is only 47 but that will be fixed soon as I am back to playing him fulltime and he will be in BoT soon enough.<br />
<br />
Basically I’m looking for what I can possibly buy to give this guy a little of a boost in the right direction. I want to be tanking a PoN/PoD right now for the best exp to boost me through tier 1 and then into PoV to get through tier 2.<br />
<br />
Now, funds are limited, I’ve blown my wad on the equipment he wears now. Is there anything that can be seen that needs to be upgraded and can be done so for 10-15k each piece? What is it and where can I camp it maybe? I’ve got a 65 Shaman and a slew of friends who will help me camp anything I need basically.<br />
<br />
I know LDON has some nice upgrades but I think the stuff I can get on normal will not be as good as what I’m wearing and it will waste a lot of time and exp to build points to get the good stuffs.<br />
<br />
So where to go, what to get? I will probably camp LDON mistmore for 500 some points each for 2 anger 2 augs to make me an agro ballah.</div></div><hr />

They're lore so you might want to save the 125 Ykesha for a nice 2 hander like the GSoT when you get higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenixone</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where can I get the Yak aug? I've got the GSoT already, got in from MS and noone else wanted to go near it, heh. A nice weapon but way to easy to get it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until you get to BoT, FH armor is going to probably be about as good as you can get for most visible slots.  Save for that, and get a grimling contraption or something similar for your face.  Also, a cloak of the maelstrom would probably be better for your back, a cloak of greater pernicity definitely would.  As far as I know, the only place to get ykesha augs is deepest guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure you hit EF for those anger augs and not Mistmoore else you might be a little disappointed.<br />
<br />
You're gear is looking pretty good.  Since you're a RZ worshiper I'd look at getting FH for the rest of your slots first, particularly legs, back and BP.<br />
<br />
Get a range item with stats - bone carved shortbow is nice if you want a bow and cant afford an elemental one, otherwise just pick up a goranga idol cheap until you can.<br />
<br />
Finish off with a couple of mossie earrings or bloodmetal earrings and you'll be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenixone</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have updated my mask with a Kylong Darkmail Visor as the overall stats are better I think and the visor goes for 10k, whereas the contraption goes for 20k. Not worth that much if you ask me, even with a 1hp per tick regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the equipments I'm wearing fit into what your asking (10-20k a piece).<br />
<br />
I'm agnostic, so no fierce heraldic. I'm sure a few slots would be better off using cultural if available, but I do just fine without it.<br />
<br />
Magelo links to the left, under the username (since so many people seem to miss it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're already looking good. Replace the BP IMO. I wore that same one for way too long myself, and wouldn't wish it upon anyone. Fierce heraldic would be a good bet.<br />
<br />
If you have ~10k to throw at a back slot, the Cloak of Greater Pernicity is a good one. Or if you can get the NODROP piece from PoI, a bundle of superconductive wires IIRC, you can buy the rest of the quest components for much cheaper usually.<br />
<br />
Amulet of Mummy Wrappings is an OK neck slot for pretty cheap. Also, see if you can find the MQ for the Gauntlets of the Myrmidon from skyshrine - you'll need ally faction with Claws of Veeshan for it, but it's a nice pair of gloves.<br />
<br />
Gain a few levels and you should be ready for primetime in PoN with little trouble.</div></div><hr />

I did get the FH BP and FH cloak. I'll look into theother parts, thank you for the updates and I'll see what I can do to get them going.</div></div><hr />
