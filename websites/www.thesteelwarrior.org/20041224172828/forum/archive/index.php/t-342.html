<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lhostee Chulain</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey. I did this a few nights ago, and thought that I would post the strat. I found for all you here to see, and maybe some didn't know about it before.<br />
<br />
First, you go check if Gloradin Coldheart is up. She is in the hut next to Garadain, who you got the rest of the ring quests from, at loc about n2430 n430. She is on a 24hr spawn, so if shes not up, she will most likely be up the next day.<br />
<br />
Now, once you know Gloradin is up, gather some forces. I did it with me (53 war), 53 dru, 59 sham, and it was a bit overkill. I suggest you have some kind of slower, will make it go abit easier.<br />
<br />
When you have all the forces, go into the Ry`Gorr Fort, and clear the inside, in the building with the fire. When the inside is clear, have the rest of your forces wait there, while you go back out to Garadain / Gloradin.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the huts, go to Garadain. You hand him your 7th ring, Adamantium Coldain Insignia Ring, and he will give you a note for Gloradin. Go into her hut, give her the note, then run back to the orc fort quickly. The mobs should pop in a min or so inside the fort, but none will pop in the building with the fire. If you don't think you will get there fast enough, you can bring along an invis potion, or you can bring along someone you brought, and have them come along and invis you to get back into the fort.<br />
<br />
Once all the mobs are popped, you should see Chief Ry`Gorr standing with another orc and 2 giants outside the door to the room you are in. Have the highest level pull the Chief. I had a 59 pull him, and we got him solo. Kill the Chief, and then invis and run out of the fort, past the mobs.<br />
<br />
You should see some dwarfs and Garadain on the hill outside. You can either give the head to Garadain now, or you can wait until later, so the dwarves will charge the fort and kill all the orcs and giants. <br />
<br />
Garadain will call for all of the dwarves to fall in, and they will all come running to him. He will give them a little pep talk, and will tell them to fall out. This will send them running to the fort. This is where I gave him the head.<br />
<br />
I recieved the 8th ring, and I was a little surprised when the dwarves didn't full out charge the fort. You see, I had misunderstood &quot;Fall out men!&quot; for &quot;Charge!&quot;. But, believe it or not, this way is even more fun.<br />
<br />
You get to ... charge trains of mobs to a horde of dwarves! woo!!! I think this was the most fun I had had all week, and it was a good reprieve from the raid we did for this shaman earlier, which took about 3 hours to get started.<br />
<br />
Have fun, and happy hunting!</div></div><hr />

If you plan on doing this (which is exactly how I did mine) and your puller is lvl60 or under on the Chief pull, be sure you are pulling from behind the mob or you will get giant adds. Its really quite simple, and I am suprised they never nerfed this, as I am sure it wasnt the intentional way of doing it..lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another tactic I have seen used is to have a caster (easier) with levitation run up hill on left side of fort (facing entrance).  You can go high enough up hill to levi over the wall and on top of the building on the side of the fort.  Have another person do turn in.  Have caster tag Chief and run back over wall levi'd.  Chief follows through wall out side of the fort.  Kill Chief, and loot head.<br />
<br />
Then wait for the charge order and turn in the head.  Dwarf wouldn't take it for me before the charge order.</div></div><hr />
