<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to find a good place for my 30 Warrior who just happens to be a barbarian.  Anyone got any good ideas?.  I would go to the overthere but  I am afraid it may be difficult for a barbarian to venture to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to level well in LDoN missions. Its still quite possible to clear the whole mission during those levels before time is up and getting drops and pp too.<br />
<br />
I think HHK is still good down stairs, maybe thats the high 20s...<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud should be moving into your radar soon, it should take you to 35 or so if you want.<br />
<br />
Then head to Overthere SF ramp or even pulling anywhere from the northwest side of the zone. Should take you to 40 or so...<br />
<br />
Then move to DL, any of the camps are fine really, just chain pull like in OT, you should be able to go to 50, but i usually try to move into KC as soon as possible...<br />
<br />
When you ding 46 and skidaddle to PoJ for an exit group, that'll take you to 50 for sure...<br />
<br />
Main thing to remember with these levels is very fast chain pulls non-stop db to your tank, higher if you have twink buffs like temp of virtue. clerics get cheal at 39, so mana shouldn't be an issue at those levels, just keep them pulling. if your healing is runnig out of mana, even a druid or shaman( they should need to slow things should be dying to quick to be worth it), they are doing something wrong, tell them to stop :P<br />
<br />
Just keep pulling, you'll see the levels fly to 55 or so.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fastest xp at lv 30 would probably be found in HHK on guards or the lower goblin areas.  HHK has a nice ZEM (zone experience modifier).  There are lots of nice places to xp, though such as solA, DSP, and especially LDoN if you can find a group.</div></div><hr />
