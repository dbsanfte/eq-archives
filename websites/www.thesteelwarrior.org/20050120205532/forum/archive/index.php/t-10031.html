<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrinx</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed. I do read this board, as well as other boards and saw your post directed towards me here:<br />
<br />
http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showMessage?topicID=4672.topic. Now, the tone and attitude in your posts is the reason why I haven't responded at all since I read this, the day you posted it. Communication on this forum and others from players and developers is a two way street: so please be concise, clear, and exact in what it is that's wrong and what it is that needs to be looked at. Whenever I see a flame in a post, I stop reading it. I imagine my colleagues do the same. So from now on, I'd suggest less inflammatory remarks if you want us to read what you're writing.<br />
<br />
To the topic at hand, I've had QA try and verify some of the issues with the Valdoon script that I've read over the last week and a half. Ones I couldn't replicate, nor could QA replicate were the &quot;only one Valdoon&quot; bug and the &quot;Instance crashes randomly&quot; bug. I think I may have found a logic error in the regeneration/lifetap script that Valdoon has, which should fix that issue. However, I, nor has QA been able to replicate those other issues with the script. If you could PM me with the exact details of what you did in the instance, so that I can try and replicate the bug and find it, that would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Thanks.<br />
 <br />
Edit: The supposed bug that Valdoon wasn't dropping a heart couldn't be verified either. The data for his drop rate shows that he drops it 100% of the time. Valdoon was also spawned 100 times and dropped his heart 100 times on Test. I couldn't find any other indication that the real Valdoon wasn't dropping his heart, other than the fact that you didn't engage the real Valdoon, but that you engaged the fake one the times you did it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So in case you didnt know it the developers read the class boards and if they see flaming on the questions directed towards them, they do not post about it.  So to keep them posting here for our questions/comments keep that thread clean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that's the story, but since they're also silent in many cases where we had HUGE, massive fucking issues, it's definitely not always the facts.<br />
<br />
Truth is, I bet they read far less than they think they do, and care about even less.  We've called them on many issues that they have no idea how to fix, and they just ignore the problems, the threads, the e-mails, everything, until they're ready to look at it.<br />
<br />
So I wouldn't be too concerned about keeping anything clean, since there's a relatively slim chance they're gonna respond to an actual issue on a class board anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno.  I've had a few conversations with Devs where I mentioned a thread on the Steel Warrior and in multiple cases they had already read the thread I was talking about.  Of course they don't read every thread on every board, if they did that's all they would get done, but I think they keep up with the boards pretty well.  That's not to say that they can immediately get to work on whatever problem comes up on the boards.  Of course they don't respond well to being flamed.  I don't think anybody does hehe :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've all heard it before, and its bullshit. You have a product, people will have problems with it. SoE needs to suck it up and wade through the bad stuff that will always exist because there are a lot of faults in their product. Them saying they are offended or unwilling to deal with threads that contain even a single flame is just another excuse for them not to have to face their problems.<br />
<br />
It's the same excuse they gave Necros for ignoring their community. We heard this and started modding and censoring posts and nothing happened. We decided to go even further and we (I am a mod at eqclasses, although I don't visit often anymore) set up a very heavily moderated Dev Forum and even gave the Devs mod rights, and they still didn't post.<br />
<br />
Hell, even now we have these class reps that SoE supposedly listens to and still very little is being changed. Sure some class balance has happened and thats nice but the true, fundamental changes that are needed to really make EQ worth playing in today's finally competitive MMOG market aren't happening, and they're taking steps away by killing great zones like MistMoore and Splitpaw when they should be adding expansions to them, not killing what is part of EQ history.<br />
<br />
edit: Brutul, it'd be nice if they dropped a simple line that said nothing more than &quot;I read this post, thanks for the information.&quot; or even &lt;gasp&gt; joined the discussion or asked a question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please, no more expansions.<br />
<br />
More pocket zones like we saw with SolC and ChardokB. Make use out of content that already exists. As far as I'm concerned, the greatest story lore was from the original EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFLMAO...too true.  Though Im getting paid, it isn't for that.  I can't even imagine, that reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be cheap to read class boards, it terms of finding out about issues and, to a smaller degree, find out the exact nature of those issues. It would be less good as a place to get workable solutions, but there'd be ideas and those ideas would cost you nothing.<br />
But I wouldn't post here if, for some reason (such as, you know, I were representing a corporation and talking to my customers), I couldn't tell some ass who flamed me to fuck off. <br />
Check the forums on EQ traders. You're not allowed to tell people to fuck off over there, and the Devs post. I think over time they've paid more and more attention to that site.<br />
I think they're reading this site, I just don't think things get fixed very fast sometimes, and actually posting here might will get ya more grief than info. I think that's why they've got class reps like Frod and why they'll like do more summits with players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felnar</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have to add my $0.02 here, as I work as a customer service rep for a CC company.<br />
<br />
When people call up and ask nicely for something...if I can do it-it's done-I'll even sometimes do things that aren't &quot;by the book&quot; if I'm able.  If you call me and make it personal(i.e. you f*ing aholes need to credit this, lower my apr, etc) and/or tell me I &quot;AM&quot; going to do something...you're getting exactly jack and s**t from me, whether I can or not.<br />
<br />
So basically my thoughts on this are...be as nice and non-inflamatory as possible.  After all...you don't really know what these people can or can't do...you're just supposing what can be done.  Ya get more flies with honey than vinegar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I highly doubt that any of you who think that SOE has to listen to your incessant bitching (whether it's justified or not) have ever been in a developer/implementor position for an on-line game.<br />
<br />
I owned a MUD (small potatoes, I know) for about a year, and ended up SHUTTING DOWN THE GAME because I didn't care to deal with the attitude of my players (i.e. this sucks, this is bullshit, fix it and FIX IT NOW when I knew stuff was not working properly and/or content was incomplete and was being worked on).<br />
<br />
Yes there's bugs and broken content in EQ, but like the original poster said, you're far more likely to see results by being polite and civilized towards those that are responsible for making the changes.<br />
<br />
If you're still not happy, cancel your account.  Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

LOL that's so good.<br />
<br />

BTW, if a Dev read this post I have to notice you that this post is intended to flame you and all what you like and what you does. So now that I saved you from reading all the posts under that follow mine to no end, you can actually go back to your fixing duty.<br />
Thanks for your comprehension and have a nice day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im all for being polite to the devs on their own boards. but where do they get off coming to an independent forum and telling us how to behave?<br />
<br />
i used to have a more cooperative attitude toward the devs. i used to submit bug reports in the game. i had the &quot;sysinfo send&quot; option turned on. i would write a well thought out email once in a while to help them with problems in game.<br />
<br />
but not anymore. my impression of the old verant was that their management was heavily influenced by gamers who wanted to take pride in their product. my impression now is of poorly trained businessmen who want to maximize this year's revenues totally blind to the long term future of the game.<br />
<br />
so when a dev comes to this board to try to shame me into sucking up to him and to threaten to spite me by putting me on /ignore if i dont flatter his ego a little more then i say i dont really care. i warned for years at first politely that the dev team was taking a seriously wrong turn. in the last year they've lost half their playerbase. so who was right and who was wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, the dev did not tell anyone how to behave, he simply stated that once he got to a flame in a thread, he stopped reading it.

<br />
Secondly, your comments about the greedy money whoring dev's who care nothing about the game does not ring true.  OoW is generally considered one of the better expansions in awhile, and is so in part because they listened to the players to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, could you please document this immagined loss of 1/2 the player base.  It certainly does not match up my what I have seen, expecially considering that this is the holidays, and the recent release of 2 big time competitors.  Even with all that, there has been no 50 % loss in players, and numbers online will rebound after the holidays are over.<br />

Lastly, please do us all a favor, go play WoW.  If EQ sucks so much, stop playing, stop caring, and go away.</div></div><hr />

It's what happens when 80% of your talent follows someone with compassion for games and not just one with compassion for a fat wallet.<br />
<br />
At any rate, when a populace is ignored for a long time they will turn hostile to a dev source no matter the approach. Plugging your ears and going la la la la, i'm not going to listen if you argue is a perfect description of what is wrong with the state of the live team. Perhalps if time was taken before hand there wouldn't be an issue list longer then santa's naughty or nice list.<br />
<br />
And as much as the witty 'go away if you dont play eq' remarks are, perhalps one day you will realize that golly gee, some people just want to see the game return to what made it great instead of it's continued running into the ground to fund eq2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can never get back to where you where.  Part of what made early EQ great was the exploration of new things.  Well, we have been there, seen it, done it now, and that old feeling is never coming back.  Currently EQ has a better look, better encounters, more content, and if you go looking for fun, by god it is there in shitloads still.  You cannot un-evolve a game like EQ.  You can either look forward and enjoy what is there, or look back, piss and moan becuase the inevitable happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Returning to what made it great doesn't involve de-evolution. Perhalps if you hadn't jumped to the conclusion that I was fixated on the fun of &quot;exploring a brand new norrath&quot; like it was 5 years ago you'd understand what many people are saying. <br />
<br />
However you are right in one thing, I guess those of us whom are vocal should just stop. It's beyond evident that they'll never go about with a serious conviction to change things for the better. Those resources are all focused in one direction, and it doesn't involve a game that's 6 years old.</div></div><hr />

i am not answerable to you henna. so this is the last of your personal attacks i will ever respond to. it really gets old you know? but you did tell me to &quot;please document this loss&quot; so...<br />
<br />
do a /who trader in the bazaar. half the people have left the game this year. if you are not satisfied with that for evidence even after all the talk on tsw about people disappearing then there is no way ill convince you. as for them coming back after the holidays, ive heard it time and again. they dont come back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the market is sh*t. like the &quot;Real World&quot;; when items are past vogue no one really cares and it's not a &quot;Bear Market&quot; liek it was when OoW or GoD was released.<br />
<br />
IT just shows current market trends. People are still playing; but just not taking/keeping/hoarding/profiting off mass bazaar sales. <br />
<br />
Want to try for a real statistic? See how many tradeskill items are sold versus 'new and shiny' items sold in the bazaar. There's always new silk &amp; pelt traders up. There's always new velium and acrylia traders up. Check those numbers<br />
<br />
I dunno; but this is Marketing101 here fella. Like a former Terris inhabitant on this board (Grumbam) wrote in another thread<br />
<br />
&quot;..and every day you see the same 6 Edges of Envelopments for sale&quot;<br />
<br />
Market is sh*t man. No one is playing it. Mudflation is the factor; not loss of playerbase ( in that respect ) which is drying up the /bazaar. Even in a very small enviroment ( Test Server where I reside ); I have been playing the market to try to gain some $$$'s and my only profitable items are Tradeskill items which I farm semi-actively. Not the &quot;buy low-sell high&quot; items. Test though isn't a real gauge to this; maybe some of the other big bazaar hounds on the boards on the more productive servers can attest to this; or even I can try to log onto Terris and Sell off high end to tradeskill items and see what kinda numbers I can produce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corpsed</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the market isnt good so people are not buying stuff so I dont leave my trader logged in at night like I used to.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">point well taken. ive found the buy low sell high technique is getting progressively less profitable over the years. the first couple months that the bazaar trading existed were unreal in their opportunities for profit and now its like pulling teeth.<br />
<br />
even so im not convinced. bazaar population has dropped in spurts corresponding to times that people have posted &quot;where is everybody&quot; threads. the most recent being in the last month where the population abruptly fell by about a quarter or more. i noticed it one day when i was looking for items to buy and was perplexed that people werent selling the items i was looking for. so i did a /who trader and discovered why.<br />
<br />
so maybe im right in my interpretation and maybe im wrong. but my claim is certainly not baseless.<br />
<br />
man im not even supposed to be logged on. my account was supposed to expire. i actually checked my credit card statements to see if sony sneaked in a charge for an extension but saw nothing. they wouldnt really sneak in a FREE extension by mistake would they? now THAT would be a bug i could live with :) ... or then again maybe im just remembering wrong when i last renewed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a massive problem now, and a showstopper for the future.  <br />
<br />
Unless a new player starts playing eq with the specific intent on only playing the low level game, they face a *massive* hurtle just to start out.  Have to grind 70 levels, have to grind 500 aa's, have to gain countless flags, keys, etc.<br />

If eq survives a few more years, think about the new player then.   Their 'usefulness deficit' will be insurmountable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with everything you say here, Torrinx. I still don't see that many new players coming up. And I actually look. I used to try to spend 30% of my in-game time helping new players who I didn't know. It was easy: go to Everfrost, black burrow, orc hill, etc. and look around for a couple of minutes, figure out which folks were not being pl'd, and help 'em. Lots of time my help consisted of nothing other than standing there until they noticed me. Sometimes they'd try to invite me (bless their newbie hearts) and I'd just say that was okay, I'm just here to make it very very difficult for you to die. Shout if you need help; otherwise I won't bother you. Very often I'd end up just talking to them about playing the game. Sometimes I'd /shield or bind wound a bit. I'd tell them about quests they could do for leather armor or whatever. I'd show 'em around their home towns, warn them not to vendor their silks and good hides, and so forth.<br />
<br />
I can't find folks to help anymore, at least not often. Yes, it's &quot;easier&quot; to be new now. Remember the &quot;sense heading&quot; hotkeys/mapping? Lol. <br />
But if I can't find new players to help, how are they supposed to find new folks to group with? How are they supposed to get the sort of base of friends that make the game interesting? I got such a rush the first time I tanked for a group in BB (after figuring out how to back down that dark tunnel from Everfrost). It really convinced me that being a warrior rocked, and nothing else would do. Are people supposed to solo until lvl 35 now before they find that out? I'd like to think I'm patient, but I'd have bagged the game if that's all there was to it when I started.<br />
Maybe it's better on the &quot;newbie&quot; servers; I don't know. But I wouldn't blame someone for feeling discouraged if they started the game on my server without knowing anyone.<br />

A few months ago I started an untwinked Troll SK. It was still possible to get commonlands camps and groups on the Orc Highway. Not sure you can any more, and if not, it's a pity.  I've never leveled a character by fighting in Crushbone, and I'm afraid that on my server anyway, I might be too late. Because PC is indeed easy: I leveled a shaman alt in there from level 11 to level eh, hmm, 20ish I guess in 4 hours (not counting the 6 hours I spent catching up some of my skills after that session). It took me weeks and weeks and weeks to do that leveling on my first character. So, basically, it became easy for me to avoid weeks and weeks of fun. Hmmm....anyway, PC is not the same quality of experience as the old world zones used to be when there were other players to play with.<br />
<br />
Yeah, no doubt my view is influenced by having old school nostalgia glasses on, but I'm not *that* old school. <br />
<br />
And even if I were, it wouldn't change the fact that /who 1 10 in newbie zones gets you very few hits now, and of those new characters you do see, half of them are guild tagged and have a level 65 toon standing next to them.<br />
<br />
So, if (and indeed I have no &quot;proof&quot; this is true; my own guild has actually grown since EQ2 and Wow came out) but if the population in EQ is falling, it's falling because of a lack of critical mass of new players, not simply because old players are leaving.</div></div><hr />
