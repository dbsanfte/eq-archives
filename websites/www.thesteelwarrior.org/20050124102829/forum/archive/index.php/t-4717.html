<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I'd start a little poll. What do you guys think are the coolest looking mobs of each expansion? And maybe some of the worst :p<br />
<br />
I'll start off with:<br />
<br />
Original EQ: <br />
<br />
Ubermob: <br />
Cazic Thule, obviousely, he was huge and scary :p<br />
Regular: <br />
Fire giants<br />
<br />
Bad: Hill giants; all blocky and with the plat they drop, you d think they' d buy decent clothes.<br />
<br />
Kunark:<br />
Ubermob:<br />
 The real VS did it for me; that robe looked awesome.<br />
Regular:<br />
The ghostly sarnaks in KC/howling stones were cool.<br />
<br />
Bad: The cactusses in OT; I mean come one, who would think they were dangerous?<br />
<br />
Velious: Coolest model would be Kerafym, even tho I 've only ever really seen Aerin Darr in PoV due to him being awoken long ago on the Nameless. Sontalak was pretty scary too.<br />
Regular: Manticores were scary<br />
<br />
Bad: King Thormax/Vindi, they looked just as dull as all the other giants.<br />
<br />
Luclin:<br />
<br />
Ubermob:<br />
I feel Seru looked awesome with that sword and the weird armor. <br />
Regular:<br />
Coterie winged nameds were pretty scary<br />
<br />
Bad: Centi's. Not scary and the model was overused. (as many were in Luclin)<br />
<br />
PoP: Rallos Zek gets my vote, you just know he is going to hurt you with that axe.  I ve never seen Quarm up close tho.<br />
Regular: CoD guards with the scythes.<br />
<br />
Bad: The sand giants in PoS or BoT south; they look like they are wearing nappies.<br />
<br />
LoY: Never been there much can t comment, tho the female trolls with the .....er....movement were interesting.<br />
<br />
LDoN:<br />
The mob in Miraguls with half bones and half mammoth flesh.<br />
<br />
Bad: Sand elves don t look hugely interesting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorites:<br />
<br />
Original EQ - Fire Beetle. It's a classic. <br />
<br />
Kunark - Venril Ssathir. The flowing robes still to this day give me goosebumps.<br />
<br />
Velious - This is a tough one. I loved the dorfs with the crossbows. A lot. But Statue of Rallos Zek is one lean mean kick ass machine. And looks a bit more menacing than AoW, even though AoW is quite the badass.<br />
<br />
Luclin - Seru. Hands down. He's my favorite looking mob in all of EQ. The city. The pyramids. The villain. It's really very cool looking.<br />
<br />
Legacy of Ykesha - Erudite Female Pirate. ARRRRRR.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power - Gonna punk out and just pick Rallos here. Finally got to meet the Warlord the other day. And wow. Though the screenshots I've seen from Plane of Water, I like the look of the mobs there, a lot.<br />
<br />
And finally Lost Dungeons of Norrath - the bald headed, albino badass nameds in Mistmoore. With the black, matrix style clothing. They just rock the house. If Seru teamed up with them, it'd be GAME on for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Original EQ - <br />
Uber Mobs - Vox (runner up would be inny)<br />
Normal Mobs - Misty Thicket zorro guards<br />
<br />
Kunark<br />
Uber - Definately VS<br />
Normal - Sarnaks still to this day i like that model<br />
<br />
Veilius<br />
Uber Mob - Kerafyrm<br />
Normal - Icewell dwarfs rocked (i mean they got tats)<br />
<br />
Luclin <br />
Uber - Hands down Seru  (coolest in game period)<br />
Uber2 - 4 arm females in VT rock (had to give them props cuz they were up against Seru)<br />
Normal - Shissar (i love the way the snakes look)<br />
<br />
PoP<br />
Uber - Toss up Rallos with runner up status to Karana (karana is probably the best looking, closest to what i pictured him, God in EQ)<br />
Normal - PoJ Executioner Mobs<br />
<br />
LoY<br />
Uber - no clue<br />
Normal - Most of the hot new female pirate models!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">original eq: nothing more scary then facing your first jacked up looking orc<br />
<br />
kunark: i'd have to say gore. first dragon i saw. not a  pleasent first but a first<br />
<br />
velious: AoW. i was on the way to go help and i see this monk right infront of me. loading please wait<br />
<br />
luclin: never seen really uber mobs in luclin. overall the wierd  chicks with like 4 arms<br />
<br />
POP: pics of RZtW look cool but never seen him. I'd have to say Aerin Darr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite mob models are:<br />
<br />
Original ~ Naggy. Nothing more imtimidating than a huge red dragon. Amygdalyns follow as a close second.<br />
<br />
Kunark ~ I liked the way Trakanon looked. Big, green, gaping wounds all over him, lots of pointy teeth. Very scary, until he attacked, then you thought he was having seizures or something.<br />
<br />
Velious ~ Hard to pick, has to be one of the dragon models, just tough to pick a favorite. <br />
<br />
Luclin ~ One of the most unique and outstanding mob models ive seen in the game period is the one used on Khati Sha the Twisted. <br />
<br />
PoP ~ Rallos Zek is still amazing to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite model is the 'projection' type in  Miragul. Those shimmering bubble thingies.<br />
<br />
Others would be Cazic, Seru, Rallos, Terris, Kunark goblins and Tserinia.<br />
<br />
Oh, something I noticed recently about Terris. When she gets that big backhand swing done, there's some serious shiftage in the chest area. Major jiggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Old School -  Fright/Terror/Dread.  Come on... Homer Simpson in a bondage outfit, who doesn't that scare?  Well, that and knowing no one's killing fast enough and you're next to visit bind.<br />
<br />
Kunark - VS... no question.  VS.<br />
<br />
Velious - Snow Bunnies. ARRRGGG RUN!!!<br />
<br />
Luclin - Fear da bouncing boobies of Aten Ha Ra.<br />
<br />
LoY - Drogmar.  Drogmar will forever be &gt; Horsie.<br />
<br />
PoP - I actually like the Nightstalkers from PoN here.  The whole 4 legged to 2 legged transfer there is pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Original: Phinny - hands down I think and evil eyes<br />
<br />
Kunark: I liked VS and Protector just before Trakanon<br />
<br />
Velious: Lord BoB/Statue and cute lil hatchlings in tov<br />
<br />
Luclin: Seru and the Thought Horrors from the Deep<br />
<br />
PoP: Mithaniel Mar with his cool sword which he juggles and lil pigs in tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Original - Dracoliche, I like the bony undead dragon model.  Spectres are also very cool looking with their scythes.  Aviaks, Spriocs.  Efreeti.  Harpies.  Lots of cool models.<br />
<br />
Kunark - The VP dragon models.  VS was also very cool.<br />
<br />
Velious - Kelorek'Dar, I like the sea dragon models, very cool.  Lodi.  Sea turtles are also very cool.  Statue also a very ominous model.  NToV, dragons in the ring there are very cool, the water dragon is very cool in there.<br />
<br />
Luclin - Wasn't too hot on any of the Luclin models.  Coteries, especially the winged ones.<br />
<br />
PoP - I personally liked the undead knights models in PoN, especially the guy on the horse.  Never got into elementals...  but prior to that I like the PoTorment models, Saryrn is very cool looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The coolest looking model in the game has to be the Synarcana model from Everfrost LDON adventures/raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol Ro and Rallos look completely bad ass.<br />
<br />
Also, the diablo looking models I have seen look good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kunark: Will agree VS was impressive.<br />
<br />
Vellious: Vulak, what a dragon should look like. <br />
<br />
Luclin: Will agree on Seru, he is still cool looking.<br />
<br />
PoP: Sol Ro. I remember when looking at the PoP box and saying... man I want to fight that guy. Fennin Ro is unique and looks bad ass when you have particles on. The flaming hole in his stomach is cool.<br />
<br />
LDoN: The glowing specter thingy that looks like it has a pulsating shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some really cool mobs, but the one single one that gave me goosebumps the first time I saw it... was a drolvarg rager :p  I saw that, and said to myself, &quot;WOW !! now that, THAT is a warrior !&quot; :D  I'd make a drolvarg in an instant if it was a playable race.</div></div><hr />

Old World: Dracoliche in plane of Fear, I remember saying &quot;Holy ####!&quot; as I first saw that mob.<br />
Kunark: Trakanon, that bone showing through flesh think looked kinda cool.<br />
Velious: Tunare, a little biased here, I'm an elf and all. :p<br />
Luclin: Vah Shir, otherwise, that expansion BLEW!<br />
Planes of Power: Karana<br />
Legacy of Ykshea: This one was pretty ho-hum.  However, I do like how the froglok models are animated.<br />
LDoN: Sand elves<br />
<br />
WORST-<br />
Old world: Goblins, put that butt crack away, PLEASE!<br />
Kunark: The &quot;Goo&quot; monsters.  *yawn*<br />
Velious: Sontalak!  He's just flat out ooogly!<br />
Luclin: NEW PLAYER MODELS.  I detest how they are animated.  Get whoever did the froglok animations to fix the rest of the pc models!!<br />
LoY: Hands down, the female trolls.  Get them some bras already! /shudder<br />
LDoN: froglok ghosts in the Guk dungeons.  Dunno why, I just do not like them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like:<br />
EQ- Dracoliche. First time I saw him he really scared me. Especially since he was an unexpected geust. Also the deputies, gotta love the hat.<br />
RoK- The driders in FV &amp; DL are cool, but VS is best.<br />
SoV- Coldain. And the gnomish sidewheeler boat!<br />
SoL- Named Coterie are the best I've seen.<br />
PoP- Bloodravens! It took years, but finally there are birds in the game.<br />
LoY- Bought it for the dyes. Female Erudite Pirate is nice though.<br />
LDoN- New werewolf model, new vampire model, new beholder model.<br />
Also- the HUGE golems in the new Hole are awesome.<br />
<br />
Don't like:<br />
EQ- Old Ogre model, goblins.<br />
RoK- Those butterfly things in FV, altough they saved me from driders fairly often. Hate blobs too.<br />
SoV- Lord Bob. Most of PoG.<br />
SoL- Aliens, zelniaks, new troll model. <br />
PoP- No complaints really. Maybe I haven't seen the lame parts yet.<br />
LoY- Those troll wimmen, gah! <br />
LDoN- Shadow thingies in MMC. Look dumb and are hard to target. Ditto for the spinny storm thingies in MIR and TAK.</div></div><hr />
