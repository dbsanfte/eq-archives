<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuggditup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking at a Gukta guard- they have a very long, thin one hander that has a bluish hilt and etching on the blade. I don't have time to put up a screenie at the moment, but I'd like to know what sword this is, and what other swords have this graphic.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Leonof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know what sword the guards wield but the Longblade of Vitality from HoH has the same graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Theres a 1hander off aerin`dar with the same look.  Also, the 1150 point Miragul's 14/19 dagger has same look.  At least one plane of time weapon does as well, though I cannot recall which.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuggditup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok great- keep the replies coming- I might even be able to afford on of these eventually hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stone Etched War Sword has a bit bigger 2handed graphic, but it's the same type though. There are only 2 warrior weapons that I'm aware of that have this graphic. One is off Aerin'dar (can't remember what it's called), and the other off the Rathe Council final mob (sword of primordial energy I think). Here's a screenshot of a SEWS, which is the same graphic, only a little bigger:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Timespinner (Ranger 1h from W5) and the Dagger of Distraction (rogue poker from W3) both have that graphic.  Hopebringer might, I dunno.  None of them have dropped on our server.<br />
<br />
Blackened Acrylia Blade had that graphic for a while, but it was changed, sadly.  No more level 1 twinks sharing weapon graphics with Time drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">honorable longsword i think has the same gfx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hopebringer is gold and a huge blade, not like any other weapon i've seen unless its like a knight sword already in the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i killed several sword/shield wielding gukta guards cause i was curious about that sword too: they only drop the shield which has just a lil AC and is no rent.<br />
sadly they never dropped the sword so i think it's just for looks and tied to the model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah; honorable longsword = mini SEWS.<br />
<br />
i'd post a pic of it but it's basically the same as what gerald has</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">simple, quest the froglock newbie sword.<br />
<br />
pwnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SEWS is a real nice sword IMO.<br />
