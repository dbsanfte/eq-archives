I have heard that there is a see invis mob on Rif faction on the way to the T-max area.  Any hints on dodging this guy and any other see invis mobs who may be in the way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Purexhal</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get to Tormax area pretty easy if kos to rif, the zeks wear plate, and rifs wear what looks like chain or something. The only see invis rif I can remember thats otw to tormax area is the one underneath the bridge, and you can easily avoid him, althought if your kos to tormax, most of the guards in his area are on the same faction as him.</div></div><hr />

All you need is to get a levi and stay to the far right when you go over the ice bridge to get around the Rif mob. I avoided him for weeks while working Max faction.<br />
<br />
The problem is going to come once you are inside the TR. At least the 2 TMax guards are on Max faction and you are going to have to run pretty close to them to get to the quest mobs. I was never brave enough to try to run around them because the space is pretty tight and if you agro one, the entire TR will assist - you will die fast.<br />
<br />
Turn in dorf heads to Bvellos until you are not KOS to Max and Rif will take care of itself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to run down the left wall, staying completely against it while KoS to tormax, never got aggro'd once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">optimispriime</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have heard you can have a mage coh you past the mobs on tormax faction and turn in your quest pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who has the faction to do Kael armor quests can get to the quest mobs.  Hug the right side of the bridge, and get through the door on the right, then hug either the right or the left wall through the throne room, and you're safe.  Never tried this with KT up, not sure if his agro range is greater than his guards'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, get levi, invis and sow, first.  Run up wall as high as you can before bridge and hug right side crossing it.  Then hug right wall to quest mob.  Make sure there are no roamers and drop invis to do quest.  Then run like crazy to zone, the train is memorable but with sow and levi its a piece o cake.  I got my BP while max ally to Zek but KOS to Riff and Tmax.</div></div><hr />
