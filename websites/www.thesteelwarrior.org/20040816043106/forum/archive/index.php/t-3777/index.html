<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What if a fix for warriors (and pure melees in general) involved us having mana?  At this point, I'm starting to think that the only way the three mana-free classes can be fixed is to give them mana and abilities that are similar to spells.<br />
<br />
I'm brainstorming as I write, so this may not be the most coherent post ever.<br />
<br />
1) Eliminate all the warrior disciplines and get us our own mitigation table.  Worst case scenario, eliminate all but the four 3 minute disciplines and put those on a timer that is the same length as the current Evasive timer.<br />
<br />
2) Add a series of new droppable and buyable manuals that contain knowledge of new 'techniques' (melee equivalent of spell scrolls) starting around level 45.  45 since up until that point, melees see new skills every so often and the caster/melee balance is still pretty good.  Also, add melee class vendors in the PoK library for parchment/rune turnins for 61-65 manuals.<br />
<br />
3) Add a series of new 'techniques.'  Castable, use mana, are subject to focus effects, FT, the whole shebang.  Technique effects could include increased aggro buffs (warriors), aggro reducing buffs and jolt (rogues), self healing/mana regen (monks), short and long duration damage increasers (all 3), short and long duration hit chance increasers (all 3), short duration boosts to dodge/parry/riposte/block (all 3), self only poison/disease cures (monks), reduced spell damage (warriors), crippling strike (i.e. short duration slow/snare [all 3]), vicious wounds (dot for rogues), bull rush (push on demand [warriors]), short duration self and group attack buffs (warriors).  Etc, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Give the monks the best damage increasers, give rogues the best hit chance increasers (plus the dot for extra damage), give warriors the best of the crippling strikes.<br />
<br />
4) Make warrior mana stamina dependent and rogue/monk mana dexterity dependent.  Give us AAs to boost those stats to 355 like the other &quot;pure&quot; classes.<br />
<br />
5) Add channeling skill and limited meditate skill.<br />
<br />
6) Boost warrior piercing to 250 (just on principle)<br />
<br />
Advantages - makes upgrades far, far easier since spells are much more adjustable than skills or disciplines.  Gives more options for the formerly manaless classes both now and in the future.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages - will piss off the purists.  It is mana, with all the attendant difficulties if you run into mana sucking mobs or need to meditate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just a thought, figured I'd throw it out.  Personally, I don't care how SoE fixes the pure melees.  I don't care if it involves mana or no mana.  I don't care if they blatantly rip off other games.  I just don't want to have to play the EQ version of Sloth from the Goonies, locked away in the basement and laughed at until muscle is needed then shoved back out of sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this is already done in EQ2 and EQ;AO its called a special moves bar and its linked to stanima and can be effected by kill rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Calling spells &quot;techniqies&quot; ain't gonna make them not be spells. SOE's gonna tell ya that if you wanted to play a warrior with spells, you should've made a knight...<br />
<br />
The idea might work though, what if there's 2-3 new abilities added along the lines of what you said, warrior class skills, working off of the stamina bar? The thing's useless as it anyway, why not put it to some use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sounds like my berzerker in DAoC....i like the abilities; helps spice things up a bit and helps out too when needed<br />
<br />
esp when you turn into a werebear. that shit is funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah manabar would be that bad gfy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Having special abilities linked to the stamina bar would probably be the way to go.  Although I still think that if they can give monks additional attacks that do damage it couldnt be that damned hard to code special attacks for warriors that work just like skills do now and give us utility type abilities (aggro dot, snare, slow etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My concern with using or tieing the sta bar to any special abilities or skills/spells... after only a very short time of fighting, I'm out of stamina.  This would make these abilities/spells not available at the time I would be most likely to need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm all for it so long as we have things like FT15, KIE, Bard song, mana preservation, mod rods, twitch, etc. etc. for STA so that we we don't run out easily in the same way Casters can cast low level spells just about for free. In fact we should get 2 aggro &quot;abilities&quot; at level 9 and 14 that work on any mob and provide ranged aggro and snap aggro on demand. Call them Cease and Desist and have them cost 1/100th of our STA bar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a hybrid (a class that deals with spells and melee), its a more interesting game if there are two bars.  Balancing between them both adds a layer of complexity and management.<br />
<br />
If the Stimina suddenly starts being important there also adds another layer of complexity to help balance out items.    Notice how many items have a focus and an effect but melee items only have one?  Well when Stamina starts being important you can introduce new lines of focus.  Vengance IV on an item isn't that interesting but what if it had Stamina Conservation IV as well?  Now you are attacking a little bit better AND your advance melee move doesn't take so much Stamina.<br />
<br />
A system of &quot;advance melee&quot; powered by the useless Stamina bar is sound on paper.  The other half of the equation is coming up with skills to trigger that are worth a darn and somewhat fit in RPwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">your STA drops alot faster if you DW, this would be another reason to go with 2handers (i prefer 2 handers)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mana, stamina or just timed cooldowns there are plenty of ways to introduce warrior type concepts/skills that have some form of necessary limitations inbuilt. So long as the powers invoked fit the warrior archetype i could care less personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Setting - the Theme to Mission Impossible begins to play.....<br />

Mission &quot;Stamina conservation.&quot;<br />
:Invigor, aka &quot;Agent Zing&quot; - CLR/009 DRU/014 PAL/022 SHM/024 ENC/024 RNG/030 BST/049 (Decrease Stamina Loss by 35) - 20 Mana, Seek out these agents for this spell.<br />
:Acumen SHM/56 BST/65 - (Decrease Stamina Loss by 10) - 75 Mana, Again seek out these agents for this spell.<br />
:Speed of the Brood (Increase Attack Speed by 66% &amp; Decrease Stamina Loss by 3) - 560 Mana, Very few agents receive this special ability.<br />
:Speed of Shissar (Haste &amp; Decrease Stamina Loss by 3) - This ability is maintained for a select few Agents who still retain &quot;The Snake Stick&quot; or &quot;Snake Bite&quot; (Epic) be very weary of these agents.<br />
<br />
Those are all stackable and would keep your STA at near 99% even while  under water, good idea but I'm sure &quot;The Comapny&quot; would bring that up before they ever took it serious, an occasional a Zing is like having Paragon, imagine a KEI spell the fully replenishes Mana without a timer, not that I wouldn't love to have us that powerful, I don't think &quot;The Company&quot; would let this happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Keep in mind that if Stamina powers advanced melee then it would have to be completely redone along with anything that deals with Stamina regeneration.  It wouldn't behave anything like it does today (not that it does anything today anyway ^_^).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A mana bar would be fun… come over to the blue side!<br />
<br />
Seriously, a mana bar based on STA (or DEX for Monks/Rogues) would be a good way to manage Warrior feats.  You could call it a power bar if that makes you happier.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, pure melee would benefit from all the mana on their gear, as well as the mana regen spells and effects.  As long as the feats themselves make RP sense a mana bar might be the best way to ration them.<br />
