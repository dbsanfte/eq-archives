<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I feel a little silly posting about this, but I have had a blast this last weekend on Anarchy Online.<br />
<br />
For those of you who do not know about it, AO is a MMORPG set in the far future. You are deposited on the planet of Rubi-Ka where you chose from 4 races (a &quot;normal&quot;<br />
 human, a fast but not that tough Opifex, eg see elves from D&amp;D, a Smart but not strong at all Nanomage, EG, Erudites, and the Atrox which are big and brutish but not that smart) You then chose from one of 10 or so (can't remember right now) professions, such as the Enforcer (Warriors), the Soldier (Ranger or other high damage types) Martial Artist (Monk) Agent (Rogue/Sniper), Fixer (kinda like a Rogue, but with debuffs and teleports) Nano Technician (straight up nuker, even has root as a low level spell) Engineer (kinda like a mage with a robot pet) Bueracrat (Enchanter) and a few more that I can't remember right now. <br />
<br />
Once you have your race and profession picked, you chose a side in the conflict on the planet. you can work for Omni--Tek (the evil corporation who is mining the planet for its resources) the clans (rebels, disgruntled omni workers, fighting the corporation for its freedom), or the Nuetrals. Each side has a starting city (two for the nuetrals, though you don't chose which one you start in, its based on current server loads) and multiple (identical) training yards to level up in early on. <br />
<br />
It was a little hard to figure out the controls at first, but it eventually became rather intuitive (once the initial shock wore off)<br />
<br />
Once you enter the world, you can open your inventory and equip your starting weapon (a solar powered assault rifle for the soldier), if you have any nanos (spells) in your inventory you can try and learn them, but you will probably get a message saying that you must increase your skill in certain fields before you can learn that program. <br />
<br />
Skills in AO are very different from EQ, you don't learn by doing in this game. You have a certain number of IP (i think that stands for Increase Points) and each skill can cost a different amount of IP to raise (the higher your skill the more it costs per point to increase) All skills have a limit as to how much each can be raised. Class defining skills (assault rifle, heavy weapons, ranged combat initiative for the soldier) can usually be raised 5 points per level. Less specialized skills can be raised 4 or even 3 points per level AND they will generally cost more to raise then skills of your class. So while a soldier CAN become very adept at casting nanos, it will cost him alot of IP and in the long run may limit his growth in weapons skills.<br />
<br />
Twinking is interesting in this game it seems, because each item (equipment/armour/implants/nanos) has a level of skill associated with it. for example in order to equip some armoured sleeves, I had to have an 18 in SENSE and a 17 in AGILITY so in other words, I couldn't equip them til I was around level 4. <br />
<br />
<br />
If I can figure out how to take a screenshot, I will post a few.<br />
The game is really quite beautiful in its landscapes and detailed in its models. It runs really well on my system which is rather crippled right now due to some memory going bad. <br />
<br />
What really made me sit up and take notice though, was how overwhelmingly this game reminded me of early EQ. Not in its style of play or genre obviously, but in the fervor and utter devotion that the dev's have toward the game. They aren't the big corporation like Sony sitting back and soaking in profits (not yet anyway) and they are actively trying to make the game better day by day. It was really rather refreshing when within the first 10 mins of logging in my first char, I was personally greeted by a GM/GUIDE (called ARK's) who helped me to understand the basic operations of playing! Can you imagine that in EQ? It only happened on the first char, so I'm guessing its once per account flagged but the GM said that if I needed any thing else, I could send her a tell or just /petition if she wasn't on.<br />
<br />
All in all it was a good experience.<br />
<br />
Now, just so some of you don't think I am quitting EQ, this was a 7 day free trial that I activated. it runs out on Saturday, after which I will most likely never play it again. I just got tired of a few things playing Donnel, I didn't want to play an alt, but I wanted to play a computer game, and it was nice to see the perspective from another MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening, like I said I will post some SS's when I can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you only knew Donnell; if you only knew......AO was the biggest abortion of a video game ever created. If anyone is nuts enough to ever give Funcom a penny for that bastardized POS that game is, my condolences.<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
( yeah, I beta'd and &quot;played&quot; AO when it was released. What a pile of dogsh*t it became; and if only the dev's listened to what the beta people were saying. They basically laughed in our faces and released that pile of dung anyhow. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow! Those are some heavy remarks!<br />
<br />
I prolly haven't played it long enough to see those things, but I thought the game system is very well done, and it 'plays' well despite some lack of immersement into the game world that I have felt.<br />
<br />
Mebbe things have changed since beta and early release, they are one expansion deep now (a downloadable one) with another on the way. Like I said, I ain't switching, it's just interesting to see a different MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Having cut my teeth on the paranoia fest that was Ultima Online (never knowing when you were gonna get PK'd running back to town after mining 1000 stones worth of ore; chopping trees for sooo long just to get your STR high enough since whatever your STR score was that was how many HP you had) /shudder<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all though, I thought that AO was rather enjoyable, for Sci-Fi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AO in my opinion was &quot;the little game that could&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like you mentioned; AO was pretty much the biggest most anticipated Sci-Fi genre MMORPG in a long time; and how it was built up in advertising and the world it was created in should have been the game Sci-Fi nuts ( including myself ) would have went to in droves.<br />
<br />
Note that I used a lot of &quot;should&quot; and &quot;could&quot; statements. I got sucked into the game; tried and tried and spent forever in Rubi-Ka trying to convince myself &quot;oh the game will work one day, it's just new&quot;. My first days in RK were awesome when I could move. Literally. I was a clan MA; hung out in the backyard for a while killing leets and birds and the occasional Omni...I mean for the first 6 levels of a game where you're basically trying to kill yourself every 5 minutes to learn how your character works...it was an excellent idea. Even when you died there..all you did was go sit near the reclaim booth and wait for your gear to be sent back. <br />
Now; after level  it was time to go run around in the outdoors. One of the most fun places there was the Beach where I went up to level 35 or so ( from level 6 )..learned more about the game, even met a few people who were as big of a Sci-Fi nut as myself, and we were actually &quot;immersed&quot; in the game. We started our own guild; went on some PK hunts for clan points and to talk smack amongst our felow clanners....but than something happened in the game.<br />
I won't go on a personal tirade about how totally fuxx0red MA's are in AO ( who knew a lazer rifle or whatever were better than fists in a 24th century world )....but the whole mechanics on how borked some classes were in comparison to how another class were so much overpowered than the others and interdependancy soon became nonexistant really started to make people wonder just how the game was going.<br />
<br />
You played UO. Remember the ganking tamers had in comparison to everyone else? That was AO. AO was one of the first games where levelling wasn't the sole reason to progress; you had the PK option which under level 150 was fun fun fun, after that the game just dried up. There was no where to go. GM-type events were pretty much the same as EQ ( either total rapefests or not worth going to )..the storylines and powers that be on both sides of RK were non existant except for the 10-12 solid RP guilds who kept the Omni-Clan figth alive...and people soon came to the point where it wasn't even worth logging onto.<br />
<br />
I gotta admit though; on paper AO was, is, and probabally still could be the best damn game in the Sci-Fi genre ever released...but in the online universe where it existed it was the biggest piece of coding trash ever released. I know maybe i set my expectations too high. Fanboi maybe in it's early days? Probabally. Still; Funcom made a lot of great ideas ( travel on the Whom-Pa was to cool; vending machines with &quot;cool&quot; clothes; reclaim booths; apartments; storyline ) which made the powergamer just as happy as the occasional player/roleplayer just as happy...but the gameplay itself plus the individual skill systems and IP implementations and chaos it made if you spent your IP's wrong, and than the entire one-zone feel of the game which was probabally about 10 years too early to ever implement ( PC's still have a bit of trouble with the massive size of RK )....made it an exercise in futility for most if not all.<br />
<br />
I Wanted AO to work. I wanted my release from EQ and lose myself in the genre that I enjoy more than anything ( i'm a big sci-fi nut; dragons and orcs bore me :D )....but AO's downfalls and problems just outshined anyhting it's bonuses ever could do tenfold. <br />
<br />
I'm glad AO is fun for you though. It is a fun world to lose yourself in. I jus wished it worked enough to where I would still be in it with you; either PKing you or fighing along side ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with ya Shik, AO was my first MMOG.  That first night was pure bloody torture.  It took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to equip my n00b rifle on the agent I made.  Another half an hour to figure out how to attack something.<br />
<br />
After a few severely screwed up toons I made an MA.  Played him up to 115ish.  I got sick to death of rolling team missions in Broken Shores because thats the only place lvl 80 and up players went.  Lag in that zone made MBG Aego/KEI/Focus at the Nexus stone in PoK look like nothing.<br />
<br />
I was very sick of the game after about 4 months.  Nothing to do but roll more team missions in BS or go run a few solo missions.  The 1 and only quest in the game was so friggin camped you could forget about ever finishing it without a group of 190+ friends who decided to take pity on you.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine from work started telling me about EQ and I told him about AO.  EQ sounded more like the medieval type of game that I was wanting to play.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the free 1 week trial version of EQ last August and told Funcom to KMA 2 days later.  About 2 months ago Funcom sent me an email offering me a free week to come back and try their new expansion.  I almost emailed them back to ask what kind of crack they were smoking.<br />
<br />
EQ is still fun for me.  There are times when its frustrating as hell to not find groups or finally get a group that splits 3 kills later or turns out to be 5 clueless PL'd n00bs that get ya killed in a rather nasty part of the zone.  My Monk and my Warrior are my 2 favorite toons.  As my guild adds more members and we start moving into the higher end of the game I'm sure I'll have a blast seeing some of the zones I've read so much about on the forums.<br />

<br />
Yes I said Begger. Would you believe I started in Magincia and made 13000 gold before ever leaving the city limits? Only skill I think I ever GM'd.<br />
<br />
Turned him into a Mage after I had amassed that wealth. Still couldn't ever win PVP though...<br />
<br />
Well, I have about 3 days of AO left, I keep getting twinked out by helpful level 80's so my Soldier has a Division 9 Gigaplexor or something like that which is supposed to be the best weapon in the game for soldiers (Though mine is a Cheap, Low Quality one)<br />
<br />
My friend and I are both giving it a try now, and he and I say the exact same thing about it. We just can't identify with our character like we can in EQ...<br />
<br />
Still though, it's fun blasting stuff for a change hehe....<br />
<br />
Soldier: I like guns<br />
NanoMage: Shut up! Or I will stab you!<br />
<br />
heh<br />
