<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm back from San Diego. What a trip that was. It was good though, I'm really glad Sony decided to do this. The level of communication and interaction we had with the team on Saturday was just unbelievable.  <br />
<br />
I got the feeling that these guys had broken free from marketting finally and were ready to fix the game. They openly said that GoD was released based on a level raise (70) which would have gone live with GoD, and then another with Omens. You want to know something else? Marketting considers Velious to be their worst performing expansion, while...drumroll please...Legacy of Ykesha is the best performing expansion. From a marketting point of view, maybe this is true. But I think if you ask the players, LoY was a gimmick expansion while Velious was, in my opinion, the best and most complete expansion they've released yet.<br />
<br />
The developers are passionate,  they asked so many questions. Even after the meetings I was getting asked what about this, or this. They forked out a lot of money this weekend. They also took a huge risk. When you invite 50+ people who've been playing this game for years and watched it's highs and it's lows -- it's amazing they didn't a barbed wire fence with armed guards and mine fields out there. But it wasn't. It was 3 buildings, with an SOE sign out front. I think Thomas called it &quot;Sony's weekend with it's pants down&quot; - because nothing was hidden from us. We saw it all..from the GM pit to  EverQuest II to Omens of War models and new epics and the new servers that will be powering EverQuest soon. <br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is...These guys deserve a chance. They love this game and they're tired of where it's been headed. Read over these and keep an open mind that this is obviously not &quot;a CD, 2 books, 20 printed pages, and a manifesto.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anyway enough of that, heres what you guys are really after...<br />
<br />
This list is from a letter given to us today after the EQ team met to discuss what they'd heard in our individual meetings. Keep in mind this isn't a final list or even close to it. They got a ton of information today, and this is more of a &quot;to do&quot; list for the time being while they finish going through it all.<br />
<br />
Comments in Red are mine.<br />
<br />
Dear Guild and Community Representatives,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for a great Summit! By all accounts it was a huge success. I can speak for the EverQuest Development Team and tell you that we're all grateful for the input you provided. In fact, in trying to generate this list to giove you this evening, we realized there was so much to go over that we wouldn't be able to get a complete list together in time. We're committed to not only listening to your feedback, but working with you to make EverQuest more enjoyable for years to come.<br />
<br />
So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes we would address starting Monday, as well as the most common themes that we'll come back with more information on by mid-week next week.<br />
<br />
A quick discussion resulted in a list of items that we will immediately address:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Add scripting to shut off empty instances of Plane of Time<br />
 This is the first step towards them fully instancing time<br />
 Raid Messages of the day<br />
 Improving how we handle beta and the testing process<br />
 John Smedley appologized for how this was handled in GoD. BetaBuff didn't sound like it would be around much longer.<br />
 Increase the number of debuffs allowed on MOBs<br />
 Increase buffs on players through AAs<br />
 Yay.<br />
 Note field on raid window<br />
 Improved consent &amp; drag for raid, group, and guild<br />
 This includes /consent for Raid, Group, and Guild. Other things mentioned were the ability to drag multiple corpses.<br />
 Improve corpse drag radius<br />
 Make charms not no-drop<br />
 Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing<br />
 Work on larger To Do list...I know this one is a little random<br />
 <br />
<br />
Future items we will immediately begin looking at and discussing are as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
 Plane of Time instancing and other issues<br />
  Back flagging solutions to help with high-end guild atrophy<br />
 This is a great one. Ideas thrown around were guild flags, extra flags, 85/15 rule everywhere, etc.<br />
 Improved raid and guild functionality<br />
 Ideas brought up were Secondary/Tertiary assists, /assist raid being the same range as /assist, drag and drop groupmaking in the raid window.<br />
 Auto loot all for your corpse<br />
 Improvements to raid XP<br />
 Review the epic 2.0 quests<br />
 They are thinking of making these a progressive type quest (think coldain ring)<br />
 No more alien NPCs ;-) (focusing more on familiar Norrathian themes)<br />
 Solo LDON-Style instances or similar content<br />
 Issues with item augmentations<br />
 I believe this includes focii<br />
 Possible enhancement to guild wars<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course these aren't all of items. You brought us a CD, 2 books, 20 printed sheets, and a manifesto. We'll need to go through all of those and our notes before we can really get a good tally of all the wonderful ideas and questions that were presented.<br />
<br />
THank you again for your feedback and participation. WE've had a great weekend and a wonderful display of things to come.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Robert Pfister<br />
Executive Producer<br />
EverQuest<br />
<br />
And the EverQuest Development Team!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There were quite a few other issues raised obviously. This is just the first step, and I wouldn't be surprised if these things start to go live within 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
A few other things not mentioned but probably should be:<br />
<br />
<br />
 AA requirements for being able to level in Omens were called &quot;rumors&quot;.<br />
 They are going to pick a raid number and stay with it. (Got the feeling it would be 54).<br />
 OOW will only have a very small number (I was told 1) of locked zones. The end encounters will be locked, but anyone will be free to go into the zone. <br />
  Boots of Despair - The taunt mod does work for us.<br />
  Inspect Buffs Leader AA should show your own buff timers as well.<br />
 There are new armor sets coming to ldon which will be elemental-calibre. The price cap at 1452 will be raised, to what I don't know.<br />
 You will be able to remove your augments from your armor soon.<br />
 Some GoD spells will be available via quest.<br />
 They are considering outsourcing the artwork to an outside company so they're more free to work on content, while still having unique models. I believe they said PoP was outsourced, for example.<br />
 Veeshans Peak revamp is coming very soon. When I asked if the old key would be needed, I was told: &quot;You take the old key, and some new stuff, and make the new key -- then you get a reward for your old key.&quot;<br />
 The Customer service system is being improved (And has improved) quite a bit.<br />
 Lots of talk of improving LDON for the more casual or smaller numbered raiders, and possibly creating an alternate progression path to elemental -&gt; time with this.<br />
 They seem to want to instance most/all progression targets. This is good.<br />
 Guild Banking seems to be on the way.<br />
 Brenlo wants a halfling bard.<br />
 Hobart asked about any interest in an in-game DKP client<br />
 New animations at the end of the year..along with that is possible new race/class combinations (not new races/classes, just new combo's)<br />
 Shaun Lord who worked on PoP was added back to the EQ Live team this weekend (that's a good thing)<br />
  The majority of EQ players are between levels 30- 50.<br />
 Eq is NT based. <br />
 BiC quest pieces off Primals will be changed.<br />
 Ikkinz trials are being changed a bit - for knight survivability.<br />
 Epic 1.5's. These are designed more for Time-level people, while 2.0's are aimed at the endgame.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was all raised in the development meetings. We also had a customer service meeting though, which went pretty well. <br />
<br />
 There will be a GM Graveyard Shift soon<br />
 A new tool is available to the GM staff, CS Assist. This increases their efficiency quite a bit. <br />
 As part of CS Assist, GM's can do a few new things. They can leave you persistant messages - Meaning you can logout, and tomorrow you'll log in to an answered petition. Going along with that, they can reimburse items to off-line accounts.<br />
 The Guide program will be changing directions a little bit. They'll be primarily responsible for running events and roleplay quests throughout the game, and will help with smaller petitions if needbe. This should increase the number of GM events and random events happening ingame around you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also recieved a packet labelled &quot;The Legion of Mata Muram&quot;. It includes some things about OOW lore and features.<br />
<br />
The Legend of Mata Muram<br />
<br />
Everyone has learned that Mata Muram, the leader of the legion, is a terrible creature that seeks to build an ultimate army by any means necessary -- including stealing beings from other worlds.<br />
<br />
Mata Muram is much older than almost every member of his army and is well protected. He is described by the Muramites as unmerciful, powerful, and a worthy leader -- though there are rumors that he is obsessed with revenge -- against who they don't know. Some Muramites have been overheard describing Mata Muram as some sort of Dragon.<br />
<br />
No one knows when the Realm of Discord and its counterpart, the Realm of Order, came into existence. Both in the Realm of Discord and Realm of Order there are rulers that are all-knowing and all-seeing that can never be seen or touched, much like the Nameless.<br />
<br />
Follow the Wayfarers Brotherhood to the war-ravaged Realm of Discord to help end the tyrannical ways of the Muramites once and for all. Adventure solo, in groups, and raids to complete &quot;epic quests&quot; and earn prestigious weapons to aide in your battles. Take your character to new levels of p;ower and aquire new items, spells, and quests.<br />
<br />
Features<br />
<br />
-Discover rich new zones with detailed environments featuring expanded graphical elements, improved spell effects, and all-new monsters to fight.<br />
-Develop your character beyond level 65. Unlock new innovative items, powerful spells, and thrilling quests.<br />
-Earn specialized, hand-tailored Epic Weapons with the completion of any of 16 epic quests. New epic quests will challenge even the toughest and most experienced Norrathians as they journey alone or in raid groups to win these valuable items. Designed for higher level players, each weapon will be unique in design and will have specialized characteristics.<br />
-Enhanced tribute system allows yolu to turn your loot into favor points for your whole guild to enjoy.<br />
-Allows players to go to various zones and request quick and easy tasks to gain experience and collect cool loot.<br />
-Recieve exciting new Custom PC Titles for your characters. Accomplish a variety of missions and get bestowed a title added toi your characters name.<br />
-New Alternate Advancement Abilities with unique skills to master.<br />
-New tradeskill recipes to produce hundreds of new items.<br />
-Dozens of new and exciting story-driven quests for the hardy adventurer <br />
<br />
There's also some concept art of....epic 2.0's in this packet. They look really pretty badass I have to say. I saw most of the ones they have  semi-finished and these things are beautiful. With DX9 they've added a lot more intricate designs into them, and the etchings mostly glow even when it's dark all around - it's cool stuff.<br />
<br />
The warrior one was still really rough, and all I can really tell you from what I saw is that it was a sword, and not a flaming axe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Twalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if and when all this goes live it will go miles to improve customer relations and the game itself</div></div><hr />

I hope they look into rejuvinating some of the Old World and make it more used...I miss city life, Freeport, Qeynos etc used to be fun to hang out in...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry that was supposed to be &quot;not no drop&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some old-world stuff was mentioned and talked about; That stuff is a little more involved though so we weren't able to get a definate answer one way or the other...but it is definately in their notes/papers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I only saw two items that had even slight interest for me.  <br />
<br />
solo ldon-stle instanced or similar content<br />
<br />
This could have potential I suppose.<br />
<br />
there is new armors coming to ldon, and the 1452 or whatever the cap is now will be raised.<br />
<br />
Yet this doesn't really sound good.  It sounds like they're going to keep the points requirements the same, but add more timesink items.  If you had to do 60 easy LDoN group missions to get a single piece of 1452 armor, I wonder how many solo missions you'd have to do to get one piece of the &quot;new&quot; armor?  My gut says, a whole hell of a lot. <br />
<br />
Well, I'm convinced.  It looks to me at though their focus is going to continue to be primarily on those customers willing to raid.  I'm not one of those customers.  I see no reason to continue finacing their myopic focus on a segment of the player base that doesn't include me.  Therefore, I've canceled both my accounts effective today.  If in a few months I read that they've made some changes the really benefit those people, like myself, who group or duo as a primary method of playing the game I may reconsider.  Otherwise, I won't be stepping into Norrath again.  The game has been good, but it has turned into something that I don't particularly want to play any more.  Good luck to the rest of you in your adventures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I kinda feel the same way. Nothing in that entire list addressed the game simply not being enjoyable. There are some fixes there, and some good ideas, but it definitely seems raid-centric. I'm not saying they're not trying; I just think that they're spending too much effort in the wrong directions. Maybe that's just me though, and of course we'll see how it all pans out.<br />
<br />
  I AM very glad for some of those ideas. They look promising. I hope SOE posts a list as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd be dissapointed if I expected more, but I don't.<br />
<br />
It's SoE afterall.  They wouldn't have a clue if it fell out of the sky and hit them in the head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">-improved consent (/consent guild) and drag. /consent raid, guild, or group.<br />
-auto loot for your corpse<br />
<br />
I don't know if this will keep anyone from quitting, but those are two things I've wished for for a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did they say anything at ALL about casual or non-raider improvements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">pretty sure raid &quot;MOTD&quot; is something that a raid leade can set a message that goes to everyone in raid and people can check, IE raid leader puts MT order or some information there and people can just check it. ( iuse guildmotd to do that myself, having it in raid would be nice so people dont log into guildmotd being an mt ordeer!<br />
<br />
an interesting tidbit was that as part of 5th anniverary editiomn they were planning on raising level cap for everyone and gates had content tuned for that but they scrapped the idea..<br />
<br />
few others things but i gotta catch my flight home too,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This thread currently has 6644 views. I'm guessing it was linked to a LOT of boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nah, it nwas split from the other thread so it inhereited its views<br />
<br />
As ar as casual players go...<br />
<br />
The focus may have been more on raiding, but casual players weren't forgotten. They're going to talk about either lowering the loot cost in ldon (or uping the pts for the missions) and adding some 18ish -person completable raids. I talked to Alan Crosby at dinner about casual players even more, and he assured me they wouldnt be left out. There will be ways to progress and build your character.<br />
<br />
You have to understand that isn't a complete list. It would be impossible for soe to go over as much stuff as was given to them in the hour between meetings and dinner. They made this list out of the more popular requests that they'll begin working on Monday. <br />
And...remeber that thing abou &quot;i want to zone in even if i die&quot;? Yea, they agree. I don't know about Elementals, but they agree in principle at the least :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There will be ways to progress and build your character.<br />
<br />
Well, there are already ways to do this, but they're prohibitively time consuming and repetitive.  If they do some of the things you mention, maybe it won't be so bad.  But I'm taking a definite wait and see attitude and they're not getting another cent out of my wallet until and unless I see the game worth playing in the manner I enjoy playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That sounds a bit more promissing, I have to wonder what will become of OoW if they are no longer doing alien monster from other planes of reality?<br />

Does this mean no rat race in EQ1( I can bet you we will see at least 1 new race before this game dies ) or just no more &quot;alien&quot; sci-fi types?</div></div><hr />

Theres a lot of stuff that was said/mentioned during this weekend that you guys might be interested in, but i'll be damned if im typing it on this webtv keyboard. I'll add it to the first post when I get home.<br />
<br />
I gotta catch my flight, but i'll write a more comprehensive list once I get homeand a lot of these questions will have answers.</div></div><hr />

Ya well, they say they agree with a lot of things, but the game currently does not reflect that opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wubba Wubba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Compared with the wide-ranging discussion in the other thread, I have to admit that this set of issues they are addressing is disappointingly narrow.  Is Sony rearranging the deck-chairs?  Is &quot;a wider corpse summon&quot; really in the top 50 of the major issues that needs to be addressed?<br />
<br />
There is an elephant in the room (WoW) that is coming and coming fast.  And no one is talking about it.  Already several major (top tier) guilds across the servers have died in anticipation of WoW- people are selling accounts, dumping items to bazaar and leaving.  Why bother playing another 3 months when you will be leaving in 3 months time?  Why sell your account and items in 3 months time when plat prices will be much lower?  Yet, I see nothing about how EQ and WoW will fit together- what sorts of players each will attract?  <br />
<br />
What I would like to see is a list of services EQ intends to provide to each of its customer types- a &quot;business model&quot; like you'd see in any other type of business:<br />
<br />
-raid guilds will see more of xxx events; and <br />
-non-raid guilds will see more of yyy events.<br />
<br />
Sony needs to sit down and carefully think what it is providing its customers.  For example, let's take my guild:<br />
<br />
I'm the raid leader of a casual guild.  We raid (4 groups) once a week 9pm - 1am EST on Friday nights, and then run 1-3 group events maybe another 2 nights a week.  I tend to think I represent a reasonably large proportion of the EQ playerbase (20% maybe).  My guild members are almost all 65 with around 100 AA and some a lot more.  We are all mature players.  Most have been playing EQ since 1999.<br />
<br />
What events exist for a guild like mine?  It can't take long to travel to or to CR from, as time is very restricted.  Anything requiring keying or flagging is out.  Everyone is well-equipped from PoP, so loot from a large amount of the zones is undesirable.  We can't choose our time to raid, and we don't have a large number of trackers, so valued timed spawns are out.<br />
<br />
The answer of course is that there is very little now for my guild.  GoD provides a few new zones that are not locked, but equipment drops are very low even in Ferubi.  LoY raids are not worthwhile.  LDoN raids are too hard.  PoP-flags lock us out of the decent zones.  Luclin and Velious are either trash or timed spawns we will never find up.  We are left with the open PoP zones and just getting lucky with bosses in other expansions.<br />
<br />
If WoW provides a better match for my guild's requirements, we will all be leaving and taking our 80-100 accounts with us.  What is Sony doing for its customer base?<br />
<br />
This fact is especially sad given that my guild has been playing this game for 5 years, and that the tools to match my guild's needs ALREADY EXIST!  Instancing is a perfect tool for MMORPGs.  A full set of LDoN raids of all difficulty types would keep casual/non-raider guilds happy for a long time.  No new content needs to be added- Sony simply has to flesh out existing content.  I can easily see instancing being the model for all future RPGs and 3-7 day random spawns as dying with EQ.<br />

<br />
Some of the stuff they're listing seems like little bones that should have been fixed awhile back.  Seems like SoE is just throwing tiny roadspikes in the way of a runaway car when what they should be doing is jumping in and hitting the brakes.<br />
<br />
No, I don't mind small stuff being fixed, but I pay them per month and I expect little stuff to be fixed without having to call a big summit about it...<br />
<br />
What this summit *should* have addressed is the overall big picture of the game.<br />
<br />
-Where EQ will  be in 1 year.<br />
-What small guilds should expect out of the game.<br />
-What large guilds should expect out of the game.<br />
-What casual and non-raiders should expect out of the game.<br />
-What top-end players should expect out of the game.<br />
-What the next expansion has to offer in storyline, top-end, middle-end, and low-end.<br />
<br />
et cetera.</div></div><hr />

quest doable by anyone and putting solo content back in teh game, and reducing the rediculus ammount of backflagging(like just rz, mm, say, arnger and bert for ep, or just rz if time flaged ) would be a big step at adding some fun back in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My plane landed in San Diego around 2:00 pst Friday, and I was greeted at the baggage claim by a guy named Wink Winkleman. He took me out to the bus which Thomas Taylor (aka Vannoth aka Cyphos(sp)) was there. He's the guy that puts together all the fan faires and such - real cool guy and our host for the event along with Brenlo. <br />
<br />
The bus takes me to the hotel and I just chill for a bit talking to some of the SOE and other players that were there already. At 5:00 we left for PetCo park to see the Padre's vs the Brewers.<br />
<br />
<br />
On Saturday the buses left the hotel at around 8:00 for SOE headquarters. When we got there we all got name tags and sat and listened to a little talk by Smed and a few designers about some general issues and what we were trying to accomplish by being there. He said this was an open thing, if we wanted to see something we could see it - he just asked that we not take pictures of certain things on the tour. Woody took a pic of smed holding his wallet too  :D <br />
<br />
Next was a tour of the offices. We got to see everything...My group went with Tom and we saw the GM pit first. Yes, GM's do exist, I saw them. On a sunday morning at 8:30 am they had probably 9 ppl in the pit and the queues were all empty. That's a great thing to see. Their new CS Assist tool is great.<br />
<br />
After that we basically just toured the buildings. The server room was pretty impressive. Smed showed us the &quot;eq server of old&quot; which is just monstrous...then he showed us some new servers they are going to be switching to soon which were no bigger than my tv. They're really fast too.<br />
<br />
Once we got done exploring the offices (it took a little while...we really did look at everything) then we broke into our round-table discussion groups . The theme of this meeting was &quot;Problem Fixing&quot;. We had Brenlo, Smed, Shaun Lord and a couple others in there with us. The meeting went pretty well...surprisingly. Smed was writing down a ton of notes, and looked surprised by some of the things we mentioned. He was really interested in it all though.<br />
<br />
 After that, everyone went to get lunch. They had hamburgers and stuff but I went to check out EQ2 and omens instead of  a burger :P<br />
<br />
Eq2 looks fantastic graphics-wise. It was running on an alienware system with a p4 3.0, 2gb ram and one of the newer nvidia cards. In the options, you can either pick and chose from what looked like hundreds of different things. You can customize it to look as good (or bad) as you want it to. If you aren't quite that savvy though, theres also a box with ~6 settings that covered the whole spectrum pretty much. When switched to the highest settings, it would crawl. The system played it fairly well on &quot;Balanced&quot; though, which still looked amazing.<br />
<br />
After that I headed down to check out the oow models and epic weapons that they had complete. The lead graphics designer was messing with some of the models and I got to take a look at them. I also got to see all the epic weapons that they had &quot;finished&quot; (that term is used loosely because only about half had models at that point [rest had concept art i got pics of] and none of the partical effects were implemented yet). Someone put a hell of a lot of time into these. Most of them have etchings that glow in the dark, and a TON of bumpmapping and detail involved in them. They really do look epic. I'd try and describe them, but i'm sure one of the other ppl will have some pics on their sites soon enough.<br />
<br />
Next was a Customer Service meeting. Tom told me their CS reps actually asked whether they should have security in the meetings...i liked that. It was a good talk though, theres a few changes coming to customer service very soon, which I listed in the first post.<br />
<br />
Next came round two of the developer discussions, this time the theme was &quot;Moving Foreward&quot;. This time it was a little less us telling SoE what we thought off the cuff, and more of them asking us specific questions, and getting our feedback on it. <br />
<br />
After that we headed back to the hotels, and to the Rock Bottom Brewery San Diego.<br />
<br />
There was a ton of information during this event, and it's no surprise that they needed a little more time to go through it all. Everyone was really positive though and things went well I would say. There wasn't much (if any) aggression towards the staff. It was more about helping out the future of the game, than blaming and ridiculing what had been done in the past.<br />
<br />
If you guys have any specific questions I can try and answer them. I did ask about pretty much everything in that thread, so if I left something out let me know and I'll try and answer it.<br />
<br />
Oh one thing I forgot...Rod Humble and John Smedley both appologized for the way gates of discord was tested (or...wasnt). That's kidna neat, and I tried to pk gilfalas irl too but then our dinner came and we forgot =D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well--this summit is a great thing.  I still remember a year or so ago when it seemed like developers were in their own little world and there was no feedback to us at all.  At least now they are interacting with players and are letting us know they actually are considering what we tell them.  It may be that WoW has them scared but I kind of think that the developers were always paying attention and now management has let them acknowledge it do something about it.  I hope it continues.  Just keep in mind that EQ is a hugely complicated system and some of the things that need fixing or tuning are very complex and they probably are working on a lot of things people are concerned about but progress is slow because of the difficulty involved.</div></div><hr />

I really do hope this is the case. I love this game and it really bugs me to see it going the direction it has been going. IMO communication is always a Good Thing (tm) , even if all they say if F&amp;^# you, atleast then I know we were heard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What they said about selling LDON equipment back (equipment not augments) is that they didnt want to do that, and someone in the meeting I was in mentioned how bad the points were in LDoN pre 65, and they felt they were inline with the level appropiate armour, but no one there really knew enough about that to try to refute that, if it is or isnt true.<br />

crystalmatrix: We didn't get many details about removing augments, just that it would be possible in the very near future. I DID bring up the fact that a level 20 gets like 2 pts for an LDON and that buys jack. They said it was something they'd look at. There was really a ton of LDON suggestions that mostly centralized around the casual players and the fact that they use ldon to gear up, while we used elementals/time. THere will be elemental-calibre armor/item slots coming to LDON vendors soon...the bad news is they said they're raising the max item cost from 1492 to something higher.<br />
<br />
I think that they realize now that the hardcore gamers really don't utilize ldon much, and it's mostly casual/smaller guilds - the feel I got was that they're going to look at expanding on that a bit more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off the top of my head ... non-refundable equip just means that I'd keep grinding out LDoN's to get the even-more-spendy gear.  (The Tak BP is a much better deal for 1492 points than it is for 2252 pts.)   I dunno how I'd ever pull off the points to get the new stuff - I never was able to finish grinding out the Tak - but whatever they come up with in the future, it's gonna be inneresting to read all about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I am very skeptical like a lot of other people, but I do agree some of these are very welcome changes.  But while they do admit GoD was a bad idea, personally I feel the the problems with GoD are far deeper than not introducing level 70.  Now there are some good things about GoD, but to lots its just long, repetitive and boring rubbish(you too can now adventure in a sewer!) with very little creativity save some of the character models. Its almost like one big Ldon for raiders. Mobs carelessly and thoughtlessly sprinkled around with dungeons that reek of repetitiveness and are easily forgettable. <br />
<br />
I personally don't give a crap about the mata-whoever. This is the first  expansion with an end game in which I truely don't care who the end guy is. Even in Luclin I was somewhat curious about Vex Thal, Seru, Katta, The Emperor and the language they spoke. The lore in GoD is utter shite. EQ imo needs a revolution in gameplay, lore and atmosphere to get its wheels rolling again.  Honestly it sounds like Oow is still just an extension of God, only this time you get to be level 70 so crap will be easier. Big woop.<br />
<br />
However, while a lot of this sounds nice but &quot;not nearly enough&quot; of a change, I do trust the players more for the most part, and cannot comment too much as I was not at the summit myself, so I guess we will have to wait and see how it goes.  I do despite my pessimism hope they can recampture EQ's magic,  but then again that might be impossible in itself due to how long some of us have played this game.<br />
<br />
All of this is my opinion, so I could be out of synch with the majority of players on some of these issues, but generally this is how I feel. I am very impressed with some of the suggested changes with current content, I just hope they are ready to implement something new and exciting for future content.  Thanks again Raaj for the detailed writeup, its much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Lol, I have a 31 Shaman alt I play when friends need it for rounding out low-level groups (and for tradeskill stuff). Was on him the other day. He'd done something like 10 LDoNs, 10 successes, something like 21 points. Pffft. Timesink is too mild a word for that.<br />
<br />
But look: the people who went to this were encouraged; the people who were *there* left feeling better than when they came, which I find encouraging. I was surprised in our previous thread that casual players were not only as concerned as I was, but so numerous. I'm encouraged that SOE as heard of us.<br />
<br />
I'm encouraged that they realize that they have some testing issues and that they appear to believe now that testing stuff is part of their core business.<br />
<br />
If we get more instanced content; if we get some revamp of LDoN (the whole remove-augment thing; a wider variety of difficulty levels for raiding); if I can go to zones where (eek!) I might die; if they do something about flagging issues-- well, that would not be a bad start, if done intelligently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">The lore in GoD is utter shite.<br />
<br />
Exactly.  As much as we complain about broken content, FUBARed RvR, class/role imbalances and frustrating keying/flagging events, at the end of the day we look at GoD and shake our heads.  <br />
<br />
For me at least it is simply that there is no connection whatsoever to anything that came before.  At headquarters I'm sure it diagrams out nicely that GoD dovetails perfectly with the long and involved lore of LDoN but they really forgot to get player's feedback on that either.  Let's face it, in LDoN none of us gave a shit about that stupid barbie rogue and his apparently level 90 multi-classed companions.  LDoN had pages and pages of actually not bad lore if you payed attention to it but very few people cared about it.  Why?  I'd venture because it was all plopped down out of thin air.  Sand Elves?  Erm, ok. Miragul?  Well, he's an interesting figure but didn't we already have his lore?  Mistimore?  Aw heck, Mayong is still my favorite character in EQ lore and he gets nothing.<br />
<br />
Hmm, perhaps it's largely because of the instancing but I don't know.  I think at the core the trouble was suddenly it was a whole &quot;follow the adventures of mighty Morden Rasp and his fabulous crew of adventurers!&quot; when frankly I don't want to hear about it.  Imagine if entering and conquering ST had been all about following the trail of the mighty NPCs who were killing the wardens and freeing the sleeper.  Erm, no thanks.  Hell, for that matter where did Morden come from anyhow?  He just serves to remind me that as a more mortal Rogue (with a ton of time and effort invested) I can do precisely NONE of the epic things he talks about in his adventures.  Ah, you snuck in and stole the fabled artifacts of the previously unknown enemy and had your wise wizard/enchanter/cleric friend decipher their meaning did you?  Well then, good on ya Morden... I'm still trying to con some suckers into letting me leech off their flagging group so I can get to that zone and beg for groups.  After all, everything there sees this dumb Rogue from three screens away and even if I *could* sneak in there unseen, I couldn't interact with anything without bringing 53 of my closest friends.  It must be nice to be the hero you dumbass barbarian.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in my opinion it comes full circle on the lore.  I don't care a whit about Rasp and co. and frankly would love to find thier bleached bones rotting in the sun somewhere.  Why I don't care may have a number of explanations but the fact remains that I don't.  In the end though, the entire basis for GoD's lore (and likely OoW's) is to tell the tale of these fools.  I could put up with the aliens on a rampage and the ghosts and spirits bosses decently but not when the only insights are through the merry band of NPCs pretending they are somehow like the players themselves. HINT: They serve mostly to highlight that players will *never* be able to do anything that is remotely epic in scope.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one more reason just for the hell of it.  Read this list: Natimbi, Qinimi, Ferubi, Riwwi, Barindu, Vxed, Tipt, Ikkinz, Uqua, Inktu'ta, Kod'Taz, Qvic, Tacvi, Txveu, Yxtta.  That's just zones and cheerfully ignores the mobs and especially raid targets.  Smith Rhondo?  Hey, I can deal with that.  Diabolic Destroyer?  Well, kinda grade-school I think but alright, I can deal with it.  Vrex Barxt Qurat?  Good god, you could get away with this in VT perhaps (hell, I've seen amazing work-ups of the Akhevan language even) but must 90% of the GoD names look like something I ran through a crypto engine?  Ah well, at least there is a 'qu' in his surname.<br />
<br />
By the way, although this was quite ranty I am indeed encouraged that the conferance went well.  I have my doubts still indeed but at least it sounds like they are a little desperate.</div></div><hr />

It restores some hope in me personally that things may actually turn around, as it stands now I see a game I have loved to play since Jan 1999 in serious decline.   EQ has been a lot of fun to me  for 5+ years, and most of you at some point or why else would you be reading here?<br />
<br />
My thoughts are:<br />
<br />
1) Casual vs Raid content. In the past the arguement was 'raiding is more difficult/risky so raids should give better gear.'  I disagree, there are people in raid guilds who have a hell of a time in a hard LDON adventure, even after the mudflation of GoD, reward good single group players with quality rewards instead of timesinks that are more painful than the raid timesinks.  Create lots more varied 1 group content and add some raids for 2-4 groups as well.  Make the rewards worth it, endless hours of LDON for a minor upgrade is just not worth it. More drops in LDoN that are usable, not just sellable or tribute worthy please.<br />
<br />
2) Testing has always been derided by the player community in general.  There still must  be a non-uber  streak to some of the testing, hopefully by 'testing will be done by guilds' they do not mean 'only by the uber guilds'.  Every server has more than one capable guild, and many more capable unguilded players. (Note I am in a guild that has completed kod'taz/time not a casual player!)<br />
<br />
3) That this stuff may not actually be followed thru on and could really just be a PR tactic to stall people who are sitting on the fence with this game.<br />
<br />
4) More communication from SOE to the customers is needed. Often. Daily if possible (just don't do it via #5 below read solution there!) Hell if they are so fired up and proud, show it off.  <br />
<br />
5) Less marketting spam when I log in would be nice.  The 'quick connect to server' change is great.. except for the last two weeks it seems everytime I log in there is a window shilling OOW or a poll... or a news item... and all of them re-route you to the server screen which I was trying to avoid in the first place!  Add an optional button for 'read news/patch notes' that doesn't waste my time when I don't want to read it. Thanks!<br />

It might not tie up really well with the past expansions because it's a new continent, but the lore you get from the flags, the instance NPCs, the bosses and the Breakdown in Communication quest is the best lore I've seen on EverQuest.

We can't choose our time to raid, and we don't have a large number of trackers, so valued timed spawns are out.<br />

Small guild events that you have -- LDoN raids.  They just stated that they will be making small 18 man LDoN raids.<br />

This looks impressive, it's good to see such communication and openness from SOE.  Although it's true that even if they do all of these things and more, there is a good chance that this won't be enough to resurrect my account.  But it still gladdens me to see them *doing the right thing*.  Thanks for the report(s).<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head ... non-refundable equip just means that I'd keep grinding out LDoN's to get the even-more-spendy gear.  (The Tak BP is a much better deal for 1492 points than it is for 2252 pts.)   I dunno how I'd ever pull off the points to get the new stuff - I never was able to finish grinding out the Tak - but whatever they come up with in the future, it's gonna be inneresting to read all about it.<br />
<br />
Guess my progression is going to grind to a halt as I store up AP because these fools wont let me sell back what I have bought. Why would I buy anything until this revamp?<br />
<br />
Personally I think you should do a couple things:<br />
1) Make the LDoNs progressive in nature instead of random (or at least progressively random). Move from theme to theme with content tie ins.<br />
<br />
2) Enable augments to be removed and sold back (to include dropped augs, that would add a lot of interest to the loot dropped) at some fixed ratio. Augs bought with AP should be returnable forever and maybe dropped augs become No Rent yet returnable for AP? See #4 for other ideas on turn-ins<br />
<br />
3) Add new stuff and rework costs of everything to make a modest progession possible at 10 wins and major every 20 wins (1450/1492 equiv items). I dont care how it scales just that the scale is too much of a timesink. I think successful losses should have points awarded based upon completion time. So if you get that last drop 1 sec after the clock stops u get 75% the points. 5 mins late you get 50%, 10 minutes 25%, etc. instead of the canned 25%. Also scale lowby AP to equivalent items. 10 wins = good iitem, 20 wins = great item. One thing people need to come to grips with is that you are not going to earn Tak 1492 armor by winning your way from 15-45. Just not gonna happen. But you should be able to equip your guy at a level comparable to how you are progessing, that is reasonable.<br />
<br />
4) Make items returnable for AP once you have achieved a certain # of wins. So if I have a full-set of Tak 1492 armor and I want to get the new set then I need lets say (and this is random) 50 wins in each theme (or maybe complete the theme or get X of of wins in which the equipment is bought) and then I can return stuff at say 85% of original AP (its used after all). HERE IS ANOTHER REASON TO GRIND!! :-)<br />

SoE divulged that these types of player summits would continue and would also be used for EverQuest2 and their other MMO games. This first EverQuest summit as top heavy with representatives of top guilds as the current Gates expansion was the main bone of contention. However, with their recurring mention that the majority of their base of active players being in the level 30 to 50 range, we can construe that future summits may well consist of more players of that level range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE saw their numbers dropping and the top tier guilds going. And they are related (though how strongly would depend on their data mining).<br />
<br />
The raider guild leaders are damned easy to find. GM tool, guild leader, township rebelion, or what have you. So they planned, at least to an extent to fix the problems with their most intense customers (or what ever adj you want to use). Then Woody got a HUGE responce, they reminded their data an said Oh Shit! we are bleeding non-ubers too. <br />
<br />
Woody and the class rep are then the next easiest customers to find. <br />
<br />
I though you would have been a good rep (along with Bruutal and Haass) but just how easy are you all to find. Who ever was doing the invites would have to have specific knowledge of the boards and the people here. <br />
<br />
Their new and re-energized guide system might be a good way to ID key time-impaired casual reps. Though I have to say when they say the average player is 30-50 I think they have to refine their mining. <br />
<br />
If you looked at my account as a whole I am not a 65 player... I have a 65, a 53, a 39, 27 and four 2-12s or so. And you can't use /time as a metric for mainnes with bazaar bots to dirty your data.<br />
<br />
I think they were caught flat footed by Woody and the casuals and grafted them on to their first round. I also think they have the pre-PoP mentality that FOH and co drive the game...because everyone could be like the eventually. I could see myself in Indilocite, or Warlords, or what have you. I dont see myself in elemental--or getting to 8k unbuffed--without becoming a hard core raider.</div></div><hr />

people complaining that they cannot get the same thing level of improvement, in the same AMOUNT of time from doing group/solo/duo content as from raid content are simply bonkers. Are there ways to improve? yes. Will you get upgrades as big as from raid encounters? no. That should be very obvious, it would be completley pointless to have raid content if that was the case. It's harder,the rewards are better. Simple. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the whole time instancing thing, man that's big for a lot of server. VS currently has 4 time guilds....soon that will be 5. Full instancing is about the best thing the two lower time guilds, mine included, could dream of. <br />
<br />
Lots of other good ideas, some are a bit inane, but all in all it looks very promising. If they stand by what they said here, and CONTINUE TO LISTEN to their customers, I think I'd be sticking around for a logn time, and so would most of the people I play with. Most of us, at least in my guild, would be delighted to see that SoE is going to start listening to what their players are saying. <br />
<br />
Of course ultimately it might not matter. The proof is in the the pudding, but so far it seems a good start.</div></div><hr />

Um, the top end LDON armor costs 1492 points per piece.  1492/105 points per mission * ~60 mins per mission including group set up and travel time = about 15 hours per armor piece.  That's WAY more generous than the frequency of upgrades for raiding.</div></div><hr />

 I agree with you to an extent.  But as one who has recently started entering the top end I have this to say.  I get 51 points per mision and if i do hard then I lose.  My gear is not up to par yet, and exp sucks hard in normal LDON so i can not get the AA to do hard so back to pop.  I spend most my time in grind BoT until I recently entered EP where I am still a huge Mana sponge but not as bad as Hard LDON. Either way I am happy to hear about future changes and hope that 75% of them come to pass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">The key thing I was trying to show is that you instance adventures that are single player style that involve key strengths of a class.

However if he watches the bulter move around he will deliver a meal.  You can follow him inside and kill Jeaves there and then make out with the loot! ^_^<br />

Umm...I don't know you're equipment and who you group with, but there's no way me and my friends could complete 15 hard missions in 15 hours.  I've got 8.5k and 1550 ac buffed and I'm a complete mana sponge for the clerics on hard missions (all defensive AA's also - 130 total.)<br />
<br />
IF we can get the right people together we try a hard (2 and 2 so far.)  Here's my &quot;hard ldon completion time estimate&quot; for me and my friends.  Assume a 50% failure rate, 30 minutes to get everyone together and for a quick split at the end, 90 minutes for each mission (the 2 wins were both with less than 2 minutes to go.)  This means it will take 60 hours per piece of gear.  Also, that first point about &quot;get everyone together&quot; implies everyone needed is online - which is often not the case - which means we have to do a normal.  This is still ok with me, but keep in mind that after a year of building through ldon I just got to the point where we can begin to do hards.  <br />
<br />
As a comparison, for most of the last 6 months I've raided 2 nights a week for an average of 3 hours a raid.  That's been a total of about 150 hours raiding this year.  I've gotten 5 gear upgrades from raids during that time frame - which comes out to about 30 hours per piece of gear via raiding.  I don't know if this is good/bad/average - it's just my personal experience in my guild.<br />
<br />
For me, I know raiding with my guild is better for gear, but there is a catch.  Since we can't field enough to complete EP flagging raids, we can't get to the EP drops (and therefore, we can't do Time or GoD.)  That's where the problem is...there isn't a viable upgrade path if you don't do large raids...no matter how much time you put in.<br />
<br />
One more thing about ldon.  What if there was only 1 encounter you could do to upgrade your gear via raiding?  Wouldn't that be extremely boring?  Well - telling the non-uber raiders to go the current ldon route is pretty much the same thing.  Sure, the graphics are different, but it's the same thing over and over and over and over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Guess what Khumak, if you can tank a hard LDoN to get that 105 points, you probably aren't really hurting for the armor you could buy with said points.  If the LDoN armor is that big of an upgrade for you, you probably can't tank a hard adventure unless you have a really skilled and really well balanced group backing you up (and maybe not even then).  And unless you bring your group with you, you sure as hell aren't going to get a group, get them all herded into the adventure zone, and complete the mission in 60 minutes.  Average time expenditure is going to be more like 1.5-2  hours and if groups are scarce or one of the retards you're forced to group with does something stupid and kills the group could be much longer, which brings our estimation of how long it takes to get each piece of armor back up to 30-40 hours per piece of armor.  Then we get to spend a like amount of time or maybe longer per armor piece buying augments for them.  So we get to spend 60 to 80 hours per piece to get a real armor upgrade and once we're done the gear we have will still look like newbie armor when compared to ele+ gear.  If that really is WAY more generous than the frequency of getting raid gear I really don't see why you hardcore raiding folks even bother.  You could just do LDoN and get your royal attendant armor in half the time and be done with it.  But thanks for trying to trivialize something that really is a major concern for the non-raiding playerbase, which incedentally outnumbers the raiders by a fair margin.</div></div><hr />

That'd be neat ... there's no point it being fully re-iterated for the nth time this week.  But it's 1492/51 * ~110 min per adventure, for them that ain't got the real good shinies yet.  And if yer friends list is sparse, it's quite likely longer.<br />

Unless Frodlin is tanking, in which case you can net about 600 points in an hour.<br />

I find this line of reasoning interesting.  If 70ish people formed up into six man groups to do LDoN missions, we'd have 11 groups and some extras.  If all 11 groups did LDoN missions at the same time for 1.5 hours you would have the exact same man hours expended as you mention for the raid and at the end you might have a handle full of people with an additional +5 augment here and there and not much else.

<br />
You can't look at the net manhours and the individual reward.  If 11 groups did one LDoN mission you would have 3366 total LDoN points, or enough to buy roughly 2.25 pieces of top loot.  By that metric the loot per hour is slightly lower for groups than the raid in the example, which is understandible thanks to the much lower requirements to do it (only need to put together one group).  Of course some raids have better loot/hour than that and some have worse, and in LDoN you get to pick your loot, where on raids you take what you get.  Anyhow, it's hard to make a direct comparison, but 1 loot a month for an every day raider isn't an unusual rate unless you are in a guild that raids a LOT and you can certainly get that much in LDoN if you work at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reasons that raiders are not gearing up in LdoN is that they had better gear before it came out and there is better gear to get with more difficulty and more rewards per hour per person.<br />
<br />
Due to the ease of LdoN missions, there security and being able to chose your reward per time invested they should have more hours played per upgrade, though I agree the items should be a bit better than what they are atm. Why would the harder to do thing reward less often?<br />
<br />
When comparing worthwhile rewards you need to put a similar time in to both raiding and LdoN to get an upgrade.<br />
------------------------------<br />
crystalmatrix, While you personally may see an upgrade every 2 raids others and my self would not see one in nearly that much time. Considering that most mobs drop 2 loots, if youre in a raid of 70 you will get an upgrade every 35 kills or so on average.</div></div><hr />

It would be nice to know when to expect some of this stuff. Until I see a more definite timetable or see some of these things implements, I'd tend to say that many of these promises from Sony aren't worth the photons generated by my monitor. Promises are cheap. I want to see some of this stuff actually implemented. While it's not really near my top 10 things I'd like to see, increasing the drag corpse radius is something that should take one of their developers about 3 minutes to implement (if he stops to drink a can of soda while changing the 1 or 2 digits in the number). what do you think the odds are of seeing a minor change like that in the next patch? A friend of mine plays a VahShir beastlord who's spent the past 8 months or so trying to be able to shrink his warder. This also is something that should be a simple number change fix. Sony is aware of this problem and have said they are going to fix it. They have just decided not to spend the 3 minutes of time to fix it. Right now, there's not a whole lot that Sony can say to convince me of anything. I actually want to see some action. How long does it take for them to make another set of Plate/Chain/Leather/Silk armor that's has 10-15% stat improvements over the current 1492 armors (and maybe even adding INT to the INT casters silk armors)? Then come up with a price and  add them to the LDoN vendor. That's maybe a days worth of work. When will we see this stuff added?</div></div><hr />

So a lot of the current Tak armour will be easier to get (because of increased point earnings per adventure) but it will probably be made obsolete by the level change and that is why they are adding higher cost stuff.  <br />
<br />
I hope the amount of points awarded for a level 70 normal LDoN is over 150 adventure points and the level 70 hards are worth at least 300 points because I can't see many people doing a level 70 hard if the difficulty scales up like it does between level 60 and 65 missions currently.  I imagine a level 70 hard adventure will have mobs that are are doing something like 1.5k to 2k damage per hit so it really will require a huge gear upgrade for non-time equiped people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I apperciate your willingness to admit that LDoN gear is subpar compared to raid loot even that loot from previous expansions.  To hear some people talk, allowing non-raiders faster access to LDoN armor will completely trivialize raider efforts since they have to work so hard for their gear.  But they're working hard for superior gear.  Not equal.  Therefore raider objections to progress in LDoN shouldn't really exist, because if LDoN is faster for everyone, then raiders can also reap rewards there faster.  And if they find the rewards from raiding to still be superior, which I have every reason to expect they will, then they'll just continue raiding.  Their objections with regards to non-raiders getting equal gear to raiders is moot.  The gear isn't equal.  It's no where near equal.  And the fact that non-raiders can get it at all would be the slap in the face that raiders complain about if in fact it was equal.  It's not a slap in the face if non-raiders acquire it so slowly that they really shouldn't have a reasonable expectation of acquiring it at all, is that the issue?  That doesn't really make a great deal of sense now does it?</div></div><hr />

I'll admit this has some validity, except you don't also include the fact that it depends on where you're raiding as well.  For example, my understanding is that PoTime, once you get there, has a much higher loot/hour value than any zone before it.  So to claim that once you get to PoTime that loot is slow and difficult isn't really accurate I believe.  You've mastered the tricks, you've done all the previous content, now you really reap the benefits and from what I read the benefits are huge.  At no time do non-raiders get their loot/hour bumped up like this.  They're still going to have the same ratio for as long as they do LDoN.

<br />
People doing an LdoN have the choice of what to get with there points raiders do not have that choice they are confined to the items that drop not to mention that it is far harder to get 70 people together and have them function as a unit. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
Their objections with regards to non-raiders getting equal gear to raiders is moot. The gear isn't equal. It's no where near equal.

That doesn't really make a great deal of sense now does it?<br />
<br />
If the gear is so good that it gives an equable level of gear to raid gear it would be out of balance, if can be gotten real fast then it is also out of balance. Way to get loot has to have some resistance to make it a chalange.<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
Actually Brutul, to get those 3366 total LDoN points, or enough to buy roughly 2.25 pieces of loot you as an individual would not need to put together one group, but rather 66 groups. 66 successful groups no less. A far more arduous task than raiders are willing to admit.<br />
<br />
If you want to talk about the difficulty to acquire a piece of gear raiding would be far harder for a person to get an item of gear.<br />

For example, my understanding is that PoTime, once you get there, has a much higher loot/hour value than any zone before it.

<br />
<br />
That is way off actually, a guild that has just started in to time will wipe a lot and not make it to the farther areas depending on how far you go and when you need to restart it (your on a time limit if you fail you need to re-clear some) your loots per hour will be around what they are for other raids and maybe a bit less if your not lucky. As an example my guild had 2 mistakes on P1 on 2 back to back tries (someone clicked in before we were ready and we timed out with 1 item rotting) and one of the groups was under healers and wiped), so we spent 2 hours total clearing, prob half an hour each time buffing and making groups per try and an hour waiting between. All that time for 3 loot items with 50 people there that was 200 total man hours for 3 items or 66 hours per drop.<br />
<br />
Those that can clear all of time and make fairly good time and still have P1-3 be upgrades are the winners they do get lots of loot per hour but soon after you get to that level the lower phase loots start rotting. So the upper guilds are only getting about 12 drops for 4 6 hours with 72 other people or about 30 man-hours per drop.<br />
<br />
Not to mention zones like VT that are major time sinks.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
At no time do non-raiders get their loot/hour bumped up like this. They're still going to have the same ratio for as long as they do LDoN. There is no &quot;big carrot&quot; waiting at the end to really keep them going.<br />
<br />
The big carrots in LdoN are the drops from the named mobs, they do drop them and they are nice esp. the ones in hards and the hard mobs are not really hard.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Edit: In fact I would argue that the loot/hour ratio for LDoN should be somewhat higher than raiding because of two reasons. The first being that the gear is inferior to raid gear. And the second being that LDoN never has a big bump in the ease at which you acquire gear, unlike raiding.<br />

As said before you do get the big bumps in gear, the effort you need to put forward is lower and you have a variable reward.</div></div><hr />

Gob, we're going to have to agree to disagree.  You have your opinion, I have mine.  I'm not changing your mind.  You're not changing my mind.  But the big difference between us is that you find the way you play to currently be rewarding enough to continue to pay your monthly subscription and it seems probable, correct me if I'm wrong, that you'll continue doing so for the foreseeable future.  I on the other hand do not find the way I play to be rewarding enough to continue to pay my monthly subscription.  I'm not alone in that.  SoE can listen to you, and forego my contribution to their bottom line, that's their decision to make.  Or they can listen to me and people like me and not only keep your contribution to their bottom line, but regain mine as well.  It really comes down to being that simple.  And continued arguements won't change that.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps.  Or maybe it's that up until recently raiders were the most vocal about the problems.  Or maybe it's just easier for SoE to recognize the problems raiders are facing.

the risk/time between the 2 is out of balance.<br />
<br />
the difference being i know in 30 missions i will get a peice of armor. with ornate it's 30 min to still waiting to win a random.<br />
<br />
defintly not a player vs. player thing. but gear vs. gear for that lvl. the only raid peice i can think of would be bp's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know whats coming with this expansion: Bugsbugsbugsbugs, incomplete content, broken quests, pretty much non existing cs (that we pay for)... the list goes on.  Bottom line is most people who haven't played for 4+ years are going to get it just for the purpose of gaining 5 more levels.  Which to me isn't worth the price of toilet paper.  Like I said, that's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.<br />
<br />
  Then your earlier post was incorrect. You just don't think it's worth the money, it's not that you think it's not an expansion. I understand now, and frankly, I agree. Until I see better, I assume the same thing about OoW. Plenty of threads on that, however. <br />
<br />
  I see this as promising. It's very hard to be swept off your feet if you weren't there at the summit, but everything I've read by most of the people that went has been very optimistic. I'll wait and see.</div></div><hr />

They didn't come up with any ideas to fix the destroyed economy on the servers, Quests that still don't work, not to mention the New engine they put out that still doesn't fully work correctly. This game caters to the Uber guilds in the game who prevent everyone else.<br />
<br />
The things you said Raaj and the way you say it to be honest almost sounds like SOE payed you off.The list of things are so out in left field and off base of what needs to be adressed that anyone who can't see that deserves what this game will get them, while the rest of us, who know what the truth is from being there for 5 years, seeing all the poor quality, slam bam, get it on the market and let the players deal with it mentality. Personally I give Kudos to Blizzard for their developing policies. Its pretty bad when World of Warcraft in it's 1st beta is so far more stable then Everquest is in 5 years.<br />

(When SOE wants to correct a problem, easy way is to just create a spell for it i.e. Summon companion to correct pathing issues)<br />

My gear went through a pretty amazing transformation over the last year and a half or so.   When PoP came out, I was in a mix of Fierce Heraldic and some VT gear.   <br />
<br />
At the time my gear was pretty good compared to others.  When PoP came out, I raided and raided and raided.   I got a smattering of a little upgrade here and there, but I didnt' take really any upgrades until Elemental Armor.   Then came Time and the upgrades flowed, and still do.<br />
<br />
Now it took 7 months of raiding, backflagging, backflagging, racing guilds, blowing, wiping, wasting evenings, learning, mastering... hell 21 days straight sitting in tactics learning the RZ encounter.    The point was that it took one hell of a long time before I or many of my guildmates received a &quot;return on investment&quot;.   <br />
<br />
There isn't always &quot;immediate gratification&quot; on an investment of time.   In other words, you fail, fail, fail, succeed, move to the next, etc.  After a rather substantial chunk of time, you get your return.   It's not much different than had you done something similar to me in terms of time spent.   If you'd spent the time I've spent raiding, doing LDoN/GoD, we'd be at a similar place.   Clearly I'd have better gear (about 1kish more hp, better aggro, a a nice chunk more AC), and you'd have significantly more AA's/Augments, since I don't get a &quot;side benefit&quot; of good exp while raiding since the raid game and the exp game are completely different.<br />
<br />
I use the &quot;Delayed Gratification with greater risk yields a greater return in a large chunk&quot; model (the raiding game), whereas you use the &quot;Building slowly and steadily produces safer, adequate returns in bite sized chunks&quot; (the non raiding game) model.   <br />
<br />
What I think I'm hearing the most from the &quot;casual gamer&quot; crowd (although it's not necessarily a demographic with anything in common other than &quot;doesn't raid much&quot;) is that they want what I've said was missing from this game for some time.   The concept of hunting for your gear upgrades rather than saving up tiny chunks of currency be it platinum pieces or adventure points to buy something which doesnt' nearly give the same feeling as looting it from a fresh kill, the way the game used to be played.   <br />
<br />
I understand this and have been arguing for it for some time now.  The thing is, this spread between uber and non uber, raider and non raider has been around since day 1 of EQ, but a lot of people won't accept it.<br />
<br />
original EQ:<br />
<br />
Best haste:  Cloak of Flames (Raid), Runed Bolster Belt (Raid), Flowing Black Silk Sash (non raid)<br />
<br />
The differences between those items alone is astounding.<br />
<br />
When planes were added, the difference between a warrior with Indo and one with Crafted/BEBP was astounding.   <br />
<br />
In Kunark, those with VP weapons, Kunark Legs/BP's, Dragon items... were head and shoulders above the rest (I still carry 2 VP weapons with me at all times), hell Plane of Air equipped warriors with Dagas/Belt of 4 winds were gods compared to people with lammies and jade maces.<br />
<br />
In Velious, NToV/sleepers vs. Velketor's Lab Equipped people was staggering.<br />
<br />
VT geared people vs Casual people was again, astounding.<br />
<br />
PoP simply keeps the same model going that's always been around, with one exception... there's CRAP for non visible armor items pre-Elementals that aren't on gods.<br />
<br />
Had SoE kept to it's plans to itemize the lower tiers of PoP, we probably wouldnt' be having this discusssion.<br />
<br />
GoD on the other hand is chock full of goodies that are indeed attainable, it's the best &quot;small group' itemized expansion since Kunark.</div></div><hr />

Here's another little information leak... your source is wrong.   The EQ2 team is a completely different set of people from the EQ Live team.    They dont' work on each others' games, and the postponement had nothing to do with EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>grimmreaper1400</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">This is just SOE eye candy bullshit.  I'm in one of those Qvic raiding guilds.  And i can tell you GOD sucks from start to finish. Horrible design, laced with loot better *a little* then time.  Trials 7 - 13 are the exact same, with different mobs. The lay out is the Exact same.  Just like the melee enhancements, SOE threw eyecandy out there and everyone bought it, and yet they never fixed the *real* taunt button.  People still think it fails way too often, and more so on higher con'ed mobs.  But incite is kewl , haha, so is a bow and arrow, cuz thats all its good for, just shorter range.<br />
<br />
I agree OoW should be free update to Gates of Sux.  But SOE has been a money grabber since they bought EQ from Varant.  Lvl 70 is a way for YOU, the players, to fix their fuck ups.  They have made a million excuses why lvl 70 was in the concept.  But how many remember them saying &quot;we will never raise the lvl cap again&quot;  /cong introduction of aa.  They missed the boat again,  PEOPLE THAT 1) casual 2) too busy raiding to grind, are SICK of it.  GOD aa cost 175% more then they should have.  How many of you think Sturdiness should have been that expensive?  Yep i am like you i bought it, but was rather upset about it.<br />
<br />
Heh i see them scrambling to keep uber guilds playing.  Nothing they due, short of refunding and deleting GOS*ux* will bring them back.  SOE has short changed ALL players for far too long.  I am among the masses in saying, that this summit, was a joke.  At any time you actually believe SOE will do as they say, then your im sorry, but your prolly new to the game.<br />
<br />
I feel totally, for the &quot;casual&quot; people.  They never IMHO got a say in anything in this &quot;summit&quot;.   The Tradeskillers have gotten screwed since the game came out, and POP (rare drop land). GOD (super rare drop, but its ok, cuz the combines are worse then lvl twinkage gear).  Tradeskillers should be blasting SOE with /feedbacks, and emails.  SO much work/cost, for garbage i wouldnt sell to a tribute master, or put on a lvl 1 rog twink.  And lastly.  Quests.  Well EQ has failed at almost every quest they have ever put out.  Either they yield junk rewards, or bugged, or takes zergness to do.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the Epic 2.0.8.7.9, I sent SOE and email, asking for an explanation of how they came up with how its epic.  How in the hell can they call someone epic quality, if they are dependant on others to get?  Doesnt that make their zergness epic?  Make the fuckin quest solo doable.  Then that person is truely epic, and omg, it gives them something to do BESIDES mindnumbing grinding.<br />
<br />
Summit should have at least covered *for the warriors side*<br />
1) split hybrids and warriors farther,  make each unique, dont clump them in the same slots.<br />
2) fix the fuckin taunt,  incite is a toy, nothing more, move along, your comments dont work, cuz you obviously dont play a warrior.<br />
4)Quests, of good rewards (make em long), yield good rewards.<br />
5) Tradeskills, how many horses do people got to beat to death before somebody wakes up.<br />
6) Epic is not epic if its bought, zerged by a guild, sorry, call it a guild tool, but its not epic.<br />
7) Adventures should cover all types of players. casusal, hardcore, partime.  Yes the end results should equal the same.  If i raid and get loot once a week, and a casual player LDON or whatever for a month, His ass has earned that loot.  I got no problem with that.  Its the supressors that complain about them never seeing 180hp rings and shit.  Why?  You feel better claiming 12k hps, and they only can hit 6600?<br />
8) Raise the warrior only loot, i mean jesus.  Hopebringer has dropped for my guild 32 times.  Dark blade of the warlord has 8 times.  Yeah thats about fair!  Cudgel hasnt dropped 32 times, it around 18 i think.<br />
9) Spells, although this isnt a warrior subject (unless you count bellow), wtf is up with no drop?  Yeah killing a mob, all of a sudden teaches me how to cast a new spell.  LAME~!<br />
10) Grinding........ LVL 70 is bs, we grinding to fix their fuck up.  AA's its like endurance,  we all know its just mana witha  different name.<br />
11) OoW must not be like GOD, with duck taped zones, or zones that are the exact same.  What a rip off that is.<br />
12) Guild tools. haha, yeah this will get used as much as the lfg tool ,,,, never.<br />
13) At least give OoW a decent storyline.  I mean no one realy follows them but come on.  PoP had a great storyline, and well GOS*ux* is :  we found these cave people, and well we just threw a bunch of shit together , but um, its got loot better than time, so you better hurry up and get here.<br />
14)  Keys, flags, trials.   Yeah, people are excited about this concept.  I think the thrill went out back in OS.  But as usual it takes SOE 3 to 4 yrs to figure that out.<br />
<br />
I have informed my guild, that if &quot;Omens of prolly wasting your $&quot;, is anything like Gates of Sux, then i am done with EQ.  There are many good games out, or comming out, and if soe cant wake the fuck up, then like many other people , casual and hardcore.  It aint worth it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">This argument is all about human nature. It's a known fact that humans, in general, respond best to occasional, random rewards. They respond decently, but less well, to a guaranteed reward. Humans will even react better to the randomized reward system if the random reward is LESS than the sure thing. Why do you think people gamble? Why do you think casinos rake in so much money?<br />
<br />
  LDoN is a sure route towards upgrades. You WILL get them if you put enough effort forth. Raiding, and to a lesser extent random drops, are NOT a sure thing. It depends on luck, both of the mob dropping the item you want and you getting it. If LDoN and raid/dropped items were equal, people would prefer raid/dropped items path. Because raiding gives substantially better per item rewards than LDoN, people will definitely see raiding as the better option. Another reason is because raiding tends to change scenery more often than doing LDoN after LDoN after LDoN. Finally, raiding takes less individual effort for the random raid member (you can afk in a raid without throwing everything off, but you can't at ALL in a LDoN).<br />
<br />
  Obviously, these aren't the only thing that impact the game. But seriously, this is the way people react. Think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I agree.  No dispute.  SoE has failed miserably to provide people with the gratification of actually looting their gear off something they kill for the non-raid environment.<br />
<br />
Best haste: Cloak of Flames (Raid), Runed Bolster Belt (Raid), Flowing Black Silk Sash (non raid)<br />
<br />
Yes, but in Kunark there was also the RBG out of Sebilis, not as good as a CoF, not as good as a RBB, but still a reasonably decent haste item for the non-raider.  I happen to think the gear difference these days is much like you suggest above.  Raiders get CoFs, non-raiders get stuck with FBSSs.  And the content is more properly designed for something inbetween.  You're overgeared for most content I could hope to see, and I tend to be undergeared without a similar time investment in the game to what you've invested to still be less well geared.  Your path offers greater rewards yet the &quot;time&quot; expected to be given to the game is similar.  I'm no longer willing to accept that.  Decrease the time element for my lesser rewards or expect me not to pay for the privilege of playing.<br />
<br />
GoD on the other hand is chock full of goodies that are indeed attainable, it's the best &quot;small group' itemized expansion since Kunark.<br />
<br />
You've said this more than once.  And while I believe you believe it, I'm not sure I trust your evaluation of my ability to succeed in that environment with my character.  And frankly at this point in time the aggravation v. reward in the game in general doesn't make me optimistic.  After all you consider a LDoN easy mission a walk in the park, while I consider it moderately fraught with peril depending on who I happen to group with.  You have a huge buffer in your character for circumstances gone awry or the mistakes of others.  I don't.  You get a 5 pull in LDoN easy and you pop AET, furious, then defensive and stand there grinning.  I get a 5 pull in LDoN easy and even if I do the same, I'm probably visiting my bind point.  Yet you suggest that my moving on to GoD is a viable step.  I'm dubious.  Particularly after hearing that in fact GoD was designed for level 70s and wasn't rescaled when they yanked level 70 from the expansion.   I suspect I might possibly do okay in GoD, if I had a team backing me up I trusted implicitly, but I don't have that luxury in the game any more.  And I'm not liable to reobtain it in any kind of reasonable time frame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">GoD single group encounters are more like mini-raids for the casual crowd.  It is necessary due to the ease of gear that is obtainable.  It is no different than LDoN Hard is actually quite difficult, but because you can just keep on do it (and very quickly if you're willing to eat losses) until you do manage to kill the named, it obviously has to be reasonably hard.<br />
<br />
In response to the problem with Qvic loot, since when have you obtain loot way better than previous endgame loot on a zone that's obviously designed for farming so you can get through Inktuta, which isn't even the last zone or even the second to last zone.  Just as EP gear wasn't all that better than VT gear, Qvic gear only exists to help you get through Inktuta and possibly Txevu.  The true upgrades will be in Tacvi, or at least ought to be.<br />
<br />
In response to the mastermind plan that involves EQ and EQ2 in some kind of conspiracy, I wonder where people get these weird ideas about gaming company's business model.  I'm sure in SoE headquarters they have a list of every important event in the world from battle in Iraq to a new patch in FF11 so they'll know when to release a new patch or when to pay off a guildleader to counter the effects of that event.  Then again these are the people that claim no one is playing EQ anymore even though the pictures taken at SoE sure don't seem like there's any less people on the servers, and I guess they're probably the people who believe that console games sacrifice graphics for good game play because obviously the company tells a game's story writer or the game engine designer to learn how to model 3D graphics instead of sticking to their area of expertise.<br />
<br />
It'd be such an easier world if most people would just accept that you, like me, have absolutely no idea how most business even worked, and that you have not seen the light but rather you are just one of the pawns that the evil whatevers are laughing at your stupidity for falling for their grand plan to control the gaming world.  If there is a conspiracy, the evil whatevers aren't so dumb to make it so that any retired/disgruntled EQ player can see through it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">The difference is, in pre kunark days you could save up platinum and purchase a CoF/RBG/FBSS.  Can you buy a Earring of Corporeal Esscense or Helm of Flowing Time? Not very damn likely.    The upgrade choices for non-raiders are pathetic in EQ.  Every expansions increases the disparity, mostly due to the &quot;NO DROP&quot; flag.<br />
<br />
Risk v Reward is a long dead concept in EQ, I'd like to think it left with Brad McQuaid but I think it was gone even before Sigil was formed.  Raids are more risky?  Puuuhleeeze, there is little risk to raiding in this game these days.. You *cannot* lose your corpse and gear anymore, Hello Shadowrest!  All of the XP lost from completely looting a couple of your own corpses can be made up in less than an hour if you have KT/Elemental access.  The raid vs casual argument is just bullshit nowadays. <br />
<br />
You know what risk was? Risk was zoning into fearplane at level 48, with 30 other fools and wiping out thanks to a scareling train and then attempting to re-break in using summoned swords and armor you got off of the drybones circling the fear portal. That was risk.   Now everything is a 15 minute rez session, mass buffs, and a 2nd try at a_loot_piggy_bank#23.  All with 71 of your closest friends!<br />
<br />
  They dropped the ball big time not inviting some average players to help discuss these issues about the game. 50 guildleaders/fansites was free publicity for SOE. They could have been collecting much more pertinent data at Fan Faires where literally hundreds of average players show up.  Not that raid guilds shouldn't have a say too in the game, but they (as has been posted here) are not a represtative majority.  Its a shame $OE doesn't see this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Several thoughts.<br />
<br />
First, concerning this summit, I agree with Kailyn's assessment in post #77 of this thread. From a game design point of view, high-level guilds and players are a point of pressure--content has to be developed that both gives them more to do and is attractive enough that serious players will want to do it. It has to take long enough to complete that the design people have a chance to come up with the next thing. And, it has to be done in such a way that it doesn't completely bork the game economy or mechanics. It seems natural to me that this sort of summit would start with those players. How, really, could SOE start anywhere else?<br />
<br />
Second, top players and casual players are in this together. Unless SOE makes the game fun for a variety of players, then some groups of players will simply stop playing. If that happens, declining revenue will make improvements for the remaining players economically difficult to justify by a publicly traded company. Thus, it seems logical to me that SOE be interested in dealing with casual players' concerns, and from what I can tell at the very least the feedback at the summit and from various class sites must have impressed this upon SOE (and this site was not alone among class sites where casual-player issues came up. I suspect that the spontaneous eruption of these concerns from many different sources would be as attention-getting as any single arguments about specific issues.)<br />
<br />
Third, casual players and top players are in this together. Yep, I said it twice. Arguments in this thread about how long it would take a casual player like me to get great gear in LDoNs if I were in a large guild and geared to tank hard LDoNs and never had to rely on pick-up groups and never had to spend 30 minutes waiting to fill out a group and could put in the same amount of time doing adventures as serious players put in raiding --- lol, well, these arguments are simply not applicable to my situation. Likewise, for me personally a low drop rate on some GoD uberpointything01 is, to put it mildly, of no consequence at all. But I can certainly see why it would be a serious matter for someone who repeatedly and at great risk kills the mob that drops the uberpointything01 yet never sees the drop. Particularly if the drop rates for items needed by various classes is not kept in line, entire guilds could stall out trying to get one class the gear it needs for the guild to take on the next level of content, which, uh, would suck, to put it mildly.<br />
<br />
Fourth, I understand that Ixess has some reason to be angry with SOE, but saying that Raaj sounds like he's been paid off is so blatantly offensive that if it weren't so utterly absurd I would have had to pull out the profanity stick and thumped you with it, Ixess. A civil person would apologize.<br />
<br />
Finally, it seems to me that on several issues there is widespread agreement here:<br />
1. Some game mechanics elements need a lot of work, particularly the collision system. Other issues such as the failure rate of taunt against higher-level mobs could become much more critical if the level cap is raised to 70. A serious overhaul of the way in which game mechanic changes and expansions are tested would be extremely helpful. Many of these issues are well-known, long standing, and should be examined sooner rather than later. I doubt any of this is news to SOE, but still.<br />
<br />
2. Some kind of tuning of LDoN augments and point system. In particular, many people here strongly that some means of removing-and-saving or trading in augments would greatly reduce player frustration.<br />
<br />
3. There are a number of progression issues, such as flagging/back flagging, that are frustrating for a lot of players. Expansions that have a trial that is more difficult than the content it unlocks are frustrating for many players. I suspect that backflagging-like issues are a pain for guild leadership too--either your guild works hard to get players flagged only to see those players jump to a more uber guild, or the Uber guild finds itself continually re-doing old content just to keep a good supply of vital classes around. Or your small guild simply can't do such a big raid and getting an alliance worked out with another small guild and getting everyone's casual schedule set up becomes a nighmare.<br />
<br />
4. Very very few quests work in this game. I'm not just talking about bugged quests; a quest that works 1) is possible to do by a character who can use the reward given if the quest is completed, 2) Offers a reward that is in-line with the time it takes to complete the quest, and 3) is fun and cool to do and not simply some mind-numbing green camp for rare mob that rarely drops the thingy you need or a difficult camp that involves the questing player convincing large numbers of friends to spend hours camping or fighting mobs for a trivial reward.<br />
<br />
5. Instanced content should seriously be examined as a way to expand some aspects of the game. Obviously, poorly designed instanced content won't really help.<br />
<br />
6. Most folks agree that there has always been, is now, and should be a great deal of difference between the power of top characters and those who do not have the top gear. The wider the gap (and this gap would get wider with a level 70 cap), the more helpful it would be to have content with graduated difficulty. Graduated difficulty here is related to #5 above.<br />
<br />
Okay, I was going to add that tradeskills have been seriously shortchanged over time, and that some resources need to be put into providing tradeskillers with useful things to make. But, heh, not sure everyone agrees with me there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">The things you said Raaj and the way you say it to be honest almost sounds like SOE payed you off. <br />
<br />
I've been paid off because I choose to believe in a company that impressed the hell out of me this weekend? Alright...Don't get it twisted - if SoE had dropped the ball at this meeting I would have no problem telling you that. The fact is though that this weekend was a great step foreward. Don't believe me? Why is everyone who was there saying the exact same things?<br />
<br />
Anyway, for the rest of you guys who dont have your &quot;bags packed&quot; -  we do have a batphone to the developers ears now. They're listening to the community and it's a good thing. . Keep up the good suggestions on this board like you always have.</div></div><hr />

The game is broken, i play in a family guild, every expansion, every major patch we tend to loose ppl, not to other guilds, they just quit.<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP Launch it was like 6-8 ppl who were frustrated because of the whole flagging thingy.<br />
LoY wasnt really an expansion, same for LDoN.<br />
GoD hasn't even been purchased by most of my guildies.<br />
DX9 Patch drove away like 10%  of my Playerbase, they are just unable to play EQ from one day to another and add another 5% of my guildmates to that because they don't feel like Beta Testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
SoE did throw crap on us and they do that since Luclin was launched and now we should forgive them all that because they did invite 50 of the leaders of the biggest guilds?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">Thanks for taking some of the issues up for us Raaj. Sounds like it was a good time and some good ideas coming from it. I probably will not buy the new expansion still for a while but that just because I have not done much in a few of the last expansions so I am willing to wait on this one to see if I will really have any use or guildies to go there with. At this point i would probably send them back LoY and GoD but only because I am happy with my guild and we spend little time if any in those areas. Maybe will be in GoD a little more soon but I could have put off buying it for 6 months maybe, I imagine that's how this expansion will be. For me the expansions lately have been for a few kewl features then waiting until we progress to where it's actually somewhere we go.  I'm ready to see what ideas they go with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Ixess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">&lt;SoE did throw crap on us and they do that since Luclin was launched and now we should forgive them all that because they did invite 50 of the leaders of the biggest guilds?

<br />
Exactly. Kind of the old groomed/handpicked feel to it.<br />
<br />
Another point is this. and BTW I stand corrected on the Dev team statement in last post:<br />
<br />
Unless you are in an Uber guild, you, dear player will never see alot of the things in EQ.For if this were true, it would not force those out there to even concider www.mysupersales.com. <br />
<br />
When there are issues its generally those guilds that SOE listens to, and the casual player who will never be able to earn enough DKP's etc due to work and RL issues will always fall short and will generally never reach that point.<br />
<br />
And yes the high end of EQ takes those guilds to do it, thats the point, to which this game has become geared to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">When there are issues its generally those guilds that SOE listens to<br />
<br />
Then SoE needs to wise up and listen to a larger cross section of their player base or continue to alienate those who aren't in raid guilds and don't particularly care to play a game that is tailored primarily to raid guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry if you don't agree, but being there and listening to these people they invited speak - they did not make a mistake in who they invited. Some of the brightest EQ players were there. Yes, they were mostly level 65 raiders...there was also a handful who didn't have characters over level 60.<br />

If it isn't mebbe there should be one, and perhaps a heavily moderated one, at that.<br />
<br />
Even if the bulk of the first Summit invitees were hardcore raiders, that's a good place to start.  Many of them, as with Raaj, are in touch enough with their own class community to have a sense of how the rest of us play - even if they don't exactly how it is for us, any more than we know exactly how it is for them.  The *top* is a good a place to start looking as any, especially with another expansion around the corner that may need considerable revision.  Changes in game philosophy can, and do, trickle downwards significantly more than they will propogate upwards.<br />
<br />
Online gaming is finally starting to really shift in ways that have been intimated for a couple of years - more of us are parents or in the thick of our careers (mebbe both), we want more from our game time, shifts in tech and in game mechanic design, there are many factors coming to a head - and SOE appears to be reacting to this.  Mebbe with the benefit of hindsight, but still they are listening and reacting; it's truly as tho a different company is running the joint since I signed on.  They're reaching out and beginning what may be the most notable community/developer exchanges in online gaming, and if they follow up on this they are to be commended for coming around so well.<br />
<br />
If they drop the ball now, shame on them, but things do look good at the moment. Especially following positive changes in the game and their community stance (ignoring Dx9 buggage atm).  Even if, in the end, I am not compelled to renew my account, its still a good thing to see.

I like the idea of a SOE ran and moderated forum for addressing issues much more than SOE deciding who gets a voice and who does not.

Actually, it sounds like you have a batphone and all we can do is try to make our issues clear enough to you in the hopes that you will relay them to the devs. I'm not claiming that you are/will ignore our concerns, it's just that there's still another filter between us and them. If we have concerns about the game, we need to convince you that those concerns are worthy enough to be relayed to your batphone.<br />

I do appreciate that you guys have posted your ideas clear up to this point, and hope you continue to do so. The thing you need to keep in mind is...I do not just read this thread, or this section of the board. Even when I posted asking for people's ideas for the Summit, I added even more from the other forums that were brought up here or there. I didn't filter anything that wasn't filtered by logic of the other posters (and even some of that I left some conflicting view points in the notes I gave them). I cannot promise that anything gets a response though. They'll address things the way they always have, and a forum would be like advertising a dev response to any  question you wanted answered -- and that's just not the case.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">One more thing about ldon.  What if there was only 1 encounter you could do to upgrade your gear via raiding?  Wouldn't that be extremely boring?  Well - telling the non-uber raiders to go the current ldon route is pretty much the same thing.  Sure, the graphics are different, but it's the same thing over and over and over and over...<br />
<br />
Aby,<br />
You and I share the same sentiment. Now, I was a raider for a while and due to a job change, I became a casual player. I now have to play during the day which means, A) move to a Euro server (hence, leaving the friends I've made) to raid, B) find a euro guild to raid with, or C) go LDoN to upgrade my gear. Well, I am EP flagged and was fortunate enough to have really good equipment but I would much rather raid then do 30+ hours of repetative LDoNs for a single piece. Not to mention the Augs to put in them. I have been on both sides of the fence my fellow players and I can say that the casual gamer really doesn't have a lot of options in EQ if they want premier loot. I know the arguement I will hear; &quot;you don't deserve it if you don't put in the time&quot; but that argument doesn't hold up. The uber player spends say 25 hours a week raiding and gets a new item that is really nice. I spend 25 hours doing anything in EQ at the group or two-group level and I can assure you that nothing I could kill would drop a comparable item. Quest are included in this because many require a rare spawn which the casual player will have a very hard time getting. Just food for thought... <br />
<br />
It was also stated above about the failing of the game to accommodate human nature. I totally agree with that insightful observation. I would rather hunt down a mob and chance it not having my item then going through the LDoN and knowing the reward (at least for everything on my toon). My favorite time in EQ was level 40-50 in places like SoL with 6 of my friends. It was nice and intimate, and I could count on them. It was more casual and maybe it was a safer hunt, although I recall dying plenty. It just seems like everything now requires 40 people and a key that requires 30. I feel that alternate routes should be available for keys, maybe that take a single group or a solo quest. Even if it takes a while it would help the casual player and the big guilds that don't want to back-flag everyone. I thought the saying was &quot;all roads lead to Rome,&quot; not &quot; There's only one road to Rome.&quot; I know that means more development time and programming but they claim to want the game to endure and hold out against new MMORG's, so why not invest the time now for details like this and put forth a quality product.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the summit,<br />
I am very excited about Sony/EQ listening to the players. Although I am apprehensive to trust them, I feel this is a big step. In order to make money a company does have to fulfill the need or desire of its customers. This is a step in that direction. I hope they do bring life back to EQ and I hope they add some OVERDUE casual encounters they can keep from getting exploited. My life has changed and I no longer can play EQ like I once did, but my passion for the game has not. I see no reason why I should be denied the experience of holding a truly nice item just because I couldn't find 40 players to go get it with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Guess what Khumak, if you can tank a hard LDoN to get that 105 points, you probably aren't really hurting for the armor you could buy with said points.  If the LDoN armor is that big of an upgrade for you, you probably can't tank a hard adventure unless you have a really skilled and really well balanced group backing you up (and maybe not even then).  And unless you bring your group with you, you sure as hell aren't going to get a group, get them all herded into the adventure zone, and complete the mission in 60 minutes.  Average time expenditure is going to be more like 1.5-2  hours and if groups are scarce or one of the retards you're forced to group with does something stupid and kills the group could be much longer, which brings our estimation of how long it takes to get each piece of armor back up to 30-40 hours per piece of armor.  <br />
<br />
Well obviously your level of gear and the types of groups you do the adventures with are going to influence whether you do a hard or easy mission and how fast you complete them.  I was giving a timeframe for how fast I get LDON points.  This is not with guild only groups, this is with random people that invite me when I put LFG up.  Sure, I have reasonably good gear so that makes them easier for me but when I look through the leaderboard at the top hard LDON winners on my server I see primarily unguilded or friends and family guilded players with zero access to raid loot other than pickup raids.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, the ability to successfully do hard LDONs has much more to do with having all the needed roles filled and having people work together than it does about what gear they wear.  If you get in a crappy group then yeah you might fail.  So do a normal one instead...  <br />
<br />
IMO the hard LDONs are actually MORE beneficial to you the worse your gear is because not only can you get points if you win, you can get upgrades off of the named mobs that are near VT caliber.  I have several casual gamer friends who farmed the shit out of hard LDON and are fully decked out in a mix of dropped and bought LDON gear and augs.  Many of them went in fully intending to fail the missions, their goal being to knock off the named mobs for their loot and then go again.<br />
<br />
As for reward for time spent on raids vs LDON, I said the frequency was better for LDON not the quality.  I put more time on a per upgrade basis than a casual gamer would devoting the same time to LDON as I devote to raids.  When I do get my loot though, it's higher quality.  That said, you can still get to very respectable levels of AC and HPs with just LDON gear when compared to EP loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">So do a normal one instead... <br />
<br />
Khumak, I have about a one third failure rate on normals.  I wouldn't step into a hard with a pick up group unless I had reason to believe that every single person in the group was on the ball and knew what they were doing.  Getting that kind of feeling from a random selection of 5 other people you've never seen before just isn't in the cards.  I think that maybe your level of gear is also tending to make you see things as a little easier than they are for the average Joe Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>MasterB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">EQ is a sold as a Massive Multi Online Role Playing Game.<br />
Multi Massive assumes its a game for a vide variety of people.<br />
Online it is.<br />
Roleplaying Game I guess its called because you can do quests.<br />
Still people buy this game for so many other reasons that it would be impossable to print em all here.<br />
We are all under the same roof and have grudgingly been playing this game together for over 4 years now.<br />
Now it seems a large player base has left the game.<br />
I can say that during these years in game I played I seen people leave for all kinda reasons, marriage, bad economy (outa EQ abuse I'm certain many of them), shifting intrests in life and GF/BF's that has prohibited their partner from playing anymore. But during the last 6 month I lost tons of friends from EQ for all new reasons... First I lost friends coz SWG apeared, most of them are back because they very fast realized that there where far more content in EQ than in SWG. Next I lost tons of friends who couldnt play EQ at a steady sanity level, when the new graphix interface was implemented. Their outdated machines couldnt cope and not even SOE's grand offer with the rebated grphx card could help em out. Most of them also stated they be far more intrested in WoW when they get new equipment!?!? Well its their choice. Now I get tells from some friends stating that they think the last expansions sucks so much they feel that a good way to protest against that crap is to terminate their accounts!!!<br />
<br />
I'm no genius, but I can guess that SOE ain't to happy about all people leaving (summit anyone!) and I'm not to happy about it either, so what to do?<br />
<br />
First of all many people refer to what EQ was... to many of the noobs.. havve a few in my guild, it's still that... to them! They have fun running around and do the noob quests they feel the thrill I did when they camp the large orc camp in EC. They dont have any thoughts about if there should be any instanced zones in Plane of Time! They just want to earn their way up in rank and get some uber gear in the end. We lost sight of what the games all about I fear.<br />
Most friends I have left in the game sits on multiple acounts with lvl 65's able to go out and kill all HG's in RM the second they spawn. They have so much plat that buying steads for 131K is mandatory on all chars... They do &quot;charity&quot; work by sometimes dump 10K on noobs if they find them or give them Hi end uber items they have spares of in bank, when they have all their chars twinked to their teeths. The noobs have gotten tutorials (good in my opinion) to hasten their progress up in levels... boat rides have been deleted coz of time constraints for casual players. They dont have to worrie about dieing in the game until lvl 10 and all older players tend to tell all noobs wondering of the high xp zones and venture elsewhere that they are stupid if not going the fastest way to loot and glory. Evrything is counted in DPS (Damage per Second) when putting a grp together for a LDoN. Evrything in EQ has become closer and closer to a game I loath (CS) where it should be instant action from the second you logg on till you camp out. I have changed I bought the whole crapiola I spend hours with people I don't know to get another LDoN upgrade. I have a druid who was in a guild that was almost on its way to the higher planes and they had real military timetables we follwed with all attending from you logged on and until you exhausted /q yourself to the desktop. I was lead to belive the real fun starts when u are 65 and from having a lvl 59 as max lvl for the 4 first years I played I now have a 65 Enchanter with 100's of AA's and ubergear. But am I having fun? After reading through most of the boards linked from EQCasters Realm this morning Im not sure... Most off all Im not sure anyone have fun anymore. Because its all in the new games.. the fun will come in EQ2 or any other fantastic game out there. In the forums Ive read through I seen VERY little help of telling SOE what they could do to improve the game to what we want!!! Do we know WHAT we want?! and even if we knew what we want if we all want different things will it be what the majority wants ? or even what a broad percentage wants ? I dunno...<br />
<br />
Reasons to play EQ for me and what could be done to ensure I will keep on playing...<br />
<br />
The pro: I still havnt been to all zones in the game, far from it. That was what I liked with the game when I started to play it. To explore.<br />
The con. I can't ever visit all places because of flags,keys and need of a major raiding force.<br />
The solution: In my opinion. let the access to these places be easier for a single player to obtain. I't will not tip the scale of the game and visiting a zone like TIME and see it isnt the same as that person ever would be able to gain something from those mobs or even a small guild not well equiped and able to go there anyways is slim if not NIL.<br />
<br />
The pro: Quests was a very rewarding feeling even when it only yielded an item that had limited use (Ro armor for my Paladin) I still quest a lot, hey even the game suggest its an Everquest.<br />
The con: When you done most of the soloable quests and have many chars at a high lvl it is not fun for your friends to help out with single encounters you cant solo so you can obtain the last part needed for a quest or the hours needed to invest on waiting and keeping clear for a spawn.<br />
The solution: Let quests be obtainable by spending more time on the on an alternate route that you can solo. 99% of the people questing dont object and dont feel its a timesink, they are often the players who plays for fun. And also make special quest that are purely for the solists that need more to do ingame.<br />
<br />
The pro: Guild I been in with all my chars have for the most part been where evryone knows eachothers char and alts by heart. even been in a RPG on a server not suited for it. it's interacting with people that should be the real strength of these kinda games.<br />
The con: There havnt been a single attempt to add more content for the guilds.<br />
The solution: Make special abilies available for guilds. Like AA points all member can where a ribbon that shows their afinity. The guildtreasurer gets distribute plat as /guildsplit and even take tributes to the guild treasure and thereby grant long lasting buffs to the contributer. The guildarmorer gets to remove augs and/or distribute special &quot;guildaugs&quot;. The guildrecruiter can guide apliers to instanced guild zones for tests of prowess with their char before they can be granted guildmembership. Well make guilds more personal. Dont have to have a building that is their own for that. Can use the buildings ingame already existing. If another guild moves in Diplomacy or even a guildwar would make interaction between people.<br />
<br />
The pro: Between lvl 1 - 51 I felt that there where a class balance (talking about the casual play, and LDoNs)<br />
The con: When hitting 52 with certain chars it felt like walking into a wall, XP wise, grpwise and soloabiltywise.<br />
The solution: Smooth out the increase of xp needed between the gaps from the old expansions. Make it possible to have more than 6 members in a grp 7 or 8 (all in grp must be off different classes) without going into raidmode then the 4 cornered grp construction (1WAR 1CLR 1ENC 3DPS, I know there are other configs but this is what 90% of the player base on my server finds as the best) would no longer be so rigid that other classes could also get grps. and lastly find a way for non casters and non healers to solo, even after lvl 51.<br />
<br />
Hope my rantings and babblings contain some sort of structure that it could be better summarized and perhaps relayed to SOE through the batphone<br />
Hugz to all people stuck in this game with me hope to see you on the battlefield 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Just a quick note - If that's the same Glatius I knew on  Tarew Marr, I can vouch for the fact he's a good tank. We were guilded together for quite a while. We just chose different paths basically, I joined a &quot;uber guild&quot; he continued in the same path mostly.<br />
<br />
The point he's making about a Hard LDoN and GoD is very valid. It isn't about the ability of the tank most of the time, for he is a very good tank. It's the gear. You're talking bout mobs that hit for over 1k. For someone that may be 7-8k buffed (I'm guessing here) that is painful. Not to mention the fact that the people who are commenting about GoD, have probably got max attack, over 10k hp, and never done a pick-up group with the PoV regulars. Walk a mile in their shoes before telling them how to play.<br />
<br />
You may do an LDoN easy in 30mins or less  (that's my goal post when I do them) but I've got the gear that lets me just train mobs deliberately, because there's no fear of dying.  If someone forced me though, to do LDoN to get myself into some decent gear over and over and over, I think I would claw my eyes out then cancel my account. It's a nice way to get gear. But there needs to be a REAL boss in some of these encounters, that  drops a nice piece of gear. After all, that's the truly rewarding sensation. Clicking the mobs corpse and looting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I was thinking more of a moderated forum here, where we could all discuss stuff without fear of SOE moderating/editing, and we could bat viewpoints back and forth (much as this thread is doing).  Altho an SOE moderated thread could be useful, I have more faith in this group and the contacts (ie: Raaj) from here that could speak for the EQ warriors than I would if the discussions were on an SOE board, and moderated by them.<br />
<br />
I also understand you about SOE picking who speaks for the players, and the filtering, and those are good points.  Mebbe communities could nominate spokespeople next time, or have a *manifesto of concerns* we could present to 'em.  My concern on an SOE board (having scanned the *Warrior Concerns* thread) is that good ideas there would be lost in the shouting.</div></div><hr />

We just chose different paths basically, I joined a &quot;uber guild&quot; he continued in the same path mostly.<br />
<br />
I eventually left RoH and joined Numi and then Pak after Numi.  But neither really ended up being my cup of tea.  I just found the raid game too time intensive and being Warrior number 7 too tedious.  I want to play to have fun, not to constantly have demands placed on my &quot;play&quot; time.  Particularly when all I end up being is a minor cog in a very big machine.  <br />
<br />
For someone that may be 7-8k buffed<br />
<br />
Yeah, I top out at just about 8k when fully raid buffed.  Typically I'll be around 7.5k for a LDoN mission though, since I'm all most certain to be short a buff or two of some kind.<br />
<br />
If someone forced me though, to do LDoN to get myself into some decent gear over and over and over, I think I would claw my eyes out then cancel my account. <br />
<br />
That's basically where I'm at.  I'd rather have a root canal then do LDoN missions on an ongoing basis.  Particularly when I may very well end up dying a time or two if things go wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">Khumak, I have about a one third failure rate on normals.  I wouldn't step into a hard with a pick up group unless I had reason to believe that every single person in the group was on the ball and knew what they were doing.  Getting that kind of feeling from a random selection of 5 other people you've never seen before just isn't in the cards.  I think that maybe your level of gear is also tending to make you see things as a little easier than they are for the average Joe Warrior.<br />
<br />
I think I had around 9k hps when I first started trying hard ldon.  I had a pretty high failure rate on them but it wasn't because we couldn't survive, we just flat out didn't have the DPS to finish in time with random groups.  I focused on the normal missions if I wanted points for winning and just did the hard ones for fun and to kill the named for the drops.  If I got a really good group together then we'd do a hard one for the win and then go back through and finish off any of the named.<br />
<br />
I know quite well though how frustrating it is not to have the gear to do your job.  I transfered servers at level 54 back before they let you keep your gear when you did that.  I was wearing a mix of crafted and rygorr armor and wielding a mith 2 hander at level 54 and was still wearing crusty at level 60.<br />
<br />
I don't know what sort of things you tend to do when you log in but I agree that unless you have some friends or guildmates that you work well with, it's going to be hard to progress without raiding.  Generally EQ has progression paths for raiders and for casual players in a full, well balanced group.  If you mostly 2 box or 3 box then there probably isn't much left for you other than playing alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point, not even that holds much interest.  I think the last several expansions have pretty much sucked the fun out of EQ, maybe temporarily, maybe forever.  Doing PoP as a Warrior before the aggro fixes was hell.  I care about keeping my team alive.  I work hard at trying to do it.  And when someone dies I'm always asking myself, what could I have done to prevent it?  In PoP the answer was, not a whole hell of a lot.  Aggravation v. reward unusually high.  Then along comes LDoN where you're basically stuck in an endless hamster treadmill to make any progress at all.  I'm sorry, some people may enjoy it as an occassional diversion or as a lark where they get to train half the zone and beat it down, but for me it is just pure unmitigated tedium, if everything goes right.    Aggravation v. reward again unusually high.  Fun, that's what it's supposed to be about.  Not work.  Not endless grief.  Not the same old repetitious grind over and over again in hopes of making some sliver of progress.  But that's seems to be the only place they can take it.  Maybe GoD is different, but I've even heard mixed reviews on that.  And I don't feel I'm ready for GoD.  Maybe I'm right.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But if I'm feeling it, I know there are lot of non-raiders feeling the same way, because out of the people I know in the game there are two types.  Those who have joined raid guilds and who's progress has substantially surpassed mine, and those who haven't joined raid guilds and who's progress is substantially behind mine.<br />
<br />
I think SoE has probably expanded me out of the game for good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Two points.<br />
Glatius just mentioned what it was like to go to PoP before the incite line. I stopped going there as well, primarily because I simply wasn't useful to a group: there should always be some risk that a tank either can't hold aggro or can't stand the damage, but pre-incite I just found that my presence in a group might well be a death sentence for a caster. Not only was standing around lfg frustrating, but I actually agreed with groups that wanted to wait for a knight.<br />
This problem, to a large extent, has been fixed, or it has for me anyway.<br />
So I know SOE has the capacity to fix serious issues.<br />
We know there are lots of problems with this game, we know they sometimes take far too long to fix. But some things have been fixed. If SOE is making a good faith effort to work harder and actually ask players how they view the game, we should tell them.<br />
I also think that it's quite useful to both casual and the hardcore players to have folks like Raaj do a little filtering as one component of the feedback stream from players to SOE. Partly that's because filtered input is not the only kind of input SOE is getting. But partly because folks like Raaj can answer follow-up questions coherently. Are the demographics of Raaj's characters like mine? I hardly think so. Do I think if SOE listens to Raaj I'll get screwed?<br />
Pfffft. Come on, gimme a break.<br />
I'd be surprised if SOE went to the expense of running the summit and didn't bother to get the free input their own boards and sites like this one provided. Wouldn't make economic or common sense.</div></div><hr />

The problem with adding a forum is then people expect everything  they post to get a developer response, and that simply won't happen. Issues important to the community will be raised naturally on the forum the way they always have -- except now there's a good chance those will be addressed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">Raaj <br />
<br />
Number one: thank you for going there and representing us.  There was alot of worry last week that they would skip the real class communitys for feedback and based on this thread it looks like they received it.<br />
<br />
 I'd also like to make sure that everyone knows the door is open for<br />
communication, the feedback pipeline does _not_ close with you guys<br />
leaving the SOE office building <br />
<br />
I think part of the reason SoE got innundated with data is that they have been choking off feedback from sources other than Fires of Heaven/AL/ubers of the moment and their ilk (not that feedback at that level is bad...just leads to blind spots).  GoD was an excellent example with the NDA threat being used as a cudgel to keep the wider audience from giving feedback on the functionality during its beta.<br />
<br />
SoE needs to come to the class boards more often (last time they came around here officially being the &quot;standdown&quot; protest). This roundtable needs to happen AGAIN ON A REGULAR BASIS.  Unless this becomes a regular process the wealth of feedback will once again just build up with thev equating frustration..<br />
<br />
Question: was the poll regarding the potential purchase of equipment with RL $$$ brought up at all?  Very curious what SoEs thoughts were regarding this.<br />
<br />
Also, I saw a 5 post wonder taking a swipe at Raaj calling it &quot;his batphone&quot;.  To enlighten you this is a community and I would imagine that the feedback to SoE will be conducted through the War Room or some such not just one person.  Just because 1 guy has busted his hump to get us information doesn't entitle you to take swipes at him.</div></div><hr />

And I understand why you feel the way you do, really.  But as far as I can see Raaj is acting in good faith and SoE is at least giving the appearance of doing the same.  If SoE fails, as they have sometimes failed in the past, to fulfill their promises, then I'll probably be right there by you throwing stones at them.  But they've taken a step.  They've made an attempt.  A reasonable man cuts people some slack when they do that in hopes of the situation getting better.  I would like to propose that you ease up a bit and give it some wait and see time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are some promising reports coming out of this events but the proof is in the pudding (a pun on a picnic theme! ^_^).

I agree with you here. But the hard truth is that those who succeed, no matter how many times they fail, are adamently opposed to making the content easier.

You can also see this in other class board and their wishlists that are more like god mode wishlists.<br />
<br />
That's why SoE has traditionally balanced the game based on relatively few people's opinion (the developers and whoever they talk to for feedback) as opposed to just taking a poll and see what the players wanted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what this shows to me?  That the game has evolved into two completely different games.  The raid game and everyone else.  In the raid game people insist on having the maximum possible challenge that can possibly be accomplished.  I would hazard the opinion that has come about as a direct result of SoE inadvertantly using darwin like methods of natural selection on raiders, basically because so much of the content has been unbeatable initially or buggy as hell, for people to continue to raid they must have an abnormally high resistance to disappointment and frustration, and must have an abnormally high will to succeed, even beyond the point of being, at times, reasonable.  Most people without these qualities, drop to the wayside if they're doing cutting edge content each expansion.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, most people outside the raid game are just looking for a smidge more challenge and something interesting to do.  They're not interested in participating in a contest of wills between themselves and buggy content or objectives that are currently completely unable to be accomplished due to poor design.<br />
<br />
Two substantially different player bases requiring two substantially different approaches to satisfying them.  And they just cannot keep pumping out content targetted primarily at the raiders and expect that the rest of the player base is going follow in step.  And if they're going to target content at the non-raiders, at the very least they need to make it interesting content, because non-raiders for the most part aren't interested as much in the goal, but in the journey.</div></div><hr />

I can assure you, as much as the goal is nice to achieve (and getting to plane of time was exciting), I too enjoy the journey. Pop flagging although painful to manage from a guild point of view (and disappointing when you miss out, or friends do) was fun. <br />
It was interesting and fun challenging the gods in their own planes. Just like it was fun raiding fear for Cazic or Hate for Inno.<br />

<br />
Well, you never struck me as someone single mindedly focused on only getting to the goal.  Other raiders have.  Maybe my statement was a little too over generalized and should have been more along the lines of many raiders, but not all, are this way.</div></div><hr />

Ditto Glatius, Fitemore, and a smattering of Battleblade, as usual.  Eh .. Aeka, too.  That saves me so much typing ...<br />
<br />
And even if I'm not *appeased* by whatever changes SOE brings about, I still have an interest, and I'm partly hoping I will be appeased.  The fact that my enjoyment of the game, as it now exists, has faded is not a dig or an attack against anyone else, it's not even much of a slight against SOE.  I know where the game has failed *me* - not how it works for the higher end raider, the mid-level raider, or the 4 - 6 hrs on the weekend casual gamer.  But I also know that my circumstance is not atypical.<br />
<br />
Recently, I started getting back in touch with an old chum from my rawk musician days, with whom I had lost contact when I moved out to the 'burbs.  We never stopped liking each other, but we weren't doing a good job of staying in touch.  Now, we both have made a small but concerted effort to make contact, and we're hooking up from time to time.  It's a good thing, one that's worth some hope given our past together - and I think the recent moves by SOE are of a parallel nature.  YMMV, as ever, my opinions are mine and you go get yer own dam* own.</div></div><hr />

Travel was fun and dangerous (and the danger was fun..err)  back when we didn't have spoiler sites, map sites, and level 60/65 with a slew of AAs.  Now travel without books would serve very little purpose.  You can't go home again...the game has changed too much and the playerbase generally lacks the will to &quot;discouver&quot; like it used to.

Maybe i'm assuming, but a RPG is about exploring, adventuring, and so on, not maximizing your accomplishment in the minimum amount of time. If u can only play for 2 hours, thats not an excuse to make unneeded short cuts.  Thats like saying the zones are too damn big for no reason.  Why don't we just have every named spawn close to each other, cuz the middle doesn't matter, who cares, I only have 2 hours to play so why do they even have PH? Why can't they just drop what I want everytime I kill it, and it should always be up when I want it up cuz I don't have alot of time to play.<br />
<br />
IMO the middle is what matters, why do we even have lores about EQ? Why don't we just kill the mobs and loot the loot, and be done? W/o the pages, a book means nothing.</div></div><hr />

Travel was fun and dangerous (and the danger was fun..err)  back when we didn't have spoiler sites, map sites, and level 60/65 with a slew of AAs.  Now travel without books would serve very little purpose.  You can't go home again...the game has changed too much and the playerbase generally lacks the will to &quot;discouver&quot; like it used to.

I do agree w/ you that things have changed, but this is exactly how humans like it, and just cuz we like it doesn't mean its good thing.  We want everything drive-thru, if you want to get from city to city, it shouldn't be about clicking ur heel 3x and saying &quot;There's no place like home&quot; It should be about you getting up, and footing it there. And there's plenty of ways to shorten travel as is, SoW/SoE/Ports nearby, the book just nearly destoryed the term of travel.</div></div><hr />

Actually the game should be about having the flexibility to play the game the way you want, not the way someone else dictates to you.  You want to single group all the time and gain appropriate progress in that fashion, fine, it should be doable.  You want to raid and gain progress in that fashion, fine, it should also be possible.  You want to solo, that should also be supported.  Just because I find something fun and entertaining doesn't mean you will.  And I'm sure you wouldn't like me to dictate to you how you had to play because I thought I knew best and your preferences were irrelevant.<br />

Control freak game Nazis (and I'm not calling you one) aren't fun for anyone.  Some people think all twinking is a bad and shouldn't be possible.  Some people hate power leveling and don't want it to be possible.  Yet other people find these activities entertaining.  Now, who gets to decide?  You?  Me?

The way I see it though, is that each game has it's own flavor. There's no game that can cater to everybody's taste/preference, and there are enough MMOGs out there now that I'm sure people can find a game that suits them better than the other. A game that tries to please everyone usually ends up not pleasing anyone. Not everyone liked even Diablo 1/2, or KoTOR, or Doom, or Quake, Civilization 1/2/3, Baldur's Gate, etc.<br />
<br />
So, sometimes I really wonder why people get som much hung up about one game. I understand that people can get protective of their hobby, but in this case it just seem extreme to me.</div></div><hr />

Well, if we really want to split hairs, EQ was never really intended to be primarily a raid based game in the beginning.  In old norrath there were a total of two raid targets in the whole game and they could only be taken out once a week.  Raids were a once in a while diversion and the majority of the game was group or solo based.  As time has gone on more and more of the game has shifted focus from the traditional emphasis of group or solo based to raid.  That's called evolution.  And it wouldn't be a bad thing if in the process the old play styles weren't being signficantly neglected and disparaged.  Now, here is the thing, EQ has supported all three styles fairly well up until fairly recently.  If SoE is in fact going to continue to place the majority of their emphasis on the raid game to the detriment of other play styles, that's fine, they can do that.  But they need to communicate that to their player base in a straight forward and honest fashion and then let the players make an informed choice about whether or not they wish to continue playing and paying their subscription fees.  But instead what has been happening is that SoE continues to put out the marketing hype that they support all three styles equally, when in fact the truth is otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Even if the game is unfun now, it doesn't suddenly invalidate amd make all the fun people had with the game in the past go poof. Did they have fun in the past with the game? Because if they had, then it was money well spent. The suckiness of the game now doesn't lower the enjoyment you got in the past from it. So the money you paid in the past did not go to waste. If people got too attached to their toon, well, this game is going to end someday, and all the tooms will go bye-bye anyway.<br />
<br />
As for whether it's right or wrong for the devs to turn the game to a certain direction, well, they do what they feel is right for their business, and you can vote with your wallet. Again, like I said, there are a host of other games on the market now, what's wrong in having them cater to diffrent types of gamers?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">It sounds to me like Glatius and a number of folks have done the groupers-equivalent of farming time.<br />
<br />
There are options to play this game, be it to single group, duo, solo, or raid.  However, each one (with the exception of raiding) has a glass ceiling.  If you're going to solo your way through this game, you're only able to go so far before you run out of content.  A new expansion comes out, and you have more content to solo, farm, and advance your experience.<br />
<br />
If you are going to duo, you can suddenly kill more than you could when you soloed.  Still, though, getting flagged to PoValor or PoStorms (older school, I'm talking about) was out of your reach -- so there was less content for you.  Duoing was a viable option all the way up to that point, but now all that's left for you is to farm Cazic Thule for bazaar fodder.<br />
<br />
Now you have to do a single group.  You can do LDoNs, LDoN Hards, get flagged through PoTactics and BoThunder.  Eventually, though, you're going to have experienced everything there is to do.<br />
<br />
Raiders could work their way through to PoTime.  But eventually, they just sat around in PoTime bored about another clearing, even if it means they may get that DBotW that requires more effort to get than any LDoN armor does.<br />
<br />
Lo, though, Gates has come out!  PoTime is no longer the only thing raiders could do!  They can explore new zones, raid new content, and get new loot!<br />
<br />
Groupers, Soloers, and Duoers also got new content with Gates -- but not nearly as much as raiders did.  Soloers/Duoers still have Riwwi though.  Groupers can still do the sewers and the trials (there's even a person here who has a group that has never raided in PoP, but is beating Ikkinz2 now.  Its not easy, but its doable).<br />
<br />
All folks want is more content for their style of playing.  However, they're incorrect to assert that they're different from any other group.  When all groupers had was LDoN, all we had was PoTime.  No different at all.<br />
<br />
Once the level cap increases, I think these people are going to find Gates content even more doable (vxed/tipt pickup groups, anybody?) and things will die down a little bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there is a difference.  While raiders had fun along the way to PoTime, even if the back flagging was perhaps tedious and once they got into PoTime they were well rewarded with opportunities to gear up beyond the wildest of dreams of non-raiders, non-raiders were given extremely boring repetitive content that was basically cut and paste copies of dungeons where you run around playing whack-a-mole for endless hours in order to receive gear that wouldn't hold a candle to anything from the elemental planes on.  Subpar loot for non-subpar time investment.  Well and good, I suppose I wouldn't complain very much about the loot being subpar or the time investment being the same, if it had actually been fun.</div></div><hr />

I like LDoN, especially on hard.  It's no more repetetive than any other exp groups I do, and unlike plane of earth or fire, at least you're moving around and getting a change of scenery instead of sitting in one spot all night and watching the puller come back with one mob at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rewards are greater in time, of course, because it requires more people.  If you could get the same amount of ornate by soloing as you could get in a group, what's the point of grouping?<br />
<br />
There has to be an incentive to raid, just like there needs to be an incentive to group or to duo.  Just being able to see the cooler zones isn't enough, because I thought LDoN was pretty damn cool the first time I went (Rujarkian bridges was sweet). Its not just the sense of accomplishment for killing the big mob, because that gets old after the first few times as well.<br />
<br />
While I've never done PoTime myself, I have done every event in the EPs.  Raiding the EPs gets boring, but its necessary to see PoTime.  I don't get excited when we go to PoAir to farm loot, I dont get excited clearing Fire for a full pop.  I'll have fun the first month we get to Time...but eventually, it's going to be as boring as doing LDoN.  The loot is still good, I won't complain of course...but eventually, even killing Quarm gets old.  Farming Uqua will get old.  <br />

People leave the game because everything gets old...it sounds like LDoN is to you what SolRo Tower or PoAir is to me.</div></div><hr />

Actually, for some reason I can't even explain, I still enjoy going to Sebilis.  I'd rather go to Sebilis most times even today then I would like to do a LDoN mission.  What do you consider fun Brutul?  I imagine that we would find many of the same things fun.  I can't imagine that I'm the only one who considers LDoN poorly thought out from a fun stand point, in fact I know I'm not.  So, what would I suggest they do to fix it?  I'm not sure.  Maybe have each theme have their own individual map sets to pull from that are substantially different from the other themes?  Maybe on each mission make sure to have at least a few rooms with a distinctive look with distinctive mobs to go with it?  Kind of like the King room in LGuk?  Maybe take some of the time pressure off so rather than everyone having to focus solely and completely on the next pull, pull, pull, you actually have a chance to stop and look around a bit?   Make unique and valuable items drop on a pretty consistant basis rather than trivial little augments that half the time no one wants?  I don't know exactly, just floating out some ideas.  But seriously, LDoN wasn't half the expansion PoP was, now was it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">From a raid standpoint no, LDoN was not a good expansion, but from a single-group standpoint LDoN is much better IMO.  3/4 of PoP's exp zones are lake of ill omen style sit on the zone wall and pull singles all day long outdoor grind zones.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what was so special about the king room in guk, the fact that there was a chair there?  Do you want static spawns in LDoN?   LDoN does have big, cool-looking rooms.  Ever do Tak?   There are at least a couple rooms that I said &quot;wow&quot; the first time I walked into.  Good items do drop in LDoN, although they are rare, there's no LDoN item I would consider more rare than say, an FBSS that I camped for 18 hours straight and never got.  I think Sebilis was a great zone, but I think you're a victim of nostalgia if you think Sebilis was some magical place and LDoN is just boring cookie-cutter zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also have to say there are alot of gold nuggets that are covered with shit in this game, crypt of decay was really neat, I loved the monsters, wish they had used the deathbone and death knights in LDoN mistmore, the tileset for that zone was fairly cool to, and nothing beats the death script :P<br />
<br />
there is so much potential in this game that goes unused because they dont want to go back and revamp content, and then there are times when they fuck up a zone we never wanted them to mess with in the first place... ala PoM<br />
<br />
I think what non-raiders want is some attention to THEIR content, we have been asking for higher ornate drop rates since we got into BoT, we want the sand tower redone so it is more attractive to pick up raids, we want some of OUR content improved, just like the raiders have their targets retuned and reworked if the loot is shit or if its not the right reward for the risk, the reason they need a &quot;tire kick&quot; is because when you guys passed thru this content you didnt have to deal with farmers or 3 boxing lamers, we do so the content gets to be a problem of space, drop rates, and since the farmer is being a pig, exp rates slow because they take so many mobs(and since a faster spawn rate would make it alot harder to clear in, they would have to adjust the xp rate per monster and make some of them harder)<br />
<br />
every patch when PoP was new was about time change this, rathe counsle that, with LoY it was tweeking the god of hates encounter, with GoD its the instanced trials, we just want to see a little loving by them coming back and kicking a few tires like they do for you, to constantly improve the game.<br />
<br />
I know each patch I see 5 new or fixed things for GoD I get pissed off and roll my eyes, and the main reason is that patch had 10 things, 3 spell adjustments 2 spelling mistake corrections and 5 GoD related items, it really burns my ass to see nothing in the works that benefits more players, how about we push that removeable augment stuff onto the front burner so we have something to look forword to at least?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My sentiments exactly.  No matter what type of content you like you're going to wind up doing it over and over again.  SoE doesn't release content fast enough for it to be otherwise.  What's different about spending 2 hours a night in LDoN vs spending 2 hours a night in Velkator's?  You get xp in both places.  You have the potential to get drops in both places.  You get points for winning in LDoN even if you're the unluckiest person on earth and never win lottos.<br />
<br />
I'm always surprised when I hear about casual gamers who don't like LDON.  LDON was BY FAR the best expansion so far released for casual gamers.  The whole point to it is that you can progress in 10-90 minute chunks of time instead of the 6 hour chunks that raiders need.  I did 3 hard ldons last night with a random pickup group of people ranging from level 60-65.  I was the only one with more than 50 or so AAs.  Didn't know any of them and none of them were from raid guilds.  We killed 8 named and all of the drops were upgrades for the casual types.  On top of that we all got 315 pts.</div></div><hr />

Okay then, I'm a victim of nostalgia and my comments aren't accurate in the least.  Next topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">I think a lot of what makes LDoN pale in comparison to Sebilis is that I didnt have a time limit after which the time I'd spent there up to that point was meaningless when I was in Seb.  Also, Seb is a huge, sprawling zone with A LOT of neat stuff that could potentially drop in any given camp, and some good random loot drops.  LDoN is for the most part cookie cutter.  There are some exceptions, but they're random.  Example, in Tak there's a really, really cool room that is a gigantic cylinder, with a spiral staircase lining the wall and as you go up the stairs there are mobs spaced out on it that you can pull and kill.   One of the coolest areas I've seen in LDoN.  In the 30 adventures I've done there I've seen that room once.   And with the timer, as a tank, I don't have time to do anything but /assist puller, slam, autoattack, taunt, incite, position mob, rinse, repeat.  There is no sense of exploration, and unless I'm grouped with a bunch of complete morons, no sense of danger (Normal is too easy, Hard is too hard).  And speaking of the timer, it should be either expanded greatly, or done away with altogether.  Honestly, the timers just make the LDoN environment seem that much more artificial and contrived.   &quot;Frodo, you must venture into the land of Mordor and cast The One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom, from whence it came.  You have 90 minutes to complete this mission.........&quot;  Give me a friggin break.<br />
<br />
The only time that changes is when I'm with a group of friends/guildies that I know well enough that I can actually coast along and chat with them, take in the scenery, etc., and never miss a beat because we all know eachother so well.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest differences between camping that FBSS and doing LDoN is that there was an immediate payoff and that the reward was something you looted yourself.  Nothing that drops in normal LDoN is an upgrade for me, not even a slight upgrade or an &quot;I might swap this in situationally&quot; upgrade.  Hard LDoN does have some upgrades, but I can't just take any group into a hard LDoN and have even a prayer of winning, and to be honest, a lot of my guildies aren't ready for something like that even though I pretty much am.  As mentioned previously, Normal is too easy, and Hard is too hard.  If there were a Medium setting that was somewhere in between and that had loot somewhere in between that would be a start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would imagine a good part of that is nostolgia.  I love exploring Sebilis myself, because it brings me back to being level 48 at the guardian camp before 90% of the server was keyed.  I would bet that if you were asked to go to sebilis every day for a few months, though, that zone would get old.  PoValor kicked ass when I first got there.  Sometimes I still like to go back to help a lowbie friend out, because I get to see him experience what I remember experiencing 9 months ago.  However, eventually I reached the point in Sebilis where I said &quot;no more!&quot; and instead explored other places to level up (Cazic Thule revamped, till it got old...then PoP came out and I moved there).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine that I'm the only one who considers LDoN poorly thought out from a fun stand point, in fact I know I'm not.<br />
Did you feel this way the day it came out?  I know I didn't.  I loved LDoN, and wanted to see how many points I could get.  I worked like hell to get my tak wrist augged, and my anger3 augs.  I was excited to tank hard ldons, to kill the big mobs and see droppable loot that I wasnt able to obtain without a raid force otherwise (I wasn't in an EP guild when LDoN came out, we were working on Agnarr, and hadnt even touched MM/Bert yet.  Lots of BoT tower raiding at that time).<br />
<br />
I dont know about you guys, but for a while, LDoN was pretty damn cool.  Then I outgrew it.  I realized this when I can half-ass my way through a hard.  I dont even need to be paying attention half the time to keep aggro, and I dont bother turning off attack during enrage.  <br />
<br />
I'm not bragging about my penis size here, I'm saying that I farmed the crap out of it until I got to the point that the loot was stale and the excitement was gone.  But, man, when it first came out, I was living large in LDoN, and loved it from beta till I had spent 10,000pts.  I still want to max my charm, and I still could use a few more +40hp or +10ac augs (specially now with the aug removal capabilities), but its not something I'll spend an 8hr grind session doing like I did in the past.<br />
<br />
So, what would I suggest they do to fix it? I'm not sure. Maybe have each theme have their own individual map sets to pull from that are substantially different from the other themes? Maybe on each mission make sure to have at least a few rooms with a distinctive look with distinctive mobs to go with it? Kind of like the King room in LGuk? <br />
I agree with you here, that it would probably add more flavor to it -- but that will eventually get stale, too.  It seems like LDoN, the way you've been doing it at least, has just gotten old in general for you.  Have you tried any of the other exp/progression areas, like Riwwi?  They can drop some pretty decent loot, and the mobs are technically soloable by some classes, so you should be pretty good there in a group.  Or Qinimi, or Barindu?  I'm not sure exactly how a warrior of your level would fare there (no magelo for me to look at, and no experience in those zones as anything less than EP geared)...but I wouldnt imagine that they'd be out of reach for you.<br />
<br />
Maybe take some of the time pressure off so rather than everyone having to focus solely and completely on the next pull, pull, pull, you actually have a chance to stop and look around a bit?

Pull pull pull is the mentality of the group, not the dungeon...unless your group is severly underequipped, you should be able to finish an LDoN in about 60-70minutes.  That's not as an uber group, that's just a pickup group.  LDoN is designed so even the bare minimum group can complete it in 90minutes...assuming you're not the bare minimum (and judging from your posts here, I would imagine you're not the bare minimum warrior).<br />
<br />
 But seriously, LDoN wasn't half the expansion PoP was, now was it?<br />
I definately agree with you here, it was more of an add-on than an &quot;expansion&quot; by means of amount of people it appeals to...but what was nice about LDoN is that it allowed all levels (well, 25-65) to use and enjoy, and has a unique (albeit somewhat boring and poorly done) progression.  LDoN would have more potential if there were more customization available (I'd like every item to be cheaper, less stats, but many more aug slots.  A BP at 50ac 50hp and 10 different aug slots that allow you to add stats to it, for instance), and if the adventures lasted a little bit longer and gave more points.  Something like average run time of 1-2hrs for 250pts.<br />

Wow, I rambled in this post...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u205"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p205">normal is too easy, and hard is too hard<br />
IMO, once you have all the decent drops from normal, you're ready for hard.  You dont have a magelo for me to look at, so I could be way off base here, but if you have all the normal ldon drops and find normal a /yawn, I'd imagine that doing hard isn't too far out of reach.  You may not win the first time, you may not even make decent progress the first time...but that's what a challenge is about.  I would imagine that you would be able to compete there and, once your group got used to it, perform well.  <br />
<br />
Once you make the leap to hard, all the loot there gives you a Sebilis feel to it.  &quot;I just killed a mob and a 28ac 75hp bracer dropped, and I got to loot it.  Man, it was tough, but we got it&quot;.  Later on, it becomes camping the item that you have been wanting -- bard in my guild with zero EP gear (but a max LDoN charm and a few pieces of the loot) is trying like hell to get the MM ring, and its just like camping the frenzy in guk.<br />
<br />
I agree the time limit is pointless, especially without respawns -- I think its partly to save resources, and partly to punish laziness.  I could be off base here, but if you find yourself needing to rush to complete a 90minute adventure all the time, I think you either are doing something wrong or you have the wrong group makeup to do it (4shamen and 2bards, for example, is going to have a hell of a time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u206"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p206">I am ready for a hard adv Daabu, the problem is that because I'm in a family guild with a wide variety of play times, I end up doing a lot of pickup groups.  I buff up to about 7800hps and I'm almost done with my tanking AA's, so with a good group I can handle a hard mission  (Ive done 2 and didnt get beat up too badly). <br />
<br />
Now to give you a reminder of what a pickup group can be like in case you've forgotten:  I did a normal mission in Tak 2 nights ago.  For perspective I can't remember the last time I failed in a normal mission.  The shaman was absolutely the worst I've ever seen. I was the only group member hasted the entire time and that was because I have ornate gaunts.  The shaman couldn't find the spell in her book (allegedly hadn't played in a year, I believe it).  Slows didnt begin until the mobs were at about 80% health and on multiple pulls only one mob got slowed at a time so if there was no room to root park I got my ass handed to me until the first mob fell and the second was slowed.  I swear to Christ on one pull we had an add root parked, killed the first mob and started on the add....I see a message in group chat when the mob is at 33% health that says &quot;Attempting to slow %T&quot; followed by &quot;%T has been slowed.&quot;  Oh, did I mention that the cleric was watching the NBA championship game?  We had 2 snarers in the group and I watched one runner stroll through THREE ROOMS with me and the other warrior beating on it waiting at first for a snare or root and later for an evac. Nada.  I died 3 times and the other warrior who was a couple levels lower than me died 4 times.<br />
<br />
Now, lets take that group into a hard mission and see what happens.  We had an almost &quot;perfect&quot; group makeup: cleric, slower, tank, tank, DPS, DPS.  Replace one tank and we're a min/maxing powergamers dream.<br />
<br />
Last night I did a group with a me, druid, cleric, sk, rogue, bard.  Bard was puller, slower, and CC. Sk was only lvl 61 and just along for the ride.  We tore through tak like a runaway truck.  If I'd known how good the group was going to end up being before we went in I'd have gotten us a hard mission without hesitation.  Problem is, looking into the future is like looking at a cookie: You don't really know what it's going to taste like until you've taken a bite, and then it's too late.<br />
<br />
I know I've rambled a bit, but I guess the root of the problem is that it takes waaay too much grinding to get upgrades doing LDoN normal.  Once you have them, you can do hards and get more upgrades, but it's getting there in the first place that is the rub.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u207"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p207">I think what prevents LDoN from having the flavor of Seb (or LG) is that you knew what could spawn were. LDoNs complete shuffle of placement and mob types (in reletively cookie cutter designs, I will admit) prevents players from naming wings or areas or anything like that. <br />
<br />
And if you are playing &quot;offical&quot; EQ, you don't even have maps for the zones. So they are very close in design to one another and non-mapped and random placement. How the heck are you supposed attach to anything in LDoNs?<br />
<br />
Ruk, I think, has the best flavor--the hosital ward in particular comes to mind. Though there is the open air room where it looks like a dragon could land and the furace room too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u208"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p208">I don't have any well thought out reasons as to why or why not LDoN was fun, but from a hardcore non-raider's perspective (my group of friends fields a maximum of 12 characters), it was the best thing that ever happened to single group content in terms of loot and power increases. With some dedication and struggling through some boring grinds you come out with enough loot , exp, and even plat (it's kind of saturated now, but hard loot used to be huge plat) to move yourself through all the single group GoD content and get yourself time quality loot. If that isn't a jump from PoP where you were stuck at BoT towers and Tactics named, I don't know what is. From an efficiency standpoint, hard LDoN are the greatest thing to date. With the exception of a few drops, anything that drops will be a nice upgrade, and every win gets you a little closer to buying something new. How many Sebillis Crypt groups did you walk out of with just another J-stick and maybe some ranger arms when all you wanted was a Heirophants cloak, but you could never win the roll? Maybe it's just me, but I've lost enough rolls that the idea that as long as I put in the time I WILL get the item is a much better system than hoping to get lucky with the RNG. Imo, they knew that LDoN was going to be a lot of pick up groups so getting rid of the random factor was a very smart idea.<br />
<br />
I think a major part of the problem of there not being enough progression for non-raiders is that there is no organization from the players. If you are doing all pick up groups, you may not get where you want. If you can band together with others that have similar mindsets, you can actually grow in power as a unit and take on fun and challenging encounters without joining a 72 man raid force. The progression is there for the most part, you just gotta have some sorting of planning, organization, and most of all a tangible goal. Then the glass ceiling lifts to a point where, at least for me, you are about done with everything you can think of just when a new expansion is released and you have no places to go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">If SOE wanted to improve the game for casual pre-EP people, one thing they could do is to go to some of the older zones and add new areas with upgraded armor and drops that are almost as good as EP.  Imagine if a new area was discovered in ToV where you needed good NToV faction to quest for armor.  A series of solo or small group quests and events could be developed to allow people to get positive faction with (Protectors of Veeshan?) the dragons in NToV who would then give armor quests etc. once the player got enought faction.<br />
<br />
To make this interesting, they could implement what I am calling negative flags.<br />
<br />
Basically, this would involve making these quests one time only and also perhaps EP/time/GoD flag excuded.  Additionally, they could be based on solo, single group, and max 18 person raid force doable quests and events.  What I mean by time/GoD flag excluded is that if for example you have time access, you can not enter these zones much like when you enter a zone piggyback and get booted in 5 minutes if you drop the raid or if do the quests if you have either done the particular quest already or if you have access to better stuff.  This would basically provide areas for people where they could exp or miniraid for upgrades and once they got equiped and flagged for higher areas they would not be allowed back in since there wouldn't be anything there for them and this would free these areas up for casual players.  Likewise, if a player gets a new armor piece in one of these events or quests, they can not keep farming the area because in gaining their new BP etc. they are flagged and not allowed to repeat it.  They could help their friends still but the loot and quest rewards would be one time only.  Drop rates could also be biased towards people with worse gear so that the better your gear got, the lower your chances of getting a peice to drop.<br />
<br />
These are all just some extremely rough ideas I had but one thing they would do is free up areas for lower level players where they wouldn't have the competition from vastly better equiped players who are bored and in between EP/time/GoD clearings etc.  They would be upgrade and move on type zone/quests specifically designed for those who don't have access to end game areas.</div></div><hr />

OMG this idea is sooo teh win. I love it. I'd love to see a high level Crushbone style zone. There's a huge content cow waiting to be exploited in these old dungeons by just scaling up higher level content in deeper and deeper zones. It also helps get players of different levels near each other instead of being so spread out like it is now. The potential for great content here is awesome. There could be progressive quests based on these zones as you move through them and level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u224"><b>Deathdealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p224">These changes come too late for me. The game stopped being fun to me a while ago and I held out with each expansion hoping for change...and it never came. I quit playing EQ about six months ago and short of a major and complete overhaul, I will most likely not be coming back. Apparently, from what I've been hearing in this and other forums, I am not in the minority - alot of people have been quitting EQ - hence the big SOE guild summit. It's such a shame too because EQ used to be such a great game. But for me, it long ago lost it's appeal and mystique as it became a game more and more catered to high-end raiding. At this point in time, I don't think there is any near-term fix to what the game has been evolving in to over the past couple of years. I think it was Gatius (spelling?) who said the game has really become two separate and distinct games - one for the high-end raiders and the other to everyone else. And he's right - unfortunately, nearly all of the content after Velious has been geared towards raiding. So everyone else (non-raiders), who apparently make up a VERY sizeable but very silent majority, are kinda screwed. Yet SOE holds a &quot;GUILD&quot; summit?!?! And the guild representatives are from the top guilds from each server?!?! The summit would not have appeared to be such a marketing scam if SOE would have included a wider representation of the people who play their F'ing game. <br />
<br />
And this is not coming from a person who has not been in a raiding guild. I've been there and done that as well as the tradeskill thing. But going on a 6-8 hour raid is not really my idea of fun. I still can't figure out why people still do it. Anyways, that's one part of the game that some people enjoy...I can't really knock people for doing that because I've done it too (it just took me some time before I finally realized that - &quot;Hey, this kind of SUCKS!&quot;). But there's gotta be another side to the coin. What about the person who really only wants, or is only able to play for short periods of time yet wants to accomplish something without spending the better part of an evening (if not all evening..and some of the morning) and require the help of 72 other people? <br />
<br />
Furthermore, so much of Everquest has now become a near torture-test of tedium as you wait for the raid to form; kill 10 dump-truck loads of mobs only to see your EXP bar move to the right by a half of a pixel; or waiting to finally acquire some AA skill that is, when you consider the percentage of improvement to some stat or ability, is abso-F'ing-lutely meaningless; or hope some mob pops that is so rare that there is a better chance of winning the war on drugs; or hope your item - which happens to be a rare drop - drops after said mob is killed; or actually wait in line for the said mob to even F'ing appear; or clearing a path through battallion after battallion of meaningless mobs with gazzillions of HPs to the &quot;better&quot; portion of some dungeon...not to mention the absolutely F'ing mind-numbing repetitiveness of LDoN adventures and the sub-par gear you get for more hours spent on these broing-arse'd, cookie-cutter adventures than with your own family. <br />
<br />
The game has become FAR too tedious and FAR too much of a timesink where the better zones/equipment/content/experience/ require at least 50+ people who are all as equally well equipped and have equal amounts of masochistic determination (not to mention tons of free time) as yourself. I read in one of these posts that 100% of us pay for the content that only 20% of us get to enjoy. What a perfect summary. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I think this is all way too little, way too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u225"><b>Niclet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p225">Most of my career in EQ has been as a &quot;casual&quot; player.  I started a small family guild of adults fielding on a good day around 2 groups.  We gathered as a group maybe once or twice a week, with some of us playing a great deal more either solo, 2-box or single group.<br />
<br />
I was one of the rare people who played ALOT.  I have a 65 druid, 65 BL 62 chanter, 55 warrior, 49 SK, 52 cleric etc. etc. sea of other alts on 2 accounts.  I did mostly things I could 2-box, power-leveling alts, farming and the occasional &quot;raid&quot; with my guild to old-school places like hate.  There was a carrot.  I thought we could move into content quickly.  My guilds casualness meant crappy gear, the same XP zones over and over again, and no way into most of PoP.  I was wrong, we got stuck and fast.<br />
<br />
So, I prided myself in skill and tactical mastery.  I 2-boxed everything under the sun.  Sometimes I would be lucky and actually get some decent mobs up, usually it was: Lodi, Gantru Dralkner &amp; UP, WW dragons, Benevolence Bracer etc. etc.  for cash.  I upgraded on sheet plat and determination.  I did every quest under the sun.  I maxed out my trades.  I racked up 200aas.  Mostly solo or 2-box and with NO raiding. NONE.  Hell I got flagged for PoS/PoV in a pickup group!  Talk about pain.  I managed to get a BoT key, mostly by begging my way into open raids of a nice guild on our server.  Farming became very competitive and dull.  <br />
<br />
I grew weary and bitter.<br />
<br />
LDoN sounded great.  It turned out to be a dull grind with crappy pickup groups.  Most of the gear from normal LDoNs is down to around 1k in the bazaar, and was not an upgrade for me.  Some of the hard droppable gear was good for me = more farming since I couldn't do the hards.  The zones were repetitive and lacked skill if you had someone to pacify.  Plus I couldn't 2-box there.  The easys are way too easy (depending on how bad the pickup group is), and the hards are too hard (pickups can't do these).<br />
<br />
Solo content was mostly eliminated and solo xp nerfed.  I grew tired of getting in fights for table scraps with other casual players in places like Tactics (quest-keyed).<br />
<br />
I got so outrageously bored that I guilded my BL in a medium sized pre-EP raiding guild.  They had a loose policy on raid attendance (I just couldn't commit to making EQ a job).  Raiding was fun for about, oh 1 month.  We made it to tier 3 PoP and the guild imploded.  I got 2 upgrades for my &quot;tank&quot; BL.  Raiding is in all honesty a handful of decent players and a bunch of worker bee crap players.  You can leave many raids, get a sandwich and come back for the loot.  I had taken alot of crap for my &quot;skill&quot; from some of these more &quot;uber&quot; people with gear twice the power of mine and not enough skill or knowledge to poor piss from a boot.  I craved tactics and real skill.  The kind that says: &quot;I wonder if I can kill Rumblecrush with this single crap geared group&quot;, or &quot;I'll bet I can 2 box this guy if I pull him out with snare, egress, come back and aggro kite him...&quot;. <br />
<br />
It turns out that the same guild leader of the guild I left has started farming the lower end &quot;trivial&quot; named with a warrior he has twinked and his 6 accounts with high-end GoD gear he purchased with the previous guilds funds.  He is selling items off all the named that I would now love to challenge myself and my guild with.  He plays all day.  Kiss those named good-bye.  Very industrious and corrupt.  I applaud him for inginuity, but think he's being an asshole.  Content for casual players my ass.<br />
<br />
I've purchased all the bazaar upgrades I can handle.  My play time has been curtailed lately (I just got married)...I'm REALLY getting tired of the game.  PLing has lost its charm....I'm resorting to 2-boxing the Barindu line hoping for a decent drop.  Challenging, yes, drops are a snowball in hell.<br />
<br />
My guild is currently in the process of dying.  We formed very close friendships and bonds through the game, but there really isn't that much left that we can do.  People are sick of the game and their inability to see much of the content.  Many have bailed or are bailing.  I'm pissed because I still havn't seen half the zones in the game.<br />
<br />
and here's an idea, eliminate the incentive to farm: most gear should be no-drop and lootable ONLY by the group/person/raid that killed the thing.  Send farmers and guild twinking to hell with one change.  Can't use it?  LET THE F**KER ROT.  This opens up content for the casual folks.  Farming has killed the middle game.<br />
<br />
So I have started a warrior, I'm 56 now and I love the class!  The BL, sitting at 6600hps and 1200ac raid buffed and isn't gonna cut it as a tank on anything above regular PoS giants.  I still have a dream of the ultimate one group team, taking on something beyond the crap pool I'm swimming in. <br />
<br />
Many of the points of this thread are good and could help revive the interest of folks like me:<br />
<br />
1) Stick to the damned fantasy theme.  No more aliens.<br />
2) Look back at kunark and velious.  Both were well constructed thoughtfull and challenging: Howling Stones, Chardok, Kael, Velks, Seb...My favorite dungeon is still LGUK.<br />
3) Make LDoN loot no-drop.  ALL OF IT.  Pumping more crap into the bazaar ruins the excitement for people like me.  Why would I do LDoN in hopes of a crappy item from the bazaar.<br />
4) Make LDoN interesting and progressive.  No more random-ness.  Make it tiered.<br />
5) Make LDoN more like GoD in one way.  Include a small chance of a REALLY nice item dropping.  This perked me up a little.  I spent HOURS getting that regen BP from riwwi for my BL and I wear it with pride.<br />
6) Add more progressive 1-groupable quests!<br />
7) I paid for the content I sure as hell want to see it.  Give me SOME way to get to all zones.  Grind or not.  I pay for it.<br />
<br />
So what if I can 2-box kunark bosses now.  I bought it all in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to highlight one of them, since ( I admit) it's a personal hobbyhorse of mine: notice he says that he wears his BL's chest piece with pride. He does so because he killed the mob, looted the piece, and it was useful to him. That's become a sadly rare event in the life of a casual player at every level.<br />
One of the most depressing things I ever did in EQ was attempt to organize a group of mid-20s alts to go to Runnyeye a few months ago. We got partway down and people started asking why we were doing this. There was only one decent drop in the whole dungeon, exp sucked, swarming green mobs, etc.<br />
They all wanted to go somewhere else.<br />
And they were right. In half an hour we could have farmed enough spider silk to pay for that drop in the bazaar several times over. In an hour we could have gotten more experience in any number of other zones without having to work nearly as hard.<br />
All my characters want to rip usable gear of the freshly dead corpses of their enemies. I don't mind farming (I have one character whose baking skill is around 170, his WIS is around 100 when he even bothers to put his tradeskill gear on, and all but a handful of the baking combines he's made have been done with meat or fish that he personally has looted or fished). But eh, the overwhelming majority of upgrades available in this game for casuals come from the bazaar, and it's so inefficient to get them any other way you just end up feeling stupid for trying.<br />
I don't mind no drop if I get to do the killing. No drop will not stop the whole fabled drop problem though: lvl 65 solos the mob, switches to his lvl 12 twink, twink loots. It needs to be done so that if you don't do the kill, you don't get the shiny thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u227"><b>Deathdealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p227">ok, that post up there was my rant and I still think EQ is on it's way to the grave. I honestly don't think SOE has the ability to patch up the sucking wound in the chest of EQ. Not only that, but EQ has been laying on the operating table for a long time waiting for some kind of help...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, how would you fix all of the problems? Well - <br />
<br />
1) This is a fantasy game - so make the game about fantasy again. Ditch the aliens and wierd content that do not fit into the fantasy theme. Hell, pick up any book by Terry Brooks, Terry Pratchette or even the master himself - J.R.R. Tolkien...or any fantasy book that you can find. Go &quot;old school&quot; and dust off those old D&amp;D 'Players Handbooks', 'Monster Manuals' and 'Dungeon Masters' Guides'. Get the game back to a fantasy setting again. These books and older games are the reasons why most of us played EQ in the first place. If we wanted aliens we would be playing that other shite SOE game - that friggin' Star Wars Galaxies disaster. (on a side note: I actually bought that piece of crap SWG...the bad thing is that from what I've read so far, it is looking like EQ2 is going to be very similar to SWG. If so, EQ2 will be a nice looking...but it will be a nice looking total piece of garbage)  :( <br />
<br />
2) Don't shut the majority of your subscribers out of the majority of your game. Many of us...hell, in fact most of us don't want to raid. SOE has even acknowledged this fact. We don't want to go through the tedium of back-flagging or keying because we just don't have the time nor do we want to subject ourselves to that crap. But don't punish us for not having the time to raid 6-8 hours a day, 4-5 times a week (some of us recently got married and are renovating a new house). We want to enjoy the game and see the zones as well. And for F sake...WE PAID JUST LIKE THEY (the raiders) DID! Let us be able to see the content and experience some of the cool lore that you've locked the majority of your subscribers out of. It makes no sense to me why the game has evolved the way it has. Maybe because the biggest most powerful guilds/raiders seem to be your most vocal subscribers...but hell...hasn't the exodus of your &quot;casual&quot; subscribers woken you up? Apparently not with the &quot;GUILD&quot; summit. That summit should have been geared to a wider audience. Raiders should have been there of course, but casuals and tradeskillers should have had equal representation to address what their issues are.<br />
<br />
3) Bring back the fun. I am not sure how this can be done. EQ is not fun. EQ is tedium...boredom...uneventful...mind-numbing. EQ used to be fun a long time ago, but not now. How can it be fun again? I have no clue...but I do remember the sense of adventure I had when I first started playing - who remembers their first run across Kithicor Forest? Or their first excursion in to Blackburrow? Or in to Castle Crushbone? I remember the excitement of the entire Trueshot Bow quest (even though getting the fletching skill up was mind-numbing) when I played my Ranger. I remember finally accomplishing the Shortsword of Morin quest with the same Ranger. That stuff was fun back then...it was exciting...it forced you to explore and take chances. The setting was undoubtedly fantasy and the quests were fun and do-able with just a handful of people. At the time, the Shortsword of Morin was a major upgrade for me (I was using fine steel previously) and the pay-off was definitely worth the effort. And the effort to get the weapon was not a painful test of &quot;how much crap I'm willing to put up with&quot;. Which brings me to the next topic of questing -  <br />
<br />
4) Revisit those old quests, provide upgrades to all of them, make them do-able with a single group or less people, and make the pay-off worth the effort. There are so many broken quests in EQ nowadays that I don't know if anyone really does them anymore - and the game is called EVERQUEST...Q-U-E-S-T. Not to mention that many of them are VERY outdated. The weapons/armor/spells just aren't worth it when you can buy damn good gear in the bazaar already. I'd suggest revisiting those old quests and continue with the lore and story line of those old quests and simply add on to those for upgraded weapons/armor/spells. And match up the effort/pay-off with the level of the character. For example - start a quest with the Shortsword of Morin and continue further, follow-on quests through subsequent levels all the way up to level 65 and beyond. And have side-quests from those quests for other valued pieces of equipment. Get back in to the questing portion of the game...afterall, isn't questing what the game is supposed to be about. Or should the game be retitled to &quot;EVER-RAID&quot;.<br />
<br />
5) Improve the lore/story-line. The lore for the Ranger epic was really cool. Bring that back...don't just force incessant level/AA grinding and gear upgrades down our throats. And don't just toss us BS expansions with lore and storylines that are totally meaningless and have nothing to do with what's going on around us. What are we doing it all for? What's the story? Why are we fighting the mobs that we fight? Why are we KOS in their zones? This all ties back in to the fantasy setting that this game is supposed to be based on. I am not saying that we should all be in role-playing mode, but damn...show a little creativity and tell us a story that is half-way decent, makes sense, and fits in to the rest of the world of Norrath. <br />
<br />
As you can see, these are not &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; types fixes. These fixes have nothing to do with coding or gameplay improvements or what have you. These changes require imagination and creativity. With each expansion the game has moved further and further away from what the game originally was and it gradually lost alot of the above listed topics. Consequently, huge chunks of once loyal EQ addicts have left because the game has evolved into a quagmire of tedious, poorly thought out, uncreative piles of garbage. So does SOE have the ability to fix it?...nope...not in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Agreed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u230"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p230">I agree with the previous comments. EQ transformed too much into a raiding/grinding game. It got away from fantasy, group adventure, questing, and fun. The focus of the game became the big raid, with hundreds of hours grinding exp just to become more effective at more big raids. Part of the problem with the endless balance discussions is that the game got boiled down to the few repetitive tasks involved in raiding.<br />
<br />
Keys, flags -- these things should never have replaced QUESTS as the focus of the game. That's one reason why people STILL like to farm epics, even though at this point they are mostly junk. It's just one of the few sort of interesting things left. One or two keys or flags for dark and mysterious places like VP or Sebilis back in the day, that's one thing. But the endless and miserable progression that is (somewhat) Luclin and (especially) PoP was a terrible, terrible development for the game. It divided the player base and set up tiers of haves and have nots, not on the basis of individual skill, but on the ability to log many consecutive hours of play in large raiding guilds. <br />
<br />
I was a member of two guilds in my 5 years of EQ. The first was a sort of casual guild, that gradually got more and more casual, as it became clear that we weren't racing to end content. But early on, we were among the early guilds clearing Hate and Fear. As the game/progression requirements ratcheted up, we lost ground, and PoP finally simply broke the guild. Where my &quot;casual&quot; guild had formerly had the ability to field at least a few groups competitive with most of the more serious guilds on the server, we lost that. It became very apparent the guild simply could never make it through PoP, and those more interested in progression simply left. A few excellent groups could break Hate and Fear for a guild, but they can't kill MB (without being geared/AA'd beyond that level). Once that cycle starts, it's very hard for a guild to get off the treadmiill. The decision had to be made to endlessly farm epics for twinks and do LDoN, or hook up with a raiding guild and try to progress. My friends had mostly all already quit, and I was very friendly with a raiding guild, so I joined them. <br />
<br />
For a season, all was well. I always had played a lot, even as a &quot;casual&quot; player (which just meant I didn't raid all that much; I was on all the time), and I enjoyed the raiding. We broke into elementals some 9 months ago or whatever, and seemed poised to enter Time. Then I guess some kind of guild fatigue struck. Many people quit/left at the same time, including me. I never even intended to quit -- I got busy with rl stuff, and drifted away. But now I can't even really seriously contemplate going back. For what? To grind away again in Earth rings? Herd 40 people together, make sure we get enough clerics, and spend 2-3 hours tediously farming an endless succession of mobs for 2 drops? Backflag people by doing the same raids over and over and over and over again? Crank out another 200 AAs farming exp mobs in dull outdoor zones, where each AA gets me an increment of extra power that's barely discernible?<br />
<br />
I've sort of thought of the change in EQ as analogous to the difference between driving cross-country and flying. Driving is sort of slower, more personal, and surprising and little interesting things can pop up if you're open to that. Flying is hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror (or real pleasure). You have to pay the price to fly -- the ticket, standing around in airports, crowding into airplanes, etc -- and you're working on someone else's schedule. Big payoff though -- it can be amazing (if you like it), and lets you go places you couldn't get to before. EQ became totally oriented around flying, and the moment of contact with a big mob, for which hours and hours of preparation in farming, exping, etc, were necessary. It was a shift from a more general process of fun, to a more crystallized few moments of excitement (inc Vox!) which must be paid for by endless (and tedious) preparation. I think both are necessary for a really rich game experience, but somewhere EQs driving experience got short shrift. <br />
<br />
Sorry for rambling. In short:<br />
<br />
-progression is too rigidly defined, and too contingent on a certain style of game play (mass group raiding)<br />
<br />
-not enough FUN stuff, especially questing<br />
<br />
-dramatic division of the player base into haves and have nots, which LDoN, while a good effort and a good thing, is not sufficient to address</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u231"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p231">In my view, EQ has been such a successful game for so long precisely because it provided things for cutting edge players/guilds to do. Top guilds put content pressure on SOE, but that's actually good for the game.<br />
I've said this before: raiding players and casual players are in this together. The game has to be fun for both or there won't be resources available to make it fun for either.<br />
A series of posts in which raiding players call casual players lazy and casual players say that they pay just as much to play the game as raiders is not going to be productive of positive change.<br />
Also, I've pointed out before that it makes a lot of sense to invite reps from top guilds to a summit first. They have a good depth of experience in the game, they are utterly ruthless testers of the product, and they are relatively small in number, easy to find and identify, and focused (well, focused for EQ players).<br />
SOE had to start the process somewhere. Obviously, it would be good if the process continued, and one way I think it should continue is to address concerns of casual players. But they can't just be putting up hundreds of people in hotels and conferencing with them every weekend, lol. SOE hasn't had a summit before, so they've got to look at both the data that the first one generated and see how the summit process as a whole worked--what was effective and what wasn't. They've already started at least attempting to deal with the suggestions they got from guildleaders. They need to figure out how to reach other groups of players too, but they need to figure out how to do it effectively.<br />
And, you know, casual players aren't the only other category out there. I'd be very surprised if SOE's business model didn't show that the U.S. market was very &quot;mature&quot; -- that is, it will be hard to achieve growth in that market because it's been established for a long time. Europe, and perhaps in the long-term Asia/Australia, probably have better percentage growth potential, and bleh, players there sure haven't got much lovin'.<br />
I feel like bitch slapping myself for saying this with regard to EQ, but: patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u232"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p232">Oh and by the way, my post above looks like it might be in response to Tugurok's, but it's not. Tugurok's post looks reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u233"><b>Deathdealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p233">lol...I thought you were responding to my post as well Brabble. Anyways, patience is a good thing...unfortunately there are alot of people who just don't have any more. Why? Well, EQ has not evolved overnight into what it is today...the raid focused content that is the current EQ has been going on for a few years now. It's been a slow and gradual change that, I think, has been pushed by a very vocal minority of uber guilds across all of the servers. Uber-Raiders demanded harder and harder content from SOE and SOE complied. SOE just didn't consider the rest of their customer-base in the develoment of their past few expansions. If you are a raider, especially from an uber guild, you loved it. Especially with the release of PoP. Progressing through PoP is a serious test for even the most uber and dedicated of guilds. And I am coming at this from both perspectives - from the raider and the casual player because I've been both. But for the casual player, what expansion has really addressed your playing style and provided you with anything to really do since Velious? Tugurok really captures the consequences of this seeming one-sided evolution to EQ and really hit the nail on the head - <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>Lordbracus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">Agreed. It seems that the squeeky wheel gets to grease. Since they (the uber guilds) have a straight communication link with Sony (as seen by who was invited to the summit), they will get what they ask for first and foremost. Though Sony knows the active participants are the lvl 40 to 50 people, they continue to make content far outside the realm of the majority of players to keep the minority happy and try to placate those of us that really want to enjoy  the content and the imagination of the developers and how they  brought the game and their ideas forward. <br />
<br />
Over 75% of my guild has discussed moving to another game to play. Some are going to be the hardcore players and take what may come because they still enjoy the game. Recently I believe the numbers increased to approx 80% ready to jump ship, based on the summit outlining mostly &quot;Raid&quot; ideas being included or fixed.<br />
<br />
We all agree that though we do raid at times to assist folks in the persuit of their epics, we are mostly a fun guild that plays and explores the realm of Everquest as much as possible within our time contraints, i.e., Real Life work, family time, etc. <br />
<br />
We have had members leave our guild for bigger better guilds, then return a few months later to get back into the content of what EQ was about. They get burned out with the raiding 4 to 6 hours night 5 to 6 days a week, with the mandatory rules and such. Though some like the &quot;uber&quot; items they received, it was getting boring with the same content, raid after raid. I guess the same goes for experience grinding also. Which in &quot;raid&quot; content is virtually nothing.<br />
<br />
ahh well.../rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u235"><b>Maxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p235">Um, the top end LDON armor costs 1492 points per piece.  1492/105 points per mission * ~60 mins per mission including group set up and travel time = about 15 hours per armor piece.  That's WAY more generous than the frequency of upgrades for raiding.<br />
<br />
Not accurate.<br />
<br />
That's not fully augmented.<br />
<br />
Multiply the hours by 3 (45 hours) for 2 top end augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">I just posted this on my server board, while arguing with people over the same raid vs non-raid EQ. What do ya'll think?<br />
<br />
How's this idea: Every 10 missions (right?) in LDoN, you get a charm upgrade. If they also tied those 10 missions completed with a flag allowing that character to access a theme-specific optional new zone with a special challenge (harder mobs, better drops, more experience) that was between a normal and a hard mission in difficulty, there would be a progression reason to continue doing LDoNs. <br />
<br />
Ideally, those unlocked missions would have a special goal, or be some sort of bonus level ala Nintendo games. A bonus level could consist of getting 1 point per 3 mobs killed, or 1 point per item collected, or something along those lines. A special goal could be something like killing 2 lieutenants that spawn a boss. The zones could have a shorter or longer timer or no timer at all, depending on the challenge.<br />
<br />
Also, give sort of charm upgrade, or bonus amount of points, or AA for each LDoN flag recieved. I'd prefer the bonus points, personally. Make the content progress in some fashion, like in MMC, after 50 missions your goal is to kill some evil ally of Mayong's. Maybe in Miraguls, after 50, your goal is to destroy Miraguls personal laboratory.<br />
<br />
Plan the upgrades from these LDoN goals to get a character reasonably close to succeeding in an LDoN hard mission, and perhaps make an entire tier 2 of this system with hard missions. Sure, the zones wouldn't change much, but there would be PROGRESSION. Maybe the hard missions could even directly include the major figures in each theme. Mayong, Miragul, some big mean sand elf, some big mean orc, and some big mean frog.</div></div><hr />
