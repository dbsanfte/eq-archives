<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean this to be less a rant and more a bit of constructive thought. Do not beat me with the /large trout if I go over anything that has been beaten to a pulp already :)<br />
<br />
I was discussing arrogant paladins and their chain stunning ways with my fellow warrior Cyrz in my guild warrio channel. Between the usual curses and wishes for the death of one thousand rangers on to each chain stunning paladin we tried to come up with ideas that were practical enough to take the insane edge off of aggro that paladins have while chain stunning while not completely crippling one of their critical spell lines.<br />
<br />
One thing that came up early was giving the stuns a jolt style effect. Jolt being that nice aggro reducing spell a smart ranger uses so he's not turned into jelly in green tights. The idea certainly has it's appeal. It would force a paladin to depend much more on taunt. Of course taunt being broken it would land paladins and shadowknights in the same boat as warriors. And even Sony would be hard pressed to ignore all three tank classes having a broke aggro skill. Of course the down side of an aggro reducing stun would be a paladin could chain stun without fear of retribution from the mob and effectively limit its ability to do damage. That would become an unbalancing trend as any paper skinned caster preferes a non-moving, non-attacking mob to one that you have to hope taunt keeps intrested. <br />
<br />
So the question became how would you balance stuns if they became aggro reducing even to a small degree of 100 negative hate points? I threw out the idea of raising mana cost and recast time. The thing I've seen over and over in groups with guildmates and pick up groups is paladins memming two to three stuns and chain casting them until they run out of mana. Generally I've seen a paladin do this for four or more mobs until they run out of mana using clarity spells. Add in Pot9 and Beasty crack and they go for much longer. So with or without adding a jolt effect it would seemingly make sense to raise mana cost and recast time to make chain stunning less effective and lead to a greater dependence on the taunt button. And when more people stat relying on a busted skill its bound to get fixed quicker (This of course assumes that warrior taunt is the exact same as knight taunt, I never dug into the exact mechanics :)<br />
<br />
You might notice I do not mention shadowknights in this post even though they have incredible aggro abilities. In my experience of noted that most shadowknights understand and appreciate aggro a lot better than paladins. Growing up as a class with feign death they learn to appreciate gaining and losing aggro just like a monk or a necromancer would. Many shadowknights grow up being pullers and learn to dump off aggro and a mob onto a warrior. Feign death is also one of the ultimate hate killers on a mob. A smart shadowknight in an experience group or a raid who picks up aggro knows to immediately hit the ground and play dead. Paladins don't have this luxury as all around do gooders who'd never lay down and play dead......they just train :P<br />
<br />
I'm all for beefing up warrior aggro. But instead of continually stacking blocks it seems to make more sense to level things out. The raising of recast time and mana consumption seems the most agreeable route to me. Sony has always tweaked spells around to their liking. They are easier and less drastic a change than a game mechanics change in general.<br />
<br />
Also as a side note paladins and shadowknights are invincible when it comes to aggro. I my self on several occasions have pulled and maintained aggro off of several knights on my server both with and without my Blade of Carnage. And not merely as an accident. I've openly challanged knights to do their best to maintain aggro while I attempt to pull it off. And this means paladins triple stunning and even one shadowknight who gave himself Voice of Thule! (I needed the BoC for the Thule guy naturally ) All I'm saying is that its tough but possible. Aggro control isn't all mechanics but it takes skill as well.<br />
<br />
Oh, just so this fits with the forum......nerf paladins!</div></div><hr />

Yes, they can do things that would make life as Knight more difficult and aggravating, much like a Warrior's.  But it seems to me that having some real control over the situation is much more enjoyable than messing around with random factors.  An experienced Rogue will have a good handle on just how often he can BS before gaining aggro and can to a great degree control whether he has it or not.  An experienced Wizard will have a good idea when he can drop a nuke and when he should hold off.  He has a great deal of control over the situation.  Pretty much all the classes, with the exception of Warriors, have this ability to use experience and judgement and impact the situation directly.<br />
<br />
Warriors on the other hand can place themselves perfectly.  They can time their taunt perfectly.  They can do everything an experienced Warrior with good judgement can do, and still have no direct control but merely rely on luck.  The luck of taunt, the luck of a proc.  Luck.<br />
<br />
Is really a good idea to Knights join us in this position of no control or would it better we joined them in a position of control?  I opt for the latter myself.<br />

I find it hard to believe that an equally skilled SK or Paladin would be unable to pull aggro of a Warrior.  You might have indeed gotten lucky with some taunts, thereby pulling aggro off them, but they should have been quite able to yank it back at will.  They do have their own taunt button after all along with their spells.  You might have been more skilled than they were, but they certainly had more capability at their finger tips than you.</div></div><hr />

think he could have been procing like mad? think the sk was actually extremely skilled himself and new how to handle everything? it's just as much the tanks job to keep aggro as it is the groups job to not get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being the Cyrz mentioned in this post, I should point out some things.<br />
<br />
Trast did mention that the SK and Pally he was testing against was TRYING to get aggro.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Jolt&quot; effect on Stuns was partially tongue in cheek... yes, it would destroy paladin aggro, which would prevent paladins from taking the spot from me on raids. :-)<br />
<br />
I will rant and rave about nerfing paladins and such with the best of them, but my real, true desire, is to give warriors an EFFECTIVE, TRIGGERABLE method of TEMPORALIY gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
Let me explain. In any experiance group I am in, aggro is a big issue in the first 10-15 seconds. I will call these the Golden 15 seconds. During that time, you often see Slow, perhaps Tash, Perhaps a form of Malo, and perhap some DoT's landing. These spells all lose some of their value each second they are delayed being cast. You also are very likely to see the first heal or heals landing in this time.<br />
<br />
2 of the 3 tank classes have the ability to increase their aggro generating abilities during this time, and therefor allow Slows, Debuffs, and DoT's to land EARLIER, with LESS aggro concerns, and therefor allows those spell to be MORE effective. Since slow can land earlier, the first Heal can be delayed, perhaps allowing that heal to be a more mana efficent Cheal instead of maybe a Supernal line.<br />
<br />
Because of this, the 3rd Tank Class has been developing the rep of being the less effective Tank Class in Exp-Group level encounters.<br />
<br />
This, in effect, voices my ONLY real concern about Balance between the 3 tank classes. Relative DPS, etc, etc, etc, I don't personally care about. Long term aggro, current Mitigation and Advoidance Tables, etc, I don't see as a problem. The single, solitary failing point, the single most AGGRAVATING issue I see with my warrior, is the Inability to gain aggro during those golden 15 seconds, and as such, my diserability and preformance in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Also, Trast, in reference to Taunt- Warriors have a higher skill level cap on Taunt. From Memory, Warrior Skill level is 230, and SK/Pally is 200?.<br />
<br />
In reference to this issue, to provide the Dev's with Hard Numbers to get them to perhaps consider a change, or perhaps to even prove us wrong (I doubt it, but I am attempting to be totally impartial here)- I'd lied to see or do a small study in aggro.<br />
<br />
Take two similiarly equipped tanks- The best defination I would have for similiarly equiped would be both tanks perhaps belonging to the same guild, and have gotten their weapons with that guild.<br />
<br />
Put both these tanks in an exp group. Tell each tank to TRY and maintain aggro. Logfile the fight, and see who gets swung at MORE often over the course of say, 100 fights. If the Knight gets hit or missed 5000 times and the warrior 500, that should be indicitive of an aggro imblance. If it wasn't such a massive undertaking, I'd even break it down to see who has aggro during the first, Golden 15 seconds of the fight more often.</div></div><hr />

Hard to believe but true. The occasions in question have always been against compairable knights against PoP mobs. Weapons like their respective epics, Windblades, mid-teir PoP dps/proc weapons were all used. The test usually went along the lines of the knight pulling the mob and building their aggro and keep it. I'd then jump in and attempt to strip it from them. Sometimes it would ping pong and sometimes it wouldn't. But on more than half of the occasions I've taken and held aggro of these knights while they tried their best to get it back. It's certainly not an easy thing to do. I'd have to lie, cheat, and steal for every aggro point. But when clerics tell me that I hold aggro like I knight I think I am doing something right even if it's a dirty lie sometimes :P</div></div><hr />

Yeah, okay.  I'm not going to say you're not that good.  But realistically the game doesn't support it the way you claim, barring your continually procing.  Taunting and then casting should get them to the top of the aggro list each time taunt succeeds with some added padding.  If the mobs WEREN'T ping ponging, then I doubt the person you were competing with really knew their class or they weren't going all out.<br />
<br />
Your story just doesn't jive with the observable facts in the majority of other situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree on this one. As a pally who has levelled up with a warrior friend from day one of EQ I find the situation works pretty much as Trast describes. Given the same level of (achievable) equipement and aa's a warrior has quite an advantage in the tanking area over SK's/pallies. What a warrior does need over the knight class's is a skilled driver and decent equipement, and without both, yeah a warrior is going to suck in comparison!<br />
<br />
As well as my 65 pally I also play a cleric, necro and enchanter (all 65) and admit that there is a huge discrepency between a &quot;good&quot; warrior and a poor one in the aggro stakes, where as any knight class can hold agro with only a modicum of skill (there are still some that can't or don't). The problem is how to improve the poor warriors without makeing the good ones godlike? I am not sure you can! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The raising of recast time and mana consumption seems the most agreeable route to me.  <br />
<br />
Pffffft! What you wanting to do take the fun out of the game altogether?  In just about every game situation I am in I use my stuns not to out taunt the warrior but to pull an add (and sometimes 2 or 3) off sitting casters, or resisted enchanters who would get &quot;one rounded&quot; if not for my ability to chain stun and put the mobs on hold or at least on me while the enchanter gets them mezzed or the warrior gets them aggroed. <br />
<br />
Raising the recast time would destroy this ability and do nothing for warriors since it is the snap agro people seem to be complaining about and having 3 stuns loaded is plenty of snap agro even if each has a 5 min recast.<br />
<br />
Raising the mana cost would only make it so the uber ft15, multi aa with c5 pallies could chain stun, but go ahead, fol uses 12 mana and rocks for holding agro!<br />
<br />
It seems to me all some people are worried about is being top of the list for grouping and bugger the gameplay aspect. But there again I regularly group with a warrior, we are a team and not in competition with one another!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't buy what you're saying.  You're saying that a skilled Warrior using all his tools can how aggro control a skilled Shadow Knight or Paladin who is using all his tools.  In essence you're saying that even though the Knights have more ways to generate aggro on command that the skilled Warrior will still out aggro control a skilled Knight.  Hog wash.<br />
<br />
I've played a Warrior for three years, leveled him to 64, and I'm considered a reasonably good to very good player by those who have played with me.  And I've also played a Paladin and leveled him to 53.  And the difference in aggro control is huge.  There just isn't that much difference between the two when it comes to the basics, except the Paladin has a lot more on command abilities that the Warrior doesn't.<br />
<br />
I've also played the Warrior while grouped with SKs who worked at stealing aggro.  Typically I could get aggro back, certainly, but it would quickly turn back to the SK, because when I successfully taunted my aggro would only be slightly higher than the SK's so once he cast again, he'd pass me on the hate list.   Then I'd have to taunt to get back again.  It wouldn't just stick to me because we'd be playing dueling aggro and there was no way I could significantly bump my way up the aggro list based on procs or DPS alone.<br />
<br />
Given how the hate list works, it's impossible for a Warrior to jump up the hate list significantly faster than a SHD or Paladin who is actively working at chain casting aggro generation spells unless his weapons are procing a hell of a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arny</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not saying that at all! What I am saying is that a GOOD warrior with decent gear can hold agro most of the time, not as good as a knight, but certainly not as far behind as a lot of posts on various boards I have read would suggest. What I am getting at is that a warrior is more gear dependant, but then it is my belief is that this has always been the case.<br />
<br />
Also with an equally equipped and aa'd warrior and knight, the warrior will out-tank the knight by a fair margin, defensive or no defensive, I see a noticeable difference in my pally tanking an unslowable/partially unslowable pop-mob than my warrior bud, and at present I have about 150 more ac with about 200 less hp (I have ND3, warrior only ND1 atm) so I am guessing the warrior will have a 400-450 hp advantage with ND3?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the solution is NOT to nerf paladins. if SOE nerf knights, they will have to fight with high aggro weapons. the game is not designed yet with those kind of weapons, there is only a few of them, and SOE will have to introduce knights EB weapons.<br />
<br />
EB weapons are bad.<br />
<br />
Knight aggro is maybe a little bit overrated, but its just a class advantage. you cant reduce ask SOE to not reduce druid power of healing because clerics feel menaced. the problem actually is with warrior and is over exagerated with everyone focusing on aggro. the main problem is : warriors do not have anymore any major class advantage compared to another class, that justify their pretended specialisation.<br />
<br />
A - Warriors have a little more HP and AC, but at the state of the game for a casual level 60+, it's trivial, it doesn't matter a lot for an xp group (assuming you don't have a crappy gear, and about 3800 unbuffed at 61+, you can tank np in pop, thanks to slowers)<br />
B - Warriors have no added ability that can make them desired in a pickup xp groups. except /shield and disciplines with long reuse times, but it worth nothing compared to heals, roots, snare, burst damage, stuns, lay hand, group buffs, rez, FD... those abilities are spells and are useable almost at will.<br />
<br />
those are the two problems. SOE should concentrate on those and not starting to nerf paladin aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And That is all that matters...<br />
<br />
in PoP it is all about kill faster, dont let the casters get hit.<br />
<br />
Sure we could tank ALMOST as good as a knight, but because of the dependance on RNG people dont want us....<br />
<br />
65 War 8500hps buffed, EB weapons.. a good name on server... LFG 6hrs<br />
<br />
57 Shaman, a nobody... 10 mins and 4 group offers...<br />
<br />
you tell me whats wrong here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
sometimes I log and there is almost 10 or 12 tanks LFG... sometimes I got 2 or 3 offers just by using my LFG macro. In fact the real problem is that with pop I can no longer create my own pickup group easily, since slowers who log are almost never LFG and prefer to go in a group who already have a camp. I hate slow, I want a pop xp zone with unslowable mobs that hit with a normal frequency... In PoP everything is expected to be slowed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins and SKs that insist warriors have any sort of meaningful tanking advantage to justify their ridiculous lack of aggro are deluding themselves.  I've actually had groups use a beastlord to tank for the first part of every fight over me because he could guarantee that the mob would be locked on him.  <br />
<br />
I have 8400 hps buffed and it was more efficient to use a beastlord as tank because I can't lock aggro.  This is WITH an EB weapon (BoC + Blackout).  I realise there are better aggro combos out there but that's a hell of a lot better than most warriors have.  <br />
<br />
I can get aggro reasonably fast most of the time and I hold it fairly well, but sometimes I lose aggro and a caster dies.  This slows the group down.  There is nothing I can do about it.  There is nothing any warrior can do about it.  In my opinion not only knights, but rangers, beastlords, and shamans all make better tanks than warriors in xp groups because they can lock aggro.  Once slowed anyonen can tank.<br />
<br />
Aggro control is the by far the most important aspect of tanking and warriors are the worst in the game at it.</div></div><hr />
