<br />
You'll have to work harder for some time.<br />
But its not a handicap that will follow you for ever.</div></div><hr />

The only problem is you can't walk into the bazaar and buy all your gear.  If you're going to do that I see no point in playing this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your playing casual then theres other armor.<br />
<br />
FH is good but it's not the only thing thats good theres other stuff for all dieties that are great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cultural is just easy to get, its not the best stuff out there.<br />
<br />
Everyone gets cultural recommended to them, not because its the best, but because its easy to get.<br />
<br />
Stick with it.  Not too many Vah Shir around.  You wont be dissapointed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lelara</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Flikk,<br />
<br />
I share your pain as an Agnostic warrior.<br />
<br />
For some reason (most proabably it's my playing style), I have a hard time finding non Cultural Armor either for sale or someone to make it.<br />
<br />
It really makes me feel inferior as there are good cultural upgrades for me like Fierce Heraldic or Helenic Tundra armor that I just can't use.<br />
<br />
As Emilia mentioned, I just have to work harder but it's really not worth my effort as I'm not rich or have the playing time like others do.<br />
<br />
However, it's too late for me to reroll my warrior to as I refuse to level up to 65, do PoJustice trials and Vex Thall key ever again.<br />
<br />
All I can hope is the developers finally give just one chance to change our deity and I will definitely change it immediately.<br />
<br />
However, I think they made a boo boo when they made religion more important later in the game than earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other side, kitty warriors sure are a unique race as there's not many of them around, so you will stand out among the other warriors somewhat.<br />
When someone with /showname off will definitely recognize you easily.<br />
Hehehehehehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groticus</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started out as agnostic over 2 years ago.  Somewhere along the way I bought and read a book off a Vendor that made me a follower of Mith Marr.  I did not notice at the time what happened and I have yet to ever find anyone else that this has happened to.  I am still unsure if this was a bug or what but there is hope.. I just wish it had been Rallos Zek instead :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh why give VahShir a chance to change deities when their history clearly states no association with a god at all?<br />
The history of the VahShir is deep; yet remains primitive in their following of a deity. If Rallos Zek only means you get l33t armour; than you're missing the point. <br />
<br />
Believe me; I was a Karana Worshiping Half Elf Warlord in my past life. I followed and learned my diety's beliefs and saw no need for any l33t armours. I was okay.<br />
<br />
You'd be okay too. Just enjoy the game man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CasEci</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, one really can't make a mistake when making a Warrior. Cas was the 3rd 'toon I made back in '01, didn't know a thing about stat point distribution, or diety selection. So he's a human who worships Mith Marr, 95str 90sta 90agi 75dex. <br />
But ya know what, at 56 (closing in on 57) I truly have fun playing him, and the other 2 'toons, gone the way of the dodo...<br />
Agnostic, or wis based diety, just hang in there, RP a bit, and just smack MoB's around, they don't care who we worship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Shik said.. If the only reason you worship a diety is to get the l33t armor, you're doing it for the wrong reasons. I picked RZ when I rolled Tarsk because of the RP implications, and because I wanted Tarsk to worship the Warlord, not because I knew that 2 years later, SoE were going to put FH armor in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also play a Vah'Shir warrior, and up till I got into the higher end part of the game, I was pissed about not having cultural armor. Also was pissed about being a largte race without Slam, or the innate stun resistance from the front, or the fact that we eat twice as much as any other race in the game. (Get your HP AA's outta the way, and then get metablosim 3... saves a TON on food) But as I have gotten into the higher end part of the game, I have found that cultural armor, and all that stuff is moot anyways. <br />
<br />
I am level 65, I have 10 AA's, and I think my little warrior is doing fine. I can MT if needed, even on some of the higher end mobs. I really mis-spent my points when I made the toon to begin with... mostly into str and dex. (Don't ask me what I was thinking, it was the first toon I had ever made, and I knew NOTHING about EQ)  but I have gotten enough eqipment and AA's to help me get him to over 200 in str, sta, and agi unbuffed, which is very nice for those xp groups where I don't have a shammy to boost those.<br />
<br />
So is Vah'Shir as a warrior a bad choice? In retrospect, if you are not in the high end part of the game, maybe. If you are getting into places like Vex Thal, and second teir to elemental planes, then the mobs don't care what race you are, they will beat you silly with no discrimination. Vah'Shir are fun for a lot of reasons, which is why I chose it for my toon.<br />
<br />
1. Unique look. You'll be easily targeted on raids.<br />
2. Safe fall... even though it's not a very high skill, it still does come in handy.<br />
3. The fact that we eat so much food is the reason why DoT's don't stick on us as long.<br />
4. Sneak comes in handy once in a while too. <br />
5. Our starting stats, pretty much suck, but with high end gear it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
So overall... I love my Vah'Shir Warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and you can do silly shit, say stupid stuff, and people wont really pay much attention, just mumble somthing bout catnip, and continue on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nyxs</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the lowly level of 43, as a Vah Shir Warrior- I'm having a lot of fun! I can see better then a Barb, safe fall, bash, kick, shoot, throw whatever is needed for the fight- I'm happy:-) (its not a tail:-P :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could care less about diety.<br />
<br />
I'm doing just fine for my level at 52.<br />
<br />
I may not WORSHIP Rallos Zek, but after questing his jagged blade, I certainly have come to a deeper understanding of the warlord and what he's all about.<br />
<br />
RP all you want man. Have fun.<br />
<br />
The cultural gear is nice, but there's much better stuff that you can acquire eventually.</div></div><hr />
