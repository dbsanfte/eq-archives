- Tradeskill chance of failures changed - The higher your skill is over the trivial of the combine, the less likely you are to fail with a combine. This is a reduction on the chance to always fail. <br />
<br />
- Stackable - Ice Burrower Silk, Pie Tins and Muffin Tins are now stackable.<br />
<br />
- Droga and Nurga moving to Live servers - These zones were revamped and sent to Legends, and now they are moving to the Live servers. This is a great chance to revisit these zones. <br />
<br />
- Spellshield - Spellshield items now reduces spell damage by a percentage rather than a fixed amount. <br />

those look like nice changes, my brother who is a 60 pally also told me his stun line got narfed, in that alot of it doesnt work on 55 plus mobs but it think he is trying to get my hopes up :) can anyone conferm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not wether the stun works or not it's wether the aggro it produces has been toned down....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If aggro got toned down, is it all stuns or just paladin stuns. Would this say, affect 0 sec stuns like on enchanter spells or weapon procs? Cleric spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just checked PoN - No topics talking about reduced stun aggro at the moment, i doubt it'd be ignored :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think people are still confused about the June 11 or whatever thing, which simply fleshed out what was already true -- that mobs over 55 couldn't be stunned with some stuns, but that those stuns still generate aggro. There was no nerf, nothing different about the performance of stuns -- a message was changed is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well that burns my butt, its like a kid doing a card trick in front of hudiney (sp?) if they are immune to it why does it still piss stuff off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Think of it like this;<br />
<br />
If you're immune to a baby kicking you, but it keeps doing it over and over, would you not be pissed off?<br />
<br />
Maybe a baby was a bad choice of character, but what can you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paladins = babies? :p<br />
<br />
Dangerous ground :)<br />
<br />
Oceanlord is a good supporting case though ;)</div></div><hr />
