<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using 1HSers on my warrior exclusively.  However, the more I read, the more I watch, and the more I play, it seems to me that I need to work on my 2HS and other skills as well.<br />
<br />
So the question is this:  What is the best and quickest/least dangerous way to increase my skills?  Are there any static mobs that don't fight back?  (dream on pal).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?  Any good tactics for staying alive with a skill of less than 100?  (more like 24)</div></div><hr />

I trained alot of my skills duoing in poi with a cleric bot.  It works very well, especially when you can bum a haste.  If you don't have a bot you can swap weapons while grouping after you build up some aggro, or you can just go to POI graveyard and swing at the mobs people pull there.  I don't know of any more mobs like the water source, or the &quot;no wood here&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />

For Piercing I used a Shimmering Partisan.  Both of those raised my skills fairly quickly at least I thought so.  Not sure on others don't remember easiest way I guess you could build up skills if your 46+ I'd go to PoInnovation and ask groups at zone in if you can hit mobs.  Just keep an eye out for trains though they can be nasty :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions.  I might not be able to beat on yard trash in the plains for a while, but I'll do my damndest to beat on other peoples mobs - and I'll do the slowly but surely switching of weapons in groups as well.<br />
<br />
So what skills are the most important to raise?  And in what order would you raise them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1HS, 2HS, 1HB, 2HB LOL your a warrior master of combat so it sucks if you get into the higher levels see a weapon you wanna wield but you look like a monkey swinging a banana because you didn't have the foresight to train every combat skill possible :D I even have my hand to hand trained up from alot of naked drunken boxing :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best way to get your weapon skills up is to use them. <br />
<br />
You have 1HS maxed? Try putting a fast Piercer or 1HB in your off hand. You keep playing as usual, but you are working on your other skills. Go back to dual 1HS only if you really need to, and then just as long as you need to, then switch back.<br />
<br />
For 2HS, get a Nathsar Greatsword. 17/30, I think. They are fairly inexpensive,  and once your 2HS is up, you can either sell it or share it with a friend. <br />
<br />
For 2HB, get a shovel. Not sure on the stats, but it is fast for a 2HB.<br />
<br />
Now, for those 2-handed weapons, go into a zone, and find a warrior and ask him if you can assist him and that you only want to work on raising your skill. Once when I was in Dreadlands, a Troll Warrior asked if he could assist me so he could work on skill. Since I was holding agro, he got more hits in and he raised 2HB 50 points fairly quickly. <br />
<br />
You can raise skill on Light or Dark Blues.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine just got a GSoT, and his 2HB was 20. He had it at 250 in a weekend. The GSoT is a fast weapon, so it is good to train with *IF* you have one. Not many of us can afford such a great weapon. <br />
<br />
If you can get most of your skills over 100, then don't worry. When that good weapon comes, just use it. <br />
<br />
My piercing was like 120 when I came across an awesome 2HP. I started using it as my main weapon and my piercing was over 200 fairly quickly. <br />
<br />
Raising weapon skills is a Zen thing. Don't think about it.<br />
<br />
Just do it.<br />

<br />
So I suppose I should just quit fretting over it all and just start switching out weapons.  I only worry about holding aggro, especially when I'm with an aggro sucking ranger or a cast happy caster.<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks for all the input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Illusions such as boon or NDT work great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since warriors say they're not DPS, as long as you hold aggro use whatever weapon you like.  I've used offhand training for a DW class, beating other people's mobs and swapping for run mode (that is, I use 2hs until mob goes to run mode then slap in 2hb to kill it). Or for slower groups (KPC in solb once we broke it), I'd just say I was training if that was ok, then trained (peircing at the time).</div></div><hr />
