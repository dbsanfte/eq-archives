<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy,<br />
<br />
Well we know we will have Deepest Guk (files are gukc), Oasis Orc Highway V2.0(unknown what file names are), and the new temporary SolC(filenames SolC).<br />
<br />
I've sorta been paying attention to the LDoN patches, and today I noticed a few new zone files downloads:<br />
<br />
eey.ext's and mmc.ext's?<br />
<br />
any guesses?  I'm going with Deeper Gorge of King Xorbb  (EvilEYes)<br />
and Below Mistmoore Castle(MistMooreCastle).<br />
<br />
Anyone Else got an speculations to the new zones?  We know there will be 5 total &quot;genre's&quot; and to my knowledge 2 have been announced (Deepest Guk and Oasis)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>azon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember the old map that you got with luclin, the one that has all the norrath continents.  It has some names of places on there, one of them was rujarkian hills, so im guessing they may put more zones in, that were from that map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe that Sol C is not a LDoN zone, but the new temp zone that went like on 8/6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aye it's naggy's belly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sol C and Chardok B are both free, temporary zones. They have nothing to do with LDoN besides the storyline (Morden Rasp and the Wayfarer's Brotherhood).<br />
<br />
There are 4 LDoN zones that I know of.<br />
<br />
1. Rujarkian Hills - have not seen it yet/has not been pre-patched in but has been officially mentioned.<br />
2. Miragul's Lair - has been pre-patched and I have seen it, has not been officially mentioned.<br />
3. Deeper Guk - I have seen it and it has been officially mentioned<br />
4. MistMoore Castle - seen it but not officially mentioned.<br />
<br />
All zones are very big and look absolutely stunning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">god I just hope that the zone lines to these zones are not as queer to reach as SolC..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Trondir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">TakishHiz is also there. I'm not impressed with the zone layouts so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">they say solc and(not even sure about this) chardok b are temporary, but i bet they won't remove them, sol c still gets some attention and its a damn fun zone, its a change for late night 1am raids instead of mindless slaughterings in Potactics pit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i have had a blast in solc, can get loots with me and my bots and reasonable xp and fun dungon crawls with guildies, i'm looking forward to LDoN alot</div></div><hr />
