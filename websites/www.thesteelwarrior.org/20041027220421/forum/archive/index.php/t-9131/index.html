<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rikam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I looked didn't see some info I was looking for so figured I would post here. Was trying to figure out what the acceptable exchange rate was on ac vs hp and for like what expansions. Mainly focus is on PoP so figure getting where AC is really needed.  I saw in the bazaar yellow fang earing which is just 30 ac for 40k then there was the CT slime earing with 10 ac 100 hp. Figured 20 ac might be better then the 100 hp but wasnt sure. Just wanted to know to make some better informed ger descisions coming up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, I use the figure 1AC = 4HP.  Some people go even higher. say 1AC = 6HP, but I tend to fight mobs that AE alot, and AC doesn't help you as much there as HPs does.  Anywhere from 1:4 to 1:6 is usually the accepted formula.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Within the Ac/hps tradeoff, I tend to look at visible and non-visible slots separately. AC on visible slots tends to be relatively cheap compared to hitpoints; hitpoints on nonvisible slots seems to be cheaper than AC. (Bleh, I'm not saying that very well, but perhaps you get my meaning.)<br />
So, when I'm trying to balance bang-for-the-buck, I almost never look at one slot in isolation (for buyable gear). The exception might be when I'm contemplating a piece of really really good gear I wouldn't have to upgrade for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Ac is linearly beneficial all the way up to 2700/2800 ... probably even further but i dont know anyone personally who can hit such numbers.  I suppose the obvious answer is to pick the best of both worlds.  After you can raid buff to 9k-10k hps i would say it's time to swith the focus into taking damage better rather than piling on more hps.<br />
<br />
I'd have to agree with the above poster though.  AC is cheap in visible slots (relative) ... hps are cheaper in invisible slots generally.  Just find a balance within your budget/ability and run with it.<br />
<br />
10ac augs from butcherblock (5 total) are priceless.  You can also get 15ac augs in ferubi fairly easy (2 total) and i think even 1 in Wall of Slaughter.  I'd put those in all your slots where you cant put solid coals of prowess.</div></div><hr />

They drop off one of the easy named and are fairly common.  I was grinding to 67 yesterday and we saw 4 of those augs in 9 hours.  Also, a nice melee ear drops as a bonus, plus a caster-only ring to keep the finger wigglers happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rikam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cool yeah thorn gets to just around 9100 raidbuffed laa tribute all that fun stuff. Only hits around 1400 ac gonna buy the clicky ac cloak for him. Still working on his anger/yak augs before I work on the ac ones figure taking 10 hp less dmg &lt; then being able to keep the dmg coming my way=). Worst I have been tanking so far is Blob 2/3 and Va xi aten ha ra in VT. Most real gods we have our MT for I fall back around 3/4 tank most the time.  Thanks for the good reply btw last few posts didn't turn out this well=).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was wondering the same thing.  I've noticed that many of the drops I saw in OoW had more HP than my ornate stuff, but less AC.   What's the cut-off and what should my AC be at to tank in OoW?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I've been noticing that too with many OoW items..... I may just get them for the extra HP and take a loss in AC, then but the new clicky AC and it may even it out.  Try that, it may work well.</div></div><hr />
