<br />
It's almost as good as when I read a thread about a Shaman who said he killed faster because with slow his DPS would go up, because it changed time !!! :D<br />
<br />
Sam, seriously take a look on this :<br />
<br />
- You play 6 (six) characters in EverQuest<br />
- They are level 65 !<br />
- They even have AA's<br />
- You are within the top 10 of most played games in AOE and AOK.<br />
- You troll forums a lot.<br />
<br />
Jeez - How much time do you spend at your computer ?<br />
What happened to real life ?<br />
<br />
Hellooooo ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Quit EQ, sell your 7 computers, go into your bedroom and find out how many of the bed legs you can shove up your ass at the same time .. please.<br />
<br />
And no greasing up first, that would be cheating.</div></div><hr />

But to bad I already WINZORS at da RL! So its OH NOS we can't insult him to yuz.<br />
<br />
I have put the BoC in my OFFHAND to show my UBerness to all. I gots tired of the lower DPS and it dosn't really matter if the BoC or the OSoW proc goes off for agro, I don't lose it with either.<br />
<br />
ONly the top 10 most games in AOK/AOE, I whould that thought I was first for most games played on one name.<br />
<br />
I still have my SBoD and am thinking about tossing a Anger III on it and selling the BoC for PHAT LOOTZ! .... <br />
<br />
By the way I have 7 level 65 toons on 6 accounts....<br />
<br />
<br />
Well have you beaten Quarm? Have you beaten me? <br />
<br />
Naturally you will need a raid force to take Quarm, but again me it will just be your 1 vs my 6. ... Naturally you have better changes against quarm as part of a raid then against me 1v6.</div></div><hr />

Whats to repond to? <br />
<br />
Playing 6 toons is more fun cause you are always busy. I can't really see how you don't fall asleep doing just one toon. Ya there are no emeny Time Geared toons on SZ, I guess Poodles (ledgeds stuffs) is the strongest i have killed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, was just at Pantera's site (http://www.pantera.com) and it looks like thier last tour dates were in 2001...<br />
<br />
According to you, you went there 5 years ago...<br />
<br />
Wow, the biggest thing you have done in RL in the last 5 or more years is getting backstage passes to a shitty band that is only capable of screaming into a microphone and jumping around on a stage...That is VERY pitiful.<br />
<br />
Again, grats you on being the biggest loser to ever post on these boards.<br />
<br />
I bet your mother is so proud, but then again, you know that, as you see her every day, as you live in her basement after all.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work sam, and maybe in a few years you can get the big kids meal at burger king.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was ON STAGE at Pantera (as a dancer) for like 2-3 mintues, you can see the video at the &quot;video of me&quot; link in my signature. There were about 15,000 people at that concert (it was not their last tour, the one before that or so). <br />
<br />
Taste in music differs, you can say what you will but not many people have been in front of 15,000 people performing at one time. I'v seen Led Zeppline live, had 8th row center for the Stones, saw U2 when NO ONE ever heard of them in a show at a ballroom in the university when there were like 50-100 people there, and you could actualy touch the guys if you wanted to LOL.  And the show was FREE lol... Saw the TuLL thick as brick tour... <br />
<br />
Actually I am into EBM or Industrial right now, this is where I get all my music from:<br />
<br />
http://www.ebm-radio.de/<br />
<br />
Im 50 years old, naturlly I have lived more hours and done more things then someone younger... <br />
<br />
Im not &quot;cyber-squating&quot; thats my site and I own it (and Lowratemortgage also). Is The guy who got &quot;business.com&quot; a cyber squater lol...  Yur thinking of NationWideHomeMortage.com which is a huge company. Nationwidemortgage and Lowratemortgage are generic enough terms. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't eat at Burger King (They call my Pants Buger King Pants though - cause they are the &quot;Home of the Whopper&quot;). You might notice my &quot;Mango - Mozzeralla Duck creation&quot; at my photos at Yahoo.... A true gastronomical delight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh, Sam... You say you've invented &quot;The clump&quot;... that's just another thing you're talking out of your ass about. That RTS  game tactic of surrounding/blocking vital/vulnerable areas with high hitpoint, relatively hard to kill buildings to defeat rushes has been around before Age of Empires EVEN EXISTED, so your claim to have invented it is flatly impossible, let alone credible.<br />
<br />
I myself first encountered it in the original Command and Conquer:Tiberian Dawn, which was released in 1996, three yeras before Age of Kings was even released, and a full FIVE YEARS before your interview claiming to have invented the tactic. I have since encountered it in several other games, including Red Alert, Red Alert 2, Starcraft, Warcraft, etc etc, most of which were also released years before AoK was even around for you to invent the tactic with.<br />
<br />
Nice try, though. You might have gotten away with it if you hadn't tried to pull it on someone who has played the genre since its very beginnings...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to do concert reviews, and entertainment &quot;reporting&quot; (I use the word reporting loosely, but hey, I got to interview movie stars and musicians, so it was pretty fun) for a LIVING.<br />
<br />
Backstage passes don't impress.<br />
<br />
Having good seats at a concert REALLY don't impress.<br />
<br />
To each their own I guess.<br />
<br />
Back to VIRTUAL REALITY now, please ...<br />
<br />
BTW, this &quot;clump&quot; strategy sounds EERILY similar to a time honored strategy used in the RISK boardgame.<br />

<br />
Oh fiiiiiiiiiiiiiine Hulanta, sure, be that way !!  You could maybe kill more things with 2 toons over time than he could with 6, but, like, are they YOUR toons ?!?!?  And would that be like BURST over time, or sustained over time?  And quite frankly, would you look like r0x0rz doing it?  And is that like with buffs, pocket buffs, or like no buffs ??Cuz, like, ya know, if they're not YOUR toons that you levelled up (extra points if they are both named as part of the same team) then it's not the same, cuz then it's like he could like buy better toons and like kill you cuz like he could like buy your whole guild eh ?  Or is it liek, I forget... <br />
<br />
And I can't believe you say that people aren't impressed by the things he says.  I'm impressed... no... really... :rolleyes:  <br />
<br />
PS. I invented the jelly and peanut butter sandwich (note, it's NOT the same as peanut butter and jelly, n00bz) on my friend Colonel Sander's sandtable *ok, so it was my friend poosay's sandbox, and we were 4, but piss off anyways*, so don't fug with me, k ?<br />

PPS. Sorry.  I don't normally like to flame ppl, but I just had to vent at the sheer... whateveryouwannacallitness of Sam's comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
again, &quot;clump&quot; as described was used in Starcraft, which came out YEARS before AoK. Not like anyone cares about you creating gosu strats in a newbie game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Demo Games <br />
Here are some games in Age of Kings where Sam and others use his Castle Clump effectively. <br />
<br />
- Sam_DeathWalker vs GSF_, a Frank Expert. <br />
- Sam_DeathWalker Clumps in a 3v3 Game in 44 Seconds!!<br />
 - Sam_DeathWalker's Saracen Clump manages to beat Top DM Player _reznor's Frank Rush.<br />
 - Combined with Frank war Expert MaLiCiOuS_K1LLa, Sam manages to take down two of AoK Rated DM's finest players.<br />
 - Another Example of Sam's devastating Castle Clump!<br />
 - 3v3 Expert Arabia - Sam's Saracen Clump inevitably wins them the game.<br />
 - MaJoR_Eloff + MaJoR_Spike use British and Saracen Castle Clumpsvs DevilZ_Baron + _ZiNg.<br />
 - _xNUADAx_ + _xATLASx_ play against MaJoRs Eloff and Spike.<br />
 - MaJoR_Eloff uses his Saracen Clump against the inventor of the Franks in DM - DevilZ_Baron!<br />
 - Eloff vs fossil_, Saracens vs Franks.<br />
 - PlatinTitan demonstrates a much larger Saracen Clump.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some games in Age of Kings: The Conquerors where Sam and others use his Castle Clump effectively. <br />
<br />
 - 3v3 Expert DM AoC. Sam uses his Cataphracts to break down the Mayan army of mYsTiKaL_SouL. <br />
 - Sam manages to take down an Expert Celtic army in another 3v3.<br />
 - With the help of an ally Sam manages to almost completely knock out a Mayan opponent within 15 minutes.<br />
 - Sam's strategy doesn't work quite so well in 1v1 against Mayans however....<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are a few Recorded Game examples of when Sam first used his Two-Cell Clump: <br />
<br />
 - 3v3 Expert DM Game, Sam is able to produce masses of Mamelukes using his Two-Cell Clump.<br />
 - Sam's Two-Cell Clump manages to hold off an Expert Celt for 30 minutes.<br />
 - 3v3 Expert DM Game.<br />
 - Yet another victory for the ALMIGHTY DEATHWALKER!<br />
<br />
<br />
These are but a few of the hundreds of Sam's AoK and AoC DM Recorded Games. You can find more throughout the site <br />

Maybe you did it first, but then again, no one will know because no one in their right mind would ever think of admitting to it, let alone bragging about it.<br />
