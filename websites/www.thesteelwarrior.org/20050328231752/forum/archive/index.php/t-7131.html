<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed and beyond. <br />
- Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges. <br />
- NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously had difficulty with. <br />
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone. <br />
- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably. <br />
- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs. <br />
- Spell drops have been increased. <br />
- Increased the rate of cash drops. <br />
- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate. Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for this. <br />
- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards! <br />
<br />
Collision <br />

It appears yellow mobs do not actually dual wield, at least they don't succeed very often.  It seems like if a mob was white before, it's now a yellow that rarely dual wields so the difficulty is still the same (and considering lower attack overall it's probably easier).  ZEM doesn't seem to have changed significantly, but with more high cons you naturally get more XP due to the bonus for fighting high cons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The yellows you are talking about are the ones in the opening zones? Or do KT/Ikkinz yellows not always dual weild now either? That would sure make those yellow archers a lot more bearable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to vary on a mob by mob basis.  Although it's just eyeballing I'm pretty sure the yellows and even reds I run into today in KT/Vxed aren't anything like the old yellow mobs.  My guess is that if a mob was yellow before, it'd be red now with identical stats (sure don't recall old KT yellows failing dual wield).  If a mob was blue/white before, now it could be blue/white/yellow, and if yellow it seems to have reduced dual wield success.<br />
<br />
However, red Ra'Tuks are pretty nasty from what I've heard, since Flurry is now 4 hits instead of 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a slight bug with flurry in kod.  I was tanking some yellow donkey mob( the pixt graphic) and every time i would flurry, the mob would hit me 5 times.  They were all right after the flurry emote and i gained no additional swings.  As for mobs in kod, anything under a yellow i can solo if slowed, so their attack has been reduced by a lot.  Kod also gives 4-6% aa exp a kill in full group.</div></div><hr />

The red con mobs are considerably weaker than the yellow cons used to be. It was actually really good exp and definately  more manageable.</div></div><hr />

Agreed  :)</div></div><hr />

Ra'Tuks are never yellow in KT so they can only hit twice on flurry instead of 4.  Now a yellow/red Ra'tuk will flurry for 4 hits and that's a much worse spike than before.</div></div><hr />
