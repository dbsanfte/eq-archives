<br />
I saw it up on the hill on Saryrn server last night.  If you zone into Natimbi, face the water from the wayfarer's camp and look up on the hill just to the right across the water.  It wanders a bit but is easy to spot.  <br />
<br />
Supposedly the dwarf in the back of the wayfarer's camp behind the magus will give a reward if you kill it too.  My guild has been in elementals for about 2 months and I am wondering if this mob is a potential raid target so any information would help.</div></div><hr />

It seems hard now but within the month it will probably become like Grummus V2.0 or something. You guys will probably be able to kill it.</div></div><hr />

2hb, pierce, archery work fine.</div></div><hr />

Looks like I need to try to get all the guild tanks a GSoT4W, aug them with 150 DD from Mir, and then wait until the mob is fixed in a month or so.  Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
P.S. I can survive 12 seconds against her solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol<br />
<br />
Edit: Trollz kant spell</div></div><hr />

<br />
 No one has killed to my knowledge. Ainain from HnE posted on FoH forums that the regen was ridiculous. To the point of making her currently unkillable. Someone said they got her to 97%, for a second or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RavenHugin</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I for onw am glad I kept all my weapon skills up.  And a large selection of weapons too.  I may eventually need them looks like.</div></div><hr />

So how low did you get her before you had to zone Snowz?  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're not close to killing hehe.<br />
<br />
I stood toe to toe to her for a solid 5 minutes or so, the maximum we got her was 97%, after co-ordinating Harm Touches---for maybe a second or two.  She then regenned to 100% again.<br />
<br />
She remained 98-100% for the remainder of the fight with some seriously sick DPS being pumped into her, that would destroy any pre-god mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds like a fun fight.............NOT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you see them linked again see if you can figure out who made them and let us know how please.  That might be good information to have since I think everyone wants to kill the thing by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No doubt, that piercer looks pretty cool, But i'd like to see a link shot of it first instead of someone mining the DB.</div></div><hr />
