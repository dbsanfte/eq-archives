<br />
I have a few questions, so I'll just list them here. Thanks in advance for your answers.<br />
<br />
1. The damage bonus on weapons. Just how does this work, i.e. on Curved Claws and SBoz the dam/del is 11/18 with a 10 dam bonus. Does this turn them in to 21/18?<br />
<br />
2. How important is it for a weapon to proc to maintain or get argo? EB items not included. The reason I ask is I tried a little experiment in Torgiran Mines last night. Fellow 55 warrior and I were fighting, she was using Tae Wu War Maul with RBG haste, I was using CC/SBoZ combo with CoF haste. We both had SoV haste buff from Chanter. I let her get agro (I was not using taunt but using disarm and slam) when mob was at 70-75% I started using taunt and found I could pull agro. Is this going to normal or is it just the fact we were fighting Dk. Blues and not Reds?<br />
<br />
3. I think I have pretty good gear, but would like your opinions on what else I should get, other than lvls.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for you input.</div></div><hr />

A successful taunt does not add to your hate, but it instead moves you to the top of the hate list.  Hence, you started to taunt, and would draw agro.  If you want to let another character tank, don't taunt.</div></div><hr />
