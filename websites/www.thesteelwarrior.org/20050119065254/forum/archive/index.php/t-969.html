<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waeolwen</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently I run the role of offtank/extra melee in my guild with a 65 warrior MT'ing. I was wondering if I might get some suggestions as to which weapons would be best for the &quot;offtank/extra melee&quot; role and which ones would work best for the times when I am the Main Tank. I have a small collection of weapons (most are in the first bag visible in my Magelo profile).<br />
<br />
If I could get some people to look at these weapons and suggest which ones would work best for the aforementioned roles.<br />
<br />
Yraen - 57 Wood Elf Warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=313342)<br />
<br />
I am also looking for some help in choosing a new haste item. As you can see from the profile I am pretty low on strength and, therefore, cannot really get rid of my belt(Axgoreth's) unless I am able to uprade the STR in other places. I have an &quot;ok&quot; amount of money to work with. (50k with other stuff to sell, so most likely 100k+)<br />
<br />
Any help/advice is appreciated. Thanks for you time</div></div><hr />

Looks like you might be on dragon faction, throw the IGS into resist bag and get some Draconic Paulderons.  Easy quest, good reward.  Should help your str/sta.<br />
<br />
2.  Any haste will do for you.  Dit Ax's belt and get some haste.  a RBG will give you 8str and it's about 20-25k.  Also, the good stand by of CoF would be good for you as well.<br />
<br />
Just get some haste, and you'll be ok.  Your str will go up as you get more stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for aggro, seriously, get haste.  doesn't much matter what weapons you are swinging if everyone else is swinging thiers that much faster.  if nothing else, go quest that 24% neck slot item in LoY.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the weapons you have now, use the bladed staff all the time.  Sell everything else.  I don't think any of the weapons will outtaunt the staff, and if you're doing dps and gain aggro, you can just stop attacking (since you only are doing damage aggro).  Although that shouldn't really be a problem if you're second after a 65.<br />
<br />
Don't give up anything for extra strength.  If you can carry all your gear, you have enough strength.  If you can't carry all your gear, get a pair of cobalt boots for when there's no other buffs.<br />
<br />
Spend all your money on haste.  After that, look to getting another valorium ring and an earring replacement.  And then if you want some proccing 1 handers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I'm 57, click the pic to see my magelo.<br />
<br />
I agree with the above, use WMBS and GET SOME HASTE, RBB would be good. And also, try to get a Greatstaff of Thunder - better aggro than the WMBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waeolwen</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am getting very close to finishing my epic and will then probably sell my weapons off. I just need the scales, maestro piece, and spiroc blade to finish it. Been considering grabbing a CoF for haste.<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks all for the input. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zilden</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haste all the way and the more the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strength should be your last concern.  Mine is lower than yours, and I couldn't care less.  Ditch the Axegoreth POS and get yourself something cheap in the bazaar (FBSSish) until you can get something permanent near 30%.<br />
<br />
Strength means squat.  It especially means squat when you're comparing it to haste.  15 str will not add 21% to your damage output, but an FBSS will.  Understand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't say I agree.  Extra STR means higher ATK (I think), and more damage per hit, on average, over time (I'm sure).  After HP and AC, STR is the most important stat for a warrior.  <br />
<br />
That said, haste is critically important to holding aggro.  If you are using proccing weapons that generate aggro, more haste means more procs.  Whether you are using proccing weapons or not, haste means more hits, and more hits will give you a better chance to capture the mob's attention.  And if you aren't MT and are just a secondary damage dealer, more haste means you are doing more damage.  Almost all high level warriors will have some decent form of haste, and they might have self-spell haste (eyepatch of plunder, I think) too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haste is more important than  STR, and that's what the debate is about.  The amount of damage gained by improving your strength will not offset the amount of damage you'd lose by choosing Strength over Haste.  Choosing a 15str belt over something even as simple as a Flowing Black Silk Sash is the wrong decision if you want DPS.<br />
<br />
Will Strength increase your DPS?  Sure.  Marginally.  It's not a big enough difference to worry about.  Your max hit will be a couple points higher, but unless you have massive ATK gear, you won't be hitting for max very often anyway.  Get a strength buff from your shaman (+67) and you'll be high enough to not have to be concerned with it.  Maxing your strength at the expense of HP, AC, or Haste is not the way to be productive with your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">waeolwen</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the moment for haste I have Silver Chitin Handwraps. Should I use these until I can afford something along the haste of a Cloak of Flames? Or should I upgrade to one of the belts (RBG,RBB)?<br />
<br />
Also...What would be good options for my Face, Ear(s), and Neck slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, since you have Champions gaunts (+40hp, goddamned nice gloves) and no HP on your belt, you should be using your waist slot for haste.  Stats are last in the rank of stuff a warrior needs.  You've gotta get over the stigma that you need high strength, because you don't.  You never die because you run out of strength...you die because you run out of HP.<br />
<br />
So, having said that yet again, sell the handwraps, buy an FBSS (should basically be a wash in price) for the time being until you decide how much you have, what else you need to upgrade and so forth, and can decide how much you're going to dump into a permanent haste slot.  RBG is a damned fine belt for 25-30k, far less than a CoF will cost you, and in my opinion, RBB is crap.<br />
If you can afford a COF and have nothing left to buy, by all means, grab one, but an RBG will suffice for a long time.<br />
<br />
Your collar, mask and ears are fine.  Mosquito or Bloodmetal earring if you're feeling up to spending an absurd amount of cash for very few HP over what you've got.  Your profile is good, you just need to make the permanent haste switch and you'll be set except for minor HP upgrades here and there for thousands of platinum each, and the upgrade to skyshrine armor.</div></div><hr />
