Get rid of that ac'less ring, buy another Valorium. Your Shoulders, Range, and Helm could use some work too but they don't need as much upgrading as your secondary and ring. May want to look into the Loyalist shield quest too. For an upgrade to shoulders the Strength of the Elements quest would be good. Everything else seems pretty on par.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rather than try and work your 1hb with CHoS, buy something cheap and nonproccing. That way you can work it in groups with someone else MTing and you don't have to worry about procs stealing aggro. You also won't have to worry about the DPS hit you're taking right now using the CHoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just make sure there is another person in the group contributing to damage, because you won't be producing much damage. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the fastest way to skill-up?  Just ask the group you're with if they care?  Or can you PL the skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the fastest way to skill-up?  Just ask the group you're with if they care?  Or can you PL the skill?<br />
<br />
Well, the fastest way to skillup is to go to your guildmaster and spend your training point, although that will be really expensive if youre above 100 skill already.  You'll get 1hb quick enough just using it in a group and the group isn't likely to care, or even notice for that matter.  You'll hit less and your DPS will suffer, but like sassinak said, it shouldn't affect your agro too much, so thats the easiest way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahzul</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got the hammer and its procing decently..My 1hB skill was only 71, but after one Ldon it jumped to 96.  I imagine a few more of those and It will be high enough that I can switch the hammer to my main hand.. I also swaped out that ring of thunderous spirits out with another valorium ring of gallantry.. I still cant find those damn helanic tundra shouders..that would even out my toon nicely.. In my first ldon and it was an EF and I was easily tanking three mobs at once and keeping aggro without a problem nor didi i ever drop below 50 percent hp..  On a side note, IM using a nvidea 5200 fx 128 video card and all those damn necro spells were making me go blind..can I do anything about that and what would I have to do to block that out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarrabas</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Copper Hammer of Striking ... call me a n00b (well, indeed I am in some way as my warr is &quot;just an alt&quot;).<br />
<br />
But why should I pay 10-15k (depending on server prolly more or less) on a weapon with recommended level 56? I plan to wield my (maybe crappy) Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood till I hit 60 and can replace it with a Velium Gemmed Long Sword. Is the proc of the Hammer really worth the lesser stats?<br />
<br />
As already said - relative new to the warrior-business here. So corrections and advice always appreciated ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Venomous axe has a simple DD proc, and therefore doesn't generate additional aggro. VGLS is the same way... Pure DPS aggro. Our DPS aggro will NEVER compare to that of rogues, monks, berserkers, rangers, wizards, mages, beastlords and so on. Therefore, warriors need to get weapons that proc some sort of additional aggro to stay ahead. The Droga combo procs stun spells, which are very decent aggro and much much MUCH better than pure DPS. THAT is why the droga weapons are worth the price, even with poor stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we have poor ratio 1Her -&gt; our DPs aggro don't scale with other melee DPS classes, and of course as nothing to compare with a caster aggro.<br />
a stun proc is almost 10 times the aggro from the DD proc on your VAotVB so we end post lvl 50 with weapon that don't make much DPS but than draw aggro alot (more than the half of it comes from the proc on the best aggro 1Her). This permit other DPS classes to unleash more DPS and to kill the mob faster.<br />
on the oposit 2Her have great DPS aggro but their lack of proc (between 30 and 40% less, so DW end up with better overall aggro on long event, not always on short fight of 30s and less).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarrabas</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds logic ... So VGLS would just make sense when being in groups where I am the only melee if I got it right.<br />
<br />
Guess I have to rethink weapon combo and go for CHoS and SotBs ...<br />
<br />
Thx for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no you don't get it.<br />
the VAotVB/Velium Gemmed Long Sword combo (no augment) will do aproximatly 52 DPS at 31% haste and no AA but 305DEX and will generate anougth aggo to keep the top position if the nuker does less than 60 DPS<br />
while the droga combo  (no augment) will do aproximatly 60 DPS at 31% haste and no AA but 305DEX and will generate anougth aggo to keep the top position if the nuker does less than 100 DPS.<br />
see, less than 20% increase in your DPS but still more than 50% increase in hate, allowing Nukers to do their job faster (they can do much more than 100DPS at lvl 50, so you are the break of your group.)<br />
the more aggro you generate, the more DPS other class can do.<br />
before lvl 50 we must rely on DPS to generate enougth hate but after we get better result with stun proc and pure hate proc.<br />
so you RSHS is far better aggro than your VAothVB, put it in your primary.<br />
when you will have a CHoS, put it in prim and your RSHS back in secondary.<br />
when you will have proc aug, put it first on prim, then when you have a better hate proc move the curent one in secondary and replace it on primary with the new one... and so on till you have a mounstruous aggro setup.<br />
<br />
ho and aggro wise : BoC &gt;&gt;&gt; CHoS &gt; SotB &gt; RSHS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that's not exactly right. VGLS is never a good choice for warriors. You might notice my list included mages and wizards, for example. Their nukes generate aggro as well, and their DPS is nearly double ours. Shamans can take aggro based on their slows, especially if they are resisted once or twice. Basically, almost every class can take aggro from warriors, if we're tanking based on nothing but DPS. Use the droga combo whenever you're tanking, and keep a seperate DPS setup for those times when there is someone else is tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And, if you can't afford the Copper Hammer of Striking, get a couple of levels and grab the Great Staff of Thunder. Lol, I can't remember what level you can equip it (56?) but it's dirt cheap aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">07-27-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It may be just me but DPS weapons are fine from 1 to 45 but once you are able to use agro weapons to their fullest you NEED to get agro weapons. At lower levels people don't listen. Okay fine, you won't let me tank right, let me just do loads of damage then. Kill it fast because if not your cleric is going to be oom trying to heal your druid/rogue/ranger/whoever who thinks he can tank with a 20/40 and doesn't need to cast a single spell. And it's fun to impress the newbies at level 20-30 with 190-210 damage crippling blows, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Try to use low damage weapons for this, it's a pain in the ass for the (very bored) pet owner if you kill it.</div></div><hr />

I hadnt thought of that, I will give it a shot..I think that once my 1hB is up there I will swap it to primary..I keep hearing of the Drogo combo but havent a clue what it is?</div></div><hr />

*eek*<br />
/selftarget<br />
/bonk<br />
<br />
Next time I should get another coffee and/or read what I am posting before pressing *submit*.<br />
I could swear I typed:<br />
&quot;in groups where I am NOT the only melee if I got it right.<br />
<br />
Even better is what Fitemore said: &quot;If someone else is tanking&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
*shrug* - I'll blame my barbarian IQ on it.<br />
However ... got me a CHoS last night and going to work on 1HB now.<br />
Thx again all for the lessons in aggro ;)</div></div><hr />

Im hoping to get a better weapon sooner or later to replace the SotB.  Now that Ive actually gotten my 1hB up there, I wont be so limited to what I can use..</div></div><hr />
