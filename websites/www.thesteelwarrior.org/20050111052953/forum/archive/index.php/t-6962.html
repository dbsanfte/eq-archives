I'm looking at doing some simple weapons testing, and so I'm looking for mobs that require a certain type of weapon to hit.  Mobs that require magic-flagged weapons, such as ghouls or willowisps would be perfect if they had more than a handful of HP, while bane-required mobs such as Seru are a little bit too much :p   Anyone know of any mobs, say in the 25-45 range, that require a certain kind of weapon to hit, be it magic, or a specific bane, or something like that ?<br />
<br />
-edit- or as an afterthought, does anyone know of any weapons that do NOT have any kind of a damage bonus?  Or does anything useable by a warrior have said bonus?</div></div><hr />

Any weapon placed in the mainhand will have an inherent damage bonus based upon your level and the delay of the weapon.</div></div><hr />
