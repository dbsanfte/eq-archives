<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am having a hard time deciding if I should re-aug my Blade of Carnage with AngerIII or the Ykesha proc..   I am currently using a BloodFrenzy as my primary hand which is aug'd with Anger III.  My Blade of Carnage is my off hand.( I had it aug'd with AngerIII, but it poofed and GM's were not able to replace aug.)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you all may be able to give me suggestions on which I should put there.  I hold aggro rather well with my auged BF and just the BoC.  My guild is basically in VT and doing lower PoP mobs.  I play MA/SA varying on the tanks online.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated even if the option was not mentioned above.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I held agro pretty well with a Yak augged Hategiver and BoC unaugged till I got my Blade of War.  Your dual wield combination is better than what I had so I wouldnt think you would have much problem.<br />
<br />
When I got my BoW I didnt have enough EF adventures unlocked for an Anger 3 proc.  So I stuck a slimestone fragment of dread on it as a &quot;temporary measure&quot; since I'm my guild's MT.  To be honest, I kind of doubt I'll bother burning off the yak aug, I like the extra dps, the proc works on many mobs even if the stun doesnt, and agro is so good that on long fights I can shut off attack for a minute at a time if I want (i.e. the Clerics are fumbling their rotation and I want to avoid ALL riposte damage) and just throw an occasional incite.  I really feel the yak proc is = anger 2 and better dps.<br />
<br />
If you really feel you need more agro, throw a yak aug on the BoC...but I didnt regret not auging my boc and just waiting for a BoW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im actually going through a similar problem i was using an anger 3 BoC then picked up a bloodfrenzy which i have yet to aug. the BoC is currently better b/c 4 procs per minute on BoC is better than 3 on the frenzy (not counting WA) im sure the ykesha would make bloodfrenzy good enough but im sure anger 3 would make it better, but i keep wondering if anger 3 is worth the 400ish more points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a big proponent of Ykesha augs over Anger augs, but in your situation, I'd go with anger III on the BoC for when you want extreme agro.  There are times when you want the best and that's it.  You should also have access to a nice 2h to put a Ykesha on.</div></div><hr />
