<br />
Anyone else hear about this? Anyone got more details than I do? I'm going mostly on hearsay.</div></div><hr />

They get Fire Shield as a DS, and they get a similar gimmick called Burn ... I'm assuming the trick uses Burn, which is reportedly pretty potent.  My tankers (still fussing over which to keep) are Invuln/Super Str and Stone/Stone, and so that's just my best guess.<br />
<br />
But, judging by this thread (http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Number=412506&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1), it's a pretty good guess.  Whether or not this counts as abuse/exploit or not, I dunno.  I've no clue how bad the endurance hit is on it.<br />
<br />
For peeking into power pools, the Hero Planner from the coh.warcry.com site is pretty handy.</div></div><hr />

UYS roots you and you become impervious to a bunch of stuff - the downside is you can't move - unless you have teleport.<br />
<br />
There was another where a person in the sewers if you found a narrow spot you had a person stand in that spot.  Another person aggroed purple cons and ran back jumping over the road block.  Blasters then shot the mobs &quot;gated&quot; by the player standing there.  No idea if fixed yet.<br />
<br />

Burn was nerfed to high heaven.  Must have been a helluva sploit then. :D <br />
<br />
Dark armor is offset by the atrocious end usage.  And you are wide open to psionics.<br />
<br />
Basically, what we are seeing is the offsetting of certain powers from people who have levelled too fste in the developers opinions.  The devs stated somewhere on the beta boards that they had a certain number in mind as max level/hour.  it must have been exceeded.<br />
<br />
I believe the Superspeed exploit was primary.  Too bad SS totally sucks now.</div></div><hr />

you ain't kiddin :D first set of 2nd set of augment slots went there and stacked them boys up with 5++ end reduction aug's<br />
<br />
one solid fight of a group of 5 even level thugs ( 1 lieut, no boss ) dries out th endurance.</div></div><hr />
