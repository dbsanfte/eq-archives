<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just last night, I pinged 91 and finally maxed out ID5. I was overjoyed to think that I was finally done with my defensive AAs and could now play around with some offensive stuff. I was curious how many hp planar power would give me, so I plugged it into Magelo. It turns out that PP5 would give me ~ 100hp, in addition to raising my other stat caps. I am only concerned with my raid status, so all my stats would be capped. So here are my questions: <br />
<br />
Would it be worth the 10 AAs spent in PP for the extra 100hp, as well as the rather minor increase in other stats, over starting on my offensive AAs? Would the increase in max dex matter in any significant way for increasing my proc rate (and therefore aggro), compared to straight offensive AAs?</div></div><hr />

AGI is crap really, but will increase your AC but a tiny amount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm at 430 aa ......<br />
If i could get 100hp for every 10AA i make from today<br />
I would be at 800+AA in a couple of months.<br />
<br />
Getting 100hp upgrade for 10-30h of &quot;casual attention&quot; (aka grinding).<br />
Is an absolutely awesome deal.</div></div><hr />
