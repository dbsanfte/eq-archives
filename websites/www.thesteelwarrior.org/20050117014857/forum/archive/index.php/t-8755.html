<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amazar</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are hints that SoE might be looking at introducing solo ldon style adventures in a future expansion. I can see how most other classes could solo... but how would a warrior? What sort of adventures would you lot like to see for warriors and how could you structure them taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seriously doubt they'd make it happen, as my understanding is that the system for it would be a huge task. Not to mention killing the bugs...<br />
<br />
Personally, I dont mind havin a chance for a worthwhile soloing experience as a warrior, to test my skills, etc.<br />
<br />
But I despise the idea in regards that solo 'elite' classes should be given even more content to be pwning till the end of time. I say this thinking solo classes would have a cakewalk in their instance (as soloing is their forte), pure melees likely to not even bother for not standing a chance of completion.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt want to be the one to even attempt at making a balanced solo ldon where a warrior and say, a necro, would have equal challenge and reward in their own respective instances.<br />
<br />
The effort just doesnt seem worth the hassle imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they'd first have to solidly believe that 'classes are balanced across the table' which they'd never fully 100% admit to.<br />
<br />
with that; yeah, i'd be nice to be able to solo a mission. doubt i'd ever see it as a warrior though. every mob would have to be lt. blue/green with no-assist aggro and non-runners and non-spellcasters with no healing ability.....the list goes on :D<br />
<br />
but it would be nice. especially in my world on test server where there's not many people at all in my level range ( can count them on one hand almost, excluding PLed alts of 65's ). i'd benefit greatly from it in terms of experience and possible upgrades that didn't already belong to Five and Brutul :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The adventures would have to be completely different for each class.<br />
<br />
If the adventure is winnable by a warrior for example, they might as well just give them the damned points up front, time your character out for a while, and &quot;say&quot; you did it, cause there would be no &quot;skill&quot; involved in winning it other than being smart enough to turn on auto-attack.<br />
<br />
In regular zones (not talking about these solo adventures for a sec), the only skills a warrior can implement is knowledge of which mobs his HP pool will outlast, and which ones are going to come single when aggroed or if it's possible for his HPs to outlast tanking all of the adds at once.  Everything else is just random chance.  Did the mob hit me 155 times doing 8800 points of damage to me and I won?  Did the mob hit me 160 times doing 9200 points of damage to me, 123hps over my HP pool, and I lost?  Did my truncheon of doom proc and I turned the tides?  That's about all a warrior can do.  If the mob hits harder than you thought it would, you can't change tactics and revert to kiting... you abort the fight and run like a little girl or pray that the random number generator is kind to you.  You can't root the mob, back out and heal, then go back in for more.  You can't do anything within your power to change the tide of the battle other than hit auto-attack.  You can't single pull through &quot;skill&quot;, it's all aggro range through level.<br />
<br />
So basically, if an adventure is winnable by a warrior solo, it's also a collection of boring, timesink earned, &quot;gimme&quot; points.  No challenge, no fun, not much different than just pounding the plus button on the Windows Calculator... a freebie.<br />
<br />
The things would also have to be tuned to your equipment level, your total HPs/AC and all that.  Cause if it's just one set of NPCs for all warriors, based on level, then a warrior will lose 100% of the time till he has enough equipment to win 100% of the time.  Versus a caster who can kite, root, heal, use pets, etc. and complete these things even if they're undgeared at a multitude of verious different equipment levels and skill.  A pure melee has one and only one choice... kill mobs that can't deplete your HPs before you deplete their's.  A casting class however, can change their tactics and take on many other types of mobs.  If they can't stand up to the mob directly, they kill it a different way.  They use their skill at manuverability in a 3D envirenment to their advantage.  They use their skills at timing the proper spell at the proper time.  They kite it, they combat heal, they root and nuke, they back out and heal, they charm, they use a pet, they etc. etc.  Many many different &quot;skills&quot; a player can have and use.  A pure melee has only one option:  Auto-attack.  Equipment level is not a player &quot;skill&quot;.<br />
<br />
All pure melee would be in this boat, unless SOE comes up with something totally unique that's never been seen before in Everquest to bring some of the &quot;play&quot; back into &quot;playing your character&quot; when talking about soloing in one of these proposed things.  Cause as things stand now the way Everquest works, there's no &quot;skill&quot; involved in a melee soloing a singled mob.  The only &quot;choice&quot; they get is &quot;Do I hit auto attack on this mob or don't I?&quot;.  Their equipment will either make it possible, or impossible.  A caster has a number of &quot;player controlled&quot; and &quot;skill&quot;-based choices to make or break the fight in comparison however.  The caster actually gets to &quot;play&quot; their character to either win or lose, whereas the pure melee only gets to &quot;watch&quot; their character win or lose.<br />
<br />
No idea how they're going to implement this.  But it will be interesting to see what they come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amazar</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One possible way of allowing a warrior to 'solo' would be to give them assistance by npc's. This could mean that your warrior might team up with a npc healer (or other classes) and you would then have a 'group' situation like normal but with only one real player. This would mean SoE would need improve the AI model of the npc's quite alot to handle the demands. The npc's could assist for set enounters or for the whole mission as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so, in essence, kinda like Diablo2 ?<br />
<br />
that would be cool. i'd rent a little frog shammy to bot for me, and cook me some biscuits :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing they could do for pure melee would be to add items that do right-click healing or other effects needed, which poof when you leave the instance.<br />
<br />
For instance, depending on the difficulty of the mobs, you could have a &quot;Healing Orb&quot; that does a right click self-only 450hp/tick HoT for 6 ticks, with 5 charges, and see if that lasts you through the adventure.  The orb poofs when you leave the solo instance to prevent you from using it elsewhere.  The orb could be expendable also, and drop from various mobs.<br />
<br />
Have the zone clear your buffs when you zone in, and you have to work with only the buffs you can get from items within from NPCs and right-clickies, although you can use your own clickies as well.<br />
<br />
Exploit the right-click stuff and NPCs who will help you out (like the tutorial), basically.  It could also give new life to the Alchemy market, creating potions that would help out.<br />
<br />
It's not that hard to come up with ideas when you consider the idea that the right-click stuff won't stay after you leave.  It could be rather cool, actually.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
You zone in, all you have are the right-clickies you have on you.  The zone wiped your buffs as you came in.<br />
<br />
You may have Kizrak BP and legs so you toss on Shield and Health for some buffs.  You may also have a Bramblecoat right-click (from Servitor of Luclin). You right click eyepatch/kizrak gloves for haste.<br />
<br />
There's 3 human corpses at the entrance, one has a right-click 50ac buff, another has a Orb of Healing, 5 charges HoT self only.<br />
<br />
You fight through the adventure, finding potions and other items to help you out, as well as an occasional NPC caster/priest who heals and tosses buffs like Faith or Haste.  You can also find a right-click instant stun or slow, all expendable.<br />
<br />
You get to the boss and must use your defensive disc to survive long enough for the heal to keep you up so you can win.<br />
<br />
I think it'd be pretty cool, augmenting abilities a class doesn't have with expendable right-clickies, and they've already created some items like that with the right-click clarity and fortitude buffs from LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To give other class ideas:<br />
<br />
Rogue:  Mostly like the above, but make it where they must sneak past many mobs that are too hard for them, pick locks on chests/doors to get items/progress.  Make the stun items more common, since they could stun the mob and circle around for the BS (or give them a stun proc poison for the adventure with a 50% higher proc rate).  It would also allow them to put their Sneak Attack ability to use, as they'd be trying to kill mobs as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Monk: Again, like Warrior, but mobs are grouped (Forced to use the Phantom line to get mobs away from powerful named).  Highly powerful named mobs (too hard to kill solo) roam at times, and the monk must be FD while it passes.<br />
<br />
Berserker: Who really knows, probably similar to warrior though.<br />
<br />
Pure casters (int and priest): Partial rune clickies (similar to Bulwark of Vie), right-click mana regen that stacks with chanter (so they can use it for enchanters also).<br />
<br />
Int Casters:  Charmable mobs for enchanters/undead for necro/elemental for mage.  Large areas for wizards?  Various right-clickies like snare in addition to buffs, as well as pet weapons<br />
<br />
Wizard: While a wizard might only do a small amount of damage to a normal exp mob, a solo instance should have a good helping of mobs that a wizard can kill in one shot of their really large nukes.  For instance, they help clear a town of a band of raiders, all human, who hit hard but only have 4-6k hp, but a few that have 12-18k.  Or perhaps a cave where rogue wizards are hiding and it's your job to flush them out, meaning the wizard must use lures due to high resists.<br />
<br />
Mages: Defending a town against raiders could be pretty easy for a mage, who can send their pet in to tank and do more damage.  As could looking for a breach to elemental planes that freed more elementals.<br />
<br />
Necromancers:  The undead around the graveyards are being controlled by a fierce rival, the necromancer must end his reign.  Perhaps also an undead beast underground.<br />
<br />
Enchanter:  Adventures deal with random races, so to roam around within without being attacked by the ones you want to help you must illusion to that race.  Can sneak past enemies also by illusioning yourself to them.  Charmable mobs aplenty.<br />
<br />
Clerics: Mostly undead, but a few acolytes and priests that aren't.  Some mobs with very low hp, but insane resists (force to use unresistable hammer).<br />
<br />
Shaman: Few mobs, but high hp.  Must be slowed as well.<br />
<br />
Druid: mostly animal, large areas, maybe consider it an outside zone?<br />
<br />
Paladin: Undead, obviously, but focus on the fact that a Paladin can buff and heal himself (not many clickies needed).  Obviously mana regen clicky, but also put one Vie-type buff to help out with boss?  Mostly stunnable mobs, but a couple that aren't but can be pacified.<br />
<br />
SK: Mix of undead and live, clickies for buffs and some healing (HoT, for instance) as well as slow.  Just like monks, have a few &quot;too powerful&quot; mobs that the SK must remain FD for as they pass.  Also Vie-like effects for boss.<br />
<br />
Bard: I'm not sure, honestly.  But it'd have to be large and counted as outdoor.  Not sure they actually need them, but it'd be nice to have.<br />
<br />
Ranger: In addition to being outdoor, you could have ravines or other obstacles that prevent you from helping whoever you're there to help (use Archery and spells to save them).  Clickies for AC/haste/heals/regen/etc.  Higher ac named (due to atk buffs)<br />
<br />
Beastlord: Obviously clickies for mana regen, heals, and other non-shaman buffs, but this is one class that can handle most anything, so no real special need...except have adds so the beastlord must be able to keep both himself and his pet alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea they MUST work with is the theme of the class.  If a class is going out to do an adventure by themselves, they're going to go into their element, not something they'll have a disadvantage in.  A Paladin would be going into a Temple of the Undead, just like a cleric would be.  A Ranger and a Druid would be going into a secluded wilderness, while a Warrior could be going in to save some miners in a cave from an attack or a small town.<br />
<br />
A solo instance should be designed where the player has fun playing the class they selected, not &quot;melee/caster class #2&quot;.  Different challenges based on the skills of the class.  They're going to be much easier than normal exp groups, but you're dealing with the fact you have no outside help or buffs.  It's all you.  One class could possibly tear through another class's instances, but it should be challenging for the class it's designed for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they put single person instanced content in it will either be doable by the traditional soloing classes and impossible for everyone else or it will be doable by everyone and ridiculously easy for the solo classes.  There's no way they'll put forth the effort that would be required to balance single person content such that it's tailored to every single individual class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adventures are outlets to gain xp from the quest itself so everyone can solo, not from the mobs, you can have a warrior go kill 20 level 30 mobs in an underused zone and give him 3/4ths the xp he would have obtained in an average group once he makes it back to the quest giver for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thinking of instanced adventures it would be really cool if they added instanced adventures that were war like, for example you zone in to a Orc vs Goblin war, you control the orcs with commands similar to the coldain war etc.. You would have to be the 'Hero' also and not only the general though, like make the goblins level 40 and the orcs level 30 so the goblins would win unless you performed well strategically and participated the entire time.<br />
<br />
Would be fun to set up your archers and warriors etc.. for 5-10min before goblins rush your ass in a frenzy for like 5 waves then you would have to go on the offensive and take over their camp or capture / kill their general or whatever for the win.<br />
<br />
I would like those anyway not to sure if other people would<br />
<br />
edit: and they would need to disable AE spells in these instanced zones so we couldnt gimp it by rampaging with earthshaker.</div></div><hr />
