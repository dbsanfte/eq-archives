Could an Overlord over there please confirm/test?</div></div><hr />

Hehe, I don't play EQ anymore... but yeah I still have a bunch of DKP banked waiting for when I was waiting on a new mask.</div></div><hr />

Will try it on a bigger mob if I can make it to VT.</div></div><hr />

Buffed 25 Warrior - 1964 Max Hit <br />
Buffed 25 Paladin - 2054 Max Hit<br />

roughs out to 4.38% natural mitigation</div></div><hr />

4%? thats not good.  <br />
<br />
That's innate, ie prior to any and all equipment. 4% we currently don't have, and that's not good????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I can tell warriors cant roll a DB + DI *20...<br />
<br />
Correct me if my math is wrong..<br />
<br />
On live servers<br />
<br />
DB on Nexus Scrion = 254, DI = 90, Max hit 2054, min hit 344.<br />
<br />
254 + (19*20) = 1964, if that the max hit its not a striaght mitigation bonus but rather just cant be hit as max as much...<br />
<br />
What will be interesting to see if there is any differnece at the low end (like if the lowest hit is 254 on test or if its still 344, and if (IE Both roll a 1-20, but for warriors a 20 = 19 and a 1 = 0, 5 =4, etc etc, or if warriors just get a straight 1-19, and would be interesting to see the way it calculats that, if it rounds down all 20's to 19, or if it is a universal mitgiation, IE if u would ahve normally gotten an 18, it might be an 17.<br />
<br />
sorry for fuzzy math towards end</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone tested the other pure melees? Or only wars, hybrids, and casters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They likely just have warriors as DI-1 in the damage equation.  The only way to test that is to find the min hit on a warrior vs someone else and compare.  If a warrior's min hit is equal to the DB of the mob, then it's simply DI-1.  If the warrior's min hit is the same as any other character's min hit, then they just cap the DI calc at 19 instead of 20.<br />
<br />
I doubt they'd scale the damage from 1-19 instead of 1-20.  The way to test that is to see if some of the middle values you get hit for are the same as other classes.  If they are, then they are either doing just a simple (DI-1) or capping DI at 19.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ya i dont think its gunna be scaled basically thinking what you said, either DI - 1, or if its capped at zero - still interesting to see if minimum hit is changed tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Min hit and DB should be the same. It looks like warriors are going 0-19 while others are going 0-20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds good for Raid tanks i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seems like a simple reasonable change that's available to any warrior and useful in any tanking situation. No gear, no aas, no quests, etc.<br />
<br />
I really think all that was needed was something like this and increasing the rate at which taunt succeeded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Min hit and DB should be the same. It looks like warriors are going 0-19 while others are going 0-20. <br />
<br />
Correct me if i'm wrong - but on live servers i'm 99% sure its DB + DI*[1-20] not [0-20]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Couple questions:<br />
1) Are we sure this wasn't the case before?  Did anyone ever test this in the past (/testbuff 25 warrior vs /testbuff 25 paladin)?<br />
<br />
2) Has anyone done a /testbuff 25 wizard and compared it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The max hit for any given mob has always been the same regardless of class, AC, level or anything else.  This is no longer true, and that is definitely a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;It looks like warriors are going 0-19 while others are going 0-20.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's always been my understanding that the DI range was 1 to 20, not 0 to 20.  I'm not a tank, but I do still get hit a lot (I'm a cleric), and I've always calculated DB/DI values from min/max hit like this (calculating the formulas from scratch):<br />
<br />
DB + DI = min<br />
DB + 20DI = max<br />
<br />
19DI = max - min<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
DI = (max-min)/19<br />
DB = min - (max-min)/19<br />
<br />
Is this not correct?  I've never heard anyone say that the mob's min hit was it's DB value... which it would be if the interval was 0-20.  I can't seem to find the post about this on this board.<br />
<br />
Also, since EQ is based on a d20 system, it just makes sense that it is 1-20.<br />
<br />
Now, if after this change warriors *do* get hit for the mob's DB value exactly, then they just subtracted 1 from the interval, so the range would be 0-19 instead of 1-20.  Plus, that just seems the simpliest thing to do, in my opinion (I'm a game programmer as well, and it's pretty simple to just go put a -1 somewhere).<br />
<br />
And yeah, Min and Max hit on a given mob has always been the same for every person/class (not counting defensive skill being up), regardless of AC, hps, or anything else.  AC, etc, doesn't affect how hard mobs hit; it just affects how often they hit hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">tested with all plate classes (sk/war/cler/pal/bard) and the max hits for the warrior was ~4% less then the others. tested rogue/ranger/monk/magi and they all got hit for the same max hit as the non warrior.<br />
<br />
max hit for non warrior war 175 max hit for the warrior was 169.<br />
<br />
also there is a new buff box for combat abilities dont know what that one does yet.</div></div><hr />

You're right, that's how it works.</div></div><hr />
