Here are a couple questions. <br />
Im am a 65 war with about 4200hps unbuffed. Have CA2 CS2 ND2.<br />
I'm almost all ways MA. <br />
The questions are. Could a group of 16-18 peeps take out vindi,<br />
Yelk from skyshrine. and these type mobs. Normally 1 cleric and 3-5 druids all 60+ in kael quest armour or better. the rest are all 60+ maybe 1 or 2 58+ malee/casters.<br />
It seems some a reluctant to try and fail. Dont really understand why but thats the way some are. As new raid officer I am planning on doing these. We are a tight bunch and play with each other nicely. <br />
Just would like some insight as what to expect during fights and chances of winning.<br />
Forgot most a barron or better also. <br />

If, as you say, you're a well oiled machine and everyone performs at the top of their game, then you can probably do Vindi.<br />
<br />
No idea on Yeli as we haven't done him yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say get more clerics.<br />
<br />
2-5 cleric rotation would be a big help to you guys doing Vindi.</div></div><hr />

Dovan, will do. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, could be tough with that few clerics, but if you move all your druids into the rotation with a slightly shorter delay than you would use with a cleric, you might be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cozlo</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vindi is cake with 20 people.  And if we have more than one cleric, its not a challenge at all.  Typical Vindi chrot for us is 4 druids and a cleric, with shaman and anyone else that can patching.</div></div><hr />
