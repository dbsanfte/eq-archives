<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit the game for a while in november for a stint in Shanghai. Before I left I noticed some amazing new tradeskill armor in the bazaar callled Fierce Heraldic. Was gonna sell my granny to buy some, till I saw it was for Rallos Zek followers only. How I cursed for not having chosen RZ as a deity in stead of the Tribunal:p Untill I looked on Alakazam and saw Helanic Tundra armor. <br />
<br />
It was only after coming back in May that I actually saw some for sale and at amazingly low prices too. Even landed a good deal on buying several pieces at once . For most slots this stuff is beyone upgrading with mere plat. (Well, you can buy Ornate plate molds, but that s still not really a major upgrade)<br />
<br />
The boost this gives is pretty amazing....hp wise I am approaching a friend of mine who raids a lot on and who was lvl 60 when I was still 35, simply because he is agnostic. Sure, I m happy......but it all seems a bit.......unfair. Why punish the pre-Kunark and Kunark era warriors who followed the guides and chose to be agnostic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rolsdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG please dont start the diety armour debate again, it has been thrashed to death on these boards:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i follow Karana ( i hear you laughing ) and i don't care muchly for the whole deity armours thing...so what if RZ worshippers get w0wl33t0 armours. good for them. same goes to Tribunal.<br />
<br />
Agnostic? Sure; it was good back in the Day. Probabally still has it's benefts. Who knows. I'm sre VI didn't say &quot;OMG let's bend aggies over the table and make deity armours!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Give it time, Ornate and elemental smithed armors will soon dwarf deity armor.<br />
<br />
And just to tell you, without this armor there is nothing but penalties for picking a god. Anyone else remember getting killed by the dorfs the first time you saw them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">being an unguilded lizard is as bad as being agnostic~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">peh i mowed through more dorfs than John Deere mowed lawns ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shik is a dr00d~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LMAO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i follow Karana ( i hear you laughing ) <br />
<br />
No sir no laughing... I chose Erollisi Mar....just because of the irony involved (ol Verant had no tolerance for a sense of humor it appeared).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Brell here.  I get to share my armor with Pally wankers!<br />
<br />
/yah!<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Janus_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anyone else remember getting killed by the dorfs the first time you saw them?<br />
<br />
Yes :D All my gear almost rotted because I was level 4 at the time too.  I got my friend to loot my stuff for me while I was on the boat.  ROFL I avoided those guards like the plague for a while after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No laughing here either, I follow Mithaniel Marr.  Gotta love the mana and wis you get with Luminant Heraldic ;)  However, call me a goody toe shoes, but don't DARE call me a pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if you look at some actually kinda high end people they might have 1 or 2 pieces of cultural at max. for every slot i can think of a upgrade besides legs and arms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The Cult crap is great if you can use it, but let's not start a flame thread again..the last one was HORRIBLE, mmkay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heads up to the deity people -- agnostic ogres are still KOS nearly everywhere any RZ ogre is, except Kael of course, where RZ ogres get along just fine, unlike agnostic ogres. The RZ/bazaar twink thing still bugs me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yes its unfair, yes i use it hehe. i mean really, you posed your statement in the form a question, /boggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Janthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't know, I 'm a Zek follower and I find it easier to deal with then other factions...Sure the dorfs hated me, but that was easily fixed spending time in Crushbone when I was young.  Also, (with my dark elf illusion from the guise of the Deceiver) I can go into Paineel and also &quot;used&quot; to be able to go into Neriak as well even without illusion...I ruined that quickly enough though be killin the poor little inkies...I'm glad I chose Zek, I really haven' t seen any downfalls that weren't dealt with very easily...Though it does suck cause in PoK I'm considered evil so I get the dirty side :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My mother asked me that question once....once!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">At least you aren't iksar...their cultural sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">*waits for a certain well known smith to come by and say iksar armor is actually really good*<br />
<br />
yeah.. iksar cultural sucks worse than a splinter in your member.  &quot;Hi, not only are we gonna screw you on all pre-SoV armor, we're gonna release armor post-luclin and arbitrarily decide to screw you on that too! die scaley handbag skins!&quot;<br />
<br />
I personally maintain inner piece only through this - the fact that Verant has scrwed my class *and* my race horribly.. somehow, a strange balance is achieved and I find myself able to go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">still makes me some nice boots them iksar skins :D<br />
hell with yer armours...i need me some new kicks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">For all of us who don't worship RZ, wouldn't it be nice if there was a way which we could transfer some of that useless mana in to hp?  I mean, 10-15 hp/piece on the most of the other non RZ/Tribunal would be nice, but still give the RZ/Tribunal folks the edge over all.<br />
<br />
Well just a thought, I can still break 5k unbuffed w/o RZ, and I'll beable to break 8k-9k unbuffed w/o it either one of these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">All noble suggestions, but let's not turn this into Diety armor argh 2, mmmkay? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I chose Tunare and I don't feel overly slighted.  I just shruged and looked else where for gear with better hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ChrystianVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It sucks how they implemented it, but oh well, gotta deal.  When the cultural armors were released i was pissed that i didn't pick Rallos Zek or the Tribunal.  But come to find out, on VZ and TZ, Half elves can only pick Tunare, so i was screwed either way.</div></div><hr />
