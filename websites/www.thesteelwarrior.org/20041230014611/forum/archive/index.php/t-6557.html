I know Ghetto bash kinda sucks, I'm too lazy and I two box so the swapping a shield sucks, but is interrupting casters that big of a deal before kick stun and such?</div></div><hr />

Interrupting casters is never a bad thing.  Specialy if you dont want to lug a shield around for ghetto bashing.</div></div><hr />

The chance of riposte really offsets the advantage that using kick as a sun gives you.  It better if one of the casters does it.</div></div><hr />

Interupting that heal, nuke or gate of a casting is huge. Also the skill cap on slam is higher than kick.<br />
<br />
Should it be your only criteria? No. Play whomever you like. Play a char you can have fun with.</div></div><hr />

Slam fucking rules at so many points in the game.  People who don't have it can live without it, but once you've had it, it's hard to go back to weak ass kick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are kidding right? You would rather rely on a caster to get a stun off than use your kick button that has no casting time? The chance for a mob riposting is pretty low. You may as well turn off attack to avoid ripostes if you are avoiding kicking because of them.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EgatBearskinner</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought slam was a very useful tool for most of my playtime, plus it has a higher skill level than kick does IIRC so it hits a bit more often.  These days with the damage output of most mobs that I exp on, it just isn't worth the potential riposte damage although I always still lead off a mez break with a slam as I turn on attack.  Bottom line, I wouldn't factor it into my decision on what warrior race I choose to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved slam and even afer kick was changed to stun mobs I find that extra kick dmg is so definatley not worth using instead of slam's higher skill cap. <br />
<br />
By the way reposte dmg is way overated. I can understand not using it on boss mobs but if you are not kicking/slaming on xp stuff you are just paranoid.</div></div><hr />

I dual box a wizard, so i have no use for kick with a 2.5 almsot guaranteed stun.  Plus i xp in the 2nd castle of plane of fire, where the fire guardians quad for 4kish, a riposte there can get me killed real fast.  Im pretty sure its the same in the higher god areas</div></div><hr />

Really its not that bad once you get setup for it.</div></div><hr />

Ya right.  You guys keep doing that, I'll keep my slam hotkey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the 3 sec casting draughts weren't affected by spell haste effects?  I know they show as faster casting time on the spell icon, but I thought that they really were not affected.<br />
<br />
But you have a point I think a lot of people don't realize.  Wizards have a 3 sec cast spell with no recast delay other than the standard 2.5 sec delay.  It's REALLY hard for a mob to get off a gate with a wizard chain casting that stun.  It's called Draught of Thunder, and I'm pretty sure it works all the way up to level 65 mobs.  Oh, it also has a -50 resist check.  There's no caster that even comes close to a wizard in ability to interrupt casting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im not sure what the cut off is, but the cast time is 3.0 and with spell haste its 2.5.</div></div><hr />

If you did, it's very, very hard to do without.  Slam is the most underrated of all racial abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klinlin</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally would like to have a wizard stunning or a chanter mezzing on a caster than taking a chance on me missing on a kick...<br />
<br />
Usually is a wizzy is present I will let them stun cast cause it has a better chance of landing, and I will kick just as a back up....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stommper</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally,<br />
I rerolled my level 51 Human warrior to be an Ogre....for many reasons.<br />
<br />
1) With my budget, I couldn't affort great equipment, so the Ogre innate HPs and STR were like free equipment to me.<br />
2) I wanted frontal stun immunity...couldn't do without it after having it now!<br />
3) I wanted slam for interrupting casters...couldn't do without it after having it now!<br />
<br />
Since then, I've played a barbarian berserker to level 49, much of that duoing with a cleric, so I was tanking. Damn, I missed that stun immunity!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaven</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI I went Ogre, and I'm loving it so far, looks, stats, hp, slam, no stun, everything =P<br />
but it's a damn good thing i have a pocket shaman lol (shrink this big mofo please)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor Gnawbones</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">General question for those that can Slam mobs.  Is anyone having problems not being able to slam mobs?  Last nite in some LDoN's I was unable to slam the mobs.  My wife plays an ogre shaman and had the same problem.  Checking to see if anyone else is having probs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if it has anything to do with what you were seeing but I was having problems last night mainly because there seemed to be a lot of latency between where a mob appeared to me to be, and where it actually was.  I'd fail to taunt when by my perspective I was standing in a mob's pocket, and would get &quot;you are too far away&quot; messages on slam too.  I suspect things still aren't right after the 20someodd hours of downtime for Innoruuk over the weekend.  Go figure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hide/Forage = teh bestest racial skialz eevr!  Wood Elf 4 lief!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyzz</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There aren't too many things more satisfying than fighting a cleric mob and you just know they are casting CH, then hitting them with Slam and getting that interrupt message long before a paladin or cleric has the chance to even cast their stun.  <br />
<br />
Haas was money when he said that once you have Slam you can't ever imagine living without it.  Now, whether it's worth me paying a 20% experience penalty for is up for debate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, this may seem like its splitting hairs here a bit, but ughres do NOT have higher innate hp!!! They have a higher starting STA which results in some extra hp until that gap is closed with equipment or even AAs as they get farther along.  A barbarian, an ughre, a dorf, a gnome and any other race you care to think about, in identical gear/AAs in which all have maxxed sta, will all have the same hp. Stamina is actually one of the easiest stats for us to raise.<br />
<br />
Slam is an ability shared by ughres, trools and barbs. Frontal Melee Stun Immunity is an ughre ability. Innate Regen is a trool and lizzerd ability. Get the trend?<br />
<br />
Some of the racial abilities are more powerful and some less, and to counter them you can consider things like base starting factions (which used to matter before the release of Luclin and still is some concern to lower level chars and role players) and racial experience penalties.<br />
<br />
3-4 &quot;what race is best&quot; threads a week and people still struggle with that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katieah</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea what is the point of kick  it gets  to be a moot point once you get to higher levels, cause  in my opinion it doesnt help add aggro to yourself and it doesnt add more then oh say 15 point of dmg. I dont have slam on my warrior, how ever I do have sneak which does come in handy at times, how ever it pretty much usless once in a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">04-25-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea what is the point of kick it gets to be a moot point once you get to higher levels <br />
<br />
Not really, Some Illusions will not allow you to use slam. So using kick to stun still is useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real benefit of kick is that chance you get to interrupt a caster. I need to parse this, but it seems to me that if I land a kick during a cast, I interrupt that sucker about 2/3 of the time. <br />
<br />
I'd like to parse this. I'm trying to convince my wife to duel with me for a couple of hours and let me kick her while she casts dots. So far no luck, even though I've explained that this project is for the Advancement of Knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's no benefit.  Slam lets you do that at level 1.  Kick lets you do that at 55.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like was stated, nuff said. And I hate the illusions where I have to swap in kick</div></div><hr />
