Some say it is better than my BoC, because of the proc mod; opinions?  Does the proc mod affect the other weapon?  If I put it in off hand would it increase proc of the BoC?  If I got the BBotE, which is main.  I think the speed on the BBotE would be a bitz on ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The proc mod will only affect the innate proc on the modded weapon. It will not affect an aug in the modded weapon, nor will it affect innate or augged procs on another weapon.<br />
<br />
I can't say about BBoTE aggro wise, but it's gotta be pretty decent given the stun proc, procrate mod, and decent ratio. I'd take it to replace your CHoS, thats for sure.</div></div><hr />

Even in the offhand, it procs quite a bit.  I haven't played with it since I got WA5, but I would assume it must go crazy.<br />
<br />
IMO the stun generates a good amount of aggro.  The only problem, as you stated, is the increased amount of ripostes if you use it in your main hand.</div></div><hr />

With WA5, that thing procs like mad.  Its definitely a good investment if one drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really wouldnt spend too much time trying to get a BBoTE.  Considering the weapons you have, the augments you have in said weapons, and the availability of WA5, i'm not sure a BBoTE is worth the timesink required to obtain one (unless you're just plain lucky).  It's an aggro upgrade for the mainhand (arguably), but in my opinion not what you need to be concentrating on atm.  If you're having aggro problems get another augment and train Weapon Affinity up to level 5 (a must).  That in and of itself will do much more for your aggro than anything else.<br />
<br />
If it's a guild raid where you use points, i'd not spend em if i were you ... hold out for a BF or be content with the fine setup ya have  :D .<br />
<br />
I'd concentrate on armor at this point.<br />
<br />
Just a side note - If you're running the encounter that drops the BBoTE, chances are you will see BF's drop with comparable frequency, and the BF runs circles around the BBoTE.  I've seen warriors go months/years with zero luck on either of them ... rare as fuck.</div></div><hr />

Here here.  I'm one of them.  I prolly have 30+ Cursed Cycles under my belt and I have not seen either one of those yet.  Now my guild has 5 Bloodfrenzies that it got before I joined, but since I got there....nothing.  Guess it's just bad mojo catching up with the guild since they got so many early on.  :p</div></div><hr />
