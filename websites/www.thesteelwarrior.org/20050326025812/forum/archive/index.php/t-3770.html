I have been hunting in Dulak Harbor since level 50.  It has been a great place to hunt for a 2-boxer.  The boats are perfect for this and the loot/cash is great.<br />
<br />
I am now starting to get bored here and wanted to get some suggestions of new places to hunt.  This 54 warrior/54 shaman duo are my mains and they are not guilded (anymore).  I am a very casual player and proof of that is I have been playing these characters since Dec 2001.<br />
<br />
Where did level 54s hunt before PoP?   Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated of where this duo could hunt at level 54.</div></div><hr />

You can always level up on bats and bugs in Sol B. It is incredibly easy fighting. (no hps)<br />
<br />
Just park your guy next to the zoneline to Sol A behind the bats. Easy easy exp there.</div></div><hr />

I know a guildmate use to either use his shaman or druid with his warrior and he lvl'd right on up to 60+ and did AA's there for a long time.  Not sure what it's like since the revamp though.</div></div><hr />

Hole should be even better nowadays, and you can walk out from the dropoff via the skyway now, you just need to find the door key.<br />
<br />
At 54 personally I'd think Howling Stones would be an outstanding spot for duo XP.  The mobs in there are the easiest in Kunark for their level (far easier than in Sebilis), and 54 is right around the sweet spot for that dungeon.  Also, the mob difficulty ramps up better in the later wings after the revamp, so you could XP up to 65 in that dungeon if you wanted to.  You do have to get over the &quot;small&quot; deal about having to camp the warrior inside between sessions (or make gate potions to get him out).  With the POK book nearby, HS is not nearly as remote as it once was.</div></div><hr />

You can easily do zone in gobs with that combo.  The loot is so-so (nothing as good as seb) but nothing runs.  If you level up a bit and go deeper in there are some nice drops to be had.  Plus the zone is way easier to get to than some other ones...<br />

Anywho, good luck  =)</div></div><hr />

I duo'd there with g/f's Cleric a couple of levels lower than my Warrior for levels 54-56 with the Warrior. Did the lava entrance from caves in Gunthak. Buff up FR after doing the first 3 elements and run/swim along lavaline on left side until you see agro message...run back to zone and kill....there are the 3 elements, plus you can get another 4-5 Trolls and elements using this method before the three entry spawns respawn. 27 min spawn timer.</div></div><hr />
