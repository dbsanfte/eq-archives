How to configure Windows XP for Smokin EQ performance<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
1. Turn off all that crap in advanced Display settings<br />
<br />
They are unnecessary and eat up precious resources. Here is how:<br />
- Click Start, right click on the My Computer icon and click Properties.<br />
- Click the Advanced Tab and select Settings next to Performance<br />
- Uncheck everything. <br />
<br />
This will make the desktop appear as the old version of Window (Windows 2000). This will free up more precious system memory for use in your games<br />
<br />
2. Clean Boot and stop unneeded services:<br />
<br />
- Click Start, Run, Type MSCONFIG and click OK<br />
- Click the Startup tab and clear all of the check boxes unless it has to do with your ISP (AOLTray for instance)<br />
- Click Apply and then OK<br />
- Restart the computer<br />
<br />
Next let’s set the unnecessary services to start manually.<br />
<br />
Services are programs that run when the computer starts up. Some services that load are not needed and take up memory space as well as CPU time. It is best to sort through the list and read the descriptions to decide whether or not you need that service.<br />
<br />
- Click Start, Run, type services.msc and click ok. <br />
<br />
For instructional purposes we are going to change the the Portable Media Serial Number service to manually start. <br />
<br />
- Find this service in the list and select it with the mouse. <br />
- Right click and select Properties. <br />
- Once the properties windows has loaded locate the Start up type drop down box and select disable or manual. <br />
- Click OK and the next time the computer starts this service will not be loaded automatically.<br />
<br />
Below is a list of windows services that I recommend you change to the manual setting:<br />
<br />
Routing and Remote Access<br />
Alerter<br />
Application Layer Gateway Service** (only if firewall is not used)<br />
Application Management<br />
Background Intelligent Transfer Service<br />
ClipBook<br />
COM+ System Application<br />
Distributed Link Tracking Client<br />
Distributed Transaction Coordinator<br />
Help and Support<br />
IMAPI CD-Burning COM Service** (only if do you not use the cd-rw xp record support)<br />
IPSEC Services<br />
Logical Disk Manager Administrative Service<br />
MS Software Shadow Copy Provider<br />
Net Logon<br />
NetMeeting Remote Desktop Sharing<br />
Network DDE<br />
Network DDE DSDM<br />
Network Location Awareness (NLA)<br />
NT LM Security Support Provider<br />
Performance Logs and Alerts<br />
Portable Media Serial Number<br />
QoS RSVP<br />
Remote Desktop Help Session Manager<br />
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator<br />
Remote Registry<br />
Removable Storage<br />
Server<br />
Smart Card<br />
Smart Card Helper<br />
SSDP Discovery Service<br />
System Restore Service<br />
Telnet<br />
Themes<br />
Uninterruptible Power Supply<br />
Universal Plug and Play Device Host<br />
Volume Shadow Copy<br />
Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)<br />
Windows Installer<br />
Windows Management Instrumentation Driver Extensions<br />
Wireless Zero Configuration<br />
WMI Performance Adapter<br />
Fast User Switching Compatibility ** (only if fast user switching is not used or the machine have one user only)<br />
Protected Storage<br />
Windows Time<br />
TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper<br />
Task Scheduler<br />
Secondary Logon<br />
Print Spooler ** (only if the pc does not have or use a printer)<br />
Indexing Service<br />
Error Reporting Service<br />
Computer Browser<br />
Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) / Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)<br />
<br />
3. Adjust the memory setting in the Windows XP registry<br />
<br />
*******WARNING, REGEDIT IS FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY*****<br />
<br />
These tweaks are recommended ONLY if you have 384 MB of RAM or more.<br />
<br />
To launch the registry editor:<br />
<br />
- Click Start, Run, type REGEDIT and then click OK<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several memory tweaks that can be performed with Windows XP - all of them are located in the registry under:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlSession ManagerMemory Management<br />
<br />
To change either of the following keys, double click the key and set the values from 0 to 1<br />
<br />
Disable Paging Executive<br />
In normal usage, XP pages sections from RAM memory to the hard drive. We can stop this happening and keep the data in RAM, resulting in improved performance. Note that only users with a large amount of RAM (256MB+) should use this setting. The setting we want to change to disable the ’Paging Executive’, as it is called, is called DisablePagingExecutive. Changing the value of this key from 0 to 1 will de-activate memory paging.<br />
<br />
System Cache Boost<br />
Changing the value of the key LargeSystemCache from 0 to 1 will tell Windows XP to allocate all but 4MB of system memory to the file system cache, basically meaning that the XP Kernel can run in memory, greatly improving it’s speed. The 4MB of memory left is used for disk caching, but if for any reason more is needed, XP allocates more.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Choose to always unload DLLs<br />
<br />
Explorer often caches DLL files in memory for a period of time after they have finished being used. This can result in large amounts of memory being taken up by DLL files that are not even being used. To stop this happening, navigate to<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer<br />
<br />
Now, you have to create a DWORD value called AlwaysUnloadDLL with a value of 1.<br />
<br />
5. Setup another partition <br />
<br />
If you only have a single partition and no Free Space, skip this step. The partition created is for the Swapfile to reside on.<br />
<br />
In Windows, you have to create and format the swap partition using the Disk Management settings <br />
<br />
- Start, Control Panel, Performance and Maintenance,<br />
- Click Administrative Tools, Computer Management, Storage and click Disk Management.<br />
<br />
Make sure you create an 'Extended' partition in the FREE disk space and then create a 'Logical Drive' inside the extended partition. <br />
<br />
- Apply the changes and then format the newly created Partition. <br />
<br />
Note that you don't need to format the swap partition using advanced filesystem types like NTFS or FAT32. FAT16 is quite a bit faster than the other two, and since this partition is only going to host one file, you don't need to worry about cluster size.<br />
<br />
6. Disable Virtual Memory<br />
<br />
- Click Start, Control Panel and then click Performance and Maintenance<br />
- Click Administrative Tools, System, Advanced, Performance<br />
- Click Settings, Advanced, Virtual Memory and then click Change.<br />
- Click Advanced and select No Paging File<br />
- Click the SET Button (important)<br />
- Click OK and then Restart<br />
<br />
7. Defragment the drives<br />
<br />
- Click Start, All Programs, Accessories and then click System Tools<br />
- Click Disk Defragmenter and defragment all of the drives<br />
<br />
8. Set a hard swapfile size<br />
<br />
- Click Start, Control Panel and then click Performance and Maintenance<br />
- Click Administrative Tools, System, Advanced, Performance<br />
- Click Settings, Advanced, Virtual Memory and then click Change.<br />
- Click Advanced and deselect No Paging File and select Custom Size<br />
- Make sure to select the new partition by selecting the proper drive letter in the window above.<br />
- Change the values 'Initial Size' and 'Maximum Size' to the size of your swap file. You HAVE to specify the same amount for these 2 values. <br />
<br />
This will keep your swap file from fragmenting and eventually crawling. <br />
<br />
- Click the SET Button (important)<br />
- Click OK and then Restart<br />
<br />
How much swap space do you need? The rule of thumb is 1.5 times the amount of system memory and then adding 2 MB (unless you have too much memory on your system). In this case, make it 1 times or less.<br />
<br />
Enjoy all!<br />

I did that stuff and some more and my machine runs like it was built in 2008.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corpsed</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is server lag.  101 ppl in pofire, couldnt barely even loot your corpse, and swung swords like once every 10 seconds.  Pretty fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah no reason to post all that crap about client side tuning, this is serverside lag.<br />
<br />
Its been that way since the august 26th patch. There is also a post about it on FoH board.<br />
<br />
We experienced it during a Fennin Ro clearing; another guild was killing birds and we have like 120 in zone total. Took minutes from the time you agroed a mob, until it had made its way to camp.<br />
<br />
And rightclick effects that usually take a few sec to cast, took a minute too hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know how to get it fixed fast.<br />
<br />
 READ THIS DEVS:<br />
<br />
 While it's laggy like this mobs DPS is cut to almost nothing. They almost never swing. Almost never AE. Not only that, but player disciplines last longer. I had Defensive last 7 minutes at one point on FR event.<br />
<br />
 TEH GAME SI TRIVIALIZED!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">had that ultra serverlag on solusek ro in PoF many times now.  MT doesn't get a single swing for 20+ seks, fights taking 20+ mins bc of the cut melee dps, caster lag.<br />
 A group of 6 ppl seriously tried to kill babanoxis while 2 other guilds raided in the zone, fennin ro takes MUCH longer to despawn etc....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we had a day of it, mobs died though so i was happy lol. after you killed them over and over, i didnt care whether they were trivial or not heh. i was told it was because they were live patching though, who knows really.  we got our junk and went to PoW which was amazingly less laggy = p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just trying to help~  What I posted will still help many people, even if you seem to have a problem with &quot;all that crap about client side tuning&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been happening to us A TON lately.  We had to leave Fire about 5x in the last 10 days or so because it was unplayable.  Every time I /bug'd it.<br />
<br />
Basically Fire is fine... till about 65-80+ people and then it's completely unplayable.  We have missed a number of needed Fennin Ro's, etc because of this.  It really sucks that they can't fix a major bug like this after weeks... <br />
<br />
Have not seen it in PoE, but certainly a ton in PoFire and BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there's the melee fix grimlokk; serverside lag iz ur friend !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cursed ... without his AE, and doing pathetic melee damage ... IS STUPID EASY.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the rest of the snakes in there.<br />
<br />
One of the ones, I forget whether it was banished or exiled or glyphed, didn't even hit our MT the last time we were in there. Didn't even HIT OUR MT. The clerics finished the fight at FM, laughing and giggling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps its the instanced dungeons, which I do believe are set to run on the zone-servers for other zones, ie, the server that usually hosts dalnir will host 75 instances, and this other zone hosts so many etc etc.  It seems that the zones that were laggy to begin with are having some instances of dungeons on them, and creating further lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was doing it before LDoN was released.</div></div><hr />
