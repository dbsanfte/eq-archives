<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wigg0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When we did time today I started to wonder about VZ stun, we never cared about it and I know most peoples dont, but how the heck do you tanks avoid it? (Im a wiz so not really in to the stuff)<br />
<br />
lol, got so curious and been thinking about it for 2 hours trying to find out how you do and MT + all other tanks I know have tanked him in the guild isnt online! Not gonna be able to sleep before I figure it out :/<br />
<br />
EDIT: dont have my own SW account so snejked a RL friends :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You avoid it by not getting hit. If you are getting hit there is no way to avoid it. The best thing to do is have a /stand button and just mash it while tanking. You will get right up and more often than not still have agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wigg0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, that should work for the agro part, but what about his 30 sec stun? Ive never seen our MT get stunned ever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If they have solid agro on Vallon there is no avoiding the stun, you will get it. If they do not have solid agro, it's very easy for him to turn and stun/fd someone else. <br />

Collect as many Stun Resist items as you can :)<br />
<br />
Apart from that you just have to make sure your raid stays further away from VZ than you are - VZ loves proximity agro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most guilds use the pet agro rules to keep VZ on the MT. Your MT is getting stunned, they all do. The trick is that if a mob has more than 4 people on the agro list, it will automatically attack a player, it will not attack a pet. Keep pets on VZ to trigger this and make sure everyone else is at max melee range. As Kalorn said, VZ loves proximity agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">unload a 10 charge snare gland before first stun, while using furious and you should have zero problem with aggro from 100% to 0%. oh yes, and corner tank it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Proximity aggro is all you need on VZ.  You can be on top of aggro list, low HP aggro, and sitting down and VZ will still ignore you about 75% of the time if you're not in his melee range.  As long as you don't get aggro wiped by FD you don't  even need to attack him to hold aggro (not that you will be able to attack him very often if you have aggro).</div></div><hr />

I disagree. On several occasions when we were learning the mob he warped back to spawn regenning to full hp cause I didn't get enough initial agro, since he tried to path to the clerics who were outside the room. You still have to generate sufficient initial agro so your melees and wizards can unload early in the fight. As we raid time with low numbers (54-ish) it's even more of an issue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Initial aggro is very important on VZ but once you have any aggro on him at all, you really don't need more.  It almost seems like you produce enough aggro with just ripostes due to Vallon's Precision.  Yes I know you can still lose aggro on VZ but it is very rare.  Most aggro problem with VZ I've seen is due to aggro being wiped by FD.  I know I have actually forgotten to turn attack back on during VZ and still didn't have any aggro issue as long as I watch the FDs.  In particular it's very hard for anyone doing damage from range to take aggro from you.  I have turned VZ around while not tanking (so top of list), got knocked down to low HP, and then walked out of his melee range with 5% health and he never came after me.  <br />
<br />
Keeping aggro from other melee is quite a bit harder though.  The bonus aggro based on proximity for melee vs nonmelee range is much higher than melee vs melee range.</div></div><hr />

They nerfed the hell out of snare and darkness aggro, so this has little effect anymore, before though you could spam them and lock aggro np.  The best way to do it is A spam a /stand hotkey and B engage with furious up.  This will give you plenty of aggro for the duration of the fight provided you arnt fd for too long, as fd for 2+ seconds pretty much wipes aggro.  This fight is immensly easy to tank.  The stun is unresistable, but occasionally it doesnt land for some reason, probably lands on a pet, and gives you 24 secs to build some more aggro.  We normally kill vallon before defensive is off so our dps is pretty hard core and noone ever dies, unless its a chanter tashing one of the adds or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh, snare agro does not have &quot;little effect&quot; when I use it...</div></div><hr />

Tank him without them and i guarantee the same results.</div></div><hr />

I have, and due to losing agro early in the fight (90%) and killing a ton of our melees, the fight lasted over 5 minutes and killing me in the process.<br />
<br />
On TZ, we used to use snare glands for tank switching if he was evelated (no AE taunt) if the MT died. Worked like a charm.</div></div><hr />

You have to engage with furious to lock aggro for the fight and spam your /stand hotkey.  If you dont you will lose aggro as you said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brutalliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In my experience the proximity aggro along with the ability to hit /stand immediately after FD hits you, is enough to hold sufficient aggro to win the fight. I rate this as the main objective for a good VZ fight as far as tanking goes.<br />
<br />
Add to that the fact you can taunt, if needed, after each FD while stunned.<br />
<br />
Using furious, while not needed for succes, is certainly a plus.<br />
<br />
Now there is a small gab of meleeing after every 2 FDs where you can use your incite abilities along with pure melee, before yet another FD hits you, to build some aggro.<br />
<br />
To me it seems if you are able to stand fast enough you will keep VZs attention.<br />
<br />
I find VZ to be one of the more fun fights as far as tankage goes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">aspit, read my first post in this thread.<br />
<br />
we have no issues with VZ anymore, only deaths we have are on the clones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think with VZ sometimes being stunned again doesn't refresh the stun timer.  E.g. you've 6 seconds left on the last stun and he stunned you again, but you can go 6 seconds later as opposed to 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When we first tried him we could not keep him on one tank.  At some point our tank would get a full memwipe on a FD and he would go after clerics.  But this was before warriors had their taunt discs where they could effectively put a dot on him to reagro even when stunned.  Before, there was nothing you could do to get back on his agro list.<br />
<br />
We ended up going in with four warriors all trying to get agro and 6-8 clerics all assist healing with their fastest heal (SR I believe).  Worked like a charm.  It is almost impossible to lose the fight this way.  Tank goes down and it hardly matters.  All the tanks go down and it hardly matters.  Each person he killed would last quite a while even if he wasn't a warrior due to all the assist heals.  There was just no way he could kill the guild before we would kill him.<br />
<br />
We did lose a few times though due to the adds getting into the clerics.  Keep contol of those and it was no problem though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya from my experience, and I pretty much was always our first tank on VZ every fight we did, if you are already stunned by him with the 30 second unresistable stun and he hits you again due to the 24 second recycle on it - while it FDs you the stun effect doesn't stack - so once the original 30 seconds of stun wears off you can go again - till the next proc.<br />
<br />
For example<br />
<br />
Stun hits lasts 30 seconds - 24 seconds later he stuns you again but after 6 seconds you recover from it and have 18 seconds of melee - this cycle will repeat itself :)<br />
<br />
What is really nice is when your stun resistance take effect and you avoid the stuns entirely :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Exactly like Brodda Thep :)<br />
<br />
Tried 1 tanking, was a complete mess<br />
Tried 2 tanking, was almost a complete mess<br />
Tried 3 tanking, and ended up burning him to the ground.<br />
<br />
3 Warriors all going full agro, everyone assist healing &amp; full burn.</div></div><hr />
