<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcmongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick Question, i've just got my Anger Aug 2 last night and am looking to place it on my Sword of the Bloodsworn, whitch leaves me wondering  whitch weapon to place in my off hand, the Wind-worn Handblade or the Copper Hammer of Striking?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just my $0.02, but I think you should mainhand the CHoS, offhand the SotB, and scratch the A2.  Buy the cheap yak aug from lguk for the CHoS instead. Sell the handblade, people will pay more for them than they are worth to a warrior.<br />
<br />
Once you have more points, see if you're still using the SotB and aug it (expensive yak or a2 is a tossup, i guess)  if you haven't replaced it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wind worn handblade is not an aggro weapon, chos and sotb are.  If you don't have anything better it's a decent offhand weapon, but chos and sotb are both far superior to it for aggro purposes.  You might want to keep it around for a low aggro dual wield setup, but that's about all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcmongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok i'll loose theWind worn hand blade then,,, <br />
<br />
should i agro aug the chos or the Sotb,, or what weapon should i buy to put the Ang aug on&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you not read my post? If you really want to buy anger 2, put it on the CHoS. It's a better weapon than the SotB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">sotbs and chos are really similliar. as an off hander for agro only, go chos. but in your case where you are going to aug it and mainhand it. I would go sotbs. The stun can actually disrupt level 65s, so it is nice on ldons and bot etc. I also agree with yak opinion, don't waste points on the anger2, pick up the 100 damage stun nuke from guk for 510 points. Then off hand the chos. wait for a gbos/chsd/boc/bbote etc and anger3 aug one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">mainhand chos, ditch the sotbs when you get an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All of you seem to be missing the fact that he said he already bought the Anger 2 augment, the only question is which weapon he puts it on, not which augment to buy.<br />
<br />
I would only put an anger augment on the weapon that you will keep longest.  To me that is the CHOS, but if you think you'll keep the SOBS longer, then augment that.  Throwing away LDON points when replacing a weapon just plain sucks, so augment the weapon that will give you the most longevity out of those points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tribute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Augments bought from LDoN Merchants can be given back to a gnome in South Ro at the adventure camps.  He will refund the points you spent  on it.  GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And, just because there seems to be some kind of confusion, Anger 2 is only 510 points as well.  Anger 3 is the expensive one.  Slap your aug on the CHoS, put that in your main hand.  When you get a better agro 1HS then you can put that in your main hand and switch the augged CHoS to your off hand and sell the SotB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcmongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I put Anger 2 on the Chos, and Main handed it,, then i put a 50DD aug on the Sotb till I get a upgrade,, going to save my points to get the Anger aug 3 to put on the upgrade when it comes along.<br />
<br />
Thank  you all.</div></div><hr />
