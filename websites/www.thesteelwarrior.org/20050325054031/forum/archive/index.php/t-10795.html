<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VERMEIL</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Folks, I'd like to get some input on the DPS/soloability of a Protection Spec'd warrior, post level 55.  I fully understand what's what with talent builds as over my past 54 levels I've spent 100gold + in respec's just so that I could discover for myself what works best.  The protection spec was where I had the most fun, hands down.  However, since level 45, I've been a MS build warrior for the sole reason of being able to effectively solo.  I saw a SIGNIFICANT difference in my solo-ability when I respec'd to an MS build from my then Prot. build.<br />
<br />
All that said, I find myself now inches from level 55, and am trying to decide at what level I'll be moving back to the protection build.  I know 100% that the protection build is where I want to be for high-level instance, but I also don't want to hinder my leveling by switching too early.<br />
<br />
As a result, I'd really appreciate your input on how a warrior's DPS &amp; solo-ability is effected when utilizing a Protection build after level 55.  Thanks, and I look foward to your input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miron</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gone protection my entire career so I can't compare how different it is to a Mortal Strike build. I find I can solo just fine, especially if I go into defensive stance. I don't use food/bandages very often. There are still a couple problems -- and they might not even be related to how I've speced at all.<br />
<br />
The first is we kill stuff soooo damn slow that if you need to fight through stuff you'll probaly be facing the retardly fast respawn. For example I couldn't do the third Cauldron in West Plaguelands solo because stuff was respawning before I could get near the Cauldron. This was when I was 57 or so. It eventually took a Druid (Who wasn't that good) and myself and we just barely did it. A Rogue friend of the same level breezed right through because of his kill speed. If I had used 2h/dual wield I think the time killing would have been wasted sitting down eating/bandaging.<br />
<br />
The second problem is we can't take that one big mob too well. At 60 I can't solo most 55+ elites regardless of tactics. I would like to think I have good gear/weapons and I have tried the various tactics. Defensive and shieldblock seems to work the best but of course it takes forever for stuff that you can kill.<br />
<br />
With those two problems highlighted I consider soloing defensive spec good when compared against other Warriors. And just because I'm protection doesn't limit me in weapon selection. I keep a set of other good weapons to two-hand and dual wield. I do wish I could try out Mortal Strike to see how well it really works but I do not want to pay the double respec cost to get back to Protection when I am done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was Arms/MS to 60. I recently switched to a prot build as I started raiding. I solo stuff slower but the rate at which I bandage/eat has decreased. I'm also more effective against NPC casters - sure, my DPS has dropped, but I can keep them locked up with stuns for a good portion of the fight. putting a full five points into 1h weapon spec has helped DPS quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I definitely recommend grinding it out to 60, doing what quests ya can but generally avoiding raid instances unless your tanking duties are minimal. once ya hit 60, well, it's your call. ya don't have to go Prot heavy, either - a dozen points will get you some extra armor and extra shield blocking, which is most of a Prot warrior's raw mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would wait until your near 60 and/or in a raiding type guild before you respec.  That's what I did.  Was Arms untiil about 60, then respecced to Prot due to raiding and needing to tank a lot etc.  Never had any issues soloing when I was Arms, and still don't now that I'm Prot specced.  Keep in mind I do have 1 hand weapon specialization which gives a bonus to one handers.  When I'm in DPS mode and not tanking I'm duel wielding, and usually in Arms or Fury stance.  My DPS is usually around 150-200, but it can spike around 350-400 if I get a good execute in.  This is in Strath/Scholo/UBRS/Molten Core/Onyxia etc.  (mainly Onyxian warders, on Onyxia herself the goal is to sustain dps, not draw aggro if your not tanking and just uhhh live  :) )  So our dps is repsectable, not insane, but you can contribute well when not tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flanders</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with drac, except I skipped the one hand specialization and use a doomsaw for DPS (rarely do though).  Also lvl 60 and tank MC/Onyxia quit often.</div></div><hr />

10% less damage in def stance actualy =-\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireiina</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With battleshout up my character sheet reports a DPS in the mid 90's using a 40DPS 1h weapon at level 60. The real DPS is of course going to be lower due to misses and mob armor. However the real cost is that I have no skills that can boost it if I have rage, the best being either heroic strike (which sucks) or doing some more sunders (which isn't very satisfying). <br />
<br />
The &quot;wet noodle&quot; description is accurate enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly full out prot is a joke of a talent path. The tree defining skill is not used much at all, the stuns are neutered in seconds due to diminishing returns (thanks charge) and the myriad of abilities do not enhance your tanking ability in the same way that MS / fury builds enhance your dps. This disparity is why you rarely see any full prot warriors outside of raid mt's. The price you pay for a tad bit better tanking overall is very high considering it destroys your soloing ability and pvp prowess. <br />
<br />
Yes I can solo mobs easily, it just takes forever and a day. This is not an efficient way to solo, no matter what anyone tells you. DPS &gt; defense in that environment, faster you kill things the more xp, faction and loot chances you get. Downtime is almost non-existant with bandages a-pleanty avaliable, and if you're not grinding on humanoids for bandage drops it's your own fault.<br />
<br />
Pvp is much the same story. I see a prot warrior coming at me on my alts and I just point and laugh. They have next to no dps, and if they give up the shield that they invested heavily in then there goes all those points. I'd say a battle chicken is more dangerous then a protection warrior in the all out fights.<br />
<br />
The sad fact is that you can get most if not all of the &quot;worthwhile&quot; prot talents with only 15 points and still retain mortal strike. The tree needs major work in the 20+ point range. Shield discipline, imp shield bash, conc blow, imp disarm -- it all needs to be overhauled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(this is mostly for me to continue soloing with light tanking duties in instances if needed)</div></div><hr />

Just to be clear, the 10% he's referring to comes from 1h specializiation.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps this is the case when you hit 60, but I always duel in def stance and my prot talents help me quite a bit (conc blow, imp disarm, one hand spec, imp shield bash).<br />
<br />
As a side note I have dueled 3 different arms spec warriors multiple times and I shame them every duel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a side note I have dueled 3 different arms spec warriors multiple times and I shame them every duel. <br />
<br />
I don't think talents have too much to do with survivability in duels.<br />
<br />
I mean, they can...but in general, most people playing this game are just fuckin tards.  One guy in my group on PvP stopped attacking people that were yellow to him because there's just no fucking challenge.  Only way we can get a halfway decent fight out of anyone is if they're significantly higher level than us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may be okay one on one, but that really isn't a judgement measure of your pvp prowess. Consider when it's 5 on 5, or 10 on 10,etc.. <br />
<br />
The only thing that really matters is dishing out as much damage // or // having the utility to distrupt the other side. Arms and to a lesser extent fury warriors have the damage spiking ability that counts in pvp, protection warriors due to three basic issues really don't have the gang-buster utility that is required.<br />
<br />
Diminishing returns and the lack of an instant stun greatly impact your distruption role. Given the fact that the best way to generate that initial rage is with a charge, and said charge is a 1.0second duration stun, any subsequent stun you use on that person is reduced 50% each application. Our stuns don't really last long anyway, and well, this just makes them very laclustre.<br />
<br />
Weapon chains (and the rare gauntlets) negate one of the most effective counters you could have for a melee class, disarm. You can have all the talents in the world to extend this to 10 minutes but the moment you face a smart melee whom doesn't care about some red demonslaying glow you're at a decided disadvantage. Now barring all of this, even still your disarm really doesn't ammount to much. Most classes will just run a bit or also use their utility means to negate your advantage untill such time as the effect fades.<br />
<br />
And the most important aspect of a protection warrior is also the most serious hampering issue you could have in pvp - taunt, or lack therof. The entire point in specing protection is to tank better then anyone else, but without an ability to focal that damage to yourself it doesn't really matter. Taunt, (perhalps just improved taunt) has to have some type of pvp utility even if it is just a 1~ish second forced target change from another to yourself. Without it, well you know the state of prot in pvp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again this is comming from a lvl 40, and at that level my roll in pvp is to disarm/shield bash/stun/sunder when possible and primarily act as bait. In this case prot spec is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Diminishing returns only affects stuns within 15 seconds of eachother. Honestly how hard do you think it is to pick a target out of 5 that hasnt been stunned in the last 15 seconds? I use conc blow just fine in instances when I have rogues and pali's stunning along side me, Im not sure why I wouldnt be able to use it well in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I've been kicking this idea around too, I think that there is a possibility of it working if they balance the target chance with a spin to face said target, and then, add an icon to the player to prevent him from being taunted again for a certain amount of time, kinda like recently bandaged.<br />
<br />

<br />
Here's your problem, once again.<br />
<br />
Anyone with any intelligence isn't hitting a fucking plate class over a less sturdy class.  That's the case, period, whether you're protection, arms, or fury.<br />
<br />
So, given that, why WOULDN'T you want the invulnerability granted by intelligence, and the ability to fuck people up hardcore?  I've PvP'd prot spec warriors.  They stand up for quite awhile...but you can basically ignore them because they pose no threat to you.  They're kinda like pallies, to an extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently i'm straight arms.  After I finish up MS, cruelty 5, I'm gonna pick up anticipation and toughness and then after that, I dunno.  Toughness is really all you need outta that tree.  Revenge and concussion blow are just utter ass when you see how much faster you can generate rage with arms/fury, and see what the results that yields.  Plus Prot spec on PvP isn't a real bright idea anyway.</div></div><hr />

The moment they realize you're not an arms or fury derivitive you get 100% ignored. It works sometimes when I run up and start whailing away with my hammer but it doesn't take long to realise no deep wounds, no flurry message = protection spec'r. By then i'm usually only being hit by the random warlock imp, about the one thing I can kick the hell out of in pvp now days with 33 prot ;b</div></div><hr />

The fact that you use charge (as everyone should be doing) as a prot warrior means you've just neutered all of your stuns on that target by 50% - right off the bat. Show me another class, even another ability that gets nailed like that before the fight even starts.<br />

<br />
I'm just curious about your mechanics on switching weapons for an overpower.  I'm attempting to do thie same and the only way I can find to do it at the moment is to manually switch to my 2 hander, then overpwer, then manually switch back to dual wield.  So that's 3 key presses with a macro to switch to dual wield.  Is that about how you do it, or do you have a better way?</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you can use some advice on your skills too pal.<br />
<br />

I have my key bound to E since its right next to my forward finger. Overpower pops I press E click overpower I get the Overpower hit and one Swing of my 2h virtually simultaneously then hit my E key again and I'm back to Dual Wield. It all happens very fast takes no bag opening item switching manually.<br />

After I finish up MS, cruelty 5, I'm gonna pick up anticipation and toughness and then after that, I dunno. Toughness is really all you need outta that tree. <br />
<br />
Improved Bloodrage and Last Stand are both very beneficial. Just my opinion, but I find the need to pop Bloodrage in PvP alot. Someone gets and Early Root/Sheep and I need to intercept quick but didn't have time to get enough rage I'll pop BR then I can close the gap in a hurry without taking a couple hundred points of dmg. Last Stand is very useful in those times when you find yourself tanking a particularly tough mob and need the health boost or in those close PvP battles. Seems like a decent boost for only 3 Talent points.</div></div><hr />

Im not really crippeling my dps - im going battle stance until he choose to fight me and then i switch to defensive to make him fight more for a long time..<br />
<br />
Besides the stun diminisng turn thingy..here is a tip: You will have enough rage to keep the guy hamstringed all the time - i charge for one reason alone - generate more rage early in the fight. The diminisng return &quot;bug&quot; as i call it wont be affected if you can keep the hamstring on allmost all the time...<br />
So again i say some warriors here are not really playing to theyre optimal - and the ones saying protection specced warriors suck in xp - hah.. group with some good dps giver like rogue that cant stand too much pain and together you are dynamite.<br />
I agree protection specced warriors suck at soloing but i dont do that often anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you talking about hamstring and stun immunity together for? Snares are not subject to diminishing returns, stuns, fear, mes, charms are. That's another arguement tho, as they should be subject much to the same bs we have to deal with on stuns while root / snare can be chain cast all day long with no recourse.<br />
<br />
I don't see anyone saying protection is the most horrible thing for pve, I will stand by it for my pvp opinion tho. PvE protection is an ok spec, but it's when you compare the gains of said talent spec you realize it is nowhere near as effective a boost to your tanking ability as ms / fury is to your offensive output. This is where the problem lies in PvE, and all I want to happen is to have the tree given the attention and corrections it deserves.<br />
<br />
Pvp is a completely different thing tho, and as stated above if you're protection spec'd you pretty much are just taking up space in the current system. Sure once and a while you may actually land that full 5 second stun, or disarm that retarded melee for 13 seconds - but those times are few and far between. Justifying 31+ point investment when the gains for over 20 are near nil.. that's the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bottom 4 talents really need work.<br />
<br />
Imp disarm should incur some type of penalty, perhalps stat reducing in nature. So what if they're not using a sword, still a hard hit or such to the arm / hand should cause whatever is attacking you to have some reaction other then &quot;I have no weapon, /laugh at you&quot;. -2% critical hit chance or like -2% hit rate per rank seems a perfect way to do this.<br />
<br />
Imp shield bash should boost the damage portion of shield bash as well as retain the silence component. Somehow I don't think a 25/50% rank 1/2 damage boost is all too overpowering considering it hits for like 40 on anything worthwhile anyway. <br />
<br />
Concussion blow needs to be made instant, up the rage cost by 5 if really needed or just remove the attack effect entirely. 45 second cooldown will not allow this to be the poor man's MS, I don't see it encroaching upon that realm at all. <br />
<br />
Shield discipline needs to be made innate, have it's agro modifier reduced some and limit it's bash damage enhancement reduced to give no more total then it currently does with said improved shield bash I stated above. Keep the increased damage block modifier to like 30% or so. Tada, shield disc will finally be worthy of it's 31 point cost.<br />
<br />
Unless you've really played the full gauntlet (barring end raids) it's hard to understand just how much of an impact 31+ protection makes on someones character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point was you dont need stuns at all to be a good pvp tank with protection build - just switch to battle stance and hamstring - then if he hits you switch to def stance and let him smach you for 1000 years - if he ignores you then you are doing dmg alle the time while he is hopelessly chasing other people with less movement speed... Now tell me how that isnt usefull in pvp??<br />
<br />
Edit: let me add one more thing - I have an attitude that any type of warrior can work if you learn the strenght and weaknesses of him good enough and truly try to master your style. I could come up with more examples of how protection warriors can shine in pvp but I can also come up with examples how fury warriors will really outshine a protection warrior. So I will really conclude with the fact that you can play the style you want as long as you learn its strenghts.</div></div><hr />

Sounds great for one on one...though you as a plate class will typically be the last engaged anyway.  If youre looking to be a one man snare factory, I guess your fine.<br />

Every single ability in the protection line is useful in PvP.  Diminishing returns on stuns?  Funny how warriors can think rogue and pally stuns are useful, but ours suck due to diminishing returns.  Silence bash?  Come on, preventing a mage from pouring out dps and a priest from healing isn't useful?  Stunning casters isn't useful in PvP?  Disarm is worthless because some people use weapon chains?  Well if they are using weapon chains in PvP then their dps is lowered, how many rogues gimp their dps?  So what if they run around until it wears off, it then takes them out of the fight.  Utterly decimating a targets armor isn't useful?  Being able to absorb damage isn't useful in PvP?  Come on, do you guys actually go into PvP and find that everyone ignores you because you are a warrior?  I don't get ignored.  I step up first, people target me, and many aren't smart enough to target someone else that is easier to take out after everyone else steps up.  If I need to go dps, I swap in two 40dps 1H weapons with a 10% dmg bonus on each.  Sure, my dps isn't as good, but it isn't ass either.</div></div><hr />

Rogues can kill you in the time you're stunned, warriors can't.<br />
<br />
Pallies can heal themsalves to full in the time you're stunned, warrior's can't.<br />
<br />
Silence bash? Come on, preventing a mage from pouring out dps and a priest from healing isn't useful? <br />
<br />
3 seconds of silence out of every 12, on one caster. Not really awe inspiring to me.<br />
<br />
Come on, do you guys actually go into PvP and find that everyone ignores you because you are a warrior? <br />
<br />
The intelligent people do, yes.  As they should.  There's a reason why PvE encounters are very easy...the mobs aren't smart enough to take out the support classes first.   Your ability to absorb damage is lowered drastically when everyone who can heal you is dead.<br />
<br />
people target me, and many aren't smart enough to target someone else that is easier to take out after everyone else steps up. <br />
<br />
Like I've said a hundred times,  basing your PvP strategy on people who aren't intelligent doesn't mean anything.  I've seen people do some goddamned retarded things in PvP...it doesn't mean I'm doing something right, it means I'm defeating someone who's not as experienced with the game or gets nervous or whatever.  The people who give you problems and destroy your preconcieved notions of what SHOULD work, are the people who do have experience, and aren't getting nervous.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just something I was thinking about when considering a respec to arms<br />
<br />
Crit increase by 1% from weapon spec and cruelty is 1% average increase in dps without other talents to boost crit damage.<br />
<br />
Lets say a warrior has these dps talents that stack so nicely<br />
Cruelty 5/5<br />
Deep Wounds 3/3<br />
Impale 2/2<br />
Two-Handed Weapon Specialization 5/5<br />
Axe Specialization 5/5<br />
for a total of 20 talent points.<br />
<br />
first add the average dps increase from 2h spec<br />
dps == 1.05 of normal dps<br />
<br />
multiply that by average dps increase from crit % boosters taking into account impale's boost of %20 to crit damage<br />
1.05*(1+0.1*0.2) == 1.071<br />
<br />
then assume that the warrior has a fairly nice crit rate of 25% and add the dps boost from implale that comes from the 15% crits that dont come from crit % boosting talents remembering to take into account the 5% dps boost of 2h spec<br />
1.05*(1+0.15*0.2) == 1.0815<br />
<br />
now assume that deep wounds 3/3 will do between 20% and 60% of its weapon damage each time it lands (25% of all hits)<br />
1.05*(1+0.25*0.2) == 1.1025 (on the lower end)<br />
1.05*(1+0.25*0.6) == 1.2075 (on the upper end)<br />
<br />
so from 20 tallent points we get<br />
.05+.071+.0815+.1025 == .305 (on the lower end)<br />
.05+.071+.0815+.2075 == .41 (on the upper end)<br />
<br />
thats from 1.525% to 2.05% dps increase per point (not to bad at all)<br />
<br />
and thats just the increase from 20 points<br />
<br />
on the other hand a prot speced warrior can get 1h spec for 2% dps boost per point. this seems compareable to the 1.525% to 2.05% dps boost per point seeing as 1 handers offer a little less dps to be boosted than 2 handers do. <br />
<br />
any corrections or thoughts?<br />
<br />
this may all look like a huge miscalculation later because Im posting this after an all nighter and Im generally doing or saying stupid things at this point.</div></div><hr />
