I know the AC is a bit low, even for a bracer... but the rest of the stats are great, better than ornate even.   My question is would you wear this over an ornate bracer if you had the option?</div></div><hr />

hell, a Bracer of Benevolence &gt; that piece of shit</div></div><hr />

You lose 23 raw AC (36 or so actual AC), gain some stats that are likely dubious by that stage in a warrior's career, gain 25 HP's (call it 38 or so HP's due to the extra STA), and some resists.<br />
<br />
Is it worth losing AC to HP at close to a 1:1 ratio? I think not. The resists are okay, but in the greater scheme of things minimal considering what you're losing.<br />
<br />
This is just my personal opinion based on my own experiences, but I wouldn't consider the bracer of gore at all. Now...for my rogue, I'd consider having it when fighting mobs that AE, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />

That's about as much as I could find use for.  It's a terrible piece of shit that shows just how badly melees are getting shafted.  Look at the stone spaulders, the aged eearring  and the necklace....all of the casters and hybrids in my guild are wearing their quest piece from droga.  The melees are wearing BoB's, Fierce, or Ornate.  How fuckin sad is that shit.</div></div><hr />
