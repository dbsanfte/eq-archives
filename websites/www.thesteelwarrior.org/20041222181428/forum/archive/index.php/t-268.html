<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koralak</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, I know there are a hundred of these threads, and I have looked through many of them to try to get an idea on equipment upgrades...with that being said, I have just recently come back from a long hiatus, and before I left, I gave all my no drop equipment to friends to use and or sell. Well, now that I am back, they have gifted me with items to cover my naked slots, but much has changed so I was hoping I could get some advice from those that have lore and knowledge. Before you comment, I am trying to get cash to get another Velium Fire Opal ring hehe, that ring is just so I don't look at an open space in my inventory. If it matters, I am KOS to Thurdagin Dwarves and CoV, Ally to Kromzek and Tormax. Here is my magelo:<br />

As for my playing time, abilites ect...basically I am guildless, flat broke and get into pick up groups or am forced to solo :D (yeah I am doing well lol). I am looking into small guilds as I do not get to play often, at least this way perhaps I can find some people to group with regularly, anyway, thank you for your time and suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah. i suggest you work on getting back thurg and CoV up. unless you can get into a guild thats already doing ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thyll</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you intend to solo you might want to invest some hard earned platinum (save save save) in a weapon with Slow on it. Trungeon of Doom, Wavecrasher, etc. In the long run it will save you,  if they dont hit you as much as you hit them, you should win :)</div></div><hr />
