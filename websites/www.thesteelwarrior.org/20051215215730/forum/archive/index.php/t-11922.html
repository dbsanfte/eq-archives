At Warsong Gulch, sometimes I get in right away and sometimes I have to wait an hour.  Once in, omfg is it fun, but the wait totally kills it.  Was wondering if everyone else is having a pita time actually getting into a BG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Interviglium</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeap, I've seen the wait time at Alterac over an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
I think that was more the fact that there weren't enough horde to fight us.<br />
<br />
Average wait time is 14 minutes I think. (It's th number that sticks in my mind)</div></div><hr />

Horde low population server btw.</div></div><hr />

45 Min. wait here for Warsong, 1hr 1/2 for Alterac</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you guys are all Alliance.  Hmm, just threw up a little in my mouth.  I have only been two warsong three times and alterac once, but i didn't wait one minute for any of them.  And this was at peak hours at night.  Literally, walked into the portal and it said &quot;Ready&quot;.<br />
<br />
Methinks the gods reward us noble Horde...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovinity</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I play horde as well and have yet to wait longer than 20 minutes for either BG.  I tried entering as a group once, and that was &quot;stupid crazy&quot; long.  Approaching 1 1/2 hour before I dropped, went single, and immediately got it.  I think its really just a matter of there not being enough Horde.  Yet another reason to do it all for Sylvanas....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Queues are pretty decent as long as you're not playing totally fucked up hours.<br />
<br />
Note, if there's no alterac server up when you click on &quot;Join&quot; then you're gonna wait until there's 20+ people for both sides btw.   Just warning you in advance.<br />
<br />
Warsong, the wait is barely a few minutes for me, altho I see a shitton standing outside Morsharn all the time.  I dunno what the deal is with that, but I spend a very large chunk of time playing and just enough time waiting to take a piss and grab some food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play horde on Spirestone which is a fairly new (ie low-pop server).  The times I got in quickly to Warsong were during peak times (6 to 10 CST).  Beyond that, it'll say 9min wait and I'll wait 1/2 an hour before I give up in disgust.<br />
<br />
Oh, actually I was incorrect in saying I never got into Alterac.  The one time I did I accidently backed out of the instance at the zone in (cant do that in warsong afaik) and ended up back in a 1.5 hour queue =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">06-11-2005, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im on alliance in a high population server. Takes anywhere between 5 and 40 min to get into warsong gultch. Alterac usually takes 3+ hours of wating. I usually enter in a group now and we run do instance runs while we wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im averaging about 30 mins for Alterac.  Only done CTF a couple times so no real point of reference...say 30-40 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, for the most part the wait times for Horde are far more reasonable than for Alliance. this means the organized Horde groups are in there a lot. it's kinda funny because there are several good crews from three of the top Horde guilds, and a bunch of the Alliance pickups are whining on the boards that if they see people from &lt;Spite&gt; or &lt;Dreaded&gt; they'll just leave :p<br />
<br />
however, the Horde doesn't have a monopoly, at least not on my server. we'll go up against a collection of Horde pickups and just demolish them. it's really awesome going in with your guildies, giving those guilds a difficult time, then getting tells from the Hordies on Alliance alts saying what a good match that was. there are quality teams on both sides; in those cases the matches can go either way, and I kinda like it like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Horde seem to dominate on our server.  We did win a few, but its usually the Horde side that is more organized.  Alliance seem like pickup raids and you know how those compare to MC driven guilds that go in together.<br />
<br />
If you try to go into one of the AV's as a group, it'll take WAY too long.  Perhaps there aren't enough Horde (though my friend says they wait just as long), but the Horde side seems to be able to get their whole guild in.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if there is a limit on how many AV instances your server can produce?  Ive never seen more than 2 AV instances on my server and its High population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen 4 at once on a medium pop server.  Usually one though and long wait of 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">asmiak</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i play alliance on silvermoon and the wait for alterac on saturday afternoon (est time zone) was totally ridiculous.  almost 7hr wait when i finally gave up.<br />
<br />
ironically i got into warsong gulch in about 20mins</div></div><hr />
