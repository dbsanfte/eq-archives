<br />
move along :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Findra</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield is not supposed to work with either person having a /disc up.  Doing so is an exploit.  Period.<br />
<br />
Are they going to ban you for it?  Probably not.<br />
<br />
Should you /bug it?  Absolutely<br />
<br />
Does it need to get fixed so that raid level encounters are not trivalized?  Absolutely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Payn, originally /shield did not work with other discs because you could potentially /shield someone while you had /def activated, thereby, not only reducing the damage to the MT, but also mitigating the damage absorbed from the MT. Also, if the MT had /def on as well, the entire damage output could be reducued greatly.<br />
<br />
In addition, if /shield stacked with discs, then they could stack with each other, in other words, have 4 warriors, all /def'd, and all /shield the MT who is /def'd...<br />
<br />
The scenarios for trivializing encounters were enormous.<br />
<br />
To that end, /shield was not intended to stack with any other discs, the fact that they do now is an oversight, and not working as intended :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, didn't think of the high level encounters doing this to share dmg on uber mobs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO they should change it so that /shield works with everything except for the defensive disciplines like furious, fortitude, defensive, evasive, and stonewall.  Those should cancel out /shield but everything else should work with it.  Those are the only discs that could be use to exploit it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe it was stated by SoE when /shield was introduced that this indeed was the design (shield would NOT stack with anything).  Bet this is an oversight (err failure of QA) to look at all the ramifications of the discipline changes last month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bohkah</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I might of missed an update.  Definately /bug it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand, the timers for /shield and /disc are not on speaking terms.  We tried an experiment on a raid where we started with a warrior /shielding the MT so that after /shield ended he could go /disc defensive and we'd have additional time to kill the mob without having to swap tanks.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, for a few seconds after /shield ended, the MT could not engage /disc defensive due to this bug and we lost him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been messing with shielding the MT a bit lately.  It's not so bad, I haven't died because of it... and it's sort of fun, at least something to do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a bug,  it's been fixed on beta, and probably on test, if not live servers with the patch last nite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that its even that big a deal. It is still inefficient to use. While the MT gets a big reduction in damage, the mob is still kicking the shit out of the shielder and stonewall will NOT mitigate damage he takes from shielding the MT. <br />
<br />
So the mob is still doing more damage than if it was just one warrior tanking with defensive anyway, its just the MT is taking drastically less damage but you would still need additional healing to keep the shielder up.<br />
<br />
Like if a mob would hit the MT for 2000 normally, with stonewall it hits for 1k then being shielded he takes 500. But the shielder is still taking 750. So between the two of them, the total damage is 1250. Still retains that 25% inefficiency. <br />
<br />
Now it does increase the survivability of the MT, but you have to devote additional resources to keeping the shielder up now to.<br />
<br />
If stonewall would mitigate the incoming damage to the shielder, THAN it would be a pretty impressive exploit. But since it doesnt, it really isnt all that exciting in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
