<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to list the weapons I have and what combination I use them in for what I 'think' is the best.  Need opinions to see if people disagree/agree.<br />
<br />
Usually I use:<br />
<br />
Primary<br />
Guard Captain`s Mallet<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Blunt  Atk Delay: 20<br />
DMG: 11  <br />
DEX: +6  AGI: +6  HP: +45  <br />
<br />
Secondary<br />
Centi Longsword<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Slashing  Atk Delay: 27<br />
DMG: 14  <br />
STR: +8  STA: +8  <br />
<br />
<br />
Mostly I think this is My best DPS as the only other weapon I own is a jade mace.  for Agro I use the following:<br />
<br />
Primary<br />
Jade Mace<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Blunt  Atk Delay: 18<br />
DMG: 9 <br />
<br />
Secondary<br />
Guard Captain`s Mallet<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Blunt  Atk Delay: 20<br />
DMG: 11  <br />
DEX: +6  AGI: +6  HP: +45  <br />
<br />
Is this correct? for Best Agro?  Also someone mentinoed that this would also be my best DPS combo out of the 3 weapons.  Is that right?  I also had one more question.  If I got a Barnacle Covered Axe which I see has a +100 Hate on the proc.. where should I put that for agro combo with the rest of my weapons?  BCA and Mallet?  thanks for any help in advanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure a 9/18 is better than a 11/20 in PRIMARY hand, either way is going to be very close so I'd use a 11/20 for damage.<br />
<br />
You 'd probably want a proc on your primary weapon.. I've been in PoN all day , and honestly warriors are completely shafted on taunt in those zones, and the only time I get back aggro when I loose it is when the Frostbringer procs in primary.<br />
<br />
I would only use the Centi LS in off hand for the DPS, nothing else. You will get outtaunted anyway no matter what  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you are saying????  Jademace/mallet for best option in agro and BCA and Mallet for proc agro later oN?  Sorry just not getting your suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velyssa</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the other poster was suggesting is you might want to look at saving up for a weapon to use in your mainhand that has a proc.  There comes a point when weapon's speed/damage doesn't cut it anymore for aggro.<br />
<br />
That aside, I always put my fastest weapon with the least distance between damage/delay in my main hand if I don't have a proc.<br />
<br />
So, Jade Mace in main and either of the other two in off.  Just a suggestion.  Someone will come along in a minute and tell me I'm wrong. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell your two weapons and buy a Reaver: 40/40. You ought to be able to buy it from what you sell the GCM and Jade Mace for, if your server is anything like mine. <br />
<br />
Your aggro and damage problem will be solved until you enter the planes (and even there you'll hold aggro decently if the group knows what they are doing).</div></div><hr />
