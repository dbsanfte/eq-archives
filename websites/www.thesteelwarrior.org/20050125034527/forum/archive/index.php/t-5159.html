<br />
In a nutshell, I am now at the point where i need a good two handed weapon because I'm about to start getting riposted more often. I'm moving to PoP for exp, I do LDoN when I can, but that's not feasible when I'm on call.<br />
<br />
For starters, I flat out don't want to use a 2hb. If I wanted to use one of those I could bring my monk out of retirement. For role-play reasons and looks, it has to be a sword.<br />
<br />
Additionally, this go round I am not going to be in a raid guild so this sword needs to come from the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I really don't want a windblade. Not only do I not care for how they look, they are way overpriced right now.<br />
<br />
Soo.. what else can I get? I will have around 80k to spend tops, and don't mind spending it all if need be. I don't care about getting the absolute best dps, because I'm not a min/max type.. but I want to get a solid dps weapon that will provide me with the aggro I need.<br />
<br />
To cut to the chase: what else is out there that is droppable and good besides the windblade? Currently using widebladed greatsword, and that is clearly not the way to go.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice naginata look, roughly same DPS as the windblade, cheap.<br />
<br />
get a ykehsa or angerIII augment on it and you'll have something rather nice i'd say :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
please remember, would really prefer an actual sword graphic<br />
<br />
plus having forced more than a couple hamsters through the habittrail of leveling, I tend to level fast.. so I realize what I have is good now, was looking forward to the next 14 levels plus AA..<br />
<br />
thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are not many good 2h options, even for people who have a casual raid schedule.<br />
<br />
If you can't do NToV and swipe a sword of the sky off Vyemm, and can't do that fucker that drops the Norge'Tal in Ssra, then you're basically stuck with the Windblade and the greatstaff of thunder as your best 2h options, and everything trickles down from there.<br />
<br />
I really wish they'd add a nice 1/1 ratio 2h with an aggro proc from a 1 or 2 group encounter.   I don't wanna have to buy LDoN just to make my windblade usable to to tank with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, gotten a few of these off the Seer.  My only complaint with it is that it looks like ass.  To me it's in the same category as the GSoT.  It might do the job, but I ain't toting that thing around :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to look badass, go to elemental island in twilight sea. They drop spiny weapons. All of them look pretty pimp, but the two-handed sword graphic will make you look like a rockstar. The downside is that the weapons fucking suck. Think tarnished, and you'll be in the same ballpark.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the coin, you have the windblade. Good DPS, but it looks like the piece of shit Gimli carries around on his back in the last LoTR movie.<br />
<br />
With bazaar weapons, you're going to look about as cool as everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he can get epic, it would be easier to get the Twisted Steel Bastard Sword off Eashan in ToV or the Gauldrek, Sword of the Sky off Vyemm in NToV that Haass mentioned.  Both are easy to get now compared to when Velious first  came out and both are very good DPS.  Slap Anger 3 on either of them and you will have a very nice weapon.  The GSotS from Vyemm has a 179 dd unresistable proc and is the harder of the 2 to get but either one is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a sword called Shadowflame that drops in sol C, it has a pretty nice graphic and is really easy to get. It's something like 41/43. The graphic is same as spiny weapons and BBB. And of course there's the 2h epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way as far as looks go, the sword from Vyemm beats Eashen's sword. TWBS just looks totally plain. simple wooden handle, thin kinda short blade. But then again, some people like that kind of stuff.</div></div><hr />
