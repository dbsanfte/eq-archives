I would like to try and pick one up before the droga revamp goes live, and i have never seen him, even when fac farming with alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only time I saw him was just after you leave the Warder area heading for the zone out.  You go underneath an overhead walkway and through a short tunnel which opens into a larger room with doors on both sides.  He was in this area by the door on the left.  At the end of this area I am referring to is the ramps starting your climb up to the zoneout.  Not sure if it is a random spawn or fixed though.  I only saw him one time while farming faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Up to what level mobs will this thing work against?  I guess I mean if its worth the trouble for a higher level warrior to bother with........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumptimax</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will work on any level mob of course. once your 60+ its 25% slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things I would consider before bothering with it.<br />
<br />
1.  Primary only iirc<br />
2.  6 Dam / 27 Delay iirc<br />
<br />
For the 25% slow to be &quot;efficient&quot; you would have to proc it immediately or not have weapons that outdamage this by enough to negate the benefit of the slow.  By level 60 I think the last part is a big stretch of the imagination.  If you proc slow (not resisted) halfway through the fight on average, how much DPS have you lost and how much longer has the mob been alive and beating on you because you are gimping your damage output?<br />
<br />
This is why I only really deem the Willsapper and Truncheon of Doom as viable slowing weapons for warriors.  They have decent ratios and higher % slows to make up for the slight loss in DPS they result in.  IMO, the Wavecrasher doesn't make up for the crappy ratio it has with the slow.  It should be used mainly for aggro IMO.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said, I always wanted a Wurmslayer as a younger warrior but by the time I could do the quest I had better.  This looks exactly like a Wurmslayer so it has some nostalgia associated with it for me.</div></div><hr />
