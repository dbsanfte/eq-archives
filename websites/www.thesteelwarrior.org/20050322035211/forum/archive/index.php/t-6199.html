EverQuest Creator Announces New MMORPG, &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot;<br />
<br />
    REDMOND, Wash. - March 16, 2004 - Microsoft® Game Studios and Sigil Games Online Inc. today announced that &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes,&quot; a next-generation massively multiplayer role-playing game (MMORPG), is currently in development for the Windows® platform. Brad McQuaid, one of the game industry's most renowned designers and co-creator of &quot;EverQuest,&quot; is leading a star-studded team of MMORPG veterans to create the next evolution in the genre.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Sigil's unparalleled expertise and experience in the field will bring groundbreaking advances to the genre,&quot; said McQuaid, president and CEO of Sigil Games Online. &quot;In recent years we've become concerned with a growing trend to water down gameplay in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience. At Sigil, we're designing our game for the existing MMORPG gamer who is looking for both new challenges and new rewards. On one level, 'Vanguard' combines everything we've learned from MMORPGs: their strengths, their deficiencies and how to address them. Even more important, we plan to introduce a whole new level of gameplay that represents, in our opinion, the logical evolution of the MMORPG genre.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The &quot;Vanguard&quot; team includes McQuaid and Steve Clover, both of whom co-authored the original design document and led the design team for &quot;EverQuest.&quot; McQuaid then served as the producer on &quot;EverQuest,&quot; with Clover driving development as lead programmer. Working with McQuaid as &quot;Vanguard's&quot; co-producer is Jeff Butler, who also co-produced the &quot;EverQuest&quot; expansion &quot;The Ruins of Kunark&quot; and later served as producer on the highly successful expansions &quot;The Scars of Velious&quot; and &quot;The Shadows of Luclin.&quot; Rounding out the &quot;Vanguard&quot; leadership team is art director Keith Parkinson, the award-winning artist responsible for the painted box art for the original &quot;EverQuest&quot; and several later expansions. More information about &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot; can be found at the official site at http://www.vanguardsoh.com/.<br />
<br />
    Sigil Games Online is a game studio dedicated to the development of massively multiplayer games. Formed in January 2002 by Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler, both key figures in the development of the massively multiplayer runaway hit &quot;EverQuest,&quot; Sigil Games plans to play a key role in taking MMORPGs into their next generation and beyond.<br />

They will make their mark on a world we initially create but they ultimately shape and form.(didn't i hear this at the release of eq?)<br />
<br />
Players will experience settings ranging from enjoying a drink in a tavern to walking through the streets of a bustling city. They will travel with trade caravans across deserts and they will fight pirates on the high seas. They will ascend the highest peak in the land and also explore the depths of eerie dungeons...(you will fight sea rats, desert rats, mountian rats, cave rats,)<br />

sos different fx with i guess the swg xp system.</div></div><hr />

The timing of this is in extremely poor taste, I think.  I think Brad released his secondborn on the same day as his first creation's release as a celebration of the success of his original work. He has every right to be proud of EQ and I for one appreciate it, because I already feel that comparing EQ to Vanguard is doing EQ a favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is funny, because all I've been fucking hearing about is &quot;Sigil this, sigil that&quot;, and if you actually look for information, up until today the only thing they said is that they have nothing, and they hope to have something sometime in the future.<br />
<br />
So unless they have been working on this game since the moment they leave VI/Sony, these people don't have shit, and it's just gonna be another project rushed out the door to try to compete with the big names.  I don't care what the fuck they made, I'm not excited about this, and I see no reason to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They have a game, there was a screenshot leaked in April that a few people have seen. The UI looked like shit and the combat display and what looked like the inventory were screwy too, but the fighting stance of the character (Aradune) was very nice (kind of a bent-knee, ready-to-lunge stance with the sword cocked way back, at waist height) and the mob it was fighting (a smoldering salamander) looked pretty good to. The graphics look about like EQII's though, with the same very impressive environment, armor, and non-human models, but the downfall of EQII is the skin and faces of the humanesque characters, and whether or not Vanguard can improve on that (the only bad part about EQII's graphics imo) remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

This was started in April 2002 (says so in the FAQ). I figure another 18 months before release.</div></div><hr />

I think Vanguard has the makings of a very great game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These guys created a game that has already held my attention for 5 years. Any Blizzard games I have played are lucky to make 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

Fulorian, do you mean this /GU comic (http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20040316)?<br />
<br />
Dunno, maybe...although a lot of peeps were probably thinking that Brad was being a vindictive little git that day. ;)</div></div><hr />

This isn't a happy family guild - We are here to beat shit down, end of story.<br />
