<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rahwain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am now a 65 warrior (but spent most of my EQ life as a mage, only recently switching), but still have some questions about how some aggro/hate lists work.  Any help would be apprciated.<br />
<br />
1.) How does indirect aggro affect hate lists?  Some examples are low health aggro, does a successful taunt when a mob a mob is focused on someone with low health vault you up on the hate list even if the mob is still not focused on you, or dies this situation side-step standard hate lists?  Similarily does a sitting toon generate some kind of &quot;temporary hate&quot; as evidenced by a caster sitting after nuking (or sending in a pet) getting the mobs attention, but standing up before it arrives, to have it refocus on the tank?<br />
<br />
2.) Pet's taunting.  I can tell that most mage pets out taunt me, as they are the critters being summoned when I try to move a mob around instead of me (and yes I ask the casters to turn the taunt off after, most times) and assuming that taunt puts a tank at the head of the hate, would a warrior and pet not &quot;share&quot; the top of a hate list, and pass each other back and forth if both were constantly taunting every 8 seconds? (related to #3)<br />
<br />
3.) I have noticed that having a pet in the group that is taunting seems to prevent the slower from being attacked, unless the slow comes before the pet attacks.  Do pets generate such subatantial aggro tthat they are that far ahead of warriors?  Is it that pet taunt is infalable?  (This might be a question better left on mage/necro boards, but it related directly to my function in group)<br />
<br />
4.) Is it efficient to share &quot;burst&quot; aggro with a paladin or SK, to have them pile on the aggro, then just take it back with a successful taunt, to keep the mob focused on the warrior for the remainder of the fight, in effect using the pal/sk aggro &quot;advantages&quot; and pairing them with the warrior hp/mitigation?<br />
<br />
I know some of those sound like very basic questions, but is just an attempt to understand some of the specific mechanics better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Low health/frenzy aggro &gt; all.<br />
<br />
If by sitting a caster gains aggro, yes, the mob will probably shift its aggro back to the tank when the caster stands back up.<br />
<br />
2) Yes, theoretically you can pingpong aggro like that but...<br />
<br />
3) ...afaik a pet's taunt skill kinda sucks, most of its aggro is generated through pure DPS &amp; procs.<br />
<br />
4) It can be, if you have a skilled paladin/SK who will help out with root/FD &amp; proximity. Your cleric will be healing two tanks instead of one if you rely on just taunt. Also it depends on how quickly you can gain aggro and how quickly the mobs die, it's inefficient if mobs are halfway dead when you gain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if both were constantly taunting every 8 seconds?  <br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken taunt is on a 6 second, or 1 tick, timer. <br />
<br />
The aggro stacking can work with a knight in theory, but in practice I've found its more efficient for the cleric if I play dps and reserve tanking for adds and such. The slows go without a twitch from the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rahwain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sorry if the questions were worded poorly.  I am seeking the mechanics of these situations to be able to use them as they happen, instead of just reacting to them.  The basics are simple, I'm looking for more.  If there is no more, fair enough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You've pretty much got the concept of aggro. There isn't a whole lot to it really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1)  Yes, in my experience low health and sit hate are temporary to at least some extent. <br />
<br />
You can't taunt off a low health person at ALL if they've got solid taunt (i.e. if the mob follows them when they move), but if you pound the taunt button and they subsequently get healed you don't seem to get a massive hate boost.  At least that I've seen.<br />
<br />
One solution but only for REAL emergencies is to carry a few root nets around with you.  Keep one in a main inventory slot patched through to a hotbutton, and then if the cleric gets low health aggro pop a root and hug the mob.  Root proximity aggro will let you get taunt off anything except a pet.  It's temporary though, wears off when the root breaks.<br />
<br />
<br />
2)  Pet hate is tweaked so that the mob ONLY notices it if no PCs are in melee range.<br />
<br />
A pet with taunt on may be high enough on the hate list to out taunt casters and get taunt if you move out of melee range, but you'll only notice it when you try to move the mob.  The instant you back out of melee range taunt shifts to the pet since there's now no PC in melee range of the mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)  Yes, sadly mage pets often get and hold aggro much better than the average warrior.  They taunt, do surprising damage and often cast good hate inducing spells.  They just can't taunt off you when you're in melee range though.<br />
<br />
<br />
4)  If you have better hp / AC than the knight, then yes it can be more efficient to taunt off them, or (with an SK) get them to hold aggro through slows then FD a little later if you haven't successfully taunted off them.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, they can not only gain snap aggro at the start, but keep piling on huge aggro-inducing snare or stun spells right through the fight for much more hate than you.<br />
<br />
So if they have anything remotely near your hps and AC, unless your damage dealers are good monks who can guarantee max damage with zero aggro it's often more efficient to let the knight tank so everyone else can do maximum nuke/dot/melee damage.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps - very interesting thought-provoking questions there.  It often surprises me how technical tanking is, and how much I still have to learn as I go along :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Most of your questions have already been answered pretty well. Just in relation to your last question, in  my experience, riding on knights does help a lot, as long as both know what they are doing.  <br />
<br />
first off, i tend to find this works better with pallys than SKs.  Let the pally stun on inc, tank till slow lands. Normally with just a single stun they can hold aggro through slow. Once slow lands, taunt off them.  Its really that simple. All the pally has to do is to show restraint and not try to steal aggro back once u have it.<br />
<br />
However, before u even consider this, you have to weigh up the advantages - i.e. only if you have a reasonably significant AC/HP advantage. This is because the cleric is going to have to heal pally and heal you each fight and if you arent offering enough advantages to offset the cleric having to heal both, then its not worth it and better to just let the pally MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beastlords have a line of buffs that add a proc to their pet (also adds 75dex as well), these procs not only do pretty mean amount of damage, but many of these procs carry a +hate modifier, allowing the pet to hold agro through the BSTs slows.<br />
<br />
Easy way to gain agro...let the pet attack while only the warrior is in range.  The pet can't taunt off the warrior while he's close, and it &quot;helps&quot; you gain agro, since it's holding agro over the slow also (as well as doing damage).  I'm surprised more people don't do this...<br />
<br />
4) This is also known as &quot;piggybacking&quot;...many SKs use this method since we can lose the agro after warriors have taunted off, allowing us to use our spells again to do damage without fear of over-agroing.  Don't know about paladins tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Most comments have been addressed, but I can't say I've been out-taunted by pets very often...only if I haven't really attacked the mob. If you get the first hits in (kick/bash/slam as well, I also macro in disarm with these) you shoudl have the mobs attention. If yer pulling with a bow and they are sending in pets too early is really the only time that shoudl happen.</div></div><hr />
