<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendler</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read thread after thread about what is needed to tank in GoD.  My warrior is 65 and has 151 aa's now.  (sorry no magelo at work)<br />
I have CA3, CS3, ND3, AE taunt, PE3, and others for some reason I forget.  Now my gear blows incomparison to most of the others on this board, since I do not get the chance to raid.  I am still wearing Fierce Heraldic armor in all spots, so my ac is 1330 and hps are 6k (unbuffed).   My stamina is maxed to 285 and I am a DE so I started out at a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  Do I stand a chance in hell tanking in GoD?  Will I EVER get a group there lfg on?  Am I wasting my time even trying?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice in advance.<br />

<br />
You'll probably do better to bring your own group of people that you know than to rely on pickups in GoD anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tanking in &quot;purifying plant&quot; (or whever it's called) is a ton harder.</div></div><hr />
