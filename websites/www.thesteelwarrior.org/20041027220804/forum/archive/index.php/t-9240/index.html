All of these mobs have Place Holders. They will pop like one in 3 times. Easy do with my Six Box Crew. Have droped runes up to level 70 (very rare). The PH have droped the &quot;any mob in the zone&quot; rares. You can get to all with invisible. Only the Stonetooth Camp might have a see invisible dog on the bridge from Opal. If so you can take the bridge to the left as you leave castle from zone in. Watch out for wandering mob Souldrainer at the BowHound camp as it will kinda pop right on you. Need like 12-18 to take it down but drops a nice range item, but not better for wizards then the BoWhound range.<br />
 <br />
All drop Runes, cept noc.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. BowHound<br />
	<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16082<br />
<br />
Easy camp. PH is a dog in gully. Of interest to Wizards is the Range Item. <br />
<br />
2. GraniteSmash<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16377<br />
<br />
Warps if you pull while on a the Hill. Stone model is place holder.<br />
<br />
3. Noc SlaveHearder or something. PH is the Noc next to the two guards across from Diagnal. Has only droped the Mnk/Bst Hands, no runes yet.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70176<br />
<br />
4. Goofup.... <br />
<br />
5. Dragorn Laborer, Best camp for warriors, drops the back item on my warrior.<br />
<br />
Dragorn Model that has a dragorn laborer etc as a model. Its next to the tree to the right of Tornwing Statue as you look at Tornwing from the front, away from Opal. Its a Red Dragorn model. If you pull to the back all the mobs for the Tornwing event will not assist. Drops the <br />

<br />
but once in awhile, like Opal will drop this fine caster ear:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70165<br />
<br />
6. Opal the Foul <br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16225<br />
<br />
Mob is a caster. Casts a pet which disapears after a bit. Best to Mez and forget. Do not pull far from Spot as it warps back and gets 33percent more health. Watch Grards as they will add. SnakeLady Model.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. StoonTooth<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16284<br />
<br />
Kind of a far camp. Hill fight. Drops a fine caster ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a mob next to him, towards the bridge, red con, that drops <br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52400<br />
<br />
every time. Possible use for Anguish access is rumor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am looking to find Tyian Rianda who drops a fine caster belt I wish to farm<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16160<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a dragorn model.  Hard to explain, but if you know whereabouts the Noc Slavedriver and Bowlord Rorn spawn, it's in that lil castle area. There is a room with a few Dragorn Vanquishers in it, and Tyian is a dragorn model that spawns in that room.&quot; <br />
<br />
It might be the room before BattleMaster but I cant tell for sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
From the &quot;4&quot; spot if you go in deeper towards the right there are lots of mobs and what looks to be a very perilous camp with some named archers. Also there is a see invisible noc there so I have not been able to check it out...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been farming here 8-13 hours a day. I have 1.6 Million PP in the bank mostly from selling Runes from 77K -122K each. The cleric range and this item<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70190, an excellent warrior ring.<br />
<br />
And this fine caster ear:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70191<br />
<br />
<br />
Are the rare &quot;any mob in the zone&quot; drops. They all droped from Place Holders, need to kill like 100 or more though to see one drop.<br />
<br />
You will see a lot of OoW items on my guys I got from the bazzar. This expansion has really really equilized the single group player and the guild raider. I am not guilded ((none will pay 6XDKP) and only the wrist item from Tornwing was done with a complete pick up raid of about 18 people all the rest of my items came from mobs I can one group or from the bazzar.<br />

What did you do with the REAL Sam Deathwalker!? *LOL*<br />
I came here for a good laugh and all you leave me with is good info.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya know, Sam wouldn't be so bad if he didn't take every excuse to brag about himself.... which wouldn't even be so bad except for the fact that as much as he would have you believe otherwise, he really isn't &quot;all that&quot; at all.<br />
<br />
The writeup was decent, basically a good zone for the bazaar/family guild crowd.<br />
<br />
Then he got into bragging about how fat his bank account is, and how uber his characters are supposed to be. Yep, nothing's changed.<br />
<br />
Personally, I could care less about how much money I have... every time I get more than 150k in the bank I give 50-100k away to less fortunate friends to help them out. There's just no point to having plat once you reach the point of having the best you can buy, or move to nodrop gear. Sure, I could be a PP millionaire... but really... what's the point? PP at a certain point means precisely nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice info. Been looking to spend some time in ruined city, but people seem intent on bunching up in WoS. The few times I've gone out there to check it out theres never more than like a group or two max. Anyway, appreciate the write up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">good guide but i think you missed a couple of named around the (7) stonework steeltooth camp.  ones called Ukun Fleshhound i think.. its not listed on allakhazam but I killed it yesterday.  It roamed from the beginning of the east bridge (from #7 on map) to the end of the bridge right by O the Foul<br />
<br />
1group mob but it was very difficult compared to the other mobs,  max hit for 2000, had a short range 1500 AE.  our shaman died on the pull so we actually managed to kill him unslowed with cleric / druid on 11k tank... if slowed i'm sure 1 cleric would have been fine.  he had significantly more HP than most named, and dropped an extremely nice helm http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71132 but no runes<br />
<br />
and while i didn't see anything spawn, the group i was with claimed there was a named Kyv near your #4 goofup spot, but cannot confirm as it never spawned in the few hours i was there.  all the mobs across the bridges are higher level than the guys near zone-in, most conning white at 68 and hitting for ~800ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats the see invisible dog i mentioned it drops the Cleric Face item also. Tough mob to be sure, its a time spawn, be up for awhile then despawns. Good job on one grouping him thats for sure, he's killed 2 groups and more on our sever.<br />
<br />
I need 124 Runes for all my guys. I have like 4 heh. I have 1.9 million plat now and when the runes drop to like 10K I gonna be needing all my plat.<br />
<br />
Zone is easy enough to get to. You can invisible through the other zones and even bind in bloodfields. Plus my wizard will have a bloodfields port later today heh... And no level requirement.<br />
<br />
Looks like possible shakerpage in this room (this is the big room to the right of the Slayer in the NorthWest/North part of the map), lots of mobs alone the walls also.... dont know if they summon or anything but just a lot of mobs.... <br />
<br />
http://img63.exs.cx/img63/9660/ShakerPage.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
Found my mob last night finally, in one kill it drops a rune (sold for 88K) and the belt (sold for 188K)... will give info in about a week after I farm it.<br />

I didn't take it as bragging, but more like &quot;here's a good zone you can make a lot of money in and here's proof&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sam how many machines you use? And I admire your patience, I have blown my 6box's 1.6M plat buying runes.<br />
<br />
Needed 65 66-68 and am about 2/3 done with my drops + bazaar. I had the advantage of farming DH before they nerfed it though. 8 named in a row, 7 runes and 659K in loot in under 2 hrs (after I sold it of course). Ended up getting 14 named in 20 shots in 7 hrs first day oow was live. Ahh DH before the nerf....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have 6 computers and 6 accounts, all attached to one keyboard. 6 monitors (3 21 inch and 3 15 inch). One is a FD-500 sony the best monitor every made ($1800). <br />
<br />
Just sold a minor rune for 100K a bit ago. Im selling every rune I get my hands on cause for sure they gonna be like 10K in a month of so lol.... <br />
<br />
I got a 69 no drop for my warrior though to get that extra ago when he hits 69 woot!<br />
<br />
So you think the drop nerf has already happened or there will be another big nerf coming? Named are poping 1 out of 3 or so and dropping runes 1 out of 3 or so (items 1 out of 2 or better) is that consistent with vxed or VT type drops?</div></div><hr />

Thanks for ruining the zone. Ever since these maps got posted on the messageboards like the Steelwarrior, the WoS retards flocked to RCoD and those who worked on actually finding the PHs themselves now have to deal with the trains and general newbishnes which was not present in the zone a week ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My group got 1 rune in 6 named a couple days ago and 2 runes in 10 named yesterday.  To us it already looks severely nerfed, though our luck may just suck.  This was in wos.  All the runes I've seen in single groups (about 12 to 15 of them) have been L66 or 67.<br />
<br />
Someone paid 100k for a freaking minor rune?!  /boggle  That's crazy.  They're not THAT rare.  Now I'm annoyed that I've turned a few runes in rather than selling them.  I 2 box a cleric and I definitely want the 4th L67 spell soon, pious elixir, but I can wait on some of the other stuff.<br />
<br />
No one cares about that cleric's complaint.   :p  Sorry people are going to post about stuff.  EQ's web community is too big for that NOT to happen.  If your private playground has a good risk and time versus reward, people will learn about it and it won't stay private.  Deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One is Six is low for sure.. One in 3 is about right. I'v seen a 70 two times from BowHound... but thats very rare. <br />
<br />
I dont really think that runes were nerfed as they were not common to start with. <br />
<br />
I'm kinda thinking that they have some code where the first 10 or so times a mob is killed it drops the best item in every slot in its loot table, then after that it goes back to normal droping nothing in some slots or junks. <br />
<br />
I'll bet if you go deeper and kill mobs that have not died yet or don't die often you will get a more. Like Tornwing drops 2 runes the first few times he died then 1 rune the times after that. <br />
<br />
I sold runes for 122K (4 of them) and a lot in the 80-100K range, I'm up to 2 million pp in the bank now. Have 3 out last night and none sold. If your server has full time merchants the buy these for there toon cause they dont have time to farm them and they have tons of PP as they buy and sell all day long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Of course it has to be a bit more complicated than that with a warrior pulling.  You'd get multiple mob pulls a lot.  I assume you paci where you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ya, but pacify is really usless in OoW I dont think any mobs in RCoD can be pacify with the under level 65 spells. <br />
<br />
Usually to split I pretarget one mob for mezz and use the warrior to pull the other mob. As the arrow hits one mob the other also agros on the warrior so the chanter gets his cast in. If the 2nd mob is mezzed then its ususaly no problem. A resist though is bad as then the mob comes at the chanter and if he donst channel off his 2nd mezz (or even 3rd if he has DI) he ususaly dead and its 3 X evac time. <br />
<br />
But ususaly at a static camp this is only done one time. Then the next time the mobs pop I pull the first mob instantly (2nd has not poped yet)... kill it then wait like 4 mintues and kill the 2nd. Then you have a great rotation where the first mob pops thne the 2nd like 4 mintues later....</div></div><hr />

If u arent use the new invis spells. They solve the dropping invis prob. now all you have to worry about is see invis. I wish I could do 6 machines :)  Moving is the biggest pain, I have switched out my settings for my 3box so hopefull I can do it now. Its a monster machine (3.4ghz, 2gb, x800 video) but you have to get the right settings to make it work even then. I can 3box anywhere but certain OoW zones....<br />
<br />
My setup is way diff then yours and likely a little harder to run (fewer straight nukers) but I make up for it with pure power. i.e warrior almost 12k buffed with new buffs and all casters ft18+ and 7k+ mana pools. Doesnt hurt that lowest buff hp is 7.5k and that is the chanter without runes.<br />
<br />
Doing ranger, warrior, cleric, chanter, shammy, wizard. That way I get instant almost irrestiable slow (tash/turg at same time) and can get instant mez (malo/mez). Can offtank if needed. And puller can WS if the s*** hits the fan so I can evac the grp if needed. Cant wait till 70 shammy call to corpse so I can then 100% to full mana any dead casters with cleric 100% rez. But for now cranking out AAs and finishing ranger spells before moving on to this spot for my 69 spells.<br />
<br />
U try MPG yet? Hoping my setup with 2 tanks and cleric+backup healer will shine there :) Gotta fix that lag thing though....<br />

I 3 box, 66 CLR, 66 WAR and 67 SHM, did Granitesmash a few times (hes actually easier than the PH, he is a shaman mob but doesn't cast a pet), got 3 earings, 2 runes and the 10ac aug. I then tried bowhound, boy he was nasty for my little crew, hes red to my war, downed him and got the monk weapon.<br />
<br />
Does the war ring and caster ear drop from any zone mob? I'm thinking of just farming something easy like the granitesmash camp for runes and hope the ring\earing drops?</div></div><hr />

Recently, we were camping Granitesmash, Dragorn Laborer, and Kyv Bowhound. We were doing this from the spot just north of Granite that is free of roamers.<br />
<br />
Well, after about 2 hours, this group comes in and sets up at the ever popular statue camp. They inform us, we are no longer allowed to pull the Dragorn Laborer as it is part of their (now) camp. lol.<br />

Such is how it goes I spose, but I just cannot even begin to enjoy myself near such dick weeds. Off to find greener pastures maybe =)<br />

Funny thing is, this group was one of those &quot;should be somewhere harder, but they are too skeert to do anything close to their capabilities so go crowd the places filled with gear appropriate competition&quot;.<br />

Was worth a chuckle at the time, but sours the attractiveness of this place as this happens more and more.<br />

Hopefully sams guide here helped the people that need the drops here get a few of what they need, so they can move on before the place is overcome with bottom feeding elitist scum =)<br />

Sorry for skipping a few posts while I read thru the thread. But I think you are a bit out of place with your name calling.<br />
<br />
Besides, your posts lack any kind of punctuation and capital letters. While reading lots of posts on a thread, you would avoid those post where the writer seemed to &quot;spit&quot; words.</div></div><hr />

In the group's defense, you did already have two other named mobs camped...no reason to expect to hold the entire south side of the zone just 'cuz you were there first. <br />
<br />
I say this having camped now for a few weeks in RCoD.  Early in the morning or late at night my group tends to just roam around and kill off PHers (usually Bowhound, Granitesmash, Laborer, Ornaia, Ungi, Vornad, and that-other-rock-guy-near-Ungi).  When folks show up we are forced to limit our named farming until we are down to Ornaia, Granite and Laborer /shrug  It's still no where near as retarded as WoS</div></div><hr />

Sure, ill buy that, except they had several named as well. And to be honest, if they had asked for him, we would have given it to them NP. They did not ask. They came over and told me to not pull there mob anymore. heh. On top of that, there was only 1 other group in the zone, who was at that area south of the bridge keeper, leaving numerous named camps in the northern area they could have gone to. Point is, they wanted laborer, and it was camped, but they didnt give a $#!T so took it =)<br />
<br />
But anyhow, most of the rant was based on one fact about most of OoW that I dont care for, and that is the static PH system. Very silly way to do it. That zone would be much improved if the named had a wider area of potential PHers instead of this system that forces camping, and pulling the same set of mobs over and over and over.<br />

<br />
I've discovered I'm not quite ready to be tanking RCoD yet, need a few more AA's and levels I think.  I was able to tank the PH for the named hound at the beginning, but was very hard and was really afraid of going in much further and wasn't sure how well I'd fare against the named if it spawned.  I doubt I'd be able to tank Ungli.  I did however just cough up the cash and buy a BBC, heh.<br />
<br />
What kind of HP's/AC/Level/AA's should I be shooting for before trying to tank RCoD and also I haven't hit WoS yet, is it a bit easier or about the same?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">WoS is a step up from RCoD.  You might want to try Nobel's Causeway.  You can also try the instanced Dranik's Hollow expeditions and camp the named locations there.  Some of them have very nice drops that your group can likely use or sell for plat as well as rune drops if you are in a 65+ version.  People that are 65 and under tend to love the AA experience there, and it will allow you to build up some of your hp and defensive AAs so that you can handle the tougher areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, maybe this is only my take on it, but the many PHers have what appear to be pretty clear camp spots.  For Laborer and Ornaia, the camp spot is directly behidn the statue.  From that camp you can also pull Granitesmash and Bowhound - but both Granitesmash and Bowhound have their own very clearly delinated camp spots (i.e., ones that make the pull easier).  From what I read, Cily's group was not camping at the statue but was making semi-long pulls to get the Laborer.  Another group moved in to the exact camp spot for the Laborer and that was that.  The first group still had two spawns to pull, each of which actually make up their own camp. <br />
<br />
You may think there is no justification for taking a spawn; I say there is no justification for camping multiple camps and not making room.  The bottom line is that in heavily camped areas like this there needs to be a little give and take.  For most people, the south side of the zone contains the most doable camps (other camps further in usually have roamers), and also has several PHers so it breaks nicely into several separate camps.  If one group wants to take over all of them at the same time there are bound to be conflicts.  I'm not saying that is what Cily's group did, but I guess I'm trying to explain how actual EQ etiquette works.  I've come across a lot of this type of behavior in the weeks I've been in RCoD and it's somewhat easy to avoid.<br />

IMO you need your defensive AA, which is going to be a while from the looks of it.  I'm at 7.6kHP and 1450AC and I tank in RCoD pretty easily with a druid healing.  That said, I need a bunch more AC to make the damage less spikey.  The hollows exps would probably work very nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Well, like I said, camp arguments aren't really my thing.  When they come up, I leave.  There's enough aggravation in the real world without having to deal with it in the virtual.  I just started checking out the instanced zones and I think I'm going to like them for that reason.<br />
<br />
Noble's Causeway is a nice zone.  I can tank there np.  Well, some of the mobs there are tough when you get into the harder areas, but most of the zone is doable.  We've gotten the nice silverine earring there for our clr/enc/shm and the veil of the long ages for clr/shm, as well as several runes which we have sold and made several hundred k off of.  All of us are 65, so we figured may as well sell the runes now while they're still going for a lot.  Oh, I forgot, we also got the awesome drakescale shield for our shaman!  Now that's an uber drop.<br />
<br />
I'm working on defensive AA's and gear before trying RCoD or WoS.  Well we may go try the dog at the entrance of RCoD as the ranged item off him would be nice for our casters and I think we can handle him although I'm sure he'll be tough.  We took his ph without too much trouble, so hopefully the named isn't too much harder.</div></div><hr />
