I am a halfling warrior on the FV server.  I was wondering if anyone had any advice on some quests that could get me started, where to find them, and which ones you recommend.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  The newbie armor quests are really quite good ... by the time you finsh a full set of armor you will probably be level 12-14, and ready to go to someplace else like Paludal Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you ever actually do the newbie armor quests guys? With a character of that level? I have attempted: Halfling ranger, froglok shaman, human ranger, human warrior and human monk. The only one that didn't drive me crazy was human monk, due to almost every item being tradeable and very few being rare spawns/ drops. You would be better off killing large rats in NQeynos and selling the eyes, skulls and tails to vendors, then buying armor in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, four times.  They can be completed by level 12 or even 10 if you round up some other low level people to help.</div></div><hr />

Innothule near Gutka is a great place for spiderling, and also has a npc who trades 3 lower level hides for 1 higher level, so 3 ruined for a LQ, etc.  The lanuage barrier is tough also, so try running to PoK and asking a halfling who isn't busy to teach you elvish or human.  Sorry if you knew all this, helped me alot though so I thought I'd share.</div></div><hr />

The point is, do you want to do quests for the RP aspect and because you like them or is it because you think its an easy way to get decent equipment.<br />
<br />
If the latter, you really may be better off farming items to sell for PP and going for shopping trips in the bazaar. I haven't checked the prices of crafted recently but i wouldnt be surprised if you could pick up a whole suit for under 500pp and that should last you quite a while.</div></div><hr />
