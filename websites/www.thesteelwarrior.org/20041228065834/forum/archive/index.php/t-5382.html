<br />
I'm looking for information as to where the named spawn that can drop the Flame Guilded Cloak.  I've been grinding in Fire for a few weeks now and can't seem to find the right spot for this.<br />
<br />
I've heard it drops in a field area just past the bridge but after 4 3-4hr grind sessions there I've yet to see any named spawn.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!  I've been wearing a CoF a friend gave me for 3yrs now!<br />

<br />
<br />
That being said,Head to fire the day of a patch and you should find several named up throughout the zone.Be warned that each named has a few items they can drop so even getting one to spawn won't always yield what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
At least the XP is nice there and its easy to convince people to come camp with you,Try getting a group to go to jopal island for a Epic Sword though =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense, but I'm wondering how a warrior gets to the elementals with a CoF as thier haste. Especially given the abudance of 41% items on the progression path. Also, why not round up the guild to go after the bracers or shoulders in Earth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kergin</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">None taken.  I joined my guild a few months ago as they were getting into the elementals.  I came from a small guild that didn't raid much and a CoF was the best I could get.  I opted to upgrade my other armor pieces and weapons before saving raid points for haste since 36% haste is enough to be maxed with enchanter buffs.<br />
<br />
I haven't grinded in earth yet, when my regular group gets together it seems earth is camped up and fire is deserted so we head there.  Plus the casters like the FT3 belts and range items that drop near zone in where we usually sit until the group gets full.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair deal.  You won't be able to exp grind the Earth haste items though. :) But when your guild starts to do those rings, you will get a ton dropping.<br />
<br />
edit because my spelling is teh suck today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We made it to elementals with only one warrior having 41%, and that was the belt from MM.<br />
I was using LDoN cloak (36%) and our next two warriors had soulscream belts. <br />
<br />
To be fair, this is on Stromm (new server).  We did NToV a whopping one time and skipped VT.  In 4 (I think) MM kills we got one belt.  So there weren't quite as many 41% haste items in our progression path.<br />
<br />
At this point our 4 main warriors wear MM belt, 2 earth bracers, and 1 cloak from fire.</div></div><hr />

I've yet to be awarded it, but one has dropped each of the four times we did the PoI dragon, so either we're lucky or it's not that rare an item.</div></div><hr />
