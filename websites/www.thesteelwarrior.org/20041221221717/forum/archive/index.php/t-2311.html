<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janus_Eci</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I usually don't post or even read in this mini-forum, but I had a thought that I don't recall seeing here before...<br />
<br />
<br />
Name: Hastened Instigation <br />
Pre-Requisite(s) Area Taunt <br />
Level Requirement: 63 <br />
Ability Type: Passive <br />
Max Training: 3 Levels <br />
Description: This ability decreases the amount of time required between uses of the Area Taunt abililty.<br />
The ability decreases the time between re-uses by 10% each rank. The costs are as follows: <br />
Rank 1 (Level 63) - 3 AA Points <br />
Rank 2 (Level 64) - 3 AA Points <br />
Rank 3 (Level 65) - 3 AA Points<br />
<br />
<br />
Should this not also work on regular taunt?  I mean, monks get an AA skill that lets them feign death twice as often at level 3.  Why the hell does our &quot;HASTENED INSTIGATION&quot; do nothing for normal taunt?  If we could taunt twice as often, even if it's at the cost of an AA skill, then that lessens our chance of being screwed over by the RNG.  Anyone else have any thoughts or comments on this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely a good idea. At least then if (more like when) taunt fails we wouldnt have to wait so long to try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually suggested a couple of times that normal taunt should have it's refresh time reduced as you level, much as the casting time for spells goes down and so forth.  Making it AAXP dependent is not a bad idea, but it means we have to farm more exp just to keep on a level playing field with the other classes that get improvements via spells.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm a firm believer that part of the fix to the problem is a reduction in the interval between taunts.  6 seconds is just too farging long given the PoP environment.</div></div><hr />

I pretty much just save AE taunt for emergencies so I haven't seen the need to get HI yet but if it affected regular taunt it would be my #1 priority.</div></div><hr />
