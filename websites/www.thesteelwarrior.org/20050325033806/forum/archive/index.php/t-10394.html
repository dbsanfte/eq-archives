I'd probably just retire the character at this point. ^^<br />

NE is about the most common race in the game it seems.  Hunter is a very solid soloing class,  and is quite a good damage dealer and puller in groups if you need it.  I hear some flak at the high end about them not being wanted in groups, but I can't really comment too much.  I know if we need damage and one is availible we'll get one.<br />
<br />
The servers &quot;seem&quot; to be getting a bit more stability, I'm on icecrown and I've noticed it crashing less anyways.  Best bet is to just find a place where you know some people and go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of servers/guilds had a planned server to go. You might wanna check your serverboards so you can at least recognize a few names. I guess a lot of people here play on Hellscream, but Hellscream is one of the most populated servers, so be carefull what you chose.<br />
<br />
A low pop server would be a good choice right now, because of the server issues, so that may be an incentive. I don't particularly reccomend picking a highpop server, just because the lag is unbearable at times.  You're much better off with a Medium to low population server.<br />
<br />
If you mean good server by &quot;not a lot of downtime, pretty stable&quot; pick a low pop server.  If you want a good community server, then I can't help you there.<br />
<br />
Night Elf Hunters are an extremely popular class combination.  They're solid solo'ers, but I guess some people have problems with them at the very end game, not being wanted in groups or something.  Don't be afraid to try Hoard either, they have some cool races that might intrest you, especially since you don't know anyone playing WoW right now (from the sound of if).<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your EQ1 account. Just let it rot. That's what I did with mine. I cancelled the subscription, and eventually let a friend have it. Don't give it away to people that don't know how to play, as that just makes the game worse for original players. <br />
<br />
It's up to you really, I don't think you'd make much money with a 55 warrior, so it probably wouldn't be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just let my chars rot.  EP flagged 65/90aa Mage and 52 War with full Fierce Heraldic, CoFlames, BoC + Skybreaker.   I wanted to see Time and get my warrior to 65, but once GoD came out, I knew EQ's glory had faded.<br />
<br />
As for WoW, please consider something other than a NE Hunter or Gnome Rogue.  No one will destinguish you from the hundreds of others on the server.  Try to be original and go Horde if you can stand their ugly models.  Just my 2cp tho.  I play a Human Warrior on a low pop server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to play an Alliance Hunter, go Dwarf right away...unless you just really want to use a bow at the beginning. =P  I can't find out if there's a profession that makes the upgraded arrows like the engineers make for guns.  If you do guns, then going engineering will make things easier ammo-wise.<br />
<br />
As for server, unless you know some people on a high population server...stay away from the high ones.  Go either Medium or Low.  I play on Terenas and I've never once experienced a queue or had problems getting on (outside of the &quot;all servers down&quot; things...but I play so casual it hasn't been a problem even then).<br />
<br />
A lot of people go Alliance for some reason, but the Horde side isn't bad at all.  Personally I like wide open areas and hilly grasslands, so the Tauren starting area looked incredible for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pick a low population server is paramount to getting off and enjoying WoW right from the start. If you start on a high population one, you'll probably be plague with lag and downtime as they fix things for now. Its really a short term recommendation, as I'm sure these problems will be worked out, but it can interupt a lot of fun to be had when the game is new for you.<br />
<br />
Hunter is a solid class, dont' be afraid totry one out. Leveling isn't too hard in WoW, so if you don't like it, just start again.<br />
<br />
I'd let that character rot, unless it goes to someone who has experience playing a higher level warrior. The worst thing you could do is give it away to a friend that's never played EQ. Doing so will only help destroy the game. I left EQ because it wasn't for me any more, but there are thousands of others who still enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, GL on that!  I deactivated my account where my characters stood.  didnt give away my crap this time though.  Took forever to re-equip last time.  However, I dont think Ill be going back to EQ.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said.  GL finding a copy of WoW, unless you already have one.  AFAIK, there are almost no copies to be had.  WoW will not be releasing any new boxes unitil the stability issues are completed.  <br />
<br />
I agree with the other folks here...dont pick one of the race/class combos that have been done to death, at least not for stats.  If you truly like the look then rock and roll, but try and pick a differnet class.  I think the Gnome Warrior is cool, and uncommon too hehe.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a rebel, go Horde.  Everyone is playing Alliance.<br />
<br />
/salute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree with most the posters here.<br />
<br />
Pick the class you like, even if other people have picked that class and race (there is probably a reason for it).  This isn't a contest and there is no need to be a unique snowflake.  Of course, with priests running around 8% of the server population on most servers and necessary for most high-end dungeons, that would surely net you groups.  Warlocks also tend to be rare and they are great at high level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really Vig ? I hear high level warlocks bailing all the time. Heck they are the other class Bliz has said they are going to look at. From what I have heard their good 38+ pets are more like EQ chanter charm pets than what they had upto then. And what I was hearing out of beta was that Oxinia tactics used paladin healing as even then priests drew too much agro healing and could nto stand the effects. Add to that their big heal is to slow to deal with the variability of WOW damage spikes. <br />
<br />
Apprently boss mobs do things like MS the MT for 3700. <br />
<br />
*shurg* The hunters I know are really happy with their class as are the rogues. Wizards are fun--as are the warriors.</div></div><hr />

( you can have more than one on an account correct?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think its 10 per server. And they can be on either side and there is no limitation to switching sides (a la planetside).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasco</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can have up to 10 charaters per server, you can make charaters for alliance and horde on PvE and RP servers. PvP servers, if you create an alliance charater, those are the only charaters you can make on that server, limit is still the same. You are allowed up to 50 charaters per account, across all servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">varill</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">awesomeness ..... thanks again everyone .... i ordered it ... itll be here this weekend .,, if you see me on any server and you need something just ask ...
