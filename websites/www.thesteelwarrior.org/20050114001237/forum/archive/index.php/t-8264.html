If i had a bard friend help me do you think it would be possible to do this in ... say ... PoNightmare?<br />
If he managed to pull all the trees, ravens, spiders, werewolves, hobgoblins, netting wraiths, big spiders, banshees, and the undead graveyard city area to the zout and clump them all and pull them to me with deftdance ... do you think it's possible to ae at least a large chunk of them dead by myself?<br />
<br />
i think the average hps on mobs in PoN is around 10k ... i'm just curious if there are enough.<br />
<br />
Fungus grove sounds like a promising spot to give it a try, though i can see the problem with the shrooms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sebilis (start with furious + high dmg 2h, plank or dathor) - easy - green/LB/DB<br />
Fungus Grove (same deal, you have to work hard to bunch them up properly, can grab shadels and other stuff too, better if you can lower your disease resist for the shroom slow) - can be tough - LB/DB<br />
Seru circle (can take a while to bunch them up, a lot are casters) - easy - LB/DB<br />
<br />
FAILED solo attempts&gt;<br />
Akheva (hard to get stuff pulled without getting killed, stuff have too much HP as well)<br />
Ssra skeleton basement (veryhard to survive a pull, and they have too much HP, and over half are casters)<br />
<br />
Can *maybe* do this solo in Barindu, if you can survive the pull. not recommended...<br />
<br />
Done with group only PoFire and Ssra basement, but PoN should be easy as pie, and Tactics pit too (place is just begging for it). Other places I would like to see done with a group are Xuzl caves in sol ro tower (would be insanely hard to pull without at least 2 DAs), PoFire GIB field (maybe toss in a mini? huhu =P) and anything in GoD</div></div><hr />

But i got 3 comps so im able to spawn a lot of mobs.  Handing in 4 kegs with 3 chars at the exact same time, spawn 12 callers. The 12 callers spawn 4 mobs each every 2 mins, 5 times before something depops.  NB you need a bard to keep the caller agroed, so he doesnt agro the fungus beasts and get himself killed.  When i manage to spawn 12 callers, i kill all the mobs but the named(cause they have more HP, and i cant swing/proc on dead mobs).  Some callers skip a spawn or so. So about 150-180 mobs pr run give a bit more than 1 AA.. Done probably 40+ AAs there in little time.  You might wanna train away the named to save time.  I kill Tiako for snare glands.  And yes, im slowed with forloren deeds.  With 60 mobs(4 keg hand in) it sometimes work, other times i need furious to finish em off. Kegs cost a bit, i dont loot the normal mobs, cause it take too long haha.. But the two fungus patch vests iv gotten keep me good on the money.  Good luck!!<br />

Sebilis is very good because you can round up so many mobs, and practically none are green.  By comparison, most of the other dungeons suggested are either too green, too hard, or have too many casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Mobs have ~10k hps and really arent very resistant at all.  For 1 warrior (if my math is correct) all you would need is a train of 50 or more monsters to instafrig them all.<br />
<br />
With a talented bard i would think you could gather well more than that on either side of the pond.... and easily double that if you could drag them from one side of the drink to the other towards the zout.</div></div><hr />

The problem there would likely be surviving all of the HTs on the pull.  I've gotten pretty well clobbered pulling like 1/3-1/2 of the mines for metal/shard AE groups on occasion.  Would just depend on the mix of pops you had up at the time, I guess.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've had an earthshaker forever, but haven't been able to bring myself to spend the points on rampage...  This thread is tempting me, though.    ;)<br />

Edit:  Oh, one question I did have about this technique:  If I duel my shaman to slow myself, do I have to end the duel somehow, lest he explode when the rampage goes off?</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Rampage is short range, so your shaman would have to be standing quite close by to die. If possible, just have him camp out/zone out for extra safety, or simply laugh alot when he dies.</div></div><hr />

In all trials i had a bst/ench/shaman slow me.  The first train i tried to clump them all myself ... on the rest of them i had my bard roomate pull and DA at the end to make sure they were all tightly packed.  The latter strategy worked rather well.<br />

60 mobs ... not all clumped ... some dead some not<br />

~100 mobs ... all clumped minus 3 casters ... 97 instafrig ... 30% aa xp for all 5 involved.<br />

~200 mobs (practically the whole zone) ... clumped well minus a few casters<br />
All but 5ish casters dead in 2 secs ( + lag) .... 60% aa xp for all 5.<br />
<br />
Trial 5 (Umbral Plains)<br />
~70ish mobs pulled to zin and clumped well ... not a big enough train ... got them all to 40% life.<br />
<br />
Trial 6 (Umbral Plains)<br />
150+ mobs ... not sure exactly how many but it was a fuckton ... success ... all mobs caught in the ae died ... almost an aa of xp for the 6 with me.<br />
<br />
Trial 7 (PoNightmare)<br />
~70ish mobs pulled to hedge ... 25 died instantly ... the rest lived due to partial resists and differing hp values.<br />
<br />
Trial 8 (PoNightmare)<br />
~250+ mob train ... goblin caves et all ... most of the zone ...  <br />
Zone was shakey due to the size of the train, and caused funky warping when it was time to page ...  nothing died but the bard and i both took a dirtnap.  Lag was horrendous<br />
<br />
Note to self ... PoNightmare is NOT built for 250+ trains ... i'm surprised the whole zone didnt crash when i hit rampage.</div></div><hr />

The dmg is instant, so no if you instafrig the whole lot then the warrior doesnt take any dmg.  It might be handy to keep a rezzer around, though, as the risk of death is rather high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Due to the suggestion of folks i went to FG with the callers.  After a few hours of playing with it and about 3k pp spent, i finally figured it out.<br />
<br />
We tried spawning all of them completely once ... but the lag was too great for us to clump anything.  In the end we found it best to simply use 4 kegs on one caller .. wait for pull spawn then shake them down.  In a group of 3 we were getting a little over a gold aa xp per 10 mins.  The bard i was with had them going in a cycle so that i could page every time rampage popped.  Some of the named would win, but they are/were easy to kill with the shaman healer, and their loot was a perk.<br />
<br />
It costs 380ish pp to start it ... and we always got at least 250-300pp back, though generally we broke even on plat spent.<br />
<br />
We were able to get a double turnin of 8 on one caller once ... which resulted in over 120 mobs perfectly spawned and clumped.  After we shook them down we got a bit over half an aa each, but were not able to coordinate as such very much.<br />
<br />
It requires a substantial plat investment to start and maintain, but the inflow of cash is relatively good.  With perfection, it's feasible to get 2 aa an hour and farm some nice gear.<br />

We got 5 fungusbeasts glands and even a fungus patch vest after about an hour.</div></div><hr />

I got a couple friends that semi-regularly hunt in Greig's End. And it seems like a  tempting spot to rampage in.<br />

A lot of melee mobs and I don't recall casters being a problem there. Lag has been pretty low there, not to mention practically empty of other players.<br />

Only hitch really is the crapload of doors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">08-02-2004, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best zones/areas for this kind of stuff :<br />
-Low graphics intensity (for those with lesser computers<br />
-Wide open spaces (preferably outdoor)<br />
-Mobs with a high aggro radius who Assist each other<br />
-Mobs run at similar speeds and stack well<br />
-Striaght melee mobs<br />
-Zones with low player traffic<br />
<br />
<br />
Bad zones/areas:<br />
-High graphics intensity (bad lag)<br />
-Closed indoor zones with lots of obstacles (griegs)<br />
-Mobs with low aggro radius and/or dont have a wide assist berth<br />
-Mobs run at different speeds<br />
-Caster mobs<br />
-Zones with high traffic<br />
<br />
<br />
The biggest problem often isnt the ability to aggro enough mobs ... it's the ability to safely clump them all together.  If everything isnt very damn close, then you wont kill it all and/or it will kill you first.  Casters are the devil.</div></div><hr />

He was in a group of 5, so 2aa per hour is not that bad (iirc, you got the 5aa with 5 bots, right?) 2aa per hour is good exp, easily comparible to normal elemental exp, and when you add in he had 2 friends with him, probably a lot more fun ;)</div></div><hr />

It really cant get nerfed.<br />

I know you know this, but in a sense they already did it by making it not drop anymore.<br />

There are something like 10 or 15 of these total on my server, most rotting in the bags of the elite raiders.  My server is really populated and old as well.  There aren't many of these around, and there are even fewer around who know how to use it effectively.<br />

Errm, I do Rampage. I ramp for exp in multiple zones with friends. I have done it both solo (using a bot for slow, of course) and with groups. <br />
<br />
My comment that you quoted was more in reference to the fact that you were 5boxing for solo exp to get the 5aa per hour, while he took 2 friends and got 2aa per hour with them.  However, in retrospect, I should have held my tongue on that as I don't know you and perhaps you have a lot of fun solo; I've been bored with doing anything solo for a long time, and allowed that bias to get out with that comment.</div></div><hr />

Well to be honest when I was doing the rampage thing there were about 3 of us playing with it so it was anywhere from 1-3 of us together.  At some points it was solo xp and somepoints it was a full group of 6 just powering characters.<br />
<br />
There is no question mind you that thats by far the fastest way to power characters in the game from 44-65. :)  We took a friends cleric from 44-58 in a few hours played and my druid from 58-65 in a few more hours played.</div></div><hr />

I can successfully shake 1 full set down with a slower partner ... then we kill the named that live.  Multiple tunnels just gets hairy and laggy .. but if there is some way to burn 8 kegs in one tunnel, the xp would be phenomenal</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did it with my 6 box group and invite in a bard. Bard pulls and then DA (out of my range so I dont get DA and can't cast), then my chanter does the stuns, the wizards pbaoe, the cleric heals and the warrior rampage's... Kills 40 mobs or so outright every time. The big edge here is that I can pull again as soon as the mobs pop, becuase I only used rampage and not a disc like fortitude (plus you get the 6 person group exp bonus). I suggest getting a bard puller and chanter/cleric and whatever. Bard are usually expert pullers by that level and there is good reason they pull on high end raids and not other classes. Because you don't need fortiutide you can pull twice as fast and with others you die less. In fact if you find two chanters you can stright up lock the mobs down and not take a hit.... <br />
<br />
I am sure you can do better sometimes elsewhere but this is super safe and solid with low death rate.</div></div><hr />

The last waves spawn at ~9 minutes ... and 10 mins after caller respawn is the best time to charge him.  Just invis while slowed .. take off haste items .. walk to the middle and rampage.<br />

We get the named down to ~40% every time, and instafrig the rest.  Use 4 huge kegs or it wont work, though.  You need a full spawn in one tunnel for it to effectively work.<br />

With coordination pretty sure 2 warriors could shake it down.  All you need is an AE tash from mr/ms enchanter and good clumping skills on the part of the bard.  Certain towers might actually be better due to mob density.  More mobs in the pull the better.</div></div><hr />

 The simple answer is that you can not rampage/hit/proc on a dead mob.<br />
<br />
So,  what happens is, you kill all of the mobs by the (random number) 30th mob either way, so you while you are doing double the total damage, you don't actually proc any more because you doubled the number of mobs.<br />
<br />
Basicly, the game creates a list of mobs to hit and proc on in order, so it hits the first mob, if you proc it calculates the damage, then goes to 2nd mob. Hit 2nd mob, calulates proc damage and goes to 3rd... gets to say 30th mob, procs and calculates damage, Kills all of the mobs that you have killed, tries to go to 31st, realizes 31st is dead and so on. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps, and I still haven't figured out how it sets the order. Wondering if by agro, or perhaps by spawn time. haven't had time to play with it  to figure that out =)</div></div><hr />

I don't that it is possible. Soloing in Sol Ro I get about 12% aa per kill. to get 3aas that is only 25 mobs. There is no way 25mobs is enough to kill them all. Heck the least amount of mobs I have been able to kill in FG was 35 or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
   Then I invited some guildies to come help for a few so was PLing a whole group a couple rounds.  Hardest part is finishing off the nameds after, while slowed.  And of course I realized that its not good to load poison rains on the shammy to help kill them when you are still in duel mode. Shammy almost killed the war, then was trying to loot all the corpses and got too close to war, who still had Earthshaker equipped and almost got the shammy killed.<br />
<br />
  But I did find that you can get at least half if not more of the cost of the kegs back from all the eyes and brains the mobs drop, just hard to get them looted before the corpses expire and deal with the 3-5 nameds at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The caller is kos to the mobs he spawns, but they not to he.  By locking his aggro he is focused on you.  If you dont lock aggro, then he attacks the fungus monsters and they assist each other.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I found was that the caller seems to lose aggro after about 10 minutes anyways and attack a mob. So then he would start dying. But since the rest dont assist it takes a few for him to die.<br />
<br />
   I was aggroing him with my Shaman using slow. Then when slow wears off I duel and slow the warrior, after removing a bunch of gear with MR. Then camp out war to clear duel, cause I learned the hard way trying to clear the named with duel still running can be dangerous  :)  Then when he starts dying wait till he is low, Invis war and move into middle of the mobs, then soon as he dies hit Rampage and watch the lag start.<br />
<br />
   Course the hardest part was trying to loot all the corpses, while also tanking the nameds with a warrior that is Slowed, unhasted, and has trib haste off. But after slowing the names they do very little damage and its worth looting all those corpses as the eyes get 9 plat each, and the brains 23, can recoup half the cost of the kegs or more just on those.<br />
<br />
  Then I turned in a bunch of named loot for Tribute points for haste, and have like 7 of the fungusbeast glands now. Remember back when they were the Only way a Warrior could get and hold fast aggro on raid mobs. I never could afford to try them but guess I can now.</div></div><hr />

I think that's probably his first 'break', so maybe he gets bored.<br />
<br />
Regarding the haste/slow thing.  You *can* keep on all item/tribute/spell haste.  Slow completely negates all of that and then does its full slow on top of that, so at least once slow wears off, you're at full haste.  I use the GoD slow which lasts only 90 seconds, and then go rampage when it starts to blink, so I'm only fighting slowed for a few seconds.  I'm sure you could do the same with Turgur's - would just have to plan the cast well in advance.  I also wonder if the GoD slow has some innate pvp mod, because it lands alone far better than turgur's lands with malos, despite its mr check being only -40 versus Malos debuffing it by -55.  Thankfully, my warrior's resists suck though, so it's not too bad either way...  Usually just take off the shoulders and it lands in 1-2 tries. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is because of what is more agro? A shaman who slowed you 10mins ago? Or that fungi Priest chain hasteing 120 mobs? but the bard continuously buffing itself is more agro.<br />

   Also where do you pull the swarm of mobs to for the Rampage that keeps them close enough together, the back of the cave ?

No need to pull.  In fact, if you pull and don't use an invuln disc, you are gonna get owned before you can even hit rampage.

However, the last time I tried I moved the mobs with DA and faded. Had what looked to be a ton stacked up. I than ran out of the cave and slowed my warrior with Requiem of Time. She ran in invis and I hit rampage on the pile. A grand total of 9 mobs died and she was then owned.<br />

Why would only 9 mobs die? YALP reports a total of 178,298 damage. 167,034 from the proc and 8836 from slashing plus some crits and cripples. It also reports 687 instances of &quot;xxx is smashed by the heaving ground.&quot;<br />

I have had a couple bad runs where someone else got too close and aggroed the mobs from cave just as I Rampaged where I killed about half of them but the rest rapidly took down  me and anyone that got aggro.<br />
<br />
   What I have been doing is 8 or 12 keg turn ins. I then run up and use the shaman to slow the caller when he respawns in cave. Then sit back and wait for mobs to build. Duel war and shaman and slow war. Then after about 10 minutes I camp out the shaman to clear caller aggro, caller attacks a mob and it starts killing him. Regroup shammy, slow war, walk into middle and as soon as caller dies, shakerpage them. Then run shaman in to slow the nameds, and start looting corpses for the eyes and brains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I assume you turn in for 12 using 3 PC's? If you have a way to do the trick on one pc please share!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 PC's is the win, and even then I only get all 12 about 50-60% of the time. Its not easy lining up three mice over that give button and hitting them all at once and without moving any of them.<br />
<br />
   I do have a Lvl 61 Cleric I use on the third comp, but that one runs real laggy so doubt I could manage to DA pull the mobs away with him. And with all the Lag caused by that many mobs Im not really sure how to be sure to get them all together close enough for the AE to kill em all. Maybe pulling them down into the back of the cave. Would have to get war there invissed first then bring em down and Rampage just before DA wears off. Maybe I will give it a try one of these days if they dont nerf it first.<br />
<br />
   But then if caller survives he will end up calling another batch of mobs as I am trying to finish off the nameds, and with 48 mobs called each time that could be bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The caller only &quot;calls&quot; five waves of mobs, and how many mobs are in each wave depends on how many kegs you gave him (2-4 mobs per wave per keg).  If you wait until all five waves are called and stacked up and manage to pull them away from the caller to avoid killing him, I don't think he is going to call anymore...  He's done at that point.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about the caller dying.  Just kill him as part of your rampage after all five waves are called, or if you don't want the faction hit then camp out whoever originally agro'd the caller (to keep him from attacking the mobs) and let the beasties kill him before you rampage.  He respawns quickly, and there are two other callers you can use too.  You need a little bit of downtime between each round for your rampage disc to repop anyway.</div></div><hr />

I've done 12 barrels at once, and its a 50/50 shot if the zone crashes.<br />

I just stick with 8 its safer. no 10min roll back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still have one on my warrior but I unloading my spare before OoW cause I think at level 70 they will have a lot less usefullness. <br />
<br />
And Im to lazy to level up another warrior anyway ... <br />
<br />
I'm getting 4percentAA per kill (per man in 6 man group) in Vxed and can pull at a 2.5 minute rate (3 wizards kill fasts heh) as compared to 40percent AA (per man in 6 man group) per ES pull and waiting for PoN repops about 20-25 mintues so... its kinda a toss up.</div></div><hr />

Wonder if the zone takes it. Iv done 16 keg handins for a day and the zone never crashed on me. Got around 200 mobs +/- eash time. Seemed easier to do 4 handins than 12 somehow, might be lag or something helping me.  Getting rather expensive, but fun.<br />

<br />
First try - wiped, didn't realise they spawned outside tunnel also<br />
<br />
Second try - agroed caller, stayed in middle of big room, waited for the 5 calls (10 minutes), charged in invis and boom all dead except 2 easy named, got 50% of an AA on the ungrouped war.<br />
<br />
Third try - didn't wait long enough about 10 were still not in the bunch and lived, wiped<br />
<br />
Fourth try - no clue what happened, I hit rampage at the correct time, nothing happened and 60 mobs agroed me, wiped, no clue why?<br />
<br />
With 4 kegs you make around half an AA for 20 minutes work, so 40 mins per AA, not exactly amazing as there is comparable if not better xp in PoF.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to hand in 8 kegs with one PC? I tried alt-tab but I don't think its possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On another note, has anyone who's dinged 66 tried this yet?  I'm curious as to how fast the exp will drop off here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Callers have always repopped to a single mob, but they still call based on the amount of kegs turned in. <br />
<br />
   And on a side note at Lvl 66 you get about 25% less exp for these then at 65.  Thinking of delevelling to 65 to bank 30 AA then heading for 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, good to know.  Banking 30 and then starting towards 70 was my initial plan, and I think I'll stick with it after hearing that. :)</div></div><hr />

I too have been looking for areas to use my earthshaker, its now bagged after I left level 65 and fungus grove behind. I wish I could find somewhere else to use it before I sell it.</div></div><hr />

Bard, as always, help a lot with pulling. Gather them up in one of the open areas, run in laps to bunch them, then head for a door corner. On the plus side you will be able to get parts for people's epic 1.5 too. I know of at least rog and nec that drop in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 2 computers, and 3 accounts .. FG is truly the easiest to do, cause the mobs stack up for you themself, I'm spawning 8 huge casks at a time ... got an egg timer I set for 10 minutes once the caller gets into place, slow / invis and send my warrior in .. he is only lvl 63 but, gets a full aa each caller event .. now if I loot I only loose about 50-100pp per event, if I dont it's around 800pp .. the big point here I want to stress is I have pulled out over 20aa's  A DAY, and I dont mean a 24 hour period, I'm talking 12 hours tops .. <br />
<br />
My twink warrior, lvl 63 with 125aa's and 12 days play time is pretty freaking insane .. <br />

2. In a high-end xp group you can get an aa every 30 mins anyways<br />

4. In a high-end xp group you get to upgrade yourself<br />
5. Staying level 63 forever =/= fun<br />
<br />
<br />
It's fun to do for a laugh, but as a viable xp method it's only &quot;so-so&quot; imo, unless you can accurately do 12-16 keg calls, comparable and entertaining xp is just around the corner, and it doesnt require your eyes bleeding and/or owning 2 computers.<br />
<br />
It's a toy.  It's rare.  It's fun.  I wouldnt sell mine.</div></div><hr />
