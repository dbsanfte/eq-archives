<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I re-rolled an Iksar recently and unlike my old ogre warrior certain things like heraldic armor aren't avalaible to me. I got a good start on gear, fairly decently twinked but I'm having problems comming up with what I would call quality arms and legs. I'm trying to avoid buying ornate patterns and I'm currently trying to save up for a helmet of RZ. My guild is pretty much in high end velious and about to start on Ssra so AL's arms would be an option soon although I'm not sure they'd be DKP well spent. I realize my main issue right now is lvls, but I need a few gear upgrades on the way to 65. Any advise is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also the fungi in the inventory slot is currently up for sale in the bazaar. I have about 75K atm and I 2-box a 65 shammy, main reason I re-rolled my 55 ogre war was to get him on a different account then the shammy, so the lvls are comming fast and hunting for pp and some gear is possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi there, 65 iksar warrior here so check my magelo if you like to know what is available for you :)<br />
<br />
You are doing pretty well, but a few slots could use an upgrade:<br />
Vambracers (pitted vambs maybe)<br />
Range (elemental bows rock, but the bow I use isnt bad either)<br />
Secondary (SotB or CHoS would both be a nice upgrade aggro/dps wise)<br />
Rings (valor rings)<br />
Helm (looking at your armor you should be able to get a HoRZ, they just rock)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can take a glance at my magelo, as some of my suggestions are thier. level 65 iksar warrior 219 aa or something atm. some of my old gear is banked, you can browse that aswell<br />
<br />
Best move for starters would be grab chos, i prefer sotbs but since you need a weapon to keep you 1hb up. go chos.<br />
<br />
Saving for a helmet of rallos zek is a good idea, although I feel  white dragon helm is just as good. so depending on prices and availibity pick one up<br />
<br />
For bracers look a mana-threaded bone bracers and crystalized acid bracers depending on prices. or if you put those on hold, do the cov faction quests and do 2 bracer of benovelence quests.<br />
<br />
Find a pair of tae ew plate greeves would be a nice HP upgrade for your legs.<br />
<br />
Elemental Bows kick ass, and since you have 0hp and 0ac bow, that would be a huge increase.<br />
<br />
Grab some valorium rings of gallantry.<br />
<br />
Heavy rubicite belt would be nice, but don;t make it priority, other slots should be first.<br />
Another easy one is change your mask to amyglan chain mask</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morimoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't forget about Ornate gear, could do ya good in arms and bracers and for a lot less than some of the other stuff if money is an issue.  Definitely go for an elemental bow, prices are coming down alot on some of them.<br />
<br />
Priorities would probably be:<br />
Replace bloodpoint<br />
Elemental Bow (any)<br />
Ornate (or better) arms<br />
Ornate (or better) bracer, especially for the slot with 0hp<br />
Helmet of RZ (if you're gonna spend that much, dont skimp for the much lower ac white dragon helm)<br />
Tae Ew pants are a good idea<br />
<br />
After that stuff, you could look into Heavy Rubi Girdle or rings, but bigger HP upgrades in those other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've got stonewood bow #2 on my current list of items to buy, right behind a helm of RZ, however since it's required lvl 61 it's gonna be moot for another 2 weeks or so. The biggest problem is every time I see good warrior arms or legs for sale in the bazaar they are diety specific and Iksar cultural sucks for a warrior. I might have to break down and just do SS arms.<br />
<br />
I'd love crystalized acid bracers, but at 300K a pop they are to costly for me to consider at this point, unless I were to get one of them instead of helm of RZ. Even if my guild did the ring of scale in CT and a bracer dropped I wouldn't touch it with DKP, I'm hording for a AoW ring, bloodfrenzy then VT drops. I think overall my gear is good enough to last until VT with 2-3 more bazaar purchases. <br />
<br />
I prefer the djarn ring to a valorian ring because of more raw HP. All my stats except STA max out shammy buffed and with a few minor upgrades it should as well so I'm focusing on raw HP and AC more then stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morimoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could probably get ornate arms + 2x ornate bracers for 150k total depending on prices on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssuruss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got some dried clay armguards, 30AC 70HP and some other stats, required lvl 55 so can't wear them just yet so that problem is now solved. Just leaves me low on plat so the helm and bow will take a little longer to get now. Thanks for all the advise so far.</div></div><hr />
