<br />
I have made the move to a full featured hosting provider offering several domain name options as well as a full variety of packages for everyone's needs. Domains are $10/year and all packages include PHP/CGI/mySQL (shells available on request) as well as a user friendly control panel which provides a full web based GUI to control every aspect of your site from emails to password protection (full feature list available at http://www.cpanel.net/features-cpanel.html) as well as a program called 'Fantastico' which offers auto installation and configuration of a wide variety of scripts from blogs to photo galleries (full list available at http://studentwebsolutions.com/features.php).<br />
<br />
The server is the one hosting yours truly, TSW and it is located on 14 GIG-E fiber connections from 6 different backbones providing fast connections to both the US and overseas.<br />
<br />
http://www.studentwebsolutions.com/<br />
<br />
Package Overview:<br />
Bronze - No Setup Fee ($6.95/mo)<br />
200 MB Web Space, 4000 MB Transfer, 25 Email Addresses, CPanel, Fantastico, Weekly Backups<br />
<br />
Silver - No Setup Fee ($8.95/mo)<br />
400 MB Web Space, 8000 MB Transfer, 100 Email Addresses, CPanel, Fantastico, Weekly Backups<br />
<br />
Gold - No Setup Fee ($10.95/mo)<br />
700 MB Web Space, 12000 MB Transfer, Unlimited Email Addresses, CPanel, Fantastico, Weekly Backups<br />
<br />
Platinum - No Setup Fee ($14.95/mo)<br />
1500 MB Web Space, 25000 MB Transfer, Unlimited Email Addresses, CPanel, Fantastico, Weekly Backups<br />
<br />
Prices do NOT include a domain, they are an additional $10/year as stated. You can also purchase a 6 month block and receive one free month of service. Custom Packages are available upon request.<br />
<br />
We are offering a 10% off coupon to all of you which is activated at purchase - enter 'tsw1034' into the coupon box on the main purchase page. This 10% will be in effect until service is cancelled and is a full deduction from all services including domains.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that this service is just launching as such, the webpage isn't quite 100% yet and there may be problems.  We will work through anything and provide a rock solid hosting experience for anyone interested.<br />
<br />
That is all, Thank You for listening. Drop me a PM or an email with any questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would highly recomend check with Shorty prices are really comparable and I get the feeling he would do an excellent job.</div></div><hr />
