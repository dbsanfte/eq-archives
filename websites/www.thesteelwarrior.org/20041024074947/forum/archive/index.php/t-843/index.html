<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I prepared this guide to help a guildy do it. Hope it helps:-<br />
<br />
This is my guide to getting the Bracer of Benevolence<br />
MAGIC ITEM NO DROP <br />
AC: +17 Str: +8 Sta: +8 Magic Resist: +12 Fire Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +12 HP: +30 <br />
Weight: 0.1 <br />
Classes: Ranger Paladin Shadowknight Bard Monk Rogue Warrior Beastlord <br />
<br />
First off you need to get a set of scout tools (looks like a small bag) from Commander Leuz in Skyshrine (need ally faction with SS). To find commander Leuz, enter into SS from the WL side - or go from CS side and head to WL entrance.<br />
<br />
From the WL entrance, Go through the gate. <br />
Turn right at the &quot;T&quot; just beyond the gate. <br />
Follow passage to the first room. This is where the Lieutenant is for the Giant Warrior Helm turnins. <br />
Go through the arch to your right. <br />
<br />
Follow passageway and take first left into another room. In this room will be the Commander and two other drakes around a long table.<br />
<br />
Hail him and you can either go through all the chat but if all you want is the tools, just do the following.<br />
<br />
1. Hail<br />
2. Say &quot;what tasks&quot;<br />
3. Say &quot;I accept&quot;<br />
<br />
You will then get a set of scout tools.<br />
<br />
Next, you need to go to WW and look for scout charisa. She spawns on the hill above the tunnel entrance to WW and is on a 12 hour timer. Do not give her the tools if she is holding a bag in her hands - means someone else is doing it. Only if her hands are empty. If empty, give her the tools. <br />
<br />
This will spawn 8 giants near the shoreline just south of the Scout. Seven Kromzek Warriors and one Kromzek Captain.<br />
All you want is the Kromzek Captain. He can be single pulled if 60. Kill him and loot the Broken Disk that he drops. <br />
<br />
Give the disk to Scout Charisa. She'll give you a &quot;Scout's Note&quot; that you can return to Commander Leuz in Skyshrine. She'll also give you the Robe of Benevolence. <br />
<br />
To get the Bracer, give the robe back to her and she will give you the Bracer. For casters, there is a talisman of benevolence they can get, and if you want this all you have to do is hand in the bracer.<br />
<br />
Talisman stats are as follows<br />
<br />
AC: +7 Wis: +15 Magic Resist: +12 Cold Resist: +12 HP: +38 Mana: +55 <br />
Shaman Druid Cleric Beastlord <br />
<br />
Ok to kill the kromzek captain, ive done it a few times with 1 group or less. Hes very magic resistant so melees are preferred. He can be slowed by disease slow so need a sham. He doestn hit all that hard, so warrior over 55 can go defensive, he just has quite a few hps. Safest thing to do is to have everyone inside the WW tunnel and get the puller to bring the giant there. That way you avoid any adds.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best way to find the scout is to just park a alt at the top of the tunnel entrance.<br />
<br />
One last thing, when you hand in the disc you also get a note. You can hand that back to commander leuz for exp. The bracer is not lore, so this can be done twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You don't need to be ally to get the quest.  Top end amiable works.  Other than that it's good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What happens after you turn in the scouts note?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you hand the Scout's note to Leuz you get some more CoV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your friends/guild-members are similarly in the mid 50's I would suggest you take 10-12 people just to make it easy on yourselves. I've done this at 65 with just myself, a shaman and a ranger but at 53 he would not be trivial to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bracer is still one of the best RvR quests out there, not hard to do, fast and the bracer is a decent item.</div></div><hr />

If you pull him to the tunnel, make sure you are gonna win .. because if u die before zoning you will have to wait till he depops.. and it won't be funny for the people who are passing by :D<br />
<br />
For the little story ..we tried him tonight<br />
<br />
My group consisted of a 61 bard, 61 beastlord, 55 warrior (me), 51 cleric 54 SK and 53ish wizard<br />
<br />
Neither the BST or the BRD could slow him, our cleric KEI faded right before the fight, and I was MT'ing the Captain who was Red to me :)  I had only Temperance for HP buffs and I didnt use the disc till late when I started to realise how the cleric mana was draining.<br />
<br />
We managed to take him down to 50 pct health before we tried to run to the SG zone ^_^<br />
<br />
2 group members died while zoning back to WW to find out the Captain was still there and summoning.. I think he depopped after 15 minutes or so..<br />
<br />
Next time we gonna try we havea 61 shammy for disease slow and a FRESH Kei lol and I think he'll be cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gartogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This guy is pretty easy if your level 60 tanking.  I've killed him many times, but the smallest group we did it with was:<br />
<br />
60war<br />
57beast<br />
60druid<br />
<br />
Beast couldn't slow but could land his dots and stuff.  I recommend pulling him right into the tunnel of the zone to SG and fighting him in there, no adds and he's easy to move around.  The time with only 3 ppl was a bit close mana wise (druid was at 20%), but I didn't use a disc at all as we needed all the dps we could get.  Druid had a horse, I think FT10ish or so and had KEI up as well, and a ridiculous mana pool.  You should be good to tank him at 55 but I would bring more damage classes as he has a boat load of hit points.<br />
<br />
Disease slow works well on him, we had a 65 shaman on a few kills and he is really quite easy once slowed.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah turn in the robe to the scout right away, first time I did this I thought you turned the robe in to Luez in SS, almost zoned out to go to SS without getting the bracer.</div></div><hr />
