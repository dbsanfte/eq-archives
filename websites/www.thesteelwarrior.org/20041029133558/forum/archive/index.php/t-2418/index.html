<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I HATE YOU DAMN DRAGON.  My guild tried him for our first time last night and we lost.  Want to know the worst part we wiped on him at freakin 0%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's how dragons should be:  Big and Mean.<br />
<br />
Always a fun and intense fight :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WHen we were first doing him we had 2 wipes with him under 10% when he got pushed into a pillar and ended up on the roof of the building. Talk about suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/nod .. This was a tuff one for us too. LOL we did the same thing got him to 0% and wiped. Im glad that one is over with ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Until you do him 15 times for apps to backflag, of course. Hydrotha &gt; Rydda is slammers world =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">RD is one brutal fight.  It is an all out &quot;kill him before he kills you&quot; deal.<br />
<br />
And yes, wiping when you are so close to killing him sucks (I think we wiped at 6% before we got him - was below 10 anyway)...<br />
<br />
But the good news is that if you can get that close, you know you can beat him.<br />
<br />
And from what I hear, it's a great feeling to see him fall and look around at the carnage and realize that you made it.  Of course, I wouldn't know - I always get rezzed after the excitement is over<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">manaetic behemoth and RD are both little hard for what they get you. if they toned them down a little, i think the rest of pop is about in line really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At the risk of sounding elitist... I LIKE the difficulty of RD.<br />
<br />
I think that there should be certain encounters that are milestones in a guild's progression, and that actually mean something when you beat them.<br />
<br />
There are some I classify this way that are simply a matter of getting the tactics down (Agnarr comes to mind - he was really pretty easy once we learned how to do him) and there are some that are measures of raw power/DPS (RD is a good example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">heh Ludor, i personally think behemoth was slightly too easy. same with Saryrn, TT, Sol Ro. Rydda Dar was of perfect difficulty imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">RD is just a trial mob, yet is on par with the mob he lets you have access to. not saying there shouldnt be difficult encounters, just those two being where they are doesnt make much sense.<br />
<br />
Saryrn could definately use an upgrade, seeing you were originally suppose to beat her after bertoxx and TT. torment in general is just a total waiste though, what shotty design other than little container ring.<br />
<br />
TT is about right for where she is in the game.<br />
<br />
MB belongs in pofire dropping elemental loot = p<br />
the only good thing about him is it stops hordes of ppl from xping in the zone while doing RZ, but originally he was suppose to be in his own separate zone.<br />
<br />
solro is just a loot mob, you already had to beat RZ to get to him and fire anyways. what did want, another RZ with 2x the hp and add spawn rate hehe? you actually have to heal rampage, MT, and your ch crew who are all taking ae damage unlike fennin, kinda weird really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">what did want, another RZ with 2x the hp and add spawn rate hehe?<br />
<br />
no, but i don't want an encounter you win flawlessly on your first attempt, in the shape of Solusek Ro. his gimpiness just doesn't make sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rydda Dar was awesome, I waited until the MA went down, popped AE taunt, hit Fortitude (invuln one if not Fort...) Tanked her for a total of 12 seconds, and died.<br />
<br />
It allowed the Clerics to get the Cheal chain back on the next tank. We generated a ton of completely death-free DPS in that time. (I brought a pickup raid)<br />
<br />
I loved Rydda Dar. Never in my life has 12 seconds felt like I added more value. I didnt have enough hps unbuffed to be more than a speed bump to her if I had been the MA or SA or even TA, but I executed my role flawlessly on that fight, and guess what? <br />
<br />
We won :)<br />
<br />
Rydda is an amazing feeling when you win and you executed a few things correctly. If it is just a pure zerg on her, than I can see why people hate the fight...</div></div><hr />
