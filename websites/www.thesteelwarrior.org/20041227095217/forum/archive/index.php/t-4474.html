<br />
Which is greater aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have either, but I have used Force shock/planar strike and enraging blow and based on that I would guess that Anger III is considerably better for aggro than Ykesha.  Back when AngerIII was 300 hate most people were going for Ykesha, which should have been similar aggro and added dmg as well, but since Anger III got kicked up to 600 hate I think Anger is the way to go.<br />

<br />
It's all conjecture though.<br />
<br />
Does a knockback add any hate? Anyone know?<br />
<br />
Force Strike (Chos) has a KB on it, Planar strike (Sotb) does not.<br />
<br />
But take that for whatever you will. I still mainhand 13 20 over the 12 19 just because it &quot;feels&quot; better.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that is 400 hate vs. Ykesha.<br />

Thats the reason that the Gaudralek was a nice toy for aggro 179 unresistable DD with a knockback ( no stun ).<br />
<br />
Most Weapons with a stun proc on it also have a knockback, mostly 1 ft knockback but some are more extreme like Noge'tal with a 6 ft knockback.</div></div><hr />

Also depends on what weapon you're putting it on.  But Anger III I think would be better than any of the Yak procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going for anger II &amp; III.  I dont want any pushback if it can be avoided.  Even pushback of 1 is enough to send the mob flying depending on how the melee are positioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok well, that blows up that theory ha ha :)<br />
<br />
Planar and Force Shock both have Pushback one on them.<br />
<br />
Funny, I swore my CHOS would push and SOTB would not.<br />
<br />
So sayeth the lucy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kragen</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't know that much about the anger aug since i haven't got one yet, but that is the direction i plan on going... however a monk friend of mine got the highest Ykesha aug and dueled me to see how much it procced (cause orc pawns don't have enough HP hehe)   anyway Ykesha seemed to proc alot would stun me for 1 round of his combat and had some decent push (although his dragon punch helped too :(  )<br />
<br />
anyway knowing how much Ykesha procs does anyone have any comparisons to how much they proc as compared to anger III</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anger 3 is significantly better, but both are great agro, and frankly I preferr the extra dps from the ykesha.  but to each his own ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montagor</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had Force of Ykesha on my Blade of War since the first week of LDoN.  The 125dd + stun (which 98 % of the mobs I faced were immune) was nice agro combined with my range item (75dd + stun)  but after putting Anger 3 on my BoW I won't go back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Montagor's review is the best i've read so far.  I also have had a Yak proc on my BoW since the first week or so of LDoN.  After the patch, they REALLY should have implimented some way for us to get refunds or something.  I guess i'll have to end up spending ~1800 on my anger3 then. . .I guess it's better than having 1h weapons *grin*.</div></div><hr />
