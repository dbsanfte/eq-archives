It seems that the combine function of the scabbard would prohibit us from doing so.  Anything been mentioned about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who uses epic? Currently I use GSoT for all my tanking, MT or otherwise.  Still debating raid tanking with it, but I would say that the agro off it beats any combo I have or can borrow for now (which would probbly max at CHoS + Red Blade).<br />
<br />
And I carry all 3 blades with me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drach</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After all the time and effort I put into getting my epics, only to bank them...I'd kinda like, want to make them usefull again :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

The +atk and the +55(?) dex help quite a bit. Of course, once Avatar is up, I swap right back to my GSot4W. Or my ToD. Or sometimes my 2h epic (debuff proc)...<br />
<br />
I would like to see the epic upgraded, to be worthwhile, like many others. Perhaps they will do it through this item modification system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would anyone use the red scabbard?  Make your two-hander, get a couple swords of runes, make the two 1-handers, and destroy that scabbard.  Net gain, 7 bank/bag slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Brutul says you can combine the dual wield set up to make the two hander, then get the two blades by placing swords of runes in the scabbard and have both the dual wield and 2 hander set up ready to hand. i've not destroyed the scabbard tho just in case (and for sentimental reasons) :)<br />
<br />
However, I wouldn't get my hopes up about the LDoN upgrade loots, I'd be VERY surprised if they allowed you enough leeway to do anything more than make minor cosmetic changes, unfortunately they're unlikely to allow the potential for super weapons that would be needed to upgrade the epic enough.<br />
<br />
just as an exercise in mental masturbation what changes would people favour to give epics back some edge? i'd probably be quite happy with 14/24 to 14/20 (Boc is 15/20 by way of a reference) not too overpowering but not too shabby either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drach</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just what I was thinking. Just by lowering the delay on the 1h and upping the damage on the 2h you'd make them viable again for awhile, not sup weapons but effective enough for those that can get they're hands on them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judin</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to most these days think the epic is simply ghetto.  <br />
Look at the alternatives...20k in the bazaar lands you better 1h combos now...30k in the bazaar lands you better 2h combos (prices and participation may vary)<br />
<br />
For the time it takes to finish the epic most folks could now drum up that cash in combat.  (or semi-close to it)<br />
<br />
Remember when the epics first were introduced and they were wonderful and amazing?  The market is so saturated with better items now that I dont see them regaining that appeal.  Its too bad, because I'd love to see it for all of those folks that did the work to obtain the 'ultimate' quest prize!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see this as a rip-off of Diablo II's rune system.<br />
<br />
You would socket an item (or find a socketed item) and you could insert runes into the sockets in a specific order, and you would get an upgrade to the items stats. There were also jewels that you could insert and they would give bonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know this proably isn't the exact way it will work, but it sounds like a huge rip-off of diablo 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I dont care if they steal every idea from here to kingdom come, as long as they are good ideas.<br />
<br />
Its not like their original ideas have been 100% wonderful to date LOL.<br />
<br />
I say, RIP OFF MORE STUFF!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they dont ripoff anything from other games because if they did it would actually WORK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Asheron's Call has soemthing similar too, I'm told. *shrug*<br />
<br />
As for the epic, I highly doubt these will make them any more useful. Stop trying to breathe life back into a dead horse.  It's an ancient freaking weapon, of course it's not gonna be any good now. Do you still see people going gaga over Yaks?  The only class that's really slaved to their epic are bards, and even that is FINALLY starting to fall to the wayside.<br />
<br />
In short, get over it. The quest is ass, the reward is ass, it's only worthwhile for the sense of achievement but even that kinda looses a bit of the shine when you put them in the bank. Especially when nowadays there are so many cheap or easy to get and far superior weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drach</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahem.  I like my epics because its STILL one of the coolest looking weapons in the game.  I worked hard to get them, took me a long time.  If I can make them usefull again, you bet your ass I will.  Do I care that you seem to think we shouldn't want this? Not in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Havent Sony said that they are not going to upgrade epics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drach</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the new expansion LDoN you can upgrade items ala Diablo 2 by attaching something to the item.  In this way the epics may be able to be upgraded through your own efforts and not Sony's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...I had thought they killed that whole Sword of Runes thing a while back.<br />
<br />
I'm doing a wait and see on that whole augment system.  Considering all they said about the charms, and we found out they were practically worthless considering the effort you had to go through to get them, I'm going to wait and see exactly how much you can augment something.<br />
<br />
If you can add more than just 5hp (or any other stat) to something, and aren't forced to fight for 6-15 hours to get one single item to augment something...then it might have some benefits.  Otherwise, I'm going to consider it to have very little worth like charms have.  (other than the people who did the AC key, pretty much everyone's going to be using the planes charm...haven't seen a new charm get discovered since.)<br />
<br />
Then there's the question of &quot;can you de-augment something&quot;, or what other restrictions are there...and are the augments no drop?  How many augments can you have per item?  Is there a total limit like how FT and Vengeance have?  Far too many questions about the system to warrant any strong hope right now for me.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh BTW, I never played Diablo 2, but this sounds a heck of a lot more like the system used in the Korean MMOG &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot;.  They have &quot;cards&quot;, which you can attach to your weapons to make them stronger, or faster, or special damage against certain monsters.<br />
<br />
Don't let the above statements make you think I hate this.  I think it's a great idea, and I have strong hopes for it.  But considering how useful charms could have been, and the seemingly lack of real effort in coming up with good charms that people are willing to go all the way to LoY and hunt for hours to get, I'm not too enthusiastic about it right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember when epics were first introduced and nobody had a warrior epic cause it was the hardest due to ppl not knowing how to kill queen, and rare zerg attempts had no blade drop :)<br />
<br />
I also remember when people finally DID kill her, and people were amazed how bad warrior epic compared to its difficulty was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guildleader had a good idea (in guildchat) a while ago about making the epics useful even right up to high endgame. <br />
<br />
Why not have epics across the board for all classes improve themselves the with more flags you accumulate just in the same way that charm we all got improves its stats. The warrior epic base 14/24 could improve with the more flags/zones you unlocked....the pure stats could improve...the effects on the blades could also improve, possibly even having enraging blow at the higher end. It would make them useful again to those who think it's a shame to have to bag them (which I agree with, it's a shame).<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, RVR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing you are overlooking is that any augment we could do to the epic blades we could do to OTHER weapons.  So if there was an augment to lower delay on a 1 handed weapon by 4 points, why in the hell would I apply that to my epic blade at delay 24 when I could apply it to a 20 delay weapon making it a 16?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darkoan, because it's your epic, your class defining weapon/whatever.....not some piece of loot you picked up on number xxx hunt/raid.<br />
<br />
These days I still see heaps of people still pursue to finish their epics, even though there is loads better out there for them currently and in future. Epics *still* seem to hold more of a pride of achievment status than some dropped weapon for many people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense Britty but if you think I'd lower the delay on one of my epic 1handers instead of my primal 1hb yer nutz!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope I'm not nutz at all. I'm just saying it would have been cool if Sony allowed upgrading of epics by opening pop flags, same way the charm item we all have now does. That way they would be useful until endgame instead of being bagged by so many.<br />
<br />
I didn't mention nor include any other weapons in my original post, only epics :p <br />
<br />
I think the way the game engine works now and the sheer number of weapon items in the game, allowing incremental improves on all of them across the board would be a nightmare to support and deciphar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I multiquested my sky blade, banked my queen blade and refused to roll on the green scale, and all the other drops because the epic is crap.<br />
<br />
Theres no way I'd waste anytime whatsoever for that piece of crap.<br />
<br />
I also remember when the epic came out, and people prefered blade of the black dragon eye over it, a sebilis drop, which they nerfed instead of upgrading the warrior pathetic epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drach</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don'tcha love it when the kiddies get off track on a thread.  Personally, I could care less if you like the warrior epic or not.  I have it, took me a long time to get it.  It was a goal of mine and an accomplishment I'm proud of.  You don't like the epic? Fine, buzz off and tell someone who cares.  /rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Judin</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to agree.  The question never was about whether or not epics are cool.  The question was simply stated, whether or not the epics would be augmented as part of the new process.  <br />
<br />
Simply ranting about epic performance is silly if you ask me.  OF COURSE there are better weapons out there.  No one is disputing that at all.<br />
<br />
But why the hell wouldn't you entertain ideas of being able to make your epic useful again?  Why is that such a desparaging question?<br />
<br />
I like Britty's idea and wish that Verant would do something that actually made the 'epic' weapons worth while for the long haul...instead of what they have become.  Augmenting could be a way to achieve this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The information is confusing on 'augmentation' items... One developer said they only worked with special sets of gear..somewhere else it was stated you could 'fix up that old piece of armor'...<br />
<br />
Anyways we'll know for sure in a couple of weeks!</div></div><hr />

Epics are cool. <br />

Finishing difficult quests helps define you as a character and as a person. <br />

More power to epic owners.</div></div><hr />

I was damn happy to finish that quest after a year and a half, but they went straight into the bank. I really doubt that any upgrades possible through LDoN will be enough to help them.</div></div><hr />

Just take armour dying 1 step further and allow people to replace the graphic of a weapon with another. Hell there virtually no cool looking unique weapons anymore anyway so who cares.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxus Diablus</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most characters have a favorite item that they've had in their bank for a while. They don't want to destroy it because it holds some memories, a link to the adventures they had gaining it. With this new item augmentation system, those items gain new life and endless potential!<br />
The only way they will be able to live up to that statement is to cap stats on augmented items.  <br />
<br />
It's more likely going to be some garbage like add +5 str to some piece of gear you are already using.  I'm not going to bank my Vind BP just because I can add some stat to my old Indi BP.  I'll add the stat to the Vindi &amp; the Indi will keep rusting in the bank just that same as it has for years.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, I found some 50ac BP that was otherwise identical to my Vind BP, but with no HP, I would use the 50ac BP assuming a 100HP cap on augmented stats.  This would have to assume I could not augment an item to have higher that 100 HP.  That would mean augmenting the 50ac BP with the 100HP thereby making it superior (the vind BP could not be augmented to have any higher HP than it already has).  <br />
<br />
That is the only way something like this could work.  Otherwise, it is just more min/maxing with existing gear, because its better to modify the superior pieces you are already using.  <br />
<br />
Blah.</div></div><hr />
