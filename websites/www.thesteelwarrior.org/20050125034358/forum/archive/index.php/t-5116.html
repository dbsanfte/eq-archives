<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. It's one of the first internet chat protocols and is still very popular. If you're intimidated, don't be - it's just multiplayer notepad.<br />
<br />
First off, you will need an IRC client. There are many to choose from. mIRC is popular. Trillian has a good IRC client as well. I hear even Mozilla has a built in IRC client, not to mention the several web-based IRC clients. Point is, pick one that is comfortable to and accessible by you.<br />
<br />
Once it's installed, you'll have to join the server. This isn't too hard. Look around the menus or the FAQ included with the program to find the exact way to do this. In mIRC, you can click File &gt; Select Server or Alt-E, then go to Connect &gt; Servers. You may also have to add a new server, which is self-explanatory once you reach the menu.<br />
<br />
In the server box, type &quot;irc.thesteelwarrior.org&quot; w/o the quotes. The port box should already read 6667, but enter that if it's not already there. Type whatever you want in the description; I use &quot;TSW.&quot; You can leave the password blank for now. You'll also want to choose a &quot;nick,&quot; which is a handle or username. Then, just hit connect!<br />
<br />
Once you are connected, you'll want to type &quot;/join #thesteelwarrior&quot; in the server window w/o the quotes. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
A little technical jargon - <br />
<br />
channel - what you probably think of as a chat room. channels usually have the pound sign # in front of them.<br />
<br />
op - an admin of the channel, stands for operator. they usually have a @ sign in front of their name.<br />
<br />
voice - granted to channel users, it allows them to speak when the channel is &quot;moderated.&quot;<br />
<br />
moderated - a channel status that silences anyone who isn't an op or doesn't have voice.<br />
<br />
kick - a temporary boot from the channel by an op. usually a warning.<br />
<br />
ban - pretty self-explanatory =) there are all kinds of bans. when someone is banned, you'll see a message with +b in front of their username or ip address or some such.<br />
<br />
idle - when a user doesn't type anything for a while. lots of people with perma net connections will stay in a channel 24/7, so don't be put off if they don't say anything to you at times.<br />
<br />
On to Nickserv!<br />
<br />
Nickserv is a service that lets you keep a nick on a certain server. Once you register your nick with a password, you can get the nick back any time as long as you have the password and have logged in within the last 30 days.<br />
<br />
To register your nickname, type &quot;/nickserv register passwordyouwant email&quot; without the quotes. Don't worry about spam - I've not gotten any from registering. Now, you can enter this password in the server menu and it will be entered when you log on.<br />
<br />
If your nick is stolen, or if you are disconnected but come back to find your nick is still online, type<br />
<br />
/nickserv recover yournick yourpassword<br />
<br />
afterwards, type<br />
<br />
/nickserv release yournick yourpassword<br />
<br />
then, just type /nick yournick and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
Incessant leaving and re-entering a channel is considered to be bad etiquitte. I got chewed out pretty good the first time I did that =)<br />
<br />
Anyway, come hang out with us. =)</div></div><hr />

MO is currently down, but Reebo made a program that lets you use IRC from Internet Explorer. Works well from my experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people are too lazy or stupid for IRC or can't use it from work.  I may or may not fit one or more of these adjectives.</div></div><hr />

to download priate stuff also it can be used by hackers to gain access to you computer also they can transmit Viruses to your computer also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flyntao</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can only get a virus if you use an unknown mIRC script or accept files from someone you don't know. It's just like any other program where you are able to recieve files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are occasional security exploits though, mostly in mIRC because it's so popular. That's a good reason to use a lesser-known IRC client, kinda like an advantage of Mozilla over MSIE.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the exploits are usually neutered quickly, so no worries =)</div></div><hr />
