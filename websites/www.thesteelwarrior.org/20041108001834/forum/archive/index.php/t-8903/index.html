<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having lived with the first rebalance for some time and programmers soon having free time I think it is time to look at fixing some of the issues with melee.<br />
<br />
Primarily on my list is making Combat Ability's more useable, while more abilities are useable few are because of our singular focus of our self buff line, want +15 to all resists well your going to block defensive or furious if you need them AND reduce your end. In most cases the risk of not being able to use the abilities we are there for makes every other one useless.<br />
<br />
I think we need to have some abilities that should be able to be constantly in effect with no limit on duration or how often we can trigger them. That would include everything on timer 4 though fearless would need to have its upkeep cost put up to 100 to keep balance. Though there are only 5 abilities in type 4 this would allow the introduction of a wide range of abilities that could impact in minor ways everything from a dis that would add +5 stamina at lower levels to +25 stamina at higher levels or slight boosts in AC say from 5ac at level 30 ish to 30 at level 70.<br />
<br />
To keep game balance no more than say 4 should be useable at once and in the interface should look like the way pet buffs are displayed as small boxes along the right that a hold over would bring a name up and allow you to click them off so your minor abilities would not take buff space. As well the Bezerker group buffs should go in this box so as not to block defensive or other dis that may be necessary.<br />
<br />
Casters have a wide open system that lets them pick and chose what is necessary or fun with no more thought than if they want it or not, at the moment we don’t have the luxury. Any new ability introduced in the current system will suffer from the necessities of a class’s primary function. Having other the ability to trigger more than one at once makes end more useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was my primary issue on another subject END regen is set way too low at current levels most warriors will run dry from a rare use of an ability and 1 incite per pull. Unlike classes that use mana we cannot reduce our cost at all and we only have the ability to get 3 extra endurance regen at great cost. Compared to casters with FT 3 from AA’s, 10 or 15% mana pres, and an extra 15-25% mana pres plus speciation firing sometimes reducing cost by around 50% I think when it fires, worn mana regen for FT 15, extra stackable item mana regen for FT 5, self buffed FT 3, C5 FT 18, PoT9 8, SD 8 and 24 from bard for 71 mana regen towards the upper end and a minimum of 32 with at least C3 you can get in PoK.<br />
<br />
That leaves warriors having less than 1/15 of caster regen and mana pres that lowers spell cost around 60%. Granted we use incite less often but all out available end regen does not make up for a group fast pulling.<br />
<br />
I am in a raiding guild it is rare that the healers need ask for a break and when they do they are back up fast, 1-2 min’s for a cleric will get them close to maximum mana while I need 10 min of standing there for the same. As bard mana regen was too low so is melee end regen.</div></div><hr />

I definatly agree that the endurance system needs a reworking for reasons stated.. but just for the simple fact of it, look at incite as a prime example.  Incite was to be the way to balance warriors back into the tank position and be able to have the &quot;snap&quot; aggro pally's and SK's have with spells.  But as was stated, using a rare ability and 1 incite per pull will drain the endurance down rather quick, yet the pally's and SK's aren't using any end to still have those spell snap aggroes.<br />
<br />
End regen needs to in some way be put into balance so the warriors that don't have Anger 10 billion can keep a way to snap the aggro back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't see the problem with removing the endurance cost from the incite line and removing the type system from the combat abilities, with the exception of leaving defensive/evasive/stonewall tied together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I agree Warirors don't really have much burst damage flexability, other than almost nothing affecting Endurance regeneration I don't have many issues at all with the current system.<br />
<br />
The mitigation/avoidance disciplines refresh timers are long enough that it encourages guilds to have a MT rotation rather than to rely on one or two MT's. They are also long enough to prevent undergeared for the content Warriors from hitting Defensive on every mob in an effort to Tank where they do not yet belong.<br />
<br />
Yes, Fellstrike is a little weak and Mighty Strike is useful if you want to get in a couple 40 HP Cripples prior to low HP aggro giving you a chance to make a Peridot run for the Clerics. But, I think the crit issue is being addressed on a variety of fronts.<br />
<br />
Endurance regen sure would be nice, especially after taking a death. If casters didn't have KEI, FT, Necro twitch, and Bard songs they'd be a little concerned about regen after death too.<br />

The only time I have ever run out of END is at death.   I am still trying to find that group that makes people run out.    Besides regening it after a death, anything new they add to END is a waste.   Even non stop KT pulling has never barely dent'd END.     Do the ones that run out of END consistently spam there stuff or something?    I see any AA that has to due with END regeneration a complete waste of time and effort.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The main problem I have is Sony balancing itemization around the concept that Endurance = Mana, when infact getting more and more +endurance does pretty much nothing at all.

In a fast pulling xp group I need the extra agro of Incite to keep everyone from stealing agro.  If I use incite on every mob I'll run out of endurance before long - and that's if I only  use Incite and no other discs.  Granted, everyone else in the group could slow their dps so I can hold agro without incite, but that kinda defeats the purpose of a good xp group.  ;) <br />
<br />
So - no, I don't constantly spam Incite...but I would like to use it once per mob.  (at least being able to use it once per every other mob would be good)<br />
<br />
Of course, it could be a gear thing...I'm not elemental so my gear doesn't have much End, and I don't have anything close to high-end agro weapons/gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You must be killing REALLY fast to run out just using incite on every mob.

The last few times I've done xp grinding I've had good dps groups that included at least 1 or 2 high-end GoD geared types - it's amazing how fast they drop the dark elves in Hate  :p .  For example, last night in Hate we did 16% of lvl 66 in 2 hours - including taking a couple breaks.  During that time we killed about 112 mobs (7 mobs per 1%.)  A few times during the grind I got down to 50% End and told everyone to back off a bit so I could stop using Incite and regen End.  The only time I used another disc was when we were about to take a break and I used an offensive disc for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just an observation there- high end gear is LOADED with endurance, so much that the endurance augs in KT rot w/o fail.  Personal experience is that Remf basically NEVER runs out of end unless he died and hadn't regen'ed up yet.  I'll use furi + stonewall + mighty/fellstrike and chain bellow and still never go much below 30%, and be regen'ed to full before the long reset discs are back up...<br />
<br />
Note, this may change w/ the new oow discs, but there's a pretty cheap GoD AA that bumps up regen already...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I fought a named mob in OoWar yesterday which showed me that there's going to be a real problem with endurance in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
This mob memblurred and dispelled itself constantly. Needless to say, that makes incite a hell of a lot less usefull.<br />
<br />
I was forced to taunt and incite constantly, and even still I was constantly losing aggro to everyone else, and this is with 3 seperate aggro generating procs on top of taunt and incite.<br />
<br />
Excaberating the situation was the fact that the monster had a metric asston of hitpoints. It took 10 to 15 minutes to get this mob dead. I ran out of endurance for about the last 40% of the fight. Since endurance will not regen during fights, that meant I was down to taunt and procs to attempt to hold aggro. I estimate that I was able to hold aggro MAYBE 40% of the time.<br />
<br />
The fact that the mob constantly dispelled itself is best for another thread, as it really screws over the usefullness of non instant effect casting casters, but the constant memblur and the long fights mean that warriors will be burning all of their endurance trying to keep aggro. If knights were to tank, they'd likely burn all of their mana as well, but mana regeneration capabilities mean it would take much longer.<br />
<br />
BTW, I fought 3 seperate named in Oowar last night, just exploring and messing around. be warned, as all 3 that I enountered did the dispell and memblur, expect that to happen a lot.<br />
<br />
Edit: named was Murkglider School Leader in Noble's Causeway, took 11 minutes to kill with 9 people mostly elemental equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I run out of endurance constantly unless all I use is Bellow.  I hit every mob we pull with Bellow and occasionally pop furious and/or stonewall for named or emergency situations.  I rarely have enough left over for Fellstrike.  I'm sure the endurance regen AAs will help but IMO we need more.  As for endurance augments, they are 100% useless.  My endurance pool isn't the problem, it's my rate of regeneration.  I would gladly sacrifice 50% of my total endurance pool for a 25% increase in regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Usualy when I am raiding I usualy have plenty of end, I also chain bellow, furrious and defensive. Before long I am at maximum end.  But if I am the MA at the time I use bellow or incite every pull and also need to take my turn at tanking mobs with furrious and defensive. That leaves me dry for after the raid level mob when pulls start, and mabey it should some that makes warriors share jobs.<br />
<br />
But when I am exping I am it, there are no other tanks covering my back I need to keep on pulling and fast. Every zone that you can fast pull in I will go OoE because I use every tool to increase starting agro I can, I use +damage abbilitys when I can, Furrious and def on named. I dont think I am over using any ability because you achieve your pontential through ussage of your abilitys. The incite line was set up to allow for one use per mob for a reason. The same with the sepperate dis timers and there usage more often than never.<br />
<br />
On level 60 content you still need to use one incite per pull but the diffarance is the &quot;incite&quot; you have uses less end and most importantly you kill much slower while your end pool may go up by 50% the ammount you need to regen per round time to keep up with faster pulls because of higher DPS/kill rates means that your relative regen rate goes down. Look at casters in this expansion:<br />
<br />
Per tick EXTRA regen from OoD:<br />
<br />
9 upgrade =1 <br />
SV upgrade = 2<br />
C5 upgrade = 2<br />
Bard song upgrade = 2<br />
cleric self only buff upgrade = 1<br />
<br />
So max regen rate is up by 8 from OoW and we get what 3? and only 2 if we are fighting? Let alone they get focus effects to reduce the cost of new skills.<br />
<br />
Sony wants to show how foward there thinking is, then lets hear a response on  these issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know what kind of groups some are getting, but if I do any Vxed, Tipt, PoHate, PoEarth groups, I always run out of endurance from 1 incite per mob.<br />
<br />
All these places have 40 to 70 kills per hour minimum and at that rate of kills you WILL run out of endurance.  I also didn't have super gear since my endurance was only 4700 or so.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem is you NEED incite for GoD zones.  PoHate doesn't seem to require incite (for two reasons, the enchanter can tank just fine if they get agro and the mobs don't seem to generate so much spell hate as GoD mobs.)  GoD zones (vxed and tipt etc) have really high hate from spells it seems.  Most of the time doing vxed for exp the kills per hour will be 50 to 60.  At that rate I run out of endurance fast and then the agro goes to hell.  I am very limited on what players I can go to vxed.  I need enchanters, clerics, etc that can tank just fine in that zone.  There are not many that can fit that bill.<br />
<br />
We are even more screwed since the new incite is more endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hordaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with the issue of End regen, but I don't think the solution is solely one of enhancing warrior End regen either innately or with items.  To be sure, it would be nice, maybe even needed, if there was a focus type effect for End Regen similar in fashion to mana regen, but that would be only half the approach IMO.<br />
<br />
For all you oldtimers like me, been playing both warrior and cleric since Nov 2000, remember when Stamina was actually an issue?  Remember those fast pulling places like CB, Unrest, KC, Seb, Guk, etc when your little yellow bar would go to zero and your attacks slowed and you couldn't jump anymore?  There was a &quot;cure&quot; for that then.  It was called Extinguish Fatigue, a Clr lvl 19, Dru lvl 29, Sha lvl 39, Enc lvl 44 and Rng lvl 54 spell that replensished 90 stamina.  It was a one spell line; no upgrades to it have ever been added; when melee stamina changed to endurance, no changes were made to the spell or upgrades added to those classes' spell repertoire.<br />
<br />
There NEEDS to be limiting factors in combat encounters;  a limit or weakness of one class compenstated for by an ability or strength of another class.  Risk vs reward and cooperative gameplay are fundamental to the game.  Those limits are currently, pretty much, healer mana and tank agro, and back in the day melee stamina.  What's the point really, if a tank, of any class, can get instant and unbreakable agro allowing nukers to nuke, shooters to shoot and backstabbers to backstab and dotters to dot at max DPS and max pull rate without regard to risk or consequence?<br />
<br />
I say to the developers, treat End like Mana thereby being consistent in approach.  Clerics, (using as an example, since I also play one), have Mana Regen (formally Flowing Thought) and mana pool increasing items available, have innate Mana Regen (Mental Clarity and self buffs), mana regen and mana pool size alteration from another classes' buff(s), (Enc clarity line and Bst Spritual line), and direct mana replenishment (Nec and Bst spell lines).<br />
<br />
So far, all that's been done that I know about, is adding End to items to increase the End Pool and a couple AAs for End regen (Heightened Endurance (GoD) and Fitness (OOW)).  Where's the class interdependence stuff?  Where's the End buff (either separate or part of an existing line)?  Where's the End &quot;heal&quot; (Extinguish Fatigue line needs a desparate upgrade)?  Doesn't have to be much; can even be mana expensive if needed to preserve encounter pace and risk.  But there should be something, if only to be consistent.<br />

Questions:<br />
Do you ever stop and have a med break for your casters?<br />
Is there time between pulls?<br />
Are you killing a new mob every 33-35 seconds?<br />
Is your Endurance Pool so high that you simply don't notice it lowering very much until someone else steps AFK for a minute and it can replenish?<br />
<br />
In my experience, when I go to settle down and do a regular LDoN to slouch and relax, My group typically has a new mob (as the old one is dying) as (or sometimes before) my incite button has come back up, and while I don't ALWAYS need it, it is a nice insurance, one I can't keep using without running out. I had the same problem in BoT the other day when it was almost empty and we walked in with mostly time equipped DPS...</div></div><hr />

Endurance regen is like.. 30 per tick ? so a 36 sec fight regens 180 endurance ? <br />
I.e incite spend 250, regen 180, net cost -70... With an endurance score of 4500 means you'd have to do 64 36 sec fights non-stop in a row to lose all endurance. That's more then 38 minutes of non-stop fighting, with not a single second lost..... People actually, really, truthfully fight like that ? I mean, on a regular basis ?<br />
<br />
Only thing about endurance regen that bugs me, is the 'unfairness' I perceive in mana-using classes (who can do a shitload more /w their mana then us melee's do with our endurance btw) gain a lot more regen in the form of items of spells, every expansion , then us melee's do.<br />
<br />
Maybe adding some sort of ratio to added endurance regen to hitpoint regen would solve that.<br />
<br />
Edit: And before people jump on me... I can do Vxed, Tipt, poE, PoF all day long and not run out of endurance, and did both Vxed and Tipt without chanter-charm, i.e we just killed a shitlot of mobs, never had endurance problems, occasionally had hitpoint problems  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  In a good group I'll have a bard or chanter pulling and there will be 1 or 2 mobs mezzed and in camp at all times while we're fighting.  Time to kill each mob is usually about 20-45 seconds with an average of just over 30 seconds usually.  Sometimes Bellow hasn't refreshed yet when we get to the next mob.  No time wasted waiting for a successful taunt before mez break either.  I taunt once and then break mez + Bellow whether taunt was successful or not.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I've had KT groups where we're pulling non stop for 6+ hours at a time with no breaks, no deaths, no time to even refresh my clickies other than when a mob starts to run.  Most of my groups aren't that nice but it happens.  17 AAs in 6 hours is pretty nice for a non AE group.  Usually I use stonewall a few times here or there for bosses but even without it my endurance steadily drops in a group like that.</div></div><hr />

Allow END regen to be as fast as mana regen and I'll agree.  I havnt clocked it but someone mentioned earlier END regens at 30? per tick while fighting.  VoQ+9 alone is 27.  BST buffs add on to that and so on... <br />
<br />
Normal agro spells (from what ive seen) cost far less than 250 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yes, it's funny they de-linked discs and are now linking spells?<br />
<br />
Rigeld, you need to remember that a SK (or even a  ranger sadly ) is spending the rest of their mana (the rest of that ft19+buffs they had to get) to cast DPS spells to end up doing.... less DPS than a warrior in equivalent gear is doing by just meleeing. A situation which SOE is making even worse by linking nukes.<br />
<br />
My point is this... Warriors are balanced around their discs and combat skills and gear (balanced around end-game level and then working back from there).<br />
<br />
In EXACTLY THE SAME WAY hybrids are balanced around their spells/foci (balanced around 40% end game foci and worn 19 mana regen, and then working back from there). <br />
<br />
But from my experience on this board you I expect you won't see this and will happily ask for  endurance regen as a right (because its what makes your class work) while at the same time still maintaining that hybrid gear has to be about compromises when our power is already defined/limited by our spell lines (which no longer have anything to do with our so called parent classes... just take a look at them).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rigeld, you need to remember that a SK (or even a  ranger sadly ) is spending the rest of their mana (the rest of that ft19+buffs they had to get) to cast DPS spells to end up doing.... less DPS than a warrior in equivalent gear is doing by just meleeing. A situation which SOE is making even worse by linking nukes.<br />

Actually, I disagree with what SoE has done ala linking spells.  And as a monk who uses 250 END on many pulls, and Earthwalk pretty often also (75END/second), Innerflaming when I can (60/second), I rarely run into situations where I run low on endurance. (and yes, I chain pull as much as possible, tho not in Vxed (yet).. mostly Ele Planes and SRT)<br />
<br />
I dont need END regen, unless soloing.  Looking at the end game equipment, some SKs are wearing WAR/SK/PAL/CLR armor.. using jewelry slots for the focus effects.  I dont play a full time caster or hybrid, so im not sure that is an effective way to go about things.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully with the linking nukes thing, ya'll will be able to have them raise the mana:damage ratio on the nukes, and make them cast faster.  Its not like you can chain nuke (recast times) or use multiple nukes (linked).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Woodelfwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i dont think there needs to be a endurance regen , even as marginal it is the aa regen's would do the job.<br />
<br />
<br />
myself i am never running out of endurance unless i am tanking something i am unfamiliar with then i incite and then evasive or defensive but that only happened a few times and prolly wont happen again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont like the way they linked the spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
and your comment on warriors doing more dps then a ranger / sk in melle is this triple attack and flurry with 2 handers is some real nice dps. imo i think sk's should be allowed flurry and rangers flurry also.<br />
<br />
in the end the pure melee are becoming alot stronger, think about it a berserker and rouge are in the top 3 dps , warrior number 1 tank and monk number 1 puller ( nasty blow to rangers for no new harmony ) the game is going in the era of pure melee and focused class's ( class's with only one thing they excell at ) instead of the mixed class's having a edge.<br />
<br />
but there other things also wrong with the game like why have a shaman when a bst slows good enough and buffs good enough and makes fights easier  with paragon? <br />
<br />
or like why have a ranger who cant pull while a berserker puts to shame his combined dps of spells and melee?<br />
<br />
why pick up a secondary tank for unmezzables when a pet can offtank fine when slowed ( omens  and  only when they are nicely buffed )<br />
<br />
thoose are the things that groups ask themselves everyday and the first is why take a shadowknight over a warrior who tanks less?<br />
<br />
i hope everything gets cleared up and gets going but there will always be a class that excells totally at one thing and will always be more &quot; liked &quot; in that area of there job, since groups make for max dps / max pulling and max healing and 65% slow is good enough to get by.</div></div><hr />

While you are at it, give em Rampage, and AE Taunt just in case they might need it. If you didnt notice, monks were given a Flurry AA too, not sure who other class did.<br />
You are comparing meele DPS but never saying that the ranger and SK have spells to make up for a *possible* DPS disadvantage (I dont think the ranger's DPS is lower than the warrior).<br />
<br />
monk number 1 puller <br />
<br />
My group of friends always prefered bards as pullers, since LDoN, bards were kinda given a more important pulling job. Dont forget that bards can simply paci a whole room while monk's paci works on a single mob with a reuse time, in those rooms full of mobs, monks have to FD and split em, which takes more time than the bard pacing all and pulling one. In my opinion, I think bards have an advantage over monks, at least, that was my experience.<br />
<br />
There was gonna be an End Regen spell in GoD, it was the Shaman Ward, which never worked as that, instead it was sold as an End Regen but it always worked as a HP Regen, I still dont understand why they did that and my shammy friend was dissapointed when he found out he had spent all those AAs for something that was not an End Regen.<br />
<br />
One of the problems I see, is that Endurance only gets drained on a tanking duty. We are now 2 warriors on our group of friends, and when one is tanking, the other stands with their Endurance bar full till he can pop Fellstrike, then back to full till it repops... clearly there is no use for Endurance if you are not in tanking duty (lets forget possible adds and offtanking for a second) since most of the offensive disciplines are on the same timer and the rest are all geared towards tanking, so we have warriors with full End pools when they are not tanking, something that doesnt happen with any other End AND Mana using classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>khur sed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Only time I ever ran out of endurance was doing an easy ldon chain pulling 5-6 at a time, and after dying in a very fast pulling KT group.<br />
<br />
I'd love more dmg, I think my aggro is fine, unless people really try and be smart about stealing it.<br />
<br />
I outdamage many people in my guild mainly, because I'm one of the few who has all his offensive aa and max worn attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">One thing I find wrong is that I outdps a well geared EP monk.  And if I do, then warriors do even more so. <br />
<br />
If a rog with ifir handily outdps knights/warriors a few tiers higher then monks with zha's (or whatever) should too. <br />
<br />
Looks at it like this... an EP warrior tanks better than me but an EP monk doesnt out dps me. Something badly wrong there.<br />
<br />
This is where monks are comming from with the current 'whines'.  A monks dps advantage is pathetic compared to a warriors tanking advantage. i.e. a time warrior is outdpsing an EP monk easily... but are they now tanking like an EP warrior in return?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Monk are not supposed to be tanks, Naubi, whereas warriors have always been in the middle to low area of DPS.   Someone with a higher level of gear and better places to hunt will have an advantage in gear and weapons.   That is called progression.   It has its rewards.   When a time monk is out done by a time tank then its a problem.  Many of the strengths of the monks are utilities like FD, mend and the like.   Monks should be after bards not us warriors for cutting into their once dominated role of pulling.<br />
<br />
Warriors are a baseline class.  Other classes are based off them other classes may not like this but its true.    (SK is warrior/ necro, PAL is warrior/cleric and RANG is warrior/druid)   I would guess that we are the baseline for tanking and melee DPS.  I do not think the monk class is based off us oer se but that we are a standard that it is measured against.  Of course we should compare well in many aspects to this is all we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">originally, the EQ war balance board were starting like this<br />
&quot;The warrior class is the base one, from which all other are balanced around. Doing this there is no balance definition for Warriors. However we still have put this board to let you report comment on other classes balance, and unbalance, so that you help us to correct them with an outside point of view.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
so, even if I stoped reading this one a long long time ago, I still think such statment (one class is used for the base, even if it's not anymore warriors) is partly true at SoE.</div></div><hr />
