I looted one of these the other day helping a rogue friend with his epic.  This came from a spawned mob in Steamfront...Renux Isanastybithchifyournotready....don't think I spelled her last name right but hey.  Haven't used it too extensively yet.  Got it to proc a few times whens I was in Chardok, was pretty good agro against a dozen other melees...cept when the mob(s) got completely zerged and died in a few secs. Anyone else put this to use in combat and want to share their opinion on it?</div></div><hr />

Even then I thought that the agro it generated was pretty low.  I guess its because you can only use the weapon in the offhand, but it never seems to proc much.</div></div><hr />

Nothing worse than dueling someone and be spinning arund and to have no idea where the other guy is. Doesnt proc a whole bunch but fun to use.</div></div><hr />
