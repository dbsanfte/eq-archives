Thanks in advance for your replies.</div></div><hr />

How can you go wrong with ATK and resists?  The STA is nice too if you're not already maxed.  If I can convince a BL to cast it on me, I'll take it.</div></div><hr />

Never have it during raids though due to lack of buff slots and the duration of which it lasts.  It's nice buff to have handy if you have the slots open though and a beast lord willing to keep it up on you :)</div></div><hr />

I totally disagree of course.<br />

Ferocity is an awesome spell and I'll make room to get that one on my buff list.  On raids, yeah it probably doesn't need to be on the 6th tank on the list but as far as I'm concerned the MT and probably ST should have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it on raids only when resists are really important. Otherwise, I simply don't have enough buff slots available for it. For experience groups and whatnot, sure I'll take it every chance I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahes</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always have Fero available for the MT if they request it, but generally they don't have enough buff slots.<br />
<br />
As for who I usually put it on, it's always on myself :P and then I usually use it on rogues or monks.  Primarily monks due to their dps not being as situational if a mob is walled or cornered.  I also have used it on some of our lesser-geared clerics for fights such as PoTime Saryrn.<br />
<br />
If you BST is raiding and using a fero on their pet, smack them.</div></div><hr />

atk is pretty much only for the expgrind *G*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tend to use it for the MT/RT if resists are an issue and especially if the target procs something resistable.  Otherwise our Beasts cycle the Rogues and typically themselves and thier pets.  The last part is a little silly really but hey, when constantly bugging them for a short duration buff I don't worry about it too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When doing LDoN normal missions, where resists are completely irrelevant, my beastlord keeps Ferocity up on herself, my warrior, and any rangers, rogues, or monks in our party.  I've never even considered putting it up on my pet, although perhaps I should be.  At 600 mana, it's approximately 2000 damage in nukes (with E'ci focus); is my pet likely to do 2000 more damage in the 8 minutes it lasts (SCR 3) due to having Ferocity on it?  That's an extra 4.16 DPS; and since 150 ATK is approximately a 15% increase in DPS, that would require my pet to be doing 28 DPS.  Which my pet certainly does somewhat more than.  <br />
<br />
So yes, I should be keeping Ferocity up on my pet, if we don't already have two other  melee DPS in my party.  Huh.  Who knew.<br />
<br />
Of course, that's assuming my pet is fighting every second of that 8 minutes.  Counting pull time and OTM time and such, we're probably only looking at 5 minutes of effective fighting, meaning the DPS increase would need to be 6.6, and the pet's raw DPS would need to be 44.  Unfortunately, I've been unable to find answers on what my pet's DPS is at level 65, with the LDoN pet focus.  Any information would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
NOTE: the obvious right choice, of course, is to buff the enchanter's charmed pet first, then the rogues, then the rangers, then the monks, and then the beastlord and/or pet.  But I'm really unsure on the relative merits of buffing the beastlord vs. buffing the pet, or buffing either one vs. spending the mana on nukes. <br />

Most of the time though, it's not very necessary, but we do it anyways.  :)  It's then cycled to, as it should be, rogues/rangers/monks/etc.  FA is always dps class first, at least in my guild, but sometimes I'm able to get one just in time for a boss fight.  /snicker</div></div><hr />

Its just a useless buffslot.  Bards work 20 times better on tz + can dispell the neg 300 all resists debuff if you stack like you know what youre doing.  In exp groups its a nice buff to have, but doesnt make a huge difference dps wise.</div></div><hr />

Last bst I parsed was doing right around 44 dps for himself, and another 44 for his pet. At that point I was impressed with myself for averaging around 60 dps with my WMBS (mid 50's).  I DON'T THINK he was level 65, but it was a while ago, so I might be wrong. He was certainly not ultra-uber, so I would expect YOUR pet does at least 44dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm the only beastlord in my guild, and i only cast it on the MT if resists are needed.  we are a smallish guild without an active bard.  The problem with ferocity isn't really the mana (tho 600 mana does suck) its the 2 min recast time, and short duration even with SCR3.  I don't have extended enhancement IV item yet, so I can keep it up on at most, 4 ppl if all i'm doing is staring at my spell bar waiting for it to refresh, even then, its fading by the time i recast it on the next person.  I typically only keep it up on 3 people because i also am on slow duty for raids and mana becomes an issue.  My usual choice is Rangers first, then rogues, then monks depending on who we have.  we aren't elemental+ so our rangers benefit more from ferocity than our rogues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and 64th bst pet is about 50-60dps + procs depending on mob lvl/AC and posititioning.  the various focus items changes to DPS is so minimal its within the margin of error for parsing DPS.  15% increase to their melee is like 7.5 DPS boost for 600 mana.  15% increase to a rogues say 150dps is 22.5 dps increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">64 pet non focused should do roughly 70 dps melee, an additional 10 from spirit of rellic proc.  Add any focus items and mage weapons for additional procs will increase this figure.<br />
<br />
BSTs will use scorpion venom, which is another ~ 24 dps on top of their melee.  With battle fists / grandmasters mace and only CF1 / BF5 as my offensive AAs, my lvl 65alt bst sustains 100 dps with the scorp venom dot.  A bst still using WLK / epic offhand should do around 80 dps sustained.  Most BST cast fero on themselves since it's easy to keep a 3-4 fero rotation when you see it fade on yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Derrict, what parsing program do you use?  70 DPS is very high, like maybe if you are parsing on very low green mobs.  My unfocused pet does about 68DPS to the back of the katta banker, but she's lvl 1.  Focus effects have very negligible affect on pet dps, at most ~3-5% DPS increase from unfocused to CCS.  Relic proc DPS is also very dependant on mob levels, 10 DPS is a good figure for lower tier pop but it goes down from there.<br />
<br />
with pet affinity and a bard in your group, i could see 70DPS on a good day, but not on any worthwhile content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use both Yalp and EQC and the parses were on PoN zi trash mobs, pet being behind the mob 99% of the time.<br />

The Katta bankers are green con lvl 1 but they mitigate like normal mobs so don't let their con fool you.</div></div><hr />
