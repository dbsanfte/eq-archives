<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lourdin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any word exactly what the up-and-comming melee changes are?  I have heard a multitude of things, the most disturbing is that they are nerfing our DPS a bit.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have anything that is a bit more tangeble then speculation?<br />

<br />
At this point, anything you hear can only be rumour.  But, given the stale bread crumbs I've seen dropped to date, downgrading melee DPS is the last thing I expect to see.  I would doubt anyone who claims that they have anything more tangible than speculation, other than AbsorEQ (and he's not telling :p).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class Balance<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. Some options being considered are:<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
Shields and blocking<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.[/quote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, they must be so busy on melee balance that they had to cut and paste for a 9th straight month. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Saw this one from Absor on the EQ message board (think it was today's post, but don't remember for certain.)<br />
<br />
We're workin' on it. Best I can say right now is that we may have some detail for you at the end of the month. <br />
<br />
Does it mean anything?  Not sure...and not particularly hopeful given the fact they are working on expansions atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lourdin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great, I can see it now...<br />
<br />
Expansion comes out with a level change!  All classes can reach 70 now.  There are AA's you have to get to fix the balance.  You can only get those AA's if you buy the expansion.  Bah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This quote, We're workin' on it. Best I can say right now is that we may have some detail for you at the end of the month. was from Friday. Pretty much a response to AO's romp in Time Thrusday night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's a response to Blizzard saying that WoW Beta might be up and running by the end of the month.  Don't fuckin kid yourself, these assholes know exactly how to fix it, they're just waiting for their competitor to do something so they can try to steal attention away from it with their &quot;Fancy Melee Rebalancing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Fuck them.  Fuck them in their stupid asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/aggrees with Haass<br />
<br />
They are just dragging this out to fuel our addiction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>carlelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with Hass on this one. Ive been telling people that for awhile now. It is all marketing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">are ya'll keeping up with the &quot;who needs warriors anyway&quot; cronicle's on AO's boards? makes me sick... dropping mobs in time with Vabtoo tanking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well at least the clerics will be happy to know BoV wasn't used.  They seem to care more about not getting that nerfed than getting warriors back to where they should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">10 bucks says Absor has a macro that inserts &quot;We're workin' on it.&quot; into a post with, like, 1 keystroke.</div></div><hr />

I point you to this link http://eqvault.ign.com/articles/440/440374p1.html?fromint=1 <br />
<br />
Maybe we get to hear something promising.....I hope<br />
<br />
<br />
cut and paste for those that hate links<br />

<br />
Lepidus: Warriors are a group that has been very vocal about problems with their class. Are there any plans to give special attention to the needs of this class or any other?<br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering: We will be hosting a chat to discuss the changes we have in mind on November 24th. We will be doing something more than a just simple balancing pass. It's more of a melee combat system change. The goal is to make melee combat more interesting over all, to introduce a little more skill into the way a melee character is played, and to achieve the balance that we are always looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lepidus: EverQuest II is going to release in the new year. There have been some plans for cross over elements between the two titles. How will this affect EQ players who choose not to play EQII? <br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering: Yes, there will be some cross-over between the two games. But I can't give out any details about what they will be at this time. Maybe Moorgard can be convinced to spill the beans... :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Lepidus: Will there be an option added to turn off the jarring effects of melee classes? Many players complain it gives them a headache. <br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering: Do you mean the animations that make a character move when it attacks? If so, then I'd have to say no, we don't have any plans to change the way the current set of PC animations work.</div></div><hr />
