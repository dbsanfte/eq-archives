Okay, a real rant now.<br />
<br />
Why oh why the fuck can't they PROPERLY fix Bristlebane! Every month to three months we get heavy server problems in the evening (est) ending up in massive LDs on zoning and 1017 errors getting back in. This usually cuts the server pop down by half or more (and everyone else pretty much stops moving because they're afraid to zone). and lasts anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple of hours. If we're lucky and it's the shorter bursts, they will just reoccur through the night. This will happen every night for a week to a month... Yes, they've let us play like this for a fucking MONTH when Planetside went live and every night when reported to the chat GM it is always the same answer: Nope, no problems here. It's your ISP or some other shit.<br />
<br />
You know, if not for sheer loyalty, I'd be transferring servers. I really hope I get accepted to WoW beta, I'm getting tired of this shit. At least if WoW beta has bugs, it's to be expected... being a beta and all rather than a paid-for game.<br />

Hmm.. or I could dust off my Black Mage for shits and giggles.</div></div><hr />

The good news? Sony is counting the loot. Wait till their Bean counters can show losses with a &quot;little&quot; fudged mathematics (after EQ2 comes out), so they can combine servers!</div></div><hr />
