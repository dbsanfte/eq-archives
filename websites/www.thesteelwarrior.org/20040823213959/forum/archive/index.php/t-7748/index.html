<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xpir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings from Europa....<br />
<br />
Europa is a European raid oriented guild, currently rated as one of the best guilds on Druzzil Ro.  Our goals are to experience, explore, and conquer high end raid content.  We are mature people that love to raid and thus is our main motivation for playing this game.<br />
<br />
Europa's focus is currently GoD (Uqua and soon Qvic), and we intend to progress in that expansion very quickly.  We however, do still clean PoTime one day a week .  We do not raid the Elemental Planes at all anymore, we are finished with them, and never want to see them again.<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to know about Europa: <br />
<br />
We are currently looking for dedicated, hardcore raiding players who are focused and skilled. There is no drama or whining allowed.  There is simply no room in Europa or on raids for such behavior and it will not be tolerated. You will be removed should you turn out to be that kind of person/player no matter how skilled in your class you may be.<br />
<br />
You must meet or exceed our minimum class level requirements:<br />
Have a computer and connection that are adequate for raiding.<br />
Be level: 65<br />
Have 150+ AA's and Resists that are 170+<br />
<br />
You are expected to keep your raid attendance at 70% or five days per week.  We normally raid six days per week with Wednesday off. Raid times are 7pm to 11pm GMT (or) 2pm to 6pm EST.<br />
<br />
You must have all current expansions enabled.<br />
<br />
Europa's loot distribution is done by the DKP system.  We find it to be fair and it has worked wonderfully for us in the past and present.<br />
<br />
Cross server transfers are very welcome to apply to Europa.  We welcome your application whole heartedly, and urge you to contact a recruitment officer should you meet or exceed the current recruitment guidelines.  If you are a cross server transfer you will skip the first process of applicancy and wear a Europa tag as a trial member when you arrive on Druzzil Ro.  (with prior approval of your application of course)<br />
<br />
A sense of humor is a MUST....raiding is no doubt serious, however we are also here to have fun and relax when the time is right too  ;) <br />
<br />
We are currently recruiting for the following classes:<br />
Warrior: 2<br />
Rogue: 2<br />
Cleric: 2<br />
Wizard: 2<br />
Bard: 1<br />
<br />
The classes listed above are the classes we currently seeking, however, we are never really closed for application of any calss if they are the type of players we want, that means level 65, lots of AA's, good gear, high playtime and willingness to die repeatedly while trying new encounters.<br />
<br />
If you wish to apply, visit our website at http://www.europaguild.net or contact our recruitment officers druzzil.Shaninn and druzzil.Xpir or email to apps@europaguild.net</div></div><hr />
