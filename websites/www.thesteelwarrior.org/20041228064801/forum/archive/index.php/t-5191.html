<br />
Did a quick search but did not find the answer to this question - are there any blue to 59 mobs out there that don't hit back so that i can get my weapon skills up?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

He's on a little island in warsliks woods. You can just hug the coast till you see an iksar kickin it all by himself on a tiny island. You can stand on the coast or even on his island and bow/throw till the cows come home. He's got mega regen and won't attack unless you get in melee range. For archery, just bring your bloody ancille's pouch and a few stacks of reagents. For throwing... get a mage to summon you A LOT OF whatever orrr... there's the dusty soriz worker pouch (http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10563) that summons a 170 range throwing item - it comes from ssra heh. And I just now found a quest that involves some turnins in skyshrine and thurg and MAY net you a bracer of hammerfall (http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4260) that summons throwing hammers. (Personally I'm going to look into doing this one)<br />
<br />
As for working on melee skills... I don't know what to tell you other than, &quot;Hey, do you guys mind if I practice 2hb on your mobs?&quot; It worked when I was lvl 40 in DL, and pretty much guaranteed a spot in their group when someone left lol.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Added some item links.</div></div><hr />

You can skill up on the pet and it won't attack you back.  Even better if you whack it from behind, you won't get riposte (although it's minimal anyway).<br />
<br />
The 61+ pets all work well for it (cept the mage fire pet)</div></div><hr />

Go to your favorite exp zone, and ask a group if you can practice on their mobs.  Skillups for you, extra dps for them, win-win.</div></div><hr />
