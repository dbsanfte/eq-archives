<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there. I usually 2 box with my Cleric and I was wondering.. I have a Split Blade of Destruction in Pri and horn of hsagra in offhand. I also have a GSoT. What do you think would be better as far as exping with.. I would think the dual weild combp but looking for some imputs from you all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the DW combo doesnt have procs so all it has going for it is DPS.  The GSoT has a decent ratio and a proc that makes mobs not like you so it has 2 things going for it.<br />
<br />
I would parse it and see how the DPS compares.  If the DW combo is miles ahead in DPS then maybe use that, but if the GSoT is anywhere near it then I'd go GSoT for less ripostes and a proc with agro.</div></div><hr />
