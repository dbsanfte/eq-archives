They fixed Task force missions completely. The levels of these missions are now set. The first TF (Positron) is a 15th level mission -- you can attempt it at 10th level, but the enemies will be 15.<br />
<br />
They made purple mobs (your level +4) much, much more difficult. From what I'm reading on the forums, going after purples is suicide, even in a full group. Be warned.<br />
<br />
The next patch is likely to nerf Caltrops and Burn. The CoH devs seem to want to balance nerfs by pumping up other powers in the nerfed powerset, so expect(?) Devices and Fire Melee to get some boosts at the same time.<br />
<br />
I got my comic book the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While in a group of level 22-23s today we decided to take on some level 28s.  We couldn't hardly do any damage to them.  Nothing was sticking.  I couldn't even get taunt and provoke to land while chaining them.  However, level 25 and 26s were no problem and level 27s where only a slight problem.  Be aware, be very aware, 5 levels or more now basically means you're going to be ineffective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">small bit of suckage to door missions......end of missions usually involve a red con or purple con boss ( lieut's are +2 to level i think, boss +4 )..be very very careful..<br />
<br />
+3 i think is a bit too narrow that they made...i'd be happy with a +5 range of effectiveness overall or a slight retune of door missions ( drastic measure )<br />
it'd be easier to implement a +5 IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Remember when EQ had a range where you couldn't possibly land spells a certain point above you? That was silly. This... is silly.</div></div><hr />

They're tweaking the system (http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showflat.php?Cat=&amp;Board=general&amp;Number=599527&amp;page=0&amp;view=collapsed&amp;sb=5&amp;o=&amp;fpart=1) soon ...<br />
<br />
So we did a lot of data mining and statistic gathering, and we decided that the drop off of difficulty for villains is indeed too steep, but only slightly. The main thing we want to avoid is making it too difficult to find teammates. The way it is now, teammates 2 levels below you may face a disadvantage. It is hard to build a team of diverse levels. A team spanning 5 levels should be well within reason, but at the same time you should not be able to take out villains 10 levels above you (or 10 levels above your lowest level teammate). So, to make teams spanning up to 5 levels viable, each player needs to be effective (albeit minimally) against someone 7 levels above him (if you are 5 levels below the highest member of the team, you may get a mission with villains 2 levels above your highest level teammate).<br />
<br />
So we are loosening up the range of villains you can be effective against. Coming soon, these will be the new changes to villain difficulties (note the changes after +4 levels):<br />
<br />
Foes your level have not changed. You have a 75% chance to hit and your powers are 100% effective.<br />
Foes 1 level above you - No Change. You have a 68% chance to hit and your powers are 90% effective.<br />
Foes 2 levels above you - No Change. You have a 61% chance to hit and your powers are 80% effective.<br />
Foes 3 levels above you - You have a 55% chance to hit and your powers are 65% effective.<br />
Foes 4 levels above you - You have a 48% chance to hit and your powers are 48% effective.<br />
Foes 5 levels above you - You have a 41% chance to hit and your powers are 30% effective.<br />
Foes 6 levels above you - You have a 34% chance to hit and your powers are 15% effective.<br />
Foes 7 levels above you - You have a 25% chance to hit and your powers are 8% effective.<br />
Foes 8 levels above you - You have an 11% chance to hit and your powers are 5% effective.<br />
Foes 9 levels above you - You have a 6% chance to hit and your powers are 4% effective.<br />
Foes 10 levels above you - You have a 5% chance to hit and your powers are 3% effective.<br />
Foes 11 levels above you - You have a 5% chance to hit and your powers are 2% effective.<br />
Foes 12+ levels above you - You have a 5% chance to hit and your powers are 1% effective.<br />
<br />
So this really opens things up a lot more than the way it currently is, though it’s still much tighter than it was last week. This should make teams with a 5 level span very reasonable, but villains 8+ levels higher than you really drop off, and it simply won’t be safe to take on anything higher level than that.<br />
<br />
Other things to remember:<br />
There IS currently an XP bonus for teaming up. I noticed a lot of players asking for this, but it already exists, and the larger the team, the bigger the bonus.<br />
Don’t forget side-kicking. You can sidekick a player who is 3 levels below you. All sidekicks fight one level below the mentor.<br />
This is still an online game. The balance can and will ebb and flow until a solid equilibrium is reached. The most effective thing you can do is play now and play when this change is available. That way we can gather the data and see what works best.<br />
There are some missions that are spawning villains too high for the mission owner. This is more of a concern now, so we are focusing on correcting these issues ASAP.<br />
This will go onto the TEST server first, so additional input from all of you will always be helpful.<br />
<br />
<br />
For Reference, here are the current numbers (as of 6/4):<br />
<br />
    Foes your level have not changed. You have a 75% chance to hit and your powers are 100% effective.<br />
    Foes 1 level above you - No Change. You have a 68% chance to hit and your powers are 90% effective.<br />
    Foes 2 levels above you - You have a 60% chance to hit and your powers are 80% effective.<br />
    Foes 3 levels above you - You have a 49% chance to hit and your powers are 65% effective.<br />
    Foes 4 levels above you - You have a 25% chance to hit and your powers are 32% effective.<br />
    Foes 5 levels above you - You have a 8% chance to hit and your powers are 11% effective.<br />
    Foes 6 levels above you - You have a 8% chance to hit and your powers are 3% effective.<br />
    Foes 7 levels above you - You have a 8% chance to hit and your powers are 2% effective.<br />
    Foes 8+ levels above you - You have a 8% chance to hit and your powers are 1% effective.<br />
<br />
This looks good to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well it certainly sounds like they've done their homework and know what they're trying to accomplish, and aren't shy about sharing it with the community.  I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah it does....this is an odd feeling; being listed to by the developers a bit and having them cater to the players and the best interests of the game :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's only bosses that worry me, personally. I didn't exactly go hunting for purples or reds before, but some missions might really suck if the levels aren't so happy.</div></div><hr />

/agree ... I solo a lot, or duo with my g/f, and a well nigh unhittable boss at the end of a mission would have been awful for us.  This still keeps it tuff without being impossible (or at the very high end of improbable!).</div></div><hr />
