<br />
Quests from city to city to talk to GreatFather Winter, actual tradeskill recipies for Gingerbread Cookies and Eggnog, and a massive fucking snowball fight going on in Ogrimmar.<br />
<br />
If you don't own this game, you're depriving yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, totally.<br />
<br />
In the one hour I had today to play (family, work, and the holidays &gt; games), I was able to get together with just two other guildies and do a special holiday quest that gave me a pretty fair chunk of xp just for doing some running around and killing a mob that took 3 of us to kill.<br />
<br />
Btw if you are grouped with a person who throws a snowball at you, you get knocked down and stunned for like .25 a second.  It's absolutely hilarious.  I could have spent an hour doing just that.  Haven't figured out what the mistletoe does yet, if anything :)</div></div><hr />

I was giggling like a 12 year old all night.  Snowballs are the coolest!  Although, a few horde came to Goldshire to engage in a snowball fight before I knew what they were - so I thought they were casting spells on me that were reflecting b/c I wasn't enabled. So I killed them.  And now I feel bad.</div></div><hr />

Haha, that's awesome Vig, and I've been meaning to say I dig your sig.</div></div><hr />

Fun for everyone!</div></div><hr />

Hehe, only in a mmorpg would a holiday outing involve killing stuff :).<br />

Hehe, sounds like that guy in Philly last winter that got hit by a stray snowball and started shooting :p.</div></div><hr />

Well, the title of the quest was &quot;Your a mean one...&quot; and the only mob we had to kill was the Abominable Greeench, who had stole some of Santa's (or Great Father Winter's) treats.  So he had it comin' imo.   :p <br />
<br />
The funniest thing about this entire quest is actually the little goblin quest giver's text when you complete the quest:<br />
<br />
We at Smokywood Pastures appreciate the recovery of the stolen treats, Devon. For that, we'd like to offer you a special gift... presented by none other than Greatfather Winter himself!<br />
<br />
Please, speak with Greatfather Winter, and he will give you your Feast of Winter Veil gift from us here at Smokywood Pastures. From our farm to your plate, it's always Smokywood Pastures wholesome goodness... thanks to you, of course!<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't you just HEAR the over-commercialized radio guy christmas voice? Too awesome. <br />
<br />
<br />

In my defense, they did shoot back =(  But in retrospect it was a bit hum-buggy of me.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, I spent so much time trying to figure out which character I liked, that I'm too low level to to the Greench quest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The snowballs rock!  For a lil while there they would PvP enable you if you tossed one at an opposing faction toon who was pvp enabled.  Dunno if thats still the case or not.<br />
<br />
That feature made for an interesting way to goad an alliance rogue who was at the same camp as my group in Arathi killing fire elementals I needed for the Cyclonian quest.  After about 20min of racing to kill pops as they spawned, our shaman went PvP and chuked a snowball at the alliance rogue who responded in kind, got his PvP flag turned on for doing so, and then got smooshed.<br />
<br />
I got my drops while he was running back to his corpse =)<br />
<br />
I like WoW's implementation on competition for resources.</div></div><hr />
