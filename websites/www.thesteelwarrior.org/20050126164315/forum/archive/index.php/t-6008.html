 ....and I'm curious. I know Wavecrasher used to be a pretty good aggro weapon back in the day, and it's since fallen out of favor. I also know that the ratio is worse than a GSoT. However, what do you more experienced Warriors think of the proc as an aggro getter.<br />
<br />
 (Yes, this is all theoretical, unless it's better aggro than a GSoT.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">slow is a very strong aggro tool, but the effective dps is giong to be much lower than the GSoT, and if this weapon is anything like a willsapper, very stingy with the procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
assuming it procs, i'd imagine you'd be set, but in case it doesnt, i wouldnt count on maintaining aggro throughtout the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The slow it procs is only about 10-15% (I have the 1hp from NToV that procs it), and the proc rate was pretty bad.  I rarely use it at all now and then only if I am low on mana for lifetaps to try to help keep dmg down a bit when soloing.  If you got a GSoT I would suggest using it instaed of trying to get this.  You mihgt also look for Treunchon of Doom.  That is a war only 2hb that procs slo and I have been in groups w/ a war using it til it proced, then swaping back out to normal weapons, as the only slow we had.  <br />
I never noticed a big difference in agro gaining w/ it though, and I could be wrong of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meh, ok. Was just wondering, we had it drop and I was the only plate tank who was there, so it kinda defaulted to me, and since I never owned Wavecrasher, I didn't have much of an idea on the strength of the proc for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and the proc rate was pretty bad <br />
<br />
Proc rate is determined by weapon, not proc (proof is Bloodfrenzy compared to any other EB weapon).  Also, the proc of the NToV piercer is Wave of the Deep Sea, while this is Breath of the Sea.  As for the proc rate of the NToV piercer, it has a normal proc rate.<br />
<br />
if this weapon is anything like a willsapper, very stingy with the procs <br />
<br />
Willsapper has a normal proc rate.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the proc is decent aggro, similar to GSoT.  The ratio of the GSoT makes it win in the end.</div></div><hr />

After all, I own a GSoT, and it never seems to proc enough, which is why I DW most times. May give this a shot once in a while just to check it out.</div></div><hr />

The data field that sets proc rate is now know and info available from lucy.  For more info see this thread!<br />

It makes no sense, but that's the way it was, just the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i used to have a wavecrasher and the proc rate seemed about normal. the proc is decent aggro but bear in mind once slow lands, the slow part of the proc wont land anymore so the hate you get diminishes a little. if im not mistaken the slow is about 20pct.<br />
<br />
have fun with it, maybe keep it for soloing and stuff like that..</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe i'm just really unlucky, but it goes off on average .5 times per minute 95% of fights ... and around 3 or 4 times per minute the other 5%.</div></div><hr />

Don't take this the wrong way but, go parse it and post a log or no one will believe you.  They won't believe you because what you are posting is not true, which is the best reason not to believe something.<br />
<br />
You are not unlucky.  You are just wrong.</div></div><hr />

Tested it out a few times, but it's just banked right now.  I couldn't think of any time I'd use it.  Less aggro than a GSoT, and doesn't slow as much as a ToD.</div></div><hr />
