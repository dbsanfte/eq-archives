<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see alot of warriors with the following setup:<br />
<br />
DBoTW (Anger3)<br />
Edge of Eternity (Anger3)<br />
<br />
Does the agro generated from that setup actually get &quot;used up&quot; in raids? Or do you guys feel that it might be a bit excessive?<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to figure out if the following setup might be a better selection of dps/agro:<br />
<br />
DBoTW (Anger3)<br />
Edge of Eternity (125dd Ykesha)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think it's a bit much, I have a darkblade with ykesha aug, and a mace of the ancients with no aug, WA2 and I feel like it's solid, but anymore WA or an offhand like an eoe, would make it unusable when you're not wanting to get aggro.  <br />
<br />
I will finish WA, but will probably go straight DD in my offhand because the darkblade is already enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a bloodfrenzy and BoC with Anger III, which is much lower dps but higher proc rate than Darkblade/EoE and with WA4 it did get to the point where I occaisionally thought &quot;this is getting a little bit silly&quot;.  The other night using Anger III and Blade of War in a hard LDoN a druid actively tried to pull aggro off of me and couldn't do it.  He was chain nuking, casting flame lick and snare, and in three fights he only managed to get hit once and was totally OOM afterwards.  Now that might not be as much aggro as a wizard chaining SoS or a necro stacking dots, but if a druid is actually unable to pull aggro when they are trying to, I have to think that that's enough aggro hehe.  <br />
<br />
Darkblade with no offhander should be equal or better than a blade of war for aggro, so 125 Ykesha in your EoE sounds like a good idea to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I like having the option of going into &quot;over the top&quot;-mode ;)<br />
<br />
Especially on mobs that proc de-agro stuff, or otherwise interfere with agro generation(stuns etc).<br />
<br />
Generally the agro is managable. And it doesnt bother me to take a round of damage here and there, because we are geared to handle that after all, and its easy to shed agro by simply backing up a bit.<br />
<br />
The only time when agro have annoyed me is when the main assist wants to play &quot;turtle-mode&quot; and uses a darkblade+shield. <br />
<br />
Then its almost impossible to not steal agro consistantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got Darkblade last Time clear, but still need to aug it (I hate having to do Guk to aug Time weaps). While combined with EoE it is certainly better aggro than my old anger-auged Sews, I still get mobs running off at rare times either on inc or if I am stunned for some time or get a FD proccing mob etc. <br />
<br />
I just feel adding some anger augs would vastly increase the chance of getting solid procs early. Holding aggro rarely seems a problem, but it s those first few rounds I'd like the extra procs for. <br />
Also, I've still seen wizards getting summoned by mobs our top warrior tanks (DBotWL, EoE, 2 anger augs, WA5, Raex bp, Saryrn range), so I doubt you can ever have too much aggro MT-ing.<br />
<br />
If you're ganking aggro a lotwhen not tanking, don't think it could hurt to pick up a VDD or ED; sure it's a bit less dps, but that's not really our job anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes I feel all that aggro is needed just to make sure other Warriors don't get aggro.<br />
<br />
It's rarely necessary to have that much aggro.  Certainly if the mob has no anti-aggro ability then DBoW + EoE double augmented with Anger 3 is over the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danathor</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's excessive, every bit of agro gets used on raids.  The more agro you can generate the more the dps classes can unload without fear.  It's our job to lock the mob down, not add a little more dps with a proc that can be resisted.  Especially now with GoD attempting to move away from the CH rotation routine and make fast cast, higher agro heals more common.<br />
<br />
Sure you may not lose agro with a less agro set-up, but the question then would be can your dps classes unload any harder? If it's possible that they can then why not maximize your agro generation and increase your guild's overall DPS.<br />
<br />
Only negative aspect of getting as much agro as possible would be having to spend some dkp on non-tanking weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how having that much hate increase can be 'excessive' and unused, other than a small loss of dps from a DD proc.  Having a few extra augs in addition to the natural weapon proc plus any imbued proc increases your chances of firing a proc early in the fight, which indirectly increases your group/raid dps since it'll reduce the amount of ping pong.  Chasing after the mob = lower dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went the DBoTW with anger 3, and an EOE with force of yak to give a minimal dps improvement and to not have too extreme of aggro.  With WA5 i have no probs holding aggro from the other warriors, some have WA5 and DBoTW and EOE with anger 3 on both.  <br />
<br />
However i think its very smart to have a 3rd solid weapon you can use when you arent tanking so you can control your aggro.  Ive got a hammer of crushing waves and a cudgel of wrecking for that depending on the situation, gives solid dps and small death potential so you dont overaggro the current tank.  Makes everyone happy ;p<br />
<br />
If you anger 3 your EoE and DBotW, and have that 3rd weap with like a DD aug or something thats not a hate proc, you can offhand your EoE, use the 3rd weap in main, and still get enough anger procs to keep you decently high on the aggro list, but not high enough to steal it.  Anyways enough rambling...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agro over time has never really been a problem. Once you get pretty solid agro, it's not all that hard to keep it, even with DPS classes going to town. Where I think having 2x A3 is important is early in the fight when agro has not been established. The sooner you can get a few procs in, the sooner the raid can unload. Of course, the shorter the fight, the better the chance for success. I also think this is pretty hand because my wizard hardly ever gets summoned at 9% when a mob enrages. That is a common problem when you are riding the line of agro and pumping out over 300 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And dont forget the extra procs you can bring on each weapon using the gloves of aten or the orb out of VT or the Symbol of the planemaster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo....it's all about getting that early proc or 2 to make sure the healers/debuffers don't go splat.  Since we don't have &quot;aggro on demand&quot; aka-spells, we need a RNG stacked in our favor.  I have a little trick I use when not tanking to help reduce my chances of turning a mob.  I swap my BF to offhand and put an OSoW(unaugged) in main.  It keeps my HP's high but provides alot less aggro.  If shit hits the fan I can just flip flop the 2 weapons and have good tankability without having to rummage through bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anymore, its all about having enough to keep aggro off the other tanks, and even with WA5 its a losing battle lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO you can never have too much taunt, if your tanking all the agro you can generate is a plus.<br />
<br />
Get taunt up the wazoo if you can, but always have other combo's for different situations, i always carry BoW and SEWS and switch them in depending on the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got EoE tonight and put 125 yak on it.<br />
I hope for a dbotw very soon and also have a BF with anger3.<br />
<br />
I think of 3 situations:<br />
<br />
1. Expgroup / duo with my cler bot.<br />
2. Raid as MT / MA<br />
3. Raid as non MA MT addtank<br />
<br />
In situation #1 i would use max dps and just as much agro as needed -&gt; DBotW + A3 and EoE + Yak. Depending on the ppl i group with and the zone (ikkinz with necro in a dot frenzy, very fast debuffing, etc) I would offhand the BF + A3.<br />
<br />
In situation #2 i want MAX possible agro for 2 reasons: 1. As MA to get agro off a random debuffer after a taunt fail and on bossmobs with various debuffs. Agro over time or agro versus &quot;usual&quot; bossmobs was never really a problem for me with BoW + A2 + WA5.<br />
<br />
In situation #3 i want max possible DPS and lowest agro. Atm i use EoE + yak in main and an unauged bonechiller in offhand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imho you have to see the different situations and choose your weapon setup accordingly. If you put yak on the EoE you can use it both for non agro dps and also for expgroup-like dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  That being said, The sooner you can get a few procs in, the sooner the raid can unload.  is definitely the winner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brackon</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By this time the other warriors in your guild should have better non-aggro DPS setups than to use a DB while not MT. <br />
<br />
 The beat stick from Ikknz, with hammer of Time.. aug it with the 150 poison dd augment and ykesha. Great DPS setup, very little aggro generation. You could probably use a MT who had a BoC with anger III and still not pull it off.<br />
<br />
 Some people just do not like to switch out their weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the very top of the game, warriors should always be tanking.  As someone mentioned earlier, Uqua is a prime example.  It is absolutely critical to have hard agro here.  And if a tank goes down you need to be next in line.  <br />
<br />
Even on bosses it isn't all that bad to be stealing agro if your healing setup allows for it.  I would not want to see any warrior/knight in my guild put on low agro weapons.<br />
<br />
But then I really haven't seen any problems with agro stealing yet.  It happens but it just hasn't been a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all about the initial aggro at the top of a fight.  The more chances you have to proc, the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brackon</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I should redefine a tad.. your right Brodda, if your guild is setup to heal for it.  Typically what happens with us is if your a warrior, and happen to grab aggro off the MT, you die..heh.<br />
<br />
 So it is better to stay alive with low aggro weapons, relying on aggro generation from procs and DPS, then if you have to go in..swap out weps, hit Bellow/AE Taunt/Taunt and go from there.<br />
<br />
 It really depends on how well your clerics/support healers can adapt to it as to how you approach it though.</div></div><hr />

  Just curious, but why don't you get a 125 DD/stun Ykesha  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4358&amp;source=Live) augment? Increases aggro considerably with barely less damage. If you're already pulling aggro with what you have, you might as well maximize your aggro with that setup, and get a non-aggro setup for when you're not tanking.</div></div><hr />

I have a DoD I swap in when I'm having one of those nights were I just cannot stop stealing aggro. Honestly. the stun effect for aggro from the ykesha proc isnt even worth the adventure points. I seriously have n problems getting/holding aggro at this point in the game to warrent getting the ykesha proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uqua losing aggro is usually due to an untanked mob ganking someone and then low HP.

Sure, some mobs are push overs and IF you get a series of procs from the DBotW you pretty much own the mob. If you don't get the procs you have a chance at losing agro and for what? Some more DD procs? Please, if this is the case delete and start a DPS class.<br />
<br />
Take Vallon Zek in time, where a proc stuns you and causes you to be knocked down. Most the fight you will be stunned, what keeps Vallon on you is your limited window of attacks to try to land some more procs in. Other mobs, can feign you and that will take most of your agro away. Some mobs constantly blur themselves and its also here where the extra agro procs shine. <br />

I was loving WA 5 and all the procs right about then.<br />
<br />
It's really really common for me to do normal LDoNs with no CC, in which case I'm often splitting my attention between a few mobs. Generating enough agro to keep 3 mobs on you is kinda fun. Even in EP's, if we have a bad add, I can yank it off someone and get it locked on me, then move back to the other mob -- which will have been hitting me the whole time.<br />
<br />
Basically no way can you ever have too much agro. I have seperate weapons for when I'm not tanking, or hell I can just leave attack off, my 150 dps is not make or break, I'm there to tank after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When i need aggro i use anger augmented DBOTW an anger augmented BF, and i have a ykesha EoE i can switch for dps once the aggro is well locked, or if i don't need that much aggro.<br />
<br />
IMO BF with Anger aug &gt; EoE with anger aug to tank, thanks to the enraging proc as proc #1 and the 15% riposte mod.<br />
<br />
You do loose dps, but it compensate greatly.<br />
<br />
As someone sumed it up very well:<br />
<br />
The sooner you can get a few procs in, the better... Survival is all about how fast you can lock aggro, especially in high-end zones Uqua golem TM.ing comes as a good example...<br />
<br />
I really found BF to be better than EoE as a secondary weapon for tanking, and use it often more... Am i right to do so? You guys have much more experience than i do at playing war, so you know better, it is just a feeling i got after playing war.<br />
<br />
And beeing a cleric i know how critical early aggro is, i died enough time because of that hehe.<br />

Taunt is &lt; procs on Vallon unless you're losing aggro, in which case you're already screwed.<br />

You can never have too much aggro.  That extra 1.2 DPS from a ykesha augment won't save your group from a smack down; that extra Anger proc might.</div></div><hr />

BF anger three , WA 5 , = (3x 700 hate )x 150 %<br />
                                        + (2x 600 hate )x150 %<br />
                        thats 4950 hate generated per minute <br />
thats nice for the primary . but add the offhand :-<br />
<br />
even an unaugmented BoC for another 700 (plus 50 % ) = <br />
 1150 hate , and thats a whopping 6100 hate per minute - nice !<br />

This the outhouse? After 5 years playing a warrior, I have been able to successfully do my duties as a Warrior, and still reach towords the damage level of a DPS class. Think outside the box before you try to send a veteran off to reroll buddy.  I think you need to look and see what kind of DPS a DPS class can pump out with the proper tankage. I don't care what you are weilding, you are not reaching anywhere near the damage level of a DPS class.  Aspit pretty much nailed it. The more agro you have, the sooner your DPS people can open up, the faster the fight can end. To put it in to perspective, with a time equiped duel weilding warrior, a DPS class can start unloading with the mob at 99% and maintain 400+ DPS for the duration of the fight. If you don't have some serious agro, this ain't gonna happen without some wiz/rogue splatter.</div></div><hr />

Bingo - Time equipped rogues (JTB / Quarmer) are going to do about 100-120 more dps than a Time equipped warrior (DBotW / EoE/ Raex BP).  When you're able to put out that much hate off the start, rogues / wizards and other high dps classes can go all out at the start and generally not worry about stealing aggro unless it's a mob that stuns / fd your MT.  Sacrifice your own dps, which is a minimal amount, and increase your guild/group dps by a much larger margin.</div></div><hr />

If you're using a shield at all that says you really didn't need all that aggro to begin with.  So the argument 'other people get more DPS' is false.  If it was true, you wouldn't be using a shield, and no matter how much aggro DBoW is, DBoW + shield can't be the best aggro combination out there.</div></div><hr />

DBotW + shield + incite + Raex bp at the start of the fight might be sufficient aggro to allow full dps at 99% but would if you were the guild MT, would you risk losing aggro at the start?  I doubt it, that's why the switch is made later in the fight if it's needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the difference between Anger III and 125 Ykesha is going to be minimal.  I seriously doubt there will ever be a time where you could prove that something bad happened because someone had Ykesha instead of Anger III in their offhander.  So yea, you want to maximize aggro, but for the situation of the original poster, I don't think putting a Ykesha aug in your offhander when you have a Darkblade with anger III mainhand is such a bad idea.  The difference in dps will be very minor, but so will the difference in aggro.  I'd say in this case do whatever makes you feel good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I had wondered about this too.  The old Bloodfrenzy seems like a very viable offhander to me.  The enhanced proc rate EB weapon seems like it would beat the EoE proc for aggro and your offhand dps isn't that significant.  On top of that, the BF has 5 more AC, which is arguably better than the 40 extra hps on the EoE anyhow.<br />
<br />
If you have a Bloodfrenzy with anger III it would be hard to justify spending DKP and LDoN points on a EoE for pure aggro reasons.  The added DPS in exp groups and such would be something to consider, but you may be better off buying a Vanazir for that purpose instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its decent but of course nothing like Anger III. The worst part of the proc is that it gets resisted alot.<br />
<br />
I wonder if resisted ykesha procs have any agro at all.<br />
<br />
No, I haven't done any closed laboratory aggro tests with it.<br />
<br />
For LDON grinding, I've found that the EoE/Dagger of Destruction combo to be exceedingly good dps. (The dagger was rotting so I picked it up for just this reason).<br />
<br />
Turns out I proc so infrequently on the offhand compared to the mainhand that the neg agro proc on the DoD has never &quot;snapped agro back&quot; to a debuffer or dps class yet. In fact, once malo'd the 21/20 versus 15/20 (BoC) difference in DPS probably helps mitigate the loss of 1 enraging blow per minute.<br />
<br />
I use EoE/DoD exclusively for xp now and clock in about 180dps (higher when the target is malo'd consistently).<br />
<br />
I still intend on getting a darkblade at some point of course.<br />
<br />
Caveat: EoE/DoD while being nice dps can't compete with the aggro put out by the rangers in my guild with the darkglint blades or the jagged onyx staves. Aggro is literally always being lost to those guys unless I use the Blade of War, and even then they need to use jolt. The JOS is (from experience on the wrong end)  sick aggro due to the combination of a ridiculous damage rate combined with a debuff proc.</div></div><hr />

Nobody loses aggro to the clerics with a Darkblade and anything in the offhand unless it's in the first few seconds of the fight or there is some wicked deaggro effect.  The people that are gonna die with slightly less aggro are your wizards/necros/shamans.  Personally given the choice of a MT or a wizard getting squashed I'll take the wizard, but I don't remember the last time I lost aggro to a CH chain unless I screwed up somehow.</div></div><hr />

Warriors arn't a DPS class.  Regardless, if your Anger 3 lets your wizard get just ONE more nuke off, thats the equivilant of nearly half an hour's worth of damage from a DPS augment proc.</div></div><hr />

I think that, compounded with the my experience with resisted Ykesha procs pretty much seals the deal for me.<br />
<br />
If your primary scenario is raiding then don't even think twice about augmenting with Anger III.<br />
<br />
If your primary scenario is casual xp content mix up your augmenting with a Ykesha for a slight dps gain for very slightly less aggro given a debuffed mob.</div></div><hr />

The slight aggro you lose going from eb/anger 3 to furious bash 7 is fairly minimal, and more than worth giving up for the added mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also if you have 10k+ hate over someone, they will not low hp frenzy aggro.  <br />
<br />
Aggro list has no affect on low hp aggro, if you one of the 40 on a mobs hate list and you drop under 30ish% you will pull aggro regardless of where on the list you are.<br />
<br />
Ykesha resists generate identical aggro to ykesha full its, and partials.  In fact all spells generate identical aggro full/partial/resist.<br />
<br />
Why do you use a sheild? because clerics can still fuck up, they may fizzle twice in a row, you may get a bad round of silence, rz may get off 2 heavy nondisc rounds between cheals landing, adds may aggro rotation.  Using a shield is simply for 1 reason, damage prevention.  For example dual wield is fine during disc, in fact shield is pretty useless since there is no way you are going to die with disc up in time, unless you have half the rot miss a cheal in one round.  However, once disc drops tz/vz still have the ability to fuck you up,  so does rallos.  The rest of the mobs are pretty much gimp nondisc at this point, but still worth flipping in a shield for the added 100 ac + 50-100ish hps and shielding.  If you dont think 100 ac makes that much of a difference, you are sadly mistaken.</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine using a FB7 shield to be as good as using a second weapon, otherwise you'd just start with DBoW + shield.<br />
<br />
Low HP aggro is actually just very high amount of aggro tacked on to your current hate.  VZ in Time is a good place to verify this, since the ups and downs on hate are so huge (+60% aggro due to his AE but FD to wipe it), it's quite easy to get enough hate so that even low HP aggro is ignored.</div></div><hr />

I doubt I'll ever pick up a shield unless it's rotting and/or free.<br />

Furious Bash only adds extra hate to the bash; nothing else.  It's like a 100% proc rate on Bash, but a missed bash is 0 hate, even with FB, afaik.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect.  I can aggro a mob, get bellow 20% hp, and nuke it with my wizard while I kite on my warrior.  Assuming 1 point of pre-focused non-crit damage = 1 point of hate, low hp frenzy aggro merely adds about 10k hate to the hate lists of everything mad at you, and removes it when healed.<br />
<br />
I also did some tests with my shield of strife to see the effectiveness of furious bash 7.  I am convinced the hate generated from FB is nearly non-existant.  Certainly nowhere near an EoE with Anger 3.  Thats why going as high aggro as you can is actually better defensively, because after 3 minutes of aggro build up, you can enjoy the benefits of a shield and still have your DPS love you.  You're safe enough while defensive without it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talking about shields, i can share my own experience, since the warrior i am using has the RZ shield...<br />
<br />
Let me just say i love shields! Although i had to raise his bash level ;-), as i usually also play the cleric, i see quite some difference when i put the shield on.<br />
<br />
My usual strat, i will take Ikkinz1 DD tanking for this example, it is a fine example on a somewhat hard hitting mob on which you need swift aggro.<br />
<br />
I pull with Mastruq, then put up Fortitude with DBotW / BF up, and hope to get procs during the 12seconds it lasts. It gives the time to get a few procs, and i can snag a MoR on it thx Ultor legs, and to start casting CH for the first heal...<br />
<br />
Just when the disc is about to go off, if i got a proc or two, i put up the Shield and hit stonewall, and proceed the regular tanking, first healing with DVA, then spam Lights.<br />
<br />
I keep AE Taunt in case aggro fails, and can snag another mastruq or two...<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the thread, imo put a Ykesha aug on EoE, since it is a great weapon for DPS or one group xp environment, in which it is enough aggro already, and for your aggro setup use your good old BF and twist with a shield offhand once the aggro is set up.<br />
<br />
Once again, it is not as much as the more aggro you get the better as the quicker aggro you get the better, then once you locked initially well the aggro, Furious Bash and auged DBotW can do the job jsut fine; if it is not a blurring/fd kind of mob that is</div></div><hr />

I dont see why you would have too much aggro, there is no &quot;too much aggro&quot;. You want to make sure whatever happens you have enough aggro to keep the mob facing you. So the more (hate) procs you have the better it is. Not putting an anger3 or a stun in your weapon is like having Aten's gloves or SotPM and not getting the proc buff up (if you dont run out of buff room of course :) ).<br />
So yeah your job is to keep aggro, not like a little dd is gonna make a tremendous dmg differance, the mob is facing you, so you get dodged, riposted, parried, etc... anyways.</div></div><hr />

I have used a shield while tanking RZ in Time.  Started with DBotW and BF, and switched in Aegis of Earth after the first minute or so.  Never lost aggro, and I lasted well past the end of my defensive disc.  Finally died with RZ at 10%, which is a lot better than I've ever done on him before.

 If your tank lived to the end and held aggro then you're doing it right hehe.  The shield is gaining you a tiny bit of survivability at the cost of a a small amount of dps and a significant amount of aggro.  If you are comfortable with your aggro though, then I don't see any reason to change what you're doing if it works.</div></div><hr />
