<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sodami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Two questions: Would this be preferable to a Cloak of Flames for haste, and does anyone have a link to the different race graphics for custom cowls? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMO its an overprice item.  Same haste as CoF, but more HP stats (only +8 stam diff).  Is it worth it?  Depends on how much cash you got.<br />
<br />
I personally use a soulscream belt (31%) + Kizraks's Gaunts' Mirac Visions (30%) and whatever shammy or ench haste is avail.  By going with the soulscream belt and selling my CoF (only 5% diff), I can pick up other good items like Cloak of Greater Pernicity and the Kizrack Helm.<br />
<br />
The Kizrack's Helm is ac 34, stam 8, hp 60, ultra vision, see invis<br />
The Cowl of Mortality is ac 16, sta 9, agi 12, hp 50<br />
<br />
Do the math</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">correct me if im wrong but with vallon at 68 percent haste there is an effective cap of 32 on worn haste any time you are lucky enough to get this buff for a total of 100 percent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends what gear level you're at.  I wore one for a long time before Kizrak's came to be, because the best option for a helm that was obtainable for me at the time was a Champ's Crown, because there was literally no way to obtain a Zek helm on CT if you weren't actively killing AoW.<br />
<br />
I consider the Kizrak's helm to be such a godsend for nite blind races tho, that as soon as I could grab an Ornate helm, I did, switched to CoF and never looked back.<br />
<br />
You could definitely make a case for using one if you had a Loyalist shield tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The graphic on the Custom Cowl of Mortality is the plate helm for your gender and race.  The Cowl (not custom) has the chain helm graphic.  If you don't dye it, it's black.<br />
<br />
My warrior wears a CCoM because she has high hp items in the back and waist slots (if you can afford a CCoM, you're definitely wearing at least 80hp in your back and waist slots - Crinose Cape and Rubi belt or better) and it's harder to find a high hp item in the head slot.  But then, she's a dark elf with natural utravision, so I didn't see Kizraks as quite so important.<br />
<br />
If you need the nightvision, Kizraks and COF is probably the better choice.</div></div><hr />
