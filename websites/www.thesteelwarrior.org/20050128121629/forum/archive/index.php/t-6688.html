<br />
I have seen lots of threads on how to make money in this game. These range from farming areas for specific small price items in large quantities, to camping big gribblies for that occaisional 40k drop that you can sell off. I, however, have a slightly different take on it.<br />
<br />
Now, this requires that you be a trader, I don't mean a standing there selling stuff trader, but more someone that can understand the push and shove of basic economics. It usually helps if you have a 2nd account, that way you can play and keep watching the bazaar.<br />
<br />
This also requires a lot of effort and time, this isn't a solution for the faint of heart. No slaying involved, hell you need a L1 toon to do it, but you also need a brain. :)<br />
<br />
Ok, enough of the waxing lyrical.<br />
<br />
1. Tradeskill. I learnt fletching (I made Nightmare Bows (sell about 2k))<br />
2. Sell some, trade the rest.<br />
    a. Trades - Ok, guy selling an SCHW for 1.25k (sells better than NMB), offer him an NMB for it. He makes 750pp, you have SCHW worth 1.25k<br />
    b. Sell some, make some money on it. But not as much as repeat trades.<br />
3. Back to 2, rinse and repeat. You will make money, you just have to be smart.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to give all my secrets away, but it is easy to make money. Its the principal of trade. You make money and he makes money. Hell, I even wrote some software to handle price watching for me.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done it with my Druid he is a GM Tailor, Baker, Potter, Brewer I make things as I get parts and keep a small steady stream of cash comming in. Has equiped himself my tank and 2 of my wife's toons. Also has equiped alts in decent gear but nothing like what I have or my druid or the wife's two mains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you wanna play stock market, then I guess that's your deal.<br />
<br />
Me, I'd rather get XP, earn some cash, and maybe get a decent item or 3 to toss on the trader when I go to sleep.  Oh, and be actually playing the game at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Of course, to do that, you've got to be smart.  If you've got to understand what people want and what you are capable of providing.  When Fierce Heraldic was patched into the game, I made it.  Took me quite awhile to sell the first piece because people on the whole aren't very informed, but once word started getting around, I made a MASSIVE amount of plat.  600k would be an understatement (I really wish I kept notes of how much I made over that whole ordeal, it was an absolutely ridiculous amount). <br />
<br />
When Droga was patched, it turned into one of my favorite dungeons immediately.  Copper Hammers and Swords of the Bloodsworn were now THE weapon to have if you didn't have a BoC/SoD.  I made 160k in a weekend off those, I couldn't even guess how much I made in the 3 or 4 months i farmed it.  <br />
<br />
Making money in EQ ultimately boils down to being smarter than everyone else.  Random_Dude01 needs this, but doesn't really know how easy it is to camp.  You camp a few, sell em for a lot, and go back and rinse and repeat.  You just need to keep up with what's going on in the game and hopefully have a few friends who are willing to try new things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buying and selling in the bazaar isn't worth while any more unless your dealing in high end stuff (50k+),  the problem with that is most people don't have the startup capitol to do that.  You have to have enough cash at all times to take advantage of deals, I keep at least a million plat around just in case some decent stuff comes up for sale that I feel I can make some cash on.  It can be a difficult skill to learn, since EQ economies fluctuate so much, but once you do it becomes very profitable.  GMing all your tradeskills can also be a decent source of cash, but it takes a whole lot to get them done first, and the profit takes awhile to start coming in from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">making money in EQ involves one thing = Paitence<br />
<br />
Heck; 'I' even made money; and that's saying a LOT. It just takes time and some work either farming or sitting and waiting 'playing the market' for items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use to do the bazaar thing.  I saved up enough to get myself a nice haste and full fierce heraldic armor and stopped to go out and lvl.  Yeah I could use some money for more upgrades, but I get it mostly from BoT now.<br />
<br />
Winning Ornate molds on randoms bring in some decent cash.  You can usually lvl pretty nicely in there anyways.  Just sell the ornates in the bazaar at nights, and lvl during the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its the little things that add up, blue diamonds, GoD trade skill item drops, blood, etc all.  Its amazing what a couple of 100, 500pp etc items a night can add up into if you just remember to sell everything....hitting a &quot;home run&quot; big trade is the same as lots of little trades.  I think the orginal poster has a sound way of approaching things.  It can be very rewarding/fun to use your trade skills as the basis of trade.<br />
<br />
I do keep an eye on warr items though...its really the only equipment I know prices on real well.  On occasion you will see something really mis-priced (aka an incarn BP for 12k etc).  Its just easy to buy and re-sell when you see an opening on something like this (but as said above it really requires patience).</div></div><hr />
