They are a useless dps class. I'll take a monk or rogue pls thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's expected with any new class that becomes available; it took a bit of time for beastlords to be worthwhile in group situations.</div></div><hr />

The class will get better, it won't encroach upon warriors as some of the people are hoping for. This game is screwed up enough with 3 &quot;tank&quot; classes, they won't add a fourth.<br />
<br />
You have nothing to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i hope so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No one cares about how berserkers are balanced.  They're a fucking twink class, just like beastlord was for a year and a half.  You'll live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still dunno where did they see the reason or necessity of adding another class, with no clear specific role that is not already used by other class. What is really a berserk? Chain mitigation and dps? Its like a monk with better mitigation? If you take a look at EQ2's class tree, you will see that warrior class splits into 2 subclasses, Berserker and Guardian. The first one, more inclined to DPS than tanking, the second one, all the contrary I suppose. So, berserkers would be a warrior more inclined to DPS than to tanking, right? But I still dont see the logic behind creating a new class, it will step on everyone's toes to make place for it's own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This came up recently at monkly biz. Some people (like me) would like to see Zerkers given a group buff, similar to what they had originally on test. But slightly different. Instead of a V-4 haste buff that had the exponential issues of V-4 (monk disc speed focus for example) ... give Berserkers a group-wide V-3 haste/ATK buff. That way they bring something to their groups. Overhaste. It's in line with the class idea ... as well as in line with what the class was doing for at least a couple of weeks during GoD beta.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't step on warrior, rogue OR monk toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This just kinda makes me laugh.  Anyone who really looked at the class before hand knew it was a bad idea.  They tried to shove in a new class into an area that is very tight fitting already.  I think it is really all but impossible for them to not step on someones toes, and still be useful.  At least if they made a new caster class they could do some new type of spells, whereas with melee, they seem to have dropped the idea of more on-demand abilities leaving us with very few avenues of growth.  Dps and mitigation is about it.  There are the battle cry things, but thats just stealing from bards, nothing really new or special.  I believe the only choice for this class is to be overpowered and stepping on everyones toes, or underpowered and not worth playing.  The line is thin for pure melee.  I just hope they don't go the route of the beastlord and leave a way too fucking overpowered class out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aszuth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shrug, my woman is having a blast with hers (Darkvixyen - one of the better equipped ones according to eqrankings).<br />
<br />
In our guild - she tends to out DPS our monks, she tanks in a pinch to save my ass plenty of times, her snares are semi-reliable and land on MR mobs as easily as anything else [success rate on BER axes is based upon the ATK of the user from my experience], and has enough group benefit to her that when we do freeform group setups in raids that she is often scooped up within seconds.<br />
<br />
The class needs a little polishing, specifically a consistent boon to make them more than just DPS - my vision being similar to Wubao's in that regard - a weaker warcry that gives a minor Rizlona's style overhaste using the bardbuff box, maybe even a few other weak &quot;song&quot; options, at all times while the bigger one is recycling. [Especially since how often can you honestly say you use all 5 bard buff slots] Oh - and no mixing at all either - and when I mean weak, I mean like 5% v3 haste enough to be a boon, but not step on anyone elses toes.<br />
<br />
They're 100 times better off than Beastlords two months after their release, thats for sure.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just adding a comment to the poster above - if you think that Zerker overhaste encroaches on bards at all, you should really try looking into what their warcry really does.... in reality it's actually best in tandem with a bard...</div></div><hr />

I was talking about if it was v3 haste (what it currently is, I don't know, and I don't care, I'm talking about v3 haste in general).  If it is/was v3 haste, then yes of course it does encroach on bards, by the simple fact that it is taking a bard only ability and giving to berserkers.  Whether it's good or bad doesn't matter, it does take a bard only ability and give it to someone else, thus encroaching on them.  Have you tried reading threads before posting?  It really helps in not acting like an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;I was talking about if it was v3 haste (what it currently is, I don't know, and I don't care, I'm talking about v3 haste in general).&quot;<br />
<br />
I know you said you don't care to know, but for those that do ...<br />
<br />
It is currently V-4. It is in fact, very similar to the monk discipline, Speed Focus. And does the same thing that Speed Focus does when STACKED with overhaste. Which means it gets exponentially better the more haste you have, making it quite effective. The PROBLEM with it is two-fold ...<br />
<br />
1- It doesn't last long and has a long refresh. Making it marginally useful. <br />
2- It BLOCKS anyone else's ability to use a disc. This is a bug, related to how the combat abilities window works. If this SKILL is up and working, you, as a tank, could NOT go defensive. That could lead to some very bad things happening if not considered properly.<br />
<br />
So in essence, the skill is pretty much ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it is/was v3 haste, then yes of course it does encroach on bards, by the simple fact that it is taking a bard only ability and giving to berserkers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is something I WHOLEHEARTEDLY support.<br />
<br />
Why? Because Fading Memories took a monk/necro/SK only ability and gave it to bards. So let the bards rot. Much like warriors loathe paladins wanting to main tank ... petty, irritable monks like myself loathe the fact that monk pulling was whored out to bards.<br />
<br />
So overhaste makes bards special? Big ... fucking ... deal. There's never enough bards around to make it all that useful anyways. And there'd be a shitload of zerker twinks if they made this change, and gave them something useful to do on a raid ... meaning  petty, irritable, selfish monks like me would finally get some OVERHASTE when on a damn raid.<br />
<br />
&quot;it does take a bard only ability and give it to someone else, thus encroaching on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is exactly what I want to happen. I'm tired of melees like you and me being the ONLY people that shit happens to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My point was to Aszuth, who doesn't seem to understand others.  Like I said, I'm not saying it's good or bad either way.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thats hardly taking a special thing from one class and giving it away.  I'd place it more like taking lull from chanters, clerics, bards, etc and giving it to monks.  Especially since neither one is quite the same as the original.<br />
<br />

I'd prefer people get new shit instead of everyone stealing eachothers stuff and blending the classes together.  Even if I'm bitter towards the particular class.  All this class envy / hatred does is make things worse for everyone.<br />
<br />
Much like warriors loathe paladins wanting to main tank  <br />
<br />
This is different.  A tanking disc is the warriors unique ability.  I'd compare our situation to the suggestion of taking v3 haste from bards as very similar, except that bards have many other unique abilities so taking it from them wouldn't be near as big of a deal as stealing the one trick from a one trick pony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not anyone here's fault, that's shitty design decisions.<br />
<br />
It's not Wu's fault that SoE's dev's 1) can't come up with anything on their own, and 2) actually believe things they read on messageboards posted by people who have no idea what they're talking about.  The majority of people on here at least are reasonable in their expectations of how the game should be improved.  Other boards are not so lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;All this class envy / hatred does is make things worse for everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are correct. But I'm already a lost soul. I'm already on the path to the dark side. I'm petty and evil now. So much potential for good ... so very, very lost.<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
&quot;This is different. A tanking disc is the warriors unique ability. &quot;<br />
<br />
I was referring more to paladins and SK's tanking so well during the PoP era, and warriors being gimped as tanks for anything but major raid mobs prior to Incite going live. The discussion about defensive for paladins ... that's a whole new cup of noodles, I've yet to wrap my brain around yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That's not anyone here's fault, that's shitty design decisions. <br />
<br />
I never said it was anyones fault.  However, pretty much all classes when they do their posts to Devs, emails, etc all ask for stuff from other classes.  I'm just saying that in my opinion coming up with unique things on these boards is much more helpful.  SOE does read some of this, a perfect example is Incite, the basics of which was brought to these boards by Furor long before SOE started working on the melee revamp.  It shows that some creative ideas thought up by players can actually make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;pretty much all classes when they do their posts to Devs, emails, etc all ask for stuff from other classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
So true. So very, very true. Monks are guilty of that too. Heh. I think that's what entertained me the most about that rogue thread people were picking on. How it was sooooooo eerily familiar. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fafnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Everyone other than those folks who jumped on and started up a BER knew that the class had no &quot;role&quot; and were therefore &quot;useless&quot;.  Anyone could see that they couldn't tank (or buff, or solo) and would never rival the rogue for DPS, so why would they exist?</div></div><hr />
