<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone happen to know anyhting or see this Trackball (http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=6,CONTENTID=5006)?<br />
<br />
I'm just curious if anyone has used it since for some odd reason Logitech no longer carries my TrackMan Marble FX and I figured what the hell and just try out a cordless one for shits and giggles.<br />
<br />
My primary concern is the size of the Marble itself, the other ones that Logitech makes are a pain in the ass with my CTS and I kinda 'need' one like the one I have now.<br />
<br />
Or if anyone happens to use a trackball that is oversized i'd be happy to look into it as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Technology truly can be amazing, eh?</div></div><hr />

You guys should stop thinking everything is a dig on the government by me, it is a real mouse so you can kiss my ass eh? it was first used to help ADD children to focus by playing a game of pacman or solitare using the headband.<br />
<br />
of course I can not blame you for jumping down my shit, the government/media has said for the longest time that anyone who talks about this is nuts, while at the same time they announce prince harry has gotten a GPS locator chip installed in his neck, or the playing up of kidnapping crimes and pushing this as an answer (hey, we have been doing it to dogs and cats for years! why not your kids)<br />
<br />
also something I am rather excited about, in a positive note, is that they are making implants that allow people to see again using a camera in the eyes and a foil/copper pad laying over nerves to produce images the brain can understand<br />

Seems that if implemented correctly quadriplegic may be able to move around with servo's instead of having to use stemcells</div></div><hr />

i dont use the fan much, but i like the shape and feel of it</div></div><hr />

<br />
been happy with it, if you can live with the fact that it's a M$ product.<br />
built for large hands apparently, the size of dinner plates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i tried one of those ronnan; but the thumb deal for rotating the marble around is too painful :D<br />
logitech makes one like that too with a larger base with the small marble and it just doesn't work.<br />
<br />
i took my mouse apart last night and chopped it up and changed a trigger button and it helped a bit and can prob nurse another month or two out of it; but overall i have to try to find one with a marble the size of a cue ball to work well for me.<br />
<br />
CTS is hell. A regular mouse will lame me up so bad after an hour; and yeah I do suck at FPS's too because of it. twitch-play is out of my league :D.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully this link will help you find what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />

Only problem is when the batteries go dead in the middle of MTing on a boss mob while you had the run key pressed and you are unable to stop running forward until you get new batteries in your mouse :).<br />
<br />
Also, if you really liked the TrackMan Marble FX, there are 3 of them for sale on Ebay atm.</div></div><hr />

I bet it rocks for Breakout as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm kinda leaning towards one of them kensington deals; as long as they can provide me with the dimensions of the marble...i am happy with my logitech tho ( i had it since they first released the FX and it's been years of problem free use ) but if they choose to end that line than i won't mind hopping ship.<br />
<br />
i did write the kensington people though and ask them about the dimiensions. it's too bad i can't rig up a better design with the marble and optical equipment that i have now. oh well.<br />
<br />
oh, and paddles + breakout = win. also playing Tempest with the freespinning paddle was the shiznit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i can only hear my speakers (theyre $40 JBl pro speakers).  everything else i have to turn down the music for or leave the room :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohh man, Tempest was the best. No magelo there...just 3 letters and your score! I thought I was bad ass for finally beating the red stage and getting to the flat yellow one...until I saw a guy get to the invisible stage and I was in awe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was me :D<br />
<br />
But yeah; I remember mowing lawns all week and weekend just to trade all my hard earned dollars for a sack of quarters to go dump into the Tempest arcade game at the roller rink.<br />
<br />
I can't even stand on them old style roller skates these days but back than I used to score in the high hundreds of thousands and blow out levels in Tempest like it was a pile of cheeseburgers...and not even take the skates off !! It was definately a turning point in m life; and my first video game addiction. <br />
<br />
One day I will own the arcade upright model too..one day. I promise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This much is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dang, Sakryn mentioned Kensington trackballs before me !<br />
<br />
Anyways, I used to use a Kensington Trackball for some beginner CAD work, and it was great. The ball is rather on the large side, so it carries some weight when you spin it, making it rather non-twitch game friendly ... but lotta precision.<br />
<br />
It was the type of trackball where it's in the center of 4 main buttons, like this one :<br />
http://www.kensington.com/images/pc/K64245-4202.jpg <br />
<br />
So if you are going to do anything that takes precision, then I can recommend that type of trackballs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note : Kensington Trackballs are a bit on the expensive side, since they are usually aimed at professional work and such. But they are good quality and well worth the price, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The heck with a trackball. Time to step up to a Spaceball (http://www.3dconnexion.com/spaceball5000.htm) <br />
http://www.3dconnexion.com/img/spaceball1.jpg <br />
<br />
That's what I use at work (http://www.ducommunaero.com/) for Unigraphics CAD/CAM, and without one I am 1 handed. Won't help gaming a single bit, but he mentioned work stuffs heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dude, the price of that trackball is as much as my PC :D although if I had the money that thing would have been ordered already. wow, that thing is awesome.<br />
<br />
i gotta go forward that link to my boss and see if she can approve of one for me at work. i'll also show her the medical bills that the insurance company paid for my surgery + see if this can fall under &quot;preventitive care&quot; :D<br />
<br />
Thanks !!</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah, I remember Tempest too ... I think I even have the DOS version, Tempest 2000, somewhere from a friend who had the Wingman Warrior joystick with that spinning thingamajig.  :p</div></div><hr />
