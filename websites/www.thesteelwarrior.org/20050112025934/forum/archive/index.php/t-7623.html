<br />
1) It was a pet thing, and somehow bestow DA on a pet made it retain agro, but be unable to take damage.<br />
<br />
2) It is a nerf to defensive/evasive, and if a warrior uses defensive, they take more damage.<br />
<br />
3) It is a DA type effect for defensive/evasive, where if a warrior uses defensive, the mob goes looking for the second person on the hate list to attack.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any hard evidence for any of these claims?<br />
<br />
The first one sounds most likely (if true), but number 2 and 3 would end the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Option 4 that someone else suggested in another thread:<br />
<br />
4) It is a DA type effect for auto-riposte discs, ie furious and weaponshield.<br />
<br />
Seems pretty likely, given that they can be made to last the whole fight as it stands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty (95%) sure its #3, although I never saw in personally.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, <br />
<br />
I think most people thought that DD and Tipt boss's in particular were pretty unfair to knights, however since it dealt with tanking, and tanking is so interwoven and complicated and set into the game, any changes would make one side upset.<br />
<br />
Lots of mobs have immunities to certain abilities, I think its somewhat of a cheap 'fix', but every other solution that people have suggestedI've seen woulda either pissed off warriors even more, or not fixxed the problem really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I should probably check out Tipt and see if they made Defensive useless. Since without Defensive, Paladins and Warriors tank about the same, hopefully they are even handed and disable Knight spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't that be a sensible fix - disable Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability and Spellbooks, the defining Knight characteristic. Let's all run around as ordinary footsoldiers - the role some Knights are wishing on Warriors.<br />
<br />
The &quot;problem&quot; Madrone is that Knights who aren't geared up for progressive content expect to skip previous content and do the new stuff anyway. The proper &quot;fix&quot; is to just let Little Knights That Can't &quot;hitch a ride&quot; just like they do wherever Warriors MT raid quality mobs and continue to let those Knights That Can and Do show what being at the top of the game means.<br />

<br />
That doesnt really make sense, these changes dont make it so a knight whos not geared well enough beable to tank them,  it makes it so a knight who is geared appropiatly at the content level can.</div></div><hr />

The spellbook helps all the way to the named mobs. It transforms Warriors into the ordinary footsoldiers some Knights want them to be while leaving Knight advantages 100% intact.<br />
<br />
A Knight that was geared appropriately can already tank them chief - its a Warrior nerf. They may be making Warirors more like Knights without Spellbooks. So far in these expeditions only. Only a fool would group a Warrior in these now - Knights have too many advantages on the way to the boss mob. WoW is looking better every day.<br />

<br />
i dont think this is the best solution, but for warriors its better then a solution most knights want.<br />
<br />
Knights appropiatly geared could not tank them Tipt is late elemental, and Ikkinz is mid time level, Knights who were late/post time could tank them, and they were considered endgame content only because ikkinz raid 4 and uqua wernt doable.<br />
<br />
Look, i'm not saying this is a great solution, what I'm saying is that the alternaters were much, much less popular with warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the way to the boss mob Paladins stun blue mobs, stun gaters, Res the fallen and save the expedition should the Cleric die. And when the Warrior (if a Warrior ever bothers to try to get a group in these zones again) finally gets to the boss mob, his only advantages come into play but are disabled. It's a Warrior nerf. And the sad part is that capable Knights can do these. All their whining got Warirors a 2 expedition nerf. Why don't y'all try for all of GoD?<br />

<br />
 reminds me of paladins undervaluing their spell books!<br />
<br />
**edit**<br />
<br />
a lot of the mobs are unstunnable via normal stuns (and SK's dont even have those) and dont bring up pulling beacuse anyone can pull tipt!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Trillith, for Warriors their capabilites allow them to be otherwise undergeared when taking on too hard mobs. That's what we do - it defines the class.<br />
<br />
What we don't do is spot heal, group heal, &quot;stun mitigate&quot;, stun gater dependably, Root, Res, re-buff the ressed, GRC, etc, etc. all the way to the boss mob.<br />

<br />
When did being undergeared be your specialty?  When you were the only ones who could tank raid mobs, you had to be appropriatly geared, defensive or no.  When you had to offtank, you had to be appropriately geared, defensive or no.  Defensive just brings unrealistic mobs down to where they are an appropriate level for where you are at.  <br />
<br />
And, the tanking portion of knight spellbooks usually is disabled.  Stuns don't land to help mitigate damage.  The heals do so little that they are generally meaningless (from a tanking perspective).  Even if it is true, which I'm not sure its been confirmed yet, its hardly the ruin of the class-though, this would not be my first choice on how to fix the issue.  But, I think its somewhat silly to say suddenly that your real forte was being an undergeared tank, now that you are required to live up to your own mantra and be actually worthy of completing the content you are trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh,<br />
<br />
I'll be nice. But yes - from long lines of Warriors lining up to die to AoW all the way through PoTime Warriors have done cutting edge mobs with insuffiecient gear. After awhile guilds get geared up and Defensive is less important. But at first it's the #1 reason guilds beat mobs they aren't ready to do.<br />
<br />
And I have always done mobs while undergeared - that's what Warriors do for three minutes. Knights &quot;gear up&quot; and eventually are capable. Warriors, thanks to Defensive, do it by the skin of their teeth when not yet &quot;geared up&quot; and gear up after which eventually makes it easier.<br />
<br />
And stuns land on virtually every blue mob and there are piles of them. Heals land too. So no, Knight spellbooks are not only 100% available, they are very very effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright then, I can atleast see where you are coming from, but I do disagree.  You cannot ever be &quot;ready&quot; for a mob if you need to farm the gear behind it to do it.  I think, instead, the mob is designed around a tank with appropriate gear, for the content hes done/is up to, and defensive in mind.  And then, when you've beaten it and farmed behind it, you've now made it trivial... you've not suddenly become standard ready.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DD/Tipt boss isnt a &quot;raid&quot; encounter, its single group, which is the root of the problem.<br />
<br />
No reason to move this thread to the outhouse, I disagree with BB and no ones flamed eachother<br />
<br />
Our spellsbooks arnt 100% effective, I'm not gunna say they are worthless, because I prefer not to scew my view to further the point I'm trying to say, but they definatly arnt 100% effective. (mob immunites, getting stunned ourself etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Jhiru was already nerfed too much. He went from being assbeat originally, to a total pushover - should've been somewhere in the middle.<br />
<br />
Second, whether it applies to defensive/stonewall, evasive, furious... it's assinine.  If they really wanted to appease the whiners and make it easier for knights, there are others ways to go about doing it. It's nice to know the devs are listening to players, but one would hope they'd have a Stupidity Filter to prevent them from listening to everything players say, and allow them to filter out the dumbass ideas. Like this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nod, glad you see where I'm coming from. Warriors are often NOT ready to do mobs by definition when they are first encountered. Thanks to Defensive and luck, guilds and groups beat stuff for the first time even when not geared to the teeth. But by farming gear from the content that can already handled it becomes easier and easier.<br />
<br />
I first was in the MT list on an EP boss at 9500HP's buffed. As we continued to farm this and previous content that very quickly became 11000HP's. I'm now at 12200HP's buffed with I think 1 GoD item and 3 augments. The upgrades are already in the EP's, PoTime, LDoN, and easier GoD zones that Knights need to do this content.<br />
<br />
This is just drying the tears of incapable Knights that claim pre-EP Warriors can do this stuff because of Defensive (a falsehood). I suppose Warriors should wait for the other shoes to drop - level 70 stuns, Knight &quot;burst mitigation&quot;, and further Knight inspired nerfs to Warriors.<br />
<br />
Madrone, everybody can get stunned. You can channel an instant heal without being interrupted. A mob trying to gate isn't stunning anyone. I'm not saying your class is god-like, but I am saying they have some pretty impressive advantages.<br />
<br />
Adjusting the content so Knights can handle it is one thing. But nerfing Warriors so Knights have every single one of their many advantages all the way to the boss mob and Warriors have 0, none, nada and when Warriors finally get to the boss there's no reason to want the class that's been a boat anchor up to this point is ludicruous.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have a good source for this nerf theory?<br />
<br />
I mean, can someone post a link to a thread talking about it on test or a dev saying this is the way it will be changed?<br />
<br />
I don't like the precedence this sets.  I can see it evolving to the point that you need a paladin to help the poor warriors thru OOW trials.<br />
<br />
I am going to try to log on asap and see about testing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering the route they took here, I doubt they are overly amped about the idea of going along with the other &quot;warrior nerfs&quot;.  Its just part of the constant back and forth thats been as much a part of the game as anything else.  <br />
<br />
The thing though is, you wanted defensive to remain active against these mobs.  You say defensive is a crutch to get people by content they aren't really ready for.  Then you say that warriors weren't undergeared for the encounters to begin with.  If they had to use defensive, they were, by your standard.  <br />
<br />
The complaints weren't all from the undergeared too, but I will admit many were.  That is the nature of things, both in the warrior camp and the paladin one.  Well, every class for that matter.  <br />
<br />
This isn't the ideal solution, if it even pans out as we are thinking it will, but it is a workable one for all involved.  Knights didn't get defensive, which seemed to be a biggy for warriors.  And now knights and warriors may have the same problems, though..they may not still depending on what exactly the patch message means.  The status quo is back, its just a bit more flashy then usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, if this does apply to defensive/evasive or furious, this is a warrior nerf. This does not help paladins tank these trials better, it only makes it harder for warriors to do their job using their tools. Btw, sorry, having a spellbook does offer a ton of utility and is directly comparable to a warrior's defensive and other discs.<br />
<br />
In my experience, warriors and paladins need to be geared fairly well (EP level) to tank these (exluding special groups such as 2 strong healers to support a lesser tank). The only difference was Paladins brought more utility for an entire exp, while a warrior was safer tanking the end boss mobs. For my experiences, I enjoy having a paladin/sk in group more than a lot of classes (paladin especially to do spot heals, group heals, Res to back up a cleric, etc).<br />
<br />
Of course, I probably suck because I can't pull the rooms of Tipt without multiple adds that will wipe me (and possibly my groups ;))<br />
<br />
However, I believe everyone has a different viewpoint on this based on normal group makeup. My normal group is necro, ranger/druid, warrior, cleric, ench, and a 6th (I like paladin/sk most for their utility, backup or primary tanking, and all the other benefits)<br />
<br />
&lt;edit to fix spelling and add note: do we have any actual reports that it is furious or defensive/evasive that the change affects?&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhumba</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if this is true...<br />
<br />
I guess it means that all single group content that is meant to be challenging melee wise, will have defensive nerfed for the fight?<br />
<br />
Reminds me of Charm, and all the constant nerfs and unnerfs. You'd think they would try to come up with a better core solution, rather than putting a bandaid on 2 encounters, and setting a precedent for all future single group content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is already a single group solution. Paladins do a better job getting you there, SK's can output a bucketload more damage IF you know how to kill a single mob efficiently, and Warriors are better taking the beating from brutal mobs for 3 minutes. Some Knights want all of their advantages and Warriors to lose theirs (or Knights to have them too).<br />
<br />
Being able to beat the encounter and not being able to get there is a loss. I know because it's happened to me many many many times in the trials. And there is not a trial Knights can't beat - even the ones that aren't mandatory.<br />
<br />
Getting there IS part of the trial. For Warriors, it's often the hard part.<br />
<br />
I haven't done the DD Ikkinz trial and I'll tell ya true - if it's freaking hard for me at 12200HP's buffed because I've been nerfed, I'm going to be royally ^%$^^%$'ed.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't care at all if SoE made the fights 13 minutes to lessen the impact of Defensive, or tampered with DI/DB, or added a damage shield. But taking away a Warrior capability to make some Knight's feel good that they got Warirors nerfed is assinine.<br />

SK's really dont do much more damage at the Time+ level then an compartivly geared warrior, this is even more true now that you'll use offensive discs</div></div><hr />

The idea that you should be able to raid without it is assinine.  Please, by all means go through EP without touching defensive at all.  Gear up with ornate and VT....but don't touch it until you've done ssra without defensive, which is after you've done velious without it and so on and so forth.  Gimme a break.  If it weren't for those discs, the high end guilds would still be finishing up stuff like luclin to this day.  Remember it was only after whatever guild it was that was farming time that they had a paladin tank.  Without the gear from there, he'd have gone down like...Madrone...irl~</div></div><hr />

Frodlin, just curious - you against even 15 sec Weaponshield for Paladins and 15 Sec Furious for SK's now? I've been in favor of it, but I'm starting to think even that's going to prove to be horribly overpowered within the month. And you are correct, OoW stuns are headshakingly nuts. They need to be removed or crippled with recourse buffs on the mobs asap.<br />

2 Add Tanks with spellbook extra value some of whom are geared up enough to sometimes MT.<br />

1 Tank in name only with an inadequate spellbook and inadequate DPS some of whom are geared up enough to sometimes add tank.<br />

But, for the content level they are designed for.  If that level is Time+, then it should not be nerfed to be tankable by an elemental knight.  If its elemental level, you shouldn't need a time+ knight though.<br />
<br />
As a knight, I'm really not that unhappy with GoD.  Its really been one of my favorite expansions so far.  Granted, I'm only an elemental knight so I don't have to deal with things like DD or end(ish) game tanking.  Vxed , for example, is pretty sweetly balanced imo, and really wasn't too bad pretune.  Vxed and Tipt (minus khj) push my gear to the limits, which I really, really enjoy.  I would prefer every content level was like that, for people who do it when it is appropriate for them.  <br />
<br />
Frod is right that the level 70 stuns will be an issue.  Mini-def was never really required, though, I would vastly have preferred keeping the single group content that was using Def the same and boosting  short term mitigation spells that knights already have in order to do them.  Better heals and limited stuns making it a rough, but enjoyable ride through a Defensive friendly mob challenging but doable.  A high dps encounter that uses all of a knights gear (including all of the mana on it) to get through would be pretty sweet.  Unfortunately, we don't have the spells to allow for that.  I also would like a parry/dodge/riposte disc, just because its flashy and I enjoy flash, but that is just a secret little thing that doesn't matter much to me.:)<br />
<br />
Would be nice to see how things pan out in the real world though.</div></div><hr />

By that same token, a warrior can get away with those identical stats fairly well considering our mitigation bonus and higher natural hp.<br />

The end result is the same...Warriors are the better tank. I'd encourage you guys to try these out before calling nerf...overall the trial was made an option to many more people. You can farm the (time level) gear that drops from named easier now.</div></div><hr />

So does defensive just not do anything anymore, or....? I'm particularly interested in tipt at this point, but I'm assuming the nerf will be the same on him.</div></div><hr />

That would be true if defensive didn't work for the other 2h 55m. Paladin stuns have never worked the second a mob goes from 65 to 66+...how is our defensive not working on a single mob any different?<br />
<br />
Like I said - It's not that bad. The others named are still defensive tankable (and still rip a knight apart sometimes  :D )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, are DD/Jhiru fully slowable now, to the degree that a warrior who could tank them before with defensive could still tank them with slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me like a reasonable compromise for those situations where you want to design content that is tankable by both Knights and Warriors, without giving Warriors a large inherent advantage.  Yes, it does mean that Knights will continue to have the advantage of their spellbooks while two of the Warrior advantages are negated, but as long as it is a once in a while approach, and not something they do all the time, then it seems a reasonable disadvantage to have in order to level the playing field sufficiently in single group content.<br />
<br />
If it meant that Knights were hands down preferred for these trials as a result, I'd see room for complaint.  But it doesn't appear to be that way, at least not as long as Warrior advantages outside of defensive/evasive still retain enough value to make a difference.  I can see that down the road, as Knights level and gear up a bit more, that tanking advantage will be mostly negated, but that's a while yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was this necessary?  I don't read PoN or whineplay 2.0 but based on the fact that there are few if any knights left on this board crying about the trials, and the fact that you don't even have to do the Ikkinz trials anymore (maybe one group does?)  that this was already pretty much a non-issue at this point.  If the trials were doable with a good success rate with a knight tanking, then the tradeoff is the utility of a knight vs. the higher survivabililtyof the warrior on the end boss.  So maybe a warrior could get through with less gear, the knight has man obvious advantages of their own.  All this does is make knights the hands-down better choice for tanking the trials (they already were for all the trials prior to Tipt).  <br />
<br />
The one thing I can say for it is it's better than mini defensive for knights, which would have screwed things up all over the game instead of in just a few trials.</div></div><hr />

There is only 1 other boss and it dies so fast you can jusy have a ranger WS tank it so your healers can nuke. The difference is that there is basically 1 mob between the masses and KodTaz - Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru. The rest of the trial can be done with any tank, or even without a tank if you have a good enchanter and a little luck. Jhiru is the sole reason to have a warrior tank for a Tipt group. The worst part is that a properly equipped knight has been able to tank both mobs for some time now. This change was really unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some Knights are already seeing this apparently as a sign of things to come. As Kahm said:<br />
Well, I am glad to see it the way many Knights have been asking for. Either introduce a balanced Knight mini-Defensive or else remove Warrior Defensive from the scene.<br />
<br />
Let's be clear - until I became aware that Paladins were going to get level 70 stuns in OoW, I (and many other Warriors) favored Knights getting a balanced burst mitigation ability. A 15 second auto-parry disc for Paladins and 15 second auto-reposte disc for SK's. But ya know what? If SoE had done this, most of the 6500HP unbuffed Knights would be shocked to discover they were still too under-geared to do the content they were complaining about. The problem isn't balanced burst mitigation - it's under geared &quot;Tanks&quot; expecting to Tank like they weren't.<br />
<br />
And there ya have it. Unable to play their class effectively in their established roles, some Knights applaud both Baby Trials and nerfing Warriors in them so they can't off the resultant gimped mobs too easily.<br />
<br />
This change is Baby Trials by another means. It IS gimped content and two different trials - one for Knights with 100% of their abilties and one for nerfed Warriors.<br />
<br />
I believe it's possible to design a trial that is a fair and honest challange to all 4 Tanks without resorting to nerfing anyone. But, if Baby Trials and neutralizing the defining Warrior ability is what it takes to make ya look good (*cough*), Grats.<br />
<br />
If we one group named Sand Giants to get our twinks flags though, I'll MT if you don't mind. Most of the wannabe's can't handle a real mob - not in a single group - not without &quot;special&quot; help.<br />

It's horribly overpowered on high level mobs and it can be done mob after mob after mob with no long duration Discipline refresh timer to regulate it. Basicly except for relatively rare stun immune mobs, Paladins will out tank any Warrior by a huge margin.<br />

Oh I know the beneift of stuns. I was sort of sarcastically requesting people to stop claiming &quot;knights&quot; are overpowered(or might be with OoW) when they really mean &quot;paladins.&quot;  <br />
<br />
A paladin's potential ability to stun level 70 mobs does not make &quot;knights&quot; in general overpowered.  I get as little from their ability to do that as you do, and I consider myself a knight.</div></div><hr />

Re Stuns: Stuns are definatly powerful, two things to remember though #1 we can get stunned, which means we can't stun when stuned, #2 stuns to not reset weapon delay, which means that after a stun fades, they can attack immedialy, this doesnt mean much when mobs are unslowable, but stuns arnt quite as powerful against slowable mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Afaik, swings that a mob loses the opprotunity to execute are gone. Their weapon swing timer isn't reset, but neither does it free run making them always swing as soon as stun wears off. That's actually a very fair way of handling stuns.<br />
<br />
Stating that slow decreases the effectiveness of stuns is disingenious. Just like when Warirors use Defensive, vs a unslowable mob more damage is &quot;mitigated&quot; but more is taken. An unslowed mob is dangerous and anything that reduces its damage rate is a major advantage. Against slowed mob a higher percentage of the damage they might dish out is delayed - smoothes out the damage a lot. So in both cases, Defensive and &quot;stun mitigation&quot; are a big positive benefit against hard hitting mobs - either slowed or unslowed.<br />

Leaving the Ancient one to fix the problem paladins have had with stuns for years, a stun that actually works on higher end content.   Realistcally, you will probably only be having one of those stuns in use at any one time (and the fact that the best one is ancient should say something to you.....)<br />

I tend to agree.  Paladins should be able to stun mobs they fight.  They however shouldn't be able to completely negate huge chunks of incoming melee damage by being able to chain stun something into a stupor.  Hopefully SoE will work it so Paladins always have a stun available that will work on most anything they'll fight in a group, while not giving them so much stun power it trivializes the situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When did being undergeared be your specialty?  When you were the only ones who could tank raid mobs, you had to be appropriatly geared, defensive or no.  When you had to offtank, you had to be appropriately geared, defensive or no.  Defensive just brings unrealistic mobs down to where they are an appropriate level for where you are at.  <br />
<br />
And, the tanking portion of knight spellbooks usually is disabled.  Stuns don't land to help mitigate damage.  The heals do so little that they are generally meaningless (from a tanking perspective).  Even if it is true, which I'm not sure its been confirmed yet, its hardly the ruin of the class-though, this would not be my first choice on how to fix the issue.  But, I think its somewhat silly to say suddenly that your real forte was being an undergeared tank, now that you are required to live up to your own mantra and be actually worthy of completing the content you are trying.<br />

you still have your stun mitigation to cover up the gaps in your gear, we have jack and shit for us now, that isnt fair<br />

Joking aside, stun mitigation doesnt work on these mobs, only on the trash.<br />

The Thing about OoW is that most of content we face for single groups thats boss like will be between 73 and 80 probably, so we wont beable to acheive a ton of mitigation through stuns, (not hugely more then a mnk/pal/war/sk can acheive through a Time Rend (3/68 stun) proc at 3PPM</div></div><hr />

As for the other comment about having stuns.  Yes, we do have them to close the gap in our equipment with warriors.  We still need to be at their level though.  Defensive doesn't work that way.  That and, anywhere you are pushing your gear to the max and need to makeup some extra mitigating...you can almost guarantee stuns won't work.  Basically, they are just agro machines.</div></div><hr />

It depends how far they go with changes.  Paladins can stun and decrease damage taken, but on mobs SOE doesn't want them to, they flag it unstunnable (ie raid mobs).  Same with slow, SOE makes some mobs mitigate.  We know this.  Now disciplines work the same way.  Now SOE has more tools with which to tune encounters.  Its LAME to say we were tremendously nerfed at this point.<br />

All we have (and all we want) is &quot;unmatched&quot; survivabilty when we MT brutal battles. Some of us are fully expecting this one and only capability to be taken away, shared, or neutralized. Do we really have much reason to expect anything else?<br />

High-end Knights can MT PoTime, sucessfully do acknowledged level 70 content, Paladins will be getting a revitalized stun line in OoW, and some Knights still aren't satisfied - they want the Warrior defining class ability removed, shared, or neutralized.<br />
<br />
Pop Quiz - what one-groupable mob that can be dependably MT'd by a Knight is not relatively trivial for a Warrior to MT? Answer - none. Now why since this has been the case for four years should anyone suggest it should be otherwise? Especially since Warriors are supposed to be (like it or not) better at tanking  than Knights?<br />

<br />
That's not the underlying point though.<br />
<br />
The gist of why I am concerned is the fact that this is a nerf.  They retuned it as a nerf when they proclaimed they weren't gonna nerf anymore.  Since defensive is pretty much the bread-and-butter of the warrior class, making a change to it in content that we have already done* is unwarranted.  Stealth nerfs like this make me go back to my previous position of not trusting SoE further than I can throw them.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Note that I'm complaining about content that's been tried and rebalanced at least once before.  Going back on their word and putting in such a moronic change isn't the same as putting in unique encounters in future encounters where you can't use defensive.<br />
<br />
It's pretty much the principle of things, for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a little over dramatic.  Of course there are knights who want defensive, its incredibly powerful.  They are not thinking of balance though, or well, they can be, but not a good one.  Warriors have that same problem.  Many warriors tried to create the term &quot;single group raid content&quot; to justify why knights shouldn't be able to tank well there.  Most of you seem to realize that was lunacy.  Many paladins also know that giving paladins everything any individual paladin wants to the entire class is also lunacy.  Saying, &quot;Well, fix the content OR give us defensive&quot; isn't the same as saying, &quot;Give us defensive now please.&quot;  I'm sure most of you can see the difference.  Personally, I've never had an urge to get defensive.<br />
<br />
I think its also a little silly to play the &quot;slaves to the range&quot; card.  Sure, this was always true, but it *never* mattered until PoP.  At no point from the original Eq-Luclin were warriors in Danger of losing their roles.  Hybrids had to kick and scream about serious liabilities (yes, all those small things added up to a problem atleast as big as depending on the range) and eventually got all of them removed, after a long time of trying.  Compare that to warriors having no real world problems (because people were trained to deal with your agro situation) until PoP and then needing to complain and get fixed.  Actually, I'll rework that.  I will give you that the agro thing sucked, even though it was everyone around you that paid for it, instead of you, and they still picked you up for groups more often then not (atleast on my server...well, until velious/luclin where you didn't need a tank at all-that was a seperate issue though).  I would say knights and warriors have probably had roughly equal hard times over the years.  <br />
<br />
And as someone who also plaid a high level mage for a very long time, I can tell you these same arguments were spouted at the mages tower forever.  Velious as hideous for casters as was much of Luclin.  Hell, Kunark really wasn't even all that hot if you didn't have lures.  All the while, I saw mages complaining that, &quot;we all know who the dev's really loves, its those darn rogues!&quot; You will see paladins say the same about warriors on PoN (No don't roll your eyes, its really not all that different.:) ).  Every single class board has had the complaint that they are the &quot;red headed step child&quot;.  Its a common shared experience because people have short memories and the pendulum is always swinging either too far away from you or too near.  <br />
<br />
Knights probably won't get defensive.  For starters because its a bad idea.  But they also don't have the support to push for it, even within their own ranks.  While the &quot;board warriors&quot; may feel otherwise, the rest of us are playing the game and dealing with the real world situations and problems.  I personally have no desire to push for something I know is unfair, both in theory, and in real world terms to my warrior guildmates who I've been working with for years now.  I support them getting what they need and they support me in return.  Unfortunately, most of them don't actually read the boards.:p  <br />
<br />
Just relax some, life really isn't so bad for either of us at the moment.  Warriors were supposedly saying that single group content shouldn't be designed around defensive.  Whether it is removed by virtue of it not being needed or it is actively disabled is immaterial, the ends are the same.  The big, shining point that you should be focusing on is... knights not only didn't get defensive, but now, hopefully, they will have no basis to ask for it.  Mind you, some still will.  There will always be those types.  There will also always be warriors who feel they should dominate all levels of tanking to an unreasonable degree.</div></div><hr />

I have read several places that the various autoriposte/autoparry disciplines work the same as always.  People seem to agree that defensive and evasive cause a warrior to lose aggro.  Pag0 suggested above that stonewall isn't affected by the change.<br />
<br />
I'm not a warrior, so I can't try it.  (And I don't relish the though of experimenting with it, heh.)  I suppose, since you can click off disciplines, you might be able to try it, and on aggro loss, drop the disc and aoe taunt or something.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it would be good to know if stonewall works.</div></div><hr />

Actually the end result is not the same. The ability to use Defensive assures groups that the higher risk they assume by including a Warrrior on the way to a boss mob is offset by a safety margin (needed or not) when they actually engage it.<br />

I guess many warriors would still pop defensive on a &quot;named&quot; even if they were pretty safe without it.  I had neglected to consider that.  I would still hazard a guess that in the real world it won't matter too much to people.  Even still, I would have agreed with warriors preferring content to remain untouched.  I don't think SoE has the energy to have fixed the single group tanking balance properly; Ie-without giving knights defensive, but fixing their tanking oriented spell power.  It would be alot harder then simple removing defensive from the equation or giving it out to everyone.</div></div><hr />

Warriors defense<br />
pally stuns<br />

<br />
thats' really unbalanced tank wise, knights do need some help to be able to tank becuase current spell book and disc does nto help them tank except for the pally class on stunable stuff.<br />
<br />
Sk they could add new fear spells to help them(flag boss stufff unfearable though)  and maybe like a 10-20 min 2 tick reposte disc and new set of fast runes with no regents. this class could really use help though and right now they have no way to avoid damage as a tank class, raid guilds wont even recuit more then 1 -2 sk for good reason<br />
<br />
pallys 2 tick  15 min recharge parry disc and decent self via line. pallys are good really set right now except for the unstunable stuff<br />

also they need to change some weapons and augs knight usable, their aggro nto as good as it use to be hehe.</div></div><hr />

That would help absolutely nothing from a group/raid tanking perspective, and just give Sony more reason NOT to improve the area(s) of SK deficiency due to increased solo utility.</div></div><hr />

My guild used to be centered around paladins, it was fun to watch them kick ass on raids and in groups.  But the bottom line to this situation is that Warriors, after raising hell for a year and getting nothing but empty repetitions of a meaningless promise, finally had their lack of group desireability issues addressed.  Less than a month before GoD opened, irrc.  <br />
<br />
Then GoD opens, and Knights get hosed bigtime.  Stuff hits like trucks with dynamite strapped to the bumpers, and the Tipt boss absolutely destroys most paladins and SKs who are &lt;time geared.  Warriors, with their newly decoupled discs, and massively improved aggro, come into their own big time for groups in Tipt and Vxed, and GoD in general.  Paladins raise hell, and more importantly, begin leaving the game in numbers.<br />
<br />
SoE's reaction is to gimp the content.  Ok, thats acceptable, though not optimal, and its in keeping with their long standing practice.  But to add this wrinkle... it really just seems like an undeserved penalty imposed on Warriors.  It seriously lowers the desireability of Warriors for these events.  At this point, my preferred tank for Tipt would be a Paladin, simply because having another rez can be huge.<br />
<br />
What's worse, it establishes a precedent.  You can be sure we will see this more in the future.  Which sucks.  Knights don't seem to get this, but Defensive/Evasive is our class defining ability.  We give up everything for this.  Take away Defensive/Evasive, and we are knights who traded their spell books for -1 DI mitigation and a rip disc.  <br />

Would you make that trade?</div></div><hr />

If anything, view defensive as a sure fire DA, get healed, click it off, AEtaunt if you need, go again. Fuck, stop whining, it reeks of paladin.<br />

This is a good change. Which also incidently puts the final nail in the 'paladins need a defensive type disc' coffin. They won't get one.<br />

If they want to nerf defensive for key one-group encounters then sure, make it less effective provided the mob's still tankable by both warriors and knights.<br />

GoD was tuned for L68-70, SoE have admitted that fuckup<br />
<br />
So, what happens when they do raise the level cap, and people of APPROPRIATE LEVEL are fighting in GoD? <br />
<br />
Same as PoP really - any exp grind group will be significantly better off with a paladin tank over a warrior. SKs will still be completely shunned. More and more mobs will be discovered with anti-defensive code.<br />
<br />
If you're determined to start down this path, just do it. Ram it up us in one go rather than an inch at a time. Remove defensive from the game entirely and universally rebalance tanking to give warriors a GAMEWIDE tanking advantange, and SKs a major DPS increase, both large enough to compensate with paladin's stackability and multifunctioning utility. <br />
<br />
Here's what I assumed the change would be:<br />
That's how it reads, but I expect they've just reduced the ATK and added code to partially ignore defensive disc. This would make high AC tanks (eg knights/warriors of appropriate gear) able to tank significantly easier, but without making it trivial for /disc'ed warriors at the same time<br />
Making defensive actually work better than any de-agro spell in the game is rediculous. Why not make them reflect stun, or make any heals cast by the currently agro person turn into self nukes, or give the mob a mana sucking DS, or SOMETHING to effect some of the paladin's benefits in the same way you're completely removed our's.</div></div><hr />

Igneous get's it. The trials are, as previously pointed out, not needed as gatekeepers. SoE can nerf the heck out of them and it no longer matters. They surely aren't trials where groups are impartially measured and found capable or incapable.<br />
<br />
*** They are not impartial trials anymore. ***<br />
<br />
Still, Madrone pretends he doesn't know the answer. The answer sir is make them tankable by Knights. If that makes them tankable by a Warrior in a bronze tutu, it doesn't matter. By making them tankable by Knights they are no longer Trials they are a three hour dungeon crawl with a pinata for a boss mob at the end.<br />
<br />
Make them still a &quot;challange&quot; for Warriors by situationally nerfing Defensive? Sure, if it amuses you. But why not just issue Warriors Bronze Scimitars and impound their weapons instead. It's the same thing.<br />
<br />
*** Knights and crippled Warriors can be challanged by the same content. Wu wu!! ***<br />

Frodlin says it looks like Knights shouldn't get Defensive afterall and they can't get mad.

How can ya get mad with someone who agrees with ya at least half the time  :D <br />

He claims a temporary situational nerf is &quot;a good change overall&quot;. He's wrong but it doesn't matter. The trials aren't trials anymore.<br />

The retarded thing is, there are mobs that screw with healing.  There are mobs that reflect spells.  There are mobs that chew through Da.  There are mobs that drain mana.  Knights have faced all that, though not always as a tank, but its still a beautiful limiting factor.  You *finally* have to face the problem every single other class has since pretty much day one and you're mad?  <br />
<br />
You can still make them a &quot;trial&quot;, but you have to be fair about it, they need to be knight tankable.  Which means you cannot allow defensive to be a part of it.

The only rebuttal a warrior can make to your argument is simple. We face that trial every single day. If I hit a see-invis mob in barindu otw to Tipt and get stunned, I'm toast. I have no fd, no paci, no root, no snare, no rez, no sos, no invis, no corpse summon, no evac, no pet. I WILL have to recruit some others to help me get my gear and xp back. I'm straight f'd.

But, they knew it was all just luck to begin with.  Now you are complaining that you actually have to go through the same thing?  That finally you have to do without your crutch and walk through things on your own merit?  This has always been the problem with defensive.<br />
<br />
The retarded thing is, there are mobs that screw with healing.  There are mobs that reflect spells.  There are mobs that chew through Da.  There are mobs that drain mana.  Knights have faced all that, though not always as a tank, but its still a beautiful limiting factor.  You *finally* have to face the problem every single other class has since pretty much day one and you're mad?  <br />
<br />
You can still make them a &quot;trial&quot;, but you have to be fair about it, they need to be knight tankable.  Which means you cannot allow defensive to be a part of it.  They can still very much be gatekeepers.  But, what is it you wanted then?  It seems to me you want it to be very hard for knights (from your last post, more like undoable) and easy for warriors.  You can claim that is balance?<br />
<br />
The &quot;crutch&quot; you talk about is the core warrior defining ability.  Sadly you make the case against knights with posts like this all too plain and apparant.  It's exactly the same as a warrior saying your spellbook is a crutch.<br />
<br />
The reality of this entire situation is that the content was fubar'd to begin with.  The boss mobs in the single group trials were not well thought out.  The problem is not our &quot;crutch&quot; nor is it knight spell books, it was badly designed content.<br />
<br />
This solution, while I'm sure you applaud, is the first step down a slippery slope of removing the need for warriors from the game.  The solution if it is applied in the future past these two encounters will do just that.<br />
<br />
The only way this solution would be &quot;fair&quot; would be for the mob to cast a silence spell on the tank, to remove the knights core abilities as well,  to go along with the nerf.  Then you would truly be pretty much on the same footing.<br />
<br />
The part that sucks about all of this entire subject... warriors get something... knights feel shafted...get warriors nerfed... now either knights get nerfed or warriors get something in return or massive amounts of folks will quit playing the game due to perceived inequalities in the game real or imagined.<br />
<br />
If you want to change that it's really simple...quit bitching about what another class can do and work on solely getting your own class improved.  <br />
<br />
Personally I'm thrilled when a Paladan with me gets an increase in power... that's cool... it makes the game worth playing for him.  I would like to believe that my Pally (and SK) friends feel the same towards me.<br />
<br />
Keep it all everyone... soon there won't be Core abilities for Wars, Pals or SKs.  We'll all be nerfed to oblivion.  Wars will lose defensive... pals won't get the new stuns in oow or any other decent spell, SKs will get caught in there somewhere too I'm sure.  The reason is simple...jealosy and class envy.  The classes will NEVER be totally balanced.  It just cannot and will not happen.  Keep this up and we ALL LOSE.</div></div><hr />

You would be better off with skills that act somewhat like spells (in end result, not use).  Something that is used continuously/regularly.  Skills that boost you all the time pretty much.

Any of those other new skills would probably start infringing on hybrid turf.<br />

For what it's worth, I use it all the time, particularly stonewall. Any time I need a little extra boost to handle extra adds, etc. It's actually relatively useful for train stomping in BoT, hard ldon, etc. I use what I've got.

<br />
In all honesty, I doubt you will find much sympathy to your position here.  It really IS the same thing as a warrior calling your spellbook a crutch.  It's simply a tool.  It's really a shame that you look at it that way since that exact same crutch is responsible for all of the elemental+ gear that exists in the game.  Warriors went defensive in order for guilds to initially win Bertox, or RZ or fill in the blank.  Those early days may be past... and others may be able to tank those encounters now without defensive... I know we don't typically use defensive on most of those anymore but at one time we had to.  Defensive/evasive/stonewall is our primary and ONLY tool.  We have no heals to use during combat, we can't lifetap ... etc etc and done to death.  <br />
<br />
Are pallys broken... no.  Are warriors broken... no.  Are SKs broken... no bloody clue.  Was the boss mob encounter in tipt broken...YES... was it in ikkinz?  YES.  <br />
<br />
Class balance is measured by 2 things.  Desireability in groups and and raids.  Not in pure tanking power.  Pallys particularly lost a bit and warriors gained (which was good because it was skewed) during the changes that brought incite around.  By that definition those two encounters were screwed up and needed to addressed on the Knights side.  <br />
<br />
This &quot;fix&quot; to it simply sets a dangerous precedent on how to balance future content.  <br />
<br />
Now let me clarify something here.  If they had chosen to give you a self cast vie type spell to assist you in these encounters I would have gone cool... they got something neat.  I will be happy everytime the paladan class gets something good.  .  I will be unhappy when something gets nerfed.  If your upcomming stuns get nerfed to uselessness that will not please me.    It takes away from your class defining role.  My class defining role is 3 minutes of glory every 10 mins that I use maybe 2x a night.  My ability is to stand there better than a superior equiped knight and survive.  That's what I do.  That's what a warrior is.  That is not what a paladan or SK is.  <br />
<br />
I don't think anyone that is passionate about their class is an &quot;evil Paladan&quot; or an &quot;Evil Warrior&quot;.  You are just passionate about what you want to see your class become.  Right wrong or indifferent, defensive was, is and will be the class defining trait of warriors.  The encounters that outfit guilds from Vindi on up were tuned for the use of defensive and CH rotations.  Complaining that it's a crutch is, in my opinion, not looking at the game in it's correct historical content.  Every piece of armor that anyone wears that comes off a mob that required defensive originally is a testimony to it's requirement for raids in general and warriors in specific.  Most of the rest of the equipment falls into the class that once you had the base stuff you could get better without defensive.  A strong case could be made that with the current mob encounters in the game, without defensive no one would have ever beaten AoW let alone be where they are today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defensive isn't a crutch any more than a spellbook is.  Defensive is a class defining ability.  Enraging blow weapons and anger aug's are a crutch, always were, always will be.  Both of these statements have been made, not by warriors, but by SoE.  Guess what I am if I don't have defensive for the big fights....I'm a knight with -1DI and no spells, no lay hands, and no harm touch.  Oh, and these mighty disciplines we can chain endlessly to lay waste to the countryside, well they're not all on the same timer anymore, but big groups of them are, so once I chain furious and defensive I can't do it again for about 40 minutes because furious/fortitude have a seriously long refresh timer.  <br />
Also, as has been stated previously, not having all the utility and security that a knight brings to a group is the tradeoff for knowing your tank will have defensive if he needs it.  If you don't have the security of defensive for the boss mob, why bother with the warrior at all?  In the other 98% of the trial he sucks compared to a knight, especially a paladin.  And if you say &quot;but you can still use defensive for the rest of the trial&quot; you're just completely full of shit.  I can count the number of times I've used defensive in single group content for a random trash mob on the fingers of one foot.<br />
<br />
This nerf, and that is precisely what it is, sets a terrible precedent for future content tuning.  The funniest thing is that it was a change made, once again, at the expense of the knights spellbook.  Why?  Because it's easier to nerf us than it is to retune your spellbook.  Of course, once OoW is released you may get that too. How well will tanks be balanced then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya know BB this is why you were banned from PoN boards. Cause you're a complete jackass and everything you say is complete bullshit or so skewed that it hardly resembles the truth. Let's look at this quote real quick:<br />
<br />
High-end Knights can MT PoTime - Who gives a flying fuck? Rangers, BL's, Rogues, Wizards, Enchanters or whoever the hell else wants to give it a whirl can MT it as well.<br />
<br />
sucessfully do acknowledged level 70 content - How many knights were doing this acknowledged level 70 content before it was retuned? Knights were straight getting their asses handed to them before this shit was toned down. Warriors were continuing on with business as usual.<br />
<br />
Paladins will be getting a revitalized stun line in OoW - And mobs will also be higher level in OoW. Bosses will still be flagged stun immune. Are you really bitter that we will be able to stun trash mobs in old content that has been retuned for level 65 when we are level 70? Grow the fuck up.<br />
<br />
and some Knights still aren't satisfied - they want the Warrior defining class ability removed, shared, or neutralized. - You never will get it will you. No matter how many times it's said. We want content that fucking works. We don't care how, we don't care if it is a lesser version of defensive or whatever else. You are the one that wants complete and total supremacy. You are the one that wants warriors to be so superior that knights aren't even an option. And you can shovel your shit all you want but I think even a majority of your fellow warriors know that you are completely and totally full of shit. You are the Seventhsword/Soledragondead of the warrior community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
High-end Knights can MT PoTime - it's really hard to argue with the truth isn't it. How gimp could Knights be (or anyother class) when the chief claim to fame Warriors have - unmatchable survival vs. the most brutal mobs can be duplicated by every one? That's how broken Defensive is, after the content is mastered and players gear up in the very same expansion, Defensive isn't even needed at all!<br />
<br />
You might not like the truth sir, but this plus proving that Warriors only had an innate ~386HP advantage over Paladins after AoTC was sufficient for SoE to act - with the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change and the Sturdyness AA ability. Case closed, you don't know what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
sucessfully do acknowledged level 70 content - How many? I attempted to go through Magelos and find out. It was literally hundreds. Most posters on PoN displaying the evidence of having compled trails visable on their Magelos said they were dragged through the zones unconcious and unable to help.<br />
<br />
Paladins will be getting a revitalized stun line in OoW - and &quot;stun mitigation&quot; will assure Paladins of absolute capability of add tanking and offtanking the non-boss mobs which are by and large not stun immune. Yes, bosses will be stun immune, but concidering most bosses are a Warrior concern, I'm unclear why you would care or mention it.<br />
<br />
and some Knights still aren't satisfied - they want the Warrior defining class ability removed, shared, or neutralized. - <br />
You never will get it will you.<br />
Actually, y'all are the ones that never will get it. Defensive is a Warrior defining ability that won't be shared. Understand it?<br />
<br />
Paladins should be outraged that they are getting Baby Trials and are competing with crippled Warriors in one group content. But they are not. You said it, not me:<br />
We don't care how, we don't care if it is a lesser version of defensive or whatever else.<br />
And that's the problem. You don't care if it's removing, sharing, or neutralizing the Warrior defining class ability. Screw Warriors, the game, or balance. As long as we get what we want, &quot;We don't care how...&quot;.<br />
<br />
And that's why I was banned on PoN. I told the truth as I saw it and revealed a whole lot of hipocracy and god-mode driven &quot;balance&quot; suggestions.<br />
<br />
I suggested revising Knight spellbooks to insure they had the tools needed.<br />
I supported giving Knights &quot;-1 DI&quot; and Warriors &quot;-2DI&quot;<br />
I suggested revising content so it didn't favor Warirors too much.<br />
Then and only then did I recommend taking a look at Weapon Shield to fill any short term emergency need.<br />
<br />
And I was severly chastized and ultimately banned. I opposed Knight Defensive or defensive by another means. I supported Flash Heals, BoV,etc. OMG BAN HIM!!<br />
You are the one that wants complete and total supremacy. You are the one that wants warriors to be so superior that knights aren't even an option.<br />
The vast majority of Knights are not and never have been an option since level 51. The truth is, that you do want to have Tank Parity (and Spellbook Superiority) so you can be an option. But even in hard (for Warriors) one-group content SoE has to gimp the mobs and cripple Warriors so under-geared Knights can succeed. Grats for being an option.<br />
<br />
Let's be a little honest chief. They could turn my endurance to 0 and hold it there and you Tuldail (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=224563) would not be able to tank like me. It just isn't possible. On the other hand, I can't buff, heal, Res, root, GRC, etc, etc, worth a lick.<br />
<br />
Better ask the boss mobs to be undead and Wariors to weild Bronze Scimitars.<br />

Did furious with vdd for good ripposts( augmented w/anger3)and got a few procs, then switched to normal setub Dbow and arage both a3'ed, and like Raaj said, it seem that i get aggro, then next tick i loose it to the one next on list or so in group. So was pretty close fight, even tho im way better geared than last time, it seemed as hard, and my aggro was way worse. <br />
(cuz of this we did wipe on the first try, clr died early cuz sl on inc, but druid died later aswell due to the fact that i couldnt hold aggro off him when the next tick came)<br />
Il take my chances without def there next time without doubt, hope they dont add this to more than these mobs atleast, would really take away one of our class abilities.</div></div><hr />

The fact that these bosses are now slowable makes the mobs easier to kill for Knights, who previously had practically zero chance to win.<br />
<br />
One of the encounters changed was necessary to progression.  Knights should be able to effectively win just as much as a warrior.<br />
<br />
The others changed were major exp/loot spots for a GoD group.  Like it or not, Knights are entitled a shot at a Prayer Ring, too.  Boo Hoo for BB who wants it to be different.<br />

What the hell is everybody whining about?  Warriors will still get invited to these groups over an equally geared paladin enough to warrent balance.  If you don't like it, tough -- welcome to a more balanced game (tanking parity and spell book superiority my ass)</div></div><hr />

Their &quot;stun mitigation&quot; will work on every stunable mob up to the boss mob. This will be a whole lot more than &quot;-1 DI&quot;. SoE could flag all the mobs stun immune and level the playing field, but they won't.<br />
---------<br />
I really think after all the sturm and drang, SoE took the easy way out with these trials.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't occur to me to want SU/Holyforge be turned off in MM Hard LDoN just because it's one group content. A class defining ability is a class defining ability.<br />
<br />
But, SoE needs to move on and fix the many other bugs and oversights in GoD and somehow convince customers after experiancing GoD they want to see OoW.<br />
<br />
If this change makes Knights happy, that's all that matters.<br />
<br />
I will say that I hope SoE never ever again puts non-trivial one-group instanced content in the game. Apparently making it an equal challange to Warriors and Knights, unlike any other content in the game, is now a &quot;requirement&quot; and beyond their abilty to handle without negating class defining abilities.<br />

If it is possible to substantially increase your AC and HP's and that would make the content possible, then it's incumbent on you to &quot;gear up&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, I have heard that some of the yardtrash is hitting harder (I don't know this for sure). IF you become aware of 9k Knights successfully doing this content, then it MAY be an indication of an inbalance that you might want to email SoE about.<br />
<br />
Short answer - you should to be able to do the yardtrash IMO. If not, it's really not a biggie. You've got a whole bunch of other content to do and some of it will increase your AC/HP.<br />

That would mean we would be needing 25% worth of damage reduction from a haste tap, so a 25% slow.  Now for that to have any impact it would have to stack with other classes slows (afterall stuns stack with it, and every group has a slower since every class that can haste can also slow), thus we would be reducing mob dps by quite an additional amount just about everywhere and slows are already too strong.  In addition to that for the &quot;tap&quot; portion to be any good it would have to be v3 stacking.  SK's really don't need to be more bardlike, sadly it's almost the type of thing we need at this point to keep pace with Paladins (well maybe not quite that much slowing since it would be giving haste too, but we need something that lowers dps intake not overall dps by decreasing it's lifespan).</div></div><hr />

How gimp could Knights be (or anyother class) when the chief claim to fame Warriors have - unmatchable survival vs. the most brutal mobs can be duplicated by every one? That's how broken Defensive is, after the content is mastered and players gear up in the very same expansion, Defensive isn't even needed at all!<br />
<br />
Here you go again taking bits and pieces of what is said, then twisting it and skewing it. As I originally said Enchanters, Shamans and whoever the hell else wants to MT time can do it. It's been done. Time has been completely trivialized by high end guilds.<br />
<br />
You might not like the truth sir, but this plus proving that Warriors only had an innate ~386HP advantage over Paladins after AoTC was sufficient for SoE to act - with the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change and the Sturdyness AA ability. Case closed, you don't know what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
Excuse me but where in my post did I say a fucking word about the -1 DI change or Sturdyness? I didn't. And to be honest I think Sturdyness was overpriced as was every other GoD AA ability. <br />
<br />
Paladins will be getting a revitalized stun line in OoW - and &quot;stun mitigation&quot; will assure Paladins of absolute capability of add tanking and offtanking the non-boss mobs which are by and large not stun immune. Yes, bosses will be stun immune, but concidering most bosses are a Warrior concern, I'm unclear why you would care or mention it.<br />
<br />
I mentioned it cause your retarded ass has done nothing but bitch and whine about it for the last 9 pages. You and Frodolin both. Whaaaa paladins are gonna be able to stun level 70 mobs making old content easier. WHO FUCKING CARES? Every other spell casting class is gonna get new spells that will trivialize old content too? Other classes will get stuns that work on level 70 mobs as well, so why do you continue to bitch about it?<br />
<br />
Paladins should be outraged that they are getting Baby Trials and are competing with crippled Warriors in one group content. But they are not. You said it, not me:<br />
<br />
Baby trials? We will have the exact same trails as warriors. You can say whatever the hell you want, but it was warriors who were screaming that it was content that needed to be fixed not classes. You nerfed your own damn self.<br />
<br />
And that's the problem. You don't care if it's removing, sharing, or neutralizing the Warrior defining class ability. Screw Warriors, the game, or balance. As long as we get what we want, &quot;We don't care how...&quot;.<br />
<br />
You're right I don't care. As long as single group content is balanced so that it is challenging for anyone who is of the level of the content then so be it. <br />
<br />
And that's why I was banned on PoN. I told the truth as I saw it and revealed a whole lot of hipocracy and god-mode driven &quot;balance&quot; suggestions.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't know truth if it smacked you upside the head. Or maybe you've just been lying to yourself for so long now that you actually believe this bullshit you spew. <br />
<br />
The vast majority of Knights are not and never have been an option since level 51. The truth is, that you do want to have Tank Parity (and Spellbook Superiority) so you can be an option. But even in hard (for Warriors) one-group content SoE has to gimp the mobs and cripple Warriors so under-geared Knights can succeed. Grats for being an option.<br />
<br />
That is such bullshit. If knights could make up for their tanking deficiencies through their spellbook then there would be no complaints. I have never seen a single knight ask for tank parity, and neither have you, cause it hasn't happened. And the only ones this so called gimping is gonna cripple is undergeared warriors who were doing content way above their level. The changes to GoD have made even MORE mobs unstunnable, so how does this let undergeared knights succeed? <br />
<br />
Let's be a little honest chief. They could turn my endurance to 0 and hold it there and you Tuldail (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=224563) would not be able to tank like me. It just isn't possible. On the other hand, I can't buff, heal, Res, root, GRC, etc, etc, worth a lick.<br />
<br />
You're right cheif. I would tank better. Cause with 0 endurance you wouldn't be able to hold aggro, and your group would be fucked. At least thats the way it was before endurace right? Or was all your aggro problems bullshit like pretty much everything else you say?</div></div><hr />

I was going to let your insulting post stand unanswered, but........<br />
<br />
I note that you are pretty harsh yourself when someone disagrees with you.<br />
<br />
Contrary to what has been posted on PoN:<br />
Knights do not &quot;deserve&quot; Defensive because Warriors got the Provoke line.<br />
<br />
Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability that should not be shared.<br />
<br />
There should not be 3 equal tanks with Warriors getting Beserker-like &quot;utility&quot;. Like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Pallys and SK's.<br />
<br />
Knight's do not need to be made into Warriors with Spellbooks, GoD content needs to be adjusted.<br />
<br />
I am glad you didn't accept Gilfalas defending Soledragondead - everyone knows the truth. Some just don't the truth sway them.<br />
<br />
I'm glad that we all agree future spells might make Knight Defensive way too powerful.<br />
<br />
But, you needn't just flame Warriors. There are plenty of idiotic posts on PoN. Sure, call a spade a spade and you'll get banned. But sometimes when they post things that are obviously wrong they need to be called on it even if it means being banned.<br />
<br />
A goodly portion of GoD was designed for level 70's. The campaigns for Defensive and Tank Parity (and Spellbook superiority) were demonstrably bullcrap.<br />
<br />
Gilfalas basicly let me know that I was banned for being too contentious (argumentative) . But your prick comment reminded me that I was once told that I did not tolerate fools well and should either learn to do so or avoid them. I think maybe Gil did me a favor :D.<br />
<br />
Eventually I think you'll move all the way over to my long held and oft repeated position -<br />
Since as a &quot;cost&quot; of having spellbooks Knights lost some tanking and DPS, spells and mana should restore as much of these capabilities as SoE allows.<br />
<br />
Paladin heals and SK Lifetaps should stay in step with how hard mobs hit.<br />
<br />
Knights should get &quot;-1 DI&quot; and Wariors &quot;-2 DI&quot; top differential plate tanks from other classes.<br />
<br />
Some raid boss mobs should exist in every expansion that are not Warrior preferred.<br />
<br />
While innovation and surprises are nice, content should generally be in keeping with established raid roles and should not make classes disfunctional.<br />

The planned stuns for OoW are beyond retarded into a whole new level of unreached stupidity.  Hadn't Sony recently decided that to be balanced correctly against other tanks, warriors needed a -1 to DI?  Yes.  And that was long after PoP was out and high end knights were already fighting a lot of mobs that were immune to most or all of their stuns.  The devs still felt that the tanking was too close.  So why would they then go add spells that make the paladin a much, much better tank?  The &quot;we get stunned too so we can't cast stuns when we're stunned&quot; defense is laughable.  Like you spend a large portion of your time in a fight being stunned.  It's every now and then.  Big deal.  So the mob might get a few attacks in on you.  /gasp. <br />
<br />
Currently an equally geared paladin tanks mobs that he can stun effectively FAR better than I do.  It's not close at all.  The paladin owns them.  If they get anything even approaching that type of stun ability that's effective on up to L70 mobs, or even chain stunning L65s, I might as well quit.  Warriors will be back to the tank you pull out when you need the raid mob killed (unless they make the damn raid mob ignore defensive, oh, and many pre GoD raid mobs are only L70, so will knights be stunning them too?).  Exp groups will be dominated by the superior tank, the paladin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wtf is this?  I thought Sony had acknowledged that they'd set the bar too high on much of the GoD content and it was being made EASIER.  Mob attack levels were being reduced.  So why the hell would a PRE KOD'TAZ trial be made harder?  The devs must be totally fucking retarded.</div></div><hr />

Cause with 0 endurance you wouldn't be able to hold aggro, and your group would be fucked.<br />
You would realize by looking at my Magelo no PoTime Warrior has major problems holding aggro even without the Provoke line. High level raiders practice aggro control.<br />
<br />
Everyone pretty much acknowleged non-high level Warriors had aggro control problems because outside of raids players stopped waiting for Warriors to establish aggro. With Knights they didn't have to. SoE investigated and fixed it.<br />
<br />
BTW, Paladins have very few Warrior advocates as knowledgable and articulate as Frodlin.<br />
----------<br />
Callon,<br />
We have conflicting information on this stuff. Prolly should wait until someone has the opprotunity to do some parses.<br />

What's glopped up is that SoE has touched this stuff several times. The current fix MAY turn out all right, but nobody in their right mind would contend that these trials have been indicative of good game design - from release all the way to the present.<br />

Why not quote the very next part following the part you quoted above? Maybe then you'd see how fucking stupid you made yourself look by agreeing with him. *shakes head*<br />
<br />
This change is good. It makes ac fucking matter. Most of the yard trash is unstunnable, getting rid of that paladin advantage. The boss is an issue of having the ac/hp and shit to deal with it.<br />
<br />
All this does is let paladins that should have been able to tank it (PoT+), tank it with some degree of reliability, and prevent the warriors that shouldn't have been able to tank it from tanking it and make them gear up to the PoTime level of equipment first.<br />
<br />
Though to be honest its too fucking late at this point. The real people fucked are those medium sized elemental or less level guilds with half their member base flagged and the other half with little to no chance at getting flagged. Don't be suprised to see some of those guilds crack when chunks of their membership deguild and move on up that might not have otherwise =P</div></div><hr />

10k+ hp, 1k8 ac buffed<br />
i've done Tipt trial successfully a few weeks ago.<br />
went into Tipt today to help friends getting flagged, and couldn't even make it to the cragbeast queen, dieing on the trash mobs near zone in ..<br />
even when mezing on inc, slowing and then engaging it, cleric still couln't keep me alive.<br />
<br />
So my question : am i undergeared (early elemental) or am i just f'd up by the last patch ?<br />
thx<br />
<br />
Bargran: I'm 8.2k, 1400 buffed and hit Vxed for kicks the day of the patch. We were able to engage and kill stuff quite successfully although I eventually ran my ft7 cleric out of mana and died. We had no enchanter, so I had to engage unslowed. I've had roughly the same experience in Tipt. <br />
<br />
Given you're WAY beefier than I am, methinks you need a better cleric. Have them hit you with SE before the pull, keep DI on, and start the first CH way early and you should stay up with no trouble. My cleric on this run wasn't doing any of this stuff and I stayed up pretty consistently with some help from the shammy.<br />

I'm not convinced the trash got any harder.</div></div><hr />

That sounds brutal. Make him get UD3 keep DI up all the time. Put on a cha buff. I'll have to go back to tipt and see if my experience is different post-patch, since it wasn't much worse than vxed the previous time I was there.  <br />
<br />
Honestly I can't imagine how it can have been beefed up so much that it would chew through your 10k fast than I was getting my 8k chewed through before the patch. Did you have any backup heals? They help a lot with evening out the spikes between CH's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I have always done mobs while undergeared - that's what Warriors do for three minutes. Knights &quot;gear up&quot; and eventually are capable. Warriors, thanks to Defensive, do it by the skin of their teeth when not yet &quot;geared up&quot; and gear up after which eventually makes it easier.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
You actually use this as a defense?  /boggle<br />
<br />
You still don't seem to understand that these are ONE-GROUP events.  You might have a point with raid level content, but certainly NOT with ONE-GROUP encounters.  Furthermore, the content should be designed so that gear from the immediately previous content will be sufficient to get you by it.  I fail to see why it would be unreasonable to expect a warrior to be Time-equipped to be able to tank a single-group Mob X, while a knight should be fully Time-equipped for it and still not be able to do it reliably.<br />
<br />
Defensive simply should not be a crutch for one-group content.  No tank class should be locked out of one-group content becuause of a poorly implemented ability.  They designed those crazy DPS single-grouped mobs around your class-defining ability, which was originally designed as a RAID-LEVEL ability.  Then, some exceptionially geared knight manages to tank it 1 time out of 4, using obscene levels of healing, and you think all is well?<br />
<br />
In a raid, things are different.  You can't effectively &quot;gear up&quot; the main tank with previous content to tank the new bosses without the use of defensive.  Defensive is, in some ways, a nice thing because it does seperate warriors as raid MTs and it also lets the devs make the game challenging for raids.  We all know that the tanking differences between warriors and knights isn't huge once defensive is factored out.  There *IS*  a tanking difference in most situations (and yes, with Pally stuns it can tilt it in their favor unfairly in too many situations already).  But I'm really tired of warriors thinking that they should have a complete and total lock on the the tanking role in both raid and single-group encounters.  The difference between a warrior and a knight in single-group tanking should not be near as big as the difference between a knight and a non-tank class, but that is clearly not the case currently.<br />
<br />
Why is it that whenever a knight simply requests that we be able to be effective in our single-most important role (single-group tank) that half the warriors in the known universe interpret this as us wanting to be gods and have everything, including their MT spot.  The last time I checked, most of the warriors in my guild spend 80% of their online time RAIDING.  Exp-grouping is largely done before or after raids for the purpose of earning AAs and such.  When warriors had legitimate concerns about not being able to participate equally in single-group exp grinds, they were answered.  I don't have a single problem sharing the single-group tank spot with warriors.  But some warriors definitely have a problem with me sharing the single-group tank spot withi them, apparently.<br />
<br />
And quit bringing utility into this battle so haphazardly.  Paladins and SKs are different.  SKs get no stun or any other ability to mitigate damage any better than a ranger.  We're more screwed than most, but even trying to claim that a Paladin's use as a backup rezzer will somehow earn him a spot in a single-group trial that he can't tank is a joke.  If it were true, then how come so many Paladins are complaining that they can't get any groups in these trials.  You say it's because they're undergeared or just suck.  But at the same time, the undergeared warrior is happily invited to the same group.  There simply is not room in most single-group encounters for a backup rezzer.  Sure, it's nice to have one, but if you really want a backup rezzer, grab a necro.  They are FAR more reliable as a backup rezzer (due to FD), and they have FAR superiour DPS to a Pally.  The bottom line is that if a knight can't tank in a single-group at the end of the day, he has virtually no purpose being there.  How is this any different than a warrior?  If you aren't tanking, you're value drops off greatly.  If I'm not tanking, my value decreases greatly as well.  Maybe not as much as yours, but you're a better tank to compensate for that already.  My greater DPS as an SK is a) largely a myth and b) insigificant compared to your tanking ability.  Likewise, in a fight against a nasty trial boss that, out of necessity, must be over within 2 minutes, my ability to tap 100 mana and 200 HP back for the group is completely irrelevent.  It won't even amount to one extra SL or NI during that time.  Pulling?  Please.  The last time I pulled in GoD was yard trash in Qinimi.  I don't pull in GoD.  I'm last on the list of go-to-classes when it comes to pulling in GoD.  But I can invis...and sit at the zone in because all the trash that sees invis in the zone.  Oh, but I can DIAMONDSKIN!  There you have it.  The mother of all SK abilities.  Long cast time and consumes a peridot, all for a 400 point rune that will keep me alive 0.1 seconds longer against the trial bosses.  My utility is not irrelevent in the game.  There are tons of places where it is very useful.  GoD single-group trials are not where it's used, unless you consider DA training 30 mobs in Tipt so that I can save my group some time clearing to the first trial.  But then...I just FD somewhere and box a cleric from that point on usually.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, gear SHOULD MATTER a whole lot more than it does in this game, especially when it comes to tanking.  Too much has been introduced in EQ that relies on spells or abilities from 5 expansions ago.  We ALL have our crutches.  Paladins and SKs use level 9/15 stuns and fears for aggro.  Clerics use a level 34 CH spell.  Warriors use defensive in single-group encounters.  If they made gear matter MORE, instead of relying on gimmicks, then it would free them up to actually seperate the classes by their gear more.  For example, warriors could have an even larger HP/AC gap between them and knights in order to offset the spellbook of a hybrid.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself this question.  How much better would a 6k warrior (without using defensive) tank compared to a 4k knight against exp mobs back in the Velious era?  With mobs that hit for 150ish max, that extra 2k actually could amount to a lot of difference in healing.  Likewise, how much better would a 12k (non-defensive) warrior tank against exp trash in GoD compared to an 8k knight?  That's the same HP ratio.  Yes, the mobs hit harder, but the 4k difference would probably make a big difference in healing required.  Yes, I know that the actual HP differences between knights and warriors have been much smaller than that.  What I'm asking is what it would be like *IF* that were the case.<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, the more I conclude that AC is where the difference should be, so that they can finally remove CH as a factor.  With CH, hitpoints is all that matters.  And CH itself is a gimp crutch in the game.  Remove CH, and you remove the advantage a warrior has over a knight when it comes to healing, can we agree?  To offset that, make AC mean a whole lot more, and increase the AC gap between the tanks, as well as between the tank and non-tank classes.  That is where they went wrong!  Imagine if warriors had an even bigger AC advantage over knights.  They would mitigate better, provided AC was made to mean something at any given point in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like your idea's for the most part. Making AC matter more would be great. I think thats one of the think BB is advocating heavily for, in the form of a -1 DI for knights and -2 DI for warriors. <br />
<br />
I also agree that having sub level 50 spells that are still used in combat (as opposed to stuff like see invis) is pretty ludicrous.<br />
<br />
My concern's with utility revolve around the fact that that utility makes life easier for knights in general, even though it may not have much bearing on the actual GoD trials. I've got a big chip on my shoulder from having to run places naked to get my corpse back, trying to find a rezzer, not being able to split mobs, and being completely unable to solo.<br />
<br />
I feel like defensive is all I've got in exchange for that, and though I'd prefer things to be different I cling to it because it IS all I have.</div></div><hr />

Let's agree that in one group trials no one class should be required. Warriors shouldn't be required to tank and Clerics shouldn't be required to heal. So now that a Paladins MT/Druid MH or SK/Shaman MH group can do the trials they are trivial. Oh, you mean only Warriors can't be prefered. Any other class being preferred is ok. The argument is silly - it's selectively applied.<br />
<br />
OK, let's say anything a Warrior can tank in a single group trial and Knight should be able to tank. Not true sir. The need to eliminate the usefullness of Defensive in these trials proves this thesis false.<br />
<br />
OK, let's say the pupose of a trial is to provide a meaningful test of preparedness for reasonably well-constructed group to take on the content beyond it. Can't argue with that. BUT it requires auto-selection of difficulty - the proposed fix rejected by Knights and called Baby Trials. And why sir were they called Baby Trials? Because it was assumed the boss mob would be EASIER in the trials Knights tanked. They insisted it should be the same for any group and that's the problem.<br />
<br />
Ya see, it's very dificult to arrange a trial were only the tanking of the boss mob equally by all three plate ranks is concidered a test of it's fairness. Frankly, it's probably hard to do.<br />
<br />
IF SoE wasn't lazy then the mobs on the way to the Boss mob would be a challange with a Warior tanking (mobs running when at low HP's, casting for much of their damage, gating), less for a Knight tanking and in combination with the boss mob would pose a variety of challanges sufficient to test any group.<br />
<br />
BUT, we aren't testing if a Knight can tank a boss mob like a Warrior. We are testing if a GROUP can't meet the challanges found in a trial and surmount them - with a Wariror, SK, or Paladin MTing.<br />
<br />
Don't be claiming a Knight's spellbook is useless in raids and useless in groups. That's just plain not credible. IF it is the case, let's petition SoE to make all Knights into Warriors right now - spellbooks have no significance.<br />
<br />
These are not short PoJ trials nor a test of which class best MT's a tough mob. They are 2-3 hour tests of a group's entitlement to move on to more difficult content.<br />
<br />
It seems many Knights don't get it at all and neither does SoE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahsam</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not going to argue that my spellbook is useless.  Probably one of my best &quot;utility&quot; spells is Bobbing Corpse.  I remember when I hit level 55.  It was by far the spell I had looked forward to the most for all of my levels.  Is it necessarY?  Hardly.  It does help with pulling, but with SoE available, it's a nice convenience and nothing more.  Likewise, my horse AA is a nice convenience that lets me get around faster when a bard or druid/ranger isn't in the group.  And my invis can come in handy every once in a while.  But my invis spell has been made 99% useless by a Circlet of Shadow, which is far superior to it in every way.<br />
<br />
Now compare that to lev and invis potions for warriors.  These potions don't increase your utility value one whit.  They don't make you desireable in a group.  They are simply a nice convenience for you as a warrior so that you don't have to depend another for those buffs.  No, they are NOT as useful as my spells, and I make no such claim.  But they are useful.  If they weren't, warriors wouldn't be running around with them.<br />
<br />
My point is that a very large part of my spellbook can be replicated via items that are usuable my many classes.  The value of many of my spells is nothing more than convenience.  And this carries over to the clicky items used by you guys as well.  They hardly change your value.  They are simply convenience.  You have to go to a bank to grab a few things after a death.  I have to mem some spells.  Yes, I have the advantage, but it's not really game-altering.<br />
<br />
I will say this, however.  I think what we are witnessing both in EQ and in newer RPG games being developed is a simple truth.  NOBODY is happy having only ONE or TWO abilities.  Frankly, when I looked at the warrior class, I was turned off by the fact that they were so incredibly reliant on others, especially early on.  I think most warriors, when honest, will admit that they, like you, Bardeil, get sick of having to ask for an invis or lev after 5 years of game play.  I would find it incredibly frustrating to not have any ability outside of a 3-minute discipline.  Why do you think that other games are using completely different progression models than the &quot;pick a class and hope you like it&quot; approach that EverQuest took.  Even EQ2 will be different.  If you want to be a shadow knight in EQ2, you will first become a warrior!  That is a very telling change and should explain exactly what we are.  In EQ2, we will be warriors that have focused on the dark magics.  And yes, it will come with a cost.  The current warrior class will not exist in EQ2.  You will become an even better specialist at taking damage, but there will be other skillsets introduced to make your class fun to play.<br />
<br />
The great truth for the day:  there is no such thing as a pure class because people don't want a PURE class.  They are fun for a while, but quickly grow boring.  What remains is the question as to just how diverse your skillset will be.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity, has anyone ever noticed that in many RPG type games, the PALADIN is the absolute best at taking damage?  The warrior in EQ has to be the best, because they kinda suck at most other things.  But the problem never was that they had to be the best.  The problem was that they sucked at pretty much everything else.  Warriors should be awesome at DPS, whether in a tanking role or not.  They should have other warrior abilities that are in line with what a warrior would do, but the devs didn't really start thinking about that until late in the game.<br />
<br />
Finally, I don't really care how my ability to tank is done.  Many warriors keep suggesting improvements to our spell lineup.  Okay, fine.  But admit to me something.  Am *I* not a better expert on what my spells do than you?  Am *I* not a better judge on the resist and interrupt/fizzle rates?  You want to let me tank better via a Vie like spell?  Fine?  But how does that ultimately differ from defensive?  If the end result is that I end up mitigating 25-35% better for a short duration (say 2-3 minutes), it will encroach upon you no matter what.  Yes, making it a mana-based spell would be good from a role-playing perspective, but the end result would be the same.  You would still claim that I will threaten your raid role with it.  I'm just confused by such a suggestion.</div></div><hr />

Doubtless they will be games in the future where plays buy and forget skills as they progress. Study in order to cast spells but lose physical conditioning. They may not even have classes as such.<br />

<br />
I think something you're missing is that many warriors chose to be warriors because they had a narrow skillset. They LIKE being narrowly define, but the best. When defensive gets nerfed, we get REAL unhappy because we bargained to be the best at tanking (and fighting, or so I thought), and don't get much else.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to see a big boost to our innate mitigation and/or ac bonus and/or or hp bonus. I'd really also like to see a boost to our DPS, at least when non tanking. Given that we have no utility, I don't see much reason why we shouldn't be barely short of a monk, rogue or ranger for DPS output. The thread in the library puts us pretty close, but I have to say I get BADLY outdamaged by monks and rogs every time I turn on my parser, personally. Rangers, otoh... <br />
<br />
At that point, killing defensive or nerfing it on some encounters is fine with me, but at this point without any other significant advantages, warriors really do suck when defensive is factored out.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I see.  So warriors and knights should be at the same gear level to be able to survive a trial, meaning warriors and knights should tank equally well.  Okay, give me your spellbook then.   Thanks.</div></div><hr />

This change didn't make it easier for knights to tank this content.  You aren't anymore or less able to tank it than you were before tuesday.  It just made it more difficult for warriors to tank it.  It just guaranteed the chanter a spot in the group for the pet to tank the boss mob.<br />
<br />
No one gained (cept the chanters) a damn thing from this.  What you have now are two encounters where folks were getting through that will be huge bottlenecks now.<br />
<br />
The exact wrong approach was used.  Knights you haven't been enabled in the content.  If you are undergeared you are still not going to be picked.  Warriors are brought down to that same level now.  So guess what?.. WE ALL SUCK NOW.  The sad thing on all of this... the folks trying to get through this content are the ones that have bitched the most cause it was too hard.  Now it will be even longer until you progress through it cause it will take much higher geared warriors to get through it or even higher geared pal/sks.<br />
<br />
They needed to throw you a bone to allow you to get through those trials.  The trials bosses were badly designed.  What needed to happen was something to pull you up to do those mobs...not something to pull the warriors down.<br />
<br />
Yeah it sucks that these encounters were designed with a level 70 cap and we're doing them at 65.   With the retunes it's even fair to say that tipt is probably an elemental level encounter, time gear shouldn't be required.  Don't know about ikkinz haven't made it there yet.<br />
<br />
So for the few knights that are celebrating stop... you are just as screwed as the warriors are.  For the warriors... they knights did need something to compensate for badly designed content.  For SoE... Bad call guys.  You didn't fix the content.  You didn't help the users... you screwed us all this time.  Back it out and try again.</div></div><hr />

For God's sake, I don't see what the problem is with that.  I find it distressing that a number of warriors actaully defend the position that a warrior in sub-par gear should be able to out-tank a knight in Time+ gear.   If you're a warrior with 1600 AC, you have no business in the Ikkinz trials any more than a knight with only 1600 AC.<br />
<br />
BB:<br />
<br />
I made my tradeoffs. You made yours. <br />
<br />
I really wish you would quit using the opening blurb on the character select screen to defend your position.  The fact is, you didn't know what you were doing when you clicked create any more than I did, at least not with your very first EQ character.  I created a Shadow Knight from the outset because what little information I could find advertised it as a dark knight.  And in every RPG game I've ever played, the term &quot;knight&quot; refers to a warrior-type class that wears very tough plate armor and wields a mean ass SWORD, often with a shield.  That was my image of a knight when I created my character, I pretty much got what I expected.  The game evolves, friend.  Get over it.  By your argument above, you should still suck at aggro generation, since that was originally supposed to be a weakness of your class.  You made your tradeoffs...and then asked for them to be removed.<br />
<br />
And Callon:<br />
<br />
Oh, I see. So warriors and knights should be at the same gear level to be able to survive a trial, meaning warriors and knights should tank equally well. Okay, give me your spellbook then. Thanks.<br />
<br />
If the game were designed correctly, then this would be a moot issue.  A knight in the same level of gear as a warrior (meaning that it was obtained from the same general content in the game, such as PoTime) should have fewer HP and AC than warrior gear.  The fact that the devs have horribly screwed that up by making so much all/all and multi-class gear does not change the way it SHOULD be.   As such, an equivalently geared warrior and knight should NOT tank equally, as the gear should provide the tanking difference.  And I'm not even opposed to slight differences in abilities, such as defensive skillsets.<br />
<br />
If this were only about raid bosses, I could care less, as could 98% of the other knights out there.  But it doesn't really seem to matter how loudly we scream that we don't want your raid MT role, you still think we do and that this is some subtle conspiracy to take your raid MT role.  It's about single groups and offtanking.  Period!  And while warriors may think it's perfectly acceptable to have a &quot;handful&quot; of mobs in the game that are 1-group tankable by them and no others, knights completely disagree, as it contradicts our own vision of the game that has been carved out over 5+ years now.  The fact is, that &quot;handful&quot; has always been a lot bigger than what some warriors like to represent, and they haven't been nearly as &quot;doable&quot; by knights as they have claimed.  I refuse to accept 1 success out of 10 attempts where a knight succeeded as evidence that all is working as intended.  At least be honest and admit that you don't want knights tanking these until they are trivial.  Of course, what would be the point then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they tuned it so knight can win as easily as some of the posts after yours indicate (with significant nerf in mob DPS)  theres then whether or not warriors got to keep defensive or not is irrelevant to the problem of knights being able to tank the encounter or not.<br />
<br />
As for the comment about a sub par warrior being able to outtank a time+ geared knight... there was a post in this thread earlier that I'm going to modify just slightly:<br />
<br />
What a time+ warrior can do with a druid, a time+ knight or high elemental warrior should be able to do with a cleric, a high elemental knight or low elemental warrior should be able to do with two healers.<br />
<br />
What a time+ warrior can do with a cleric, a time+ knight or high elemental warrior should need two healers.  A high elemental knight or low elemental warrior should be able to do with two clerics.<br />
<br />
What a time+ warrior can do with a cleric/druid, a time+ knight or high elemental warrior should be able to do with two clerics.  A high elemental knight or low elemental warrior are just shit out of luck.<br />
<br />
It follows then that a sub par warrior can accomplish more just by adding healers as well.  Now for me... I have won tipt and vexd.  I am sub-par by the standards of time+ gear.  I have 1850AC and 10500ish hps.  I take 2 clerics with me when I do them.  Would I win with one cleric?  Probably not.  WIll I win now with 2...yes.<br />
As for Ikkinz...dunno will let you know when I get there.<br />
<br />
Your comment about a 1600 AC warrior not belonging there anymore than a 1600 AC knight is inaccurate.  There is not and should not be equality in tanking based on those numbers alone.  To illustrate, if it takes an 1800 AC warrior, it should take a 1900 AC knight (or whatever the actual numbers are).  The bottom line a lesser equiped warrior SHOULD do better.  What the degree of difference is is open to debate, but the warrior should be able to do it sooner than the knight period.<br />
<br />
<br />
My viewpoint is if you want to make this a &quot;fair&quot; encounter on strictly a tanking basis and you can't do it any other way than nerfing.. fine strip the discs.. and have the mob cast a single target silence on the MT.  Core abilities for all tanks negated.<br />
<br />
I think the warrior viewpoint on a lot of this boils down to several points.<br />
<br />
1 - Right wrong or indifferent defensive is the core class defining skill of warriors.<br />
<br />
2 - Every person who is wearing time gear right now is wearing it because warriors had defensive.  You could not have progressed to the point of knights tanking high end PoP mobs without the warriors first going in undergeared  popping defensive and praying the CH rotation held.  If you want to call it a crutch fine... your gear is the result of a crutch... as is everyone elses.  Every warrior who has been part of the MT defensive chain that fought and died repeatedly to get their guild past bertox, RZ, FR etc knows exactly what I mean.  You directly benefited from it's use.  To do this now is like saying &quot;Thanks for the help now go get lost we don't need or want you anymore&quot;.  Now I'm not saying that it's a one class show to get past those encounters... everything had to work... but defensive was one of the key integral pieces to it.<br />
<br />
3 - It sets an extremely bad precedent for the tuning of new content in the future.  Someone is bitching?  Nerf defensive.  <br />
<br />
4 - I believe that most all warriors were sympathetic to some remedial action by SoE towards retuning this event to allow knights an equal shot at them.  My suggestion to SoE was simple ... just put a one shot, no rent Potion of defense right before the final boss... boom... encounter is &quot;balanced&quot; and no one gets nerfed... probably a simplistic approach but it would have worked.  It wouldn't affect class balance but it would balance the encounters...in fact probably a bit to the knights side.<br />
<br />
5 - What pisses the warriors off is not so much the fact that our core ability got nerfed in 2 encounters.  It is the GLEE that some within the knight community take in pointing out our &quot;crutch&quot; and how this is somehow all right that the one thing that will make a warrior stand out some has been nerfed.  Guys...we didn't design the game... we have lived with the design for years just like you have.  You got where you are right now because of an ability (in part at least) that now you want gone.  Doesn't make folks happy.</div></div><hr />

What he said.<br />
<br />
BB, please shut up.  This &quot;Tanking parity (and spellbook superiority)&quot; line is getting old, and its inaccurate.  There is no tanking parity.  The spellbook superiority is, as it stands right now, negligable at the high end game where these changes took place and therefore makes up for the seemingly &quot;negligable&quot; advantage that warriors have to tank.<br />
<br />
DD is now a DPS fight with knights or lower geared warriors such as myself (killed him for the first time today).  The problem was with the attrition -- the chanter could not possibly mes all the pops right as they spawned, and they normally would beat in the cleric a little.  The cleric then had to shuffle healing himself with healing me, usually by using an AE heal.<br />
<br />
To combat this, SKs get HT to put out some more damage.  Warriors get aggressive, with the added bonus of being able to furious tank him while the chanter messes the first pops and slows the Destroyer (dying within the first 20secs is a very real danger to knights tanking this, by the way).  Paladins get fast group heals they can cast to help keep the healers up so they can continue to spam.<br />
<br />
Warriors will take less dps than a paladin or shadowknight, even with the defensive nerf.<br />
<br />
Please stop your fucking whining, because you're pissing off even the warriors at TSW now.</div></div><hr />

When fighting a boss mob we have every expectation that we should be able to effectively use Defensive, Stonewall, or Eveasive. Kindly tell me which other mobs in game for 4 years we couldn't use this ability on.<br />

<br />
And Raivene, what you detect is not glee from me.  I'm as shocked about this fix as the next person.  I have zero idea what to really think about the nerf of defensive.  I did state months ago that either it needed nerfing or knights needed something to be able to compete against it on single-group trial bosses.  I never imagined they would actually nerf defensive, and I couldn't imagine how they would even pull it off if they did.  Obviously, the devs have been getting very creative in their ways of avoiding the real issues in the game.<br />
<br />
My preferred fix is and has always been to fix knights.  But warriors insist we aren't broken, even in GoD.  Well...some warriors.  A few agree we're broken but disagree on the solutions, and I can respect that.  But don't say you weren't warned about this.  When any one class simply digs its heals in the sand and gives the big bird to a class that is complaining of serious fairness issues, they are being extremely foolish, because when those players start leaving for other games in droves, not only will it affect your ability to progress as a guild, but it will certainly get SOE's attention when their revenue stream dips.  In the case of warriors, a sit-in was planned, with warnings of a mass exodus thereafter if demands were not met.  With knights, there have been no warnings or threats.  Many just simply left.  Others have resorted to playing alts or shrinking back behind old content.  My guild hasn't felt the affects as much as others beyond us, because we're just now starting to farm Time, and knights aren't near as broken in PoP.  I feel very adequate for the job of both single-group tank and raid offtank in all PoP zones.<br />
<br />
I really don't like the way the GoD fixes are going.  First there was talk about special versions of the trials for knights.  Then there was talk about unilateral content changes.  Now they nerf defensive.  The irony is that many of you (the warriors) and the THEM (the devs) are going so far out of your way to avoid giving knights a lightweight defensive disc, spell, or ability, that everything else is being nerfed or broken in the process.  But whatever.  Your bottom line seems to be that NO, we don't get defensive under any circumstance.  Our bottom line is that we demand to be able to tank all single-group content and function as good offtanks in almost all raid content with appropriate gear, spells, and AAs.  Period.<br />

If you read the post completely, which obviously you did not, it states that it was not a one class show, but that defensive was one of the core abilities that allowed those encounters to work.  Don't like it fine.  You lived with it at the time and you benefited from it.  Incidently those encounters wouldn't have worked without:<br />
<br />
1 - CH<br />
2 - Debufs<br />
3 - HP buffs<br />
4 - DPS<br />
5 - Defensive<br />
6 - The list goes on<br />
<br />
take out ANY one of them and the whole house of cards collapses.  Defensive is one of the required pieces for getting from there to here... not the only piece but one of the required ones none the less.  It is the only piece on those lists that the warriors brought to the table.<br />
<br />
I have been one of the ones standing up and saying yeah... these trials are screwed.  It sucks that a one group trial requires certain classes something should be done.  I wanted to see you have an equal chance to defeat these particular encounters that were so dreadfully designed.<br />
<br />
What some of the knights and not all of them by far have asked for was basically a full defensive capability.  That really was way over the line and you won't get atta boys here for that.  That's the part the warriors were being pricks about.  You should not and never should have the warrior class defining ability.<br />
<br />
Did you need something here...oh hell yeah you did.  This is just shitty implementation.  <br />
<br />
I honestly did feel sorry for the knights on these encounters, bad design had screwed you.   Worse design now pisses off the warriors.  All in all a public relations setback for SoE on this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
You want to talk about primidonnas look towards your own class that want everything of the parent classes.  As much as I hate to admit it, your most vocal members are the ones spreading that.  Yes there are sensible Knights.  There are sensible warriors too.  If you actually bothered to read entire posts you would have seen I WAS ON YOUR FRICKING SIDE.  Something had to be done...just not what they did.<br />
<br />
There were numerous ways these encounters could have been changed to give you your &quot;equality&quot;.  The way that was chosen is guaranteed to put the two communities at odds once more.  <br />
<br />
Outside of these 2 encounters, tanking is more balanced than it has been in years.  Warriors get groups where we didn't before... pallys still get group and so do SKs.  Of the 3 classes the one with the most real stuff to bitch about has to be the SKs who still are a ways behind.  Paladan's have a lot to hope for at least with the new spells coming down the road.  (and I sincerely hope they don't nerf them to oblivion though I suspect that they will sadly).</div></div><hr />

When a class loses a defining class ability even in a trial or two, it MAY cause those players to &quot;start leaving for other games in droves, not only will it affect your ability to progress as a guild, but it will certainly get SOE's attention when their revenue stream dips.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I enjoy very much having Paladins on raids let's strain real hard for some honesty here please. I don't know a high-level Paladin that couldn't get flagged. Raids don't stop because Knights don't show up. If a Paladin, SK, or Wariror leaves a high level raiding guild there are 250 ready, willing and eager to enthusiasticly take their place.<br />

I never imagined they would actually nerf defensive, and I couldn't imagine how they would even pull it off if they did.

Lol, bet this piece of shit was right there clamoring for changes to the warrior class during PoP! Yeah knights were really for changes back then! Where were you then hey? Registered April 2004, interesting. I suggest you shut the fuck up Troll and look at those four fingers you are pointing back at yourself.<br />
<br />
Some of us were not born yesterday, and there is a reason most of us are pricks towards knights. The vast majority were wankers on their boards about any improvements to warriors.<br />
<br />
Now, fuck off.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the new changes, could care less. Don't have much faith in anything SOE does anymore.  All I know is I am currently enjoying my warrior and have learnt over the years complaining about anything really won't help me much. I will just play until SOE makes my class unpleasant to play.  They could do so by reverting back to PoP in terms of power, but thats about it as far as I can see at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the game were designed correctly, then this would be a moot issue. A knight in the same level of gear as a warrior (meaning that it was obtained from the same general content in the game, such as PoTime) should have fewer HP and AC than warrior gear. The fact that the devs have horribly screwed that up by making so much all/all and multi-class gear does not change the way it SHOULD be. As such, an equivalently geared warrior and knight should NOT tank equally, as the gear should provide the tanking difference. And I'm not even opposed to slight differences in abilities, such as defensive skillsets.<br />
<br />
Then don't imply that a warrior and a knight with the same level gear should tank equally well.  That's exactly what was implied in a previous post.  Now you're saying the fact is the difference in gear that should be in the game and would make the &quot;same level gear&quot; statement justified is not in fact true.  We both know that.  All/all or all meleer or all plate wearer gear screws that up.  I won't go so far as to say that a 1600 AC warrior should tank the same as a 1600 AC paladin.  The warrior should have a small advantage innately.  But yes, class specific gear should supply most of the difference and the fact is it doesn't.  <br />
<br />
So we have to allow for the way the game is NOW.  Thus equally level geared knights and warriors should absolutely not tank the same or almost the same unless warriors get a knight equivalent spellbook.<br />
<br />
And no, the tanking advantage of warriors should not just be against raid bosses.  There should be some advantage across the board.  It's all a warrior does.  <br />
<br />
Those knights posting here who paid attention in recent months know that many warriors DID want something to be fixed for knights in GoD.  Only in GoD though!  That's where the problem has been and that's where it should be addressed.  The best way to address a problem with a few zones in a single expansion is content adjustment.  But most of us do not think that making defensive/evasive useless was the way to go.  It's stupid.  The devs are utterly lacking in creativity for this content.  <br />
<br />
(In the early days of GoD development)<br />
Dev Ogg: How we makes stuffs harder?<br />
Dev Thud: We makes dem hits harder!<br />
Dev Ogg:  Ooga booga!  Ooo! ooo! ooo!<br />
<br />
Okay, that was dumb.  But ya get the point.  I really think there should be a thread about ideas to make single group content challenging besides just chucking insane dps on stuff like they  have done for GoD.  And maybe something about how 6 person groups are not allowing for enough strategy options anyway.  How about 2 group trials with a variety of challenges?  The way things stand now for the tough trials you probably need:<br />
<br />
1. Main Tank<br />
2. Cleric<br />
3. Healer (Cleric/Druid)<br />
4. Slower (shaman/chanter)<br />
5. Puller (bard/monk, maybe an sk)<br />
6. Probably chanter/bard if you don't have one already, otherwise dps<br />
<br />
There might be a few tweaks to the above a really stout group could get away with, but still, it sucks.  So many of your group slots are practically locked in.  There just isn't much room at all for the extra tanks or extra dps classes.    That's what you get when challenge is designed around the almighty mob dps increases plus you only have 6 slots available.</div></div><hr />

Try using that think between your ears called a brain. Take my fucking spell book. If paladins are so damn powerful reroll as one. You want to talk about relative power? What's more powerful, a warrior with a paladin spell book or a paladin with warrior disciplines?<br />
<br />
What it means is that if a warrior with ~1800 ac unbuffed can do the trials then a paladin/sk with ~2000 ac unbuffed should be able to do it.<br />
<br />
It means that a warrior with 1400-1500 ac shouldn't be doing something better than a knight with 2000-2200 ac.<br />
<br />
How fucking hard is that to understand? Does it really take an IQ above 80 to get that?<br />
<br />
If you can't understand that a knight with *better* equipment should be able to tank a *single group* encounter as well as you, then you need some help that rational thought can't be.</div></div><hr />

What kind of time reference are we talking here?  Are we talking about throughout an entire trial, or for 3 minutes at the end of the trial?<br />
<br />
I think pretty much everyone agrees that in Vxed, a paladin with 2000ac will perform 20x better than a warrior with 1500ac.  The only, ONLY, yes ONLY part where warriors are preferential is when you're tanking mr_big_bad_guy01 at the end, in which case a warrior is preferred.  <br />
<br />
Just like I'd prefer a bard in bazaar gear to pull ikkinz over a warrior or a monk in time gear, because one is just plain equipped to do the job better.  Would I take a monk or warrior to do that pulling?  Sure!  Its a little harder, as I need the chanter or cleric to tag along and lull the mobs beforehand.  Just like its a little harder for the paladin to tank mr_bad_man01 (ie, he needs an extra healer, or the chanter to chain rune him, or the help of a WS).<br />
<br />
The primary job of a paladin or shadowknight was never to tank mr_bad_man01 equal to a warrior, just like the primary functions of a warrior is not to pull equal to a bard, or a shaman to heal equal to a cleric, or a cleric to..you get the picture).<br />
<br />
This change DID balance things.  It does not piss me off, it makes me happier.  Now, I am capable of beating Ikkinz with 10k hp and 2k ac (no shaman, only SoTunare instead of brells), and suddenly single groups are exciting for me.  I do not feel threatened by this change, and if a group goes with a better equipped SK or Paladin over me, I'm just fine with that.<br />
<br />
If a warrior can regularly beat a trial, a knight at the same gear level should be capable of beating that same trial.  Maybe not regularly, maybe not without some group changes, and maybe not as easily as the warrior; but it should be possible.  Right now, it is.<br />

There, see how stupid I sounded?<br />
<br />
That was exactly my point. I can't stand when people make stupid statements about how much their class is worthless and how many advantages another class has. I'm not rerolling and neither is that warrior that I was replying to, so shit like &quot;ok, give me your spell book and we're even because warriors have nothing else&quot; piss me off.<br />
<br />
There have been a few points in the last 5 years that rerolling from a particular class was actuallya tempting option, but it sure as hell isn't right now for warriors or paladins to switch between the two classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
What kind of time reference are we talking here?  Are we talking about throughout an entire trial, or for 3 minutes at the end of the trial?<br />
<br />
The last 3 minutes of course, which is what really mattered in this particular trial in the first place. Don't even have to have your tank-lite warrior tank a damn thing, let the pet do it. What is a better option:<br />
<br />
1) Take a weak warrior and struggle to the end in 3 hours (and let the pet tank if you want and do it in 2 hours like with a knight), but with a high probability of winning<br />
<br />
2) Take a strong knight and breeze to the end in 2 hours, but with a high probability of failure<br />
<br />
I know I'd take option number 1 every time.<br />
<br />
I think pretty much everyone agrees that in Vxed, a paladin with 2000ac will perform 20x better than a warrior with 1500ac.  The only, ONLY, yes ONLY part where warriors are preferential is when you're tanking mr_big_bad_guy01 at the end, in which case a warrior is preferred. <br />
<br />
Think you mean tipt, since you don't have to beat any bosses in vxed to pass, but yes. Exactly. But since there are only 6 spots and by the time you add everyone else in there is one spot for a tank. And who is getting that slot? A warrior that you'll have to work with to get to the end but that you should win with, or a paladin that will easily get you there for you to fail with?<br />
<br />

Except that this is one group trial content that requires you to go through, and there isn't an extra spot for the paladin/sk if they aren't main tanking. That is the problem.<br />
<br />

<br />
And I am happy with the change too. I think a knight in better gear than a warrior should tank as well as that warrior does, and this fix does just that.<br />
<br />
As I said in my first post, this change (they also lowered the dps of jhiru) allows knights that should have been able to tank it, tank it with a good degree of reliability, and prevents those warriors that shouldn't have been able to consider tanking there from using defensive to power up on the boss to pass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is where I'll disagree with you, because I know for a fact that knights ARE capable of winning those without &quot;a high probability of failure&quot;.  They just need to be watched a little closer (through chain runing instead of nuking, or relying on DI, or taking a healer upgrade ie druid becomes cleric, one cleric becomes cleric+druid, or by bringing more dps).<br />
<br />
Don't tell me it was a high probability to fail, because if you're a 2000ac paladin, you were perfectly capable of winning before hand (first group in my guild to win Tipt was Ranger, Druid, Cleric, Shaman, Paladin, Enchanter.  This was at release, too; not after the first nerf and not after the second nerf we just experienced.  The paladin was in mostly-Time gear).  Nowadays, I can win it without the shaman, and without the enchanters chained runes, but this is also after the content became more comfortable to my guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think pretty much everyone agrees that in Vxed, a paladin with 2000ac will perform 20x better than a warrior with 1500ac. The only, ONLY, yes ONLY part where warriors are preferential is when you're tanking mr_big_bad_guy01 at the end, in which case a warrior is preferred. <br />
I was referring to Vxed, with or without an enchanter pet, in the above example.  Since there is no boss mob to kill, knights are highly preferred over warriors because knights *do* bring more utility, and the tanking ability isnt nearly as important.<br />
<br />
Knights get Vxed, warriors get tipt.<br />
<br />
Problem is, knights expected tipt to be as easy as vxed was, and it wasnt -- it was a step above it.  Maybe it should have been a little easier (the first nerf did not bother me at all, I felt it put things where it should have been).  That doesnt mean that suddenly knights suck again, it just means that, just like warriors do, knights need to step it up a notch before they are capable of winning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Release content extremely hard, so 99.9% folks are stuck in early content<br />
<br />
Then, &quot;fix&quot; the content by making it more doable for more people, so now you have the top 10% of people breaking in to the high end game.<br />
<br />
Now that we're nearing the next expansion release, they gimp things up even more to allow a broader spectrum of people into the middle-upper tier of GoD.<br />
<br />
Sound familiar?<br />
<br />
PoP released with near-impossible flagging system.<br />
PoP then implements the Seer, which allows folks to do flags out of order and makes progression easier<br />
PoP opens up PoValor, PoStorms, HoH, and BoT to others to allow even more people to experience the mid-level content.  RZ is nerfed to allow more guilds to get into EP.<br />
Right as GoD comes out and lots of guilds start to filter out of time, SOE starts making time easier for others (although this is debatable), including fully instancing and discussing alternate forms of advancement for more casual players.</div></div><hr />

Elsewhere it was suggested that shipping on the date they committed to and getting the revenue is more important than having a complete tested product. That they habitually and intentionally put up impossible roadblocks to keep players out of incomplete content.<br />
<br />
Their first rule of project management seems to be &quot;Ship it!&quot; rather than &quot;Ship it good!&quot;<br />
<br />
In contrast, Blizzard has a reputation for &quot;Ship it good!&quot;. We shall see.<br />
<br />
Beyond this, I think your observation is correct as well. The truth is on most servers the highest level one or two guilds seem to plow through content. Without what amounts to very unreasonable challanges when attempted by the other 99% of a server's population several guilds might have been done with GoD months ago and be perpetually semi-bored.<br />
<br />
When the hard-cores make it through to the end, SoE seems to open up content letting in the masses. I happen to think this may be a good thing. I'm an aging gamer that doesn't have young reflexes. Sometimes I even screw up. I'm a dedicated raider though and stall me out forever in Uqua (for example) and I will absolutly find a game that is more fun for me.<br />
<br />
Of course better design making gearing up a guild the timesink and then with players having a substantial advantage the next step in the progression being only reasonably challanging and testing would make the game less frustrating.<br />
<br />
Somehow Challange/player frustration does not seem to me to be synomymous.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm so sorry I've pissed you off - just so you know, if those final mobs feared the MT or were trivial loot pinatas, I wouldn't have raised a single objection. Sharing or nerfing in any way my class's defining class ability infuriates me. If it doesn't bother you that's fine.<br />

I'm really pleased they made these trials more tankable by knights.  <br />
<br />
I do have something on my mind though.  Even in the days of PoP when wars were struggling, I was always against nerfing knights.  I am seriously against nerfing classes at will and swapping their unique abilities around (which is one of the reasons I don't play DAoC as much anymore).  Knights weren't nerfed, but defensive was... that to me represents a major blow against trust with SoE.<br />
<br />
I thought after the convention that SoE was shaping up, but it seems they're slipping nerfs in under our placated noses.  Nerfing defensive was not only a move of bad faith, I think it could have been avoided.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see the DI of the boss mobs in question (Jhiru, DD) lowered so that defensive has very little effect (since defensive = DI divided by 2).  I'd FAR rather that, than to have my class-defining ability rendered useless.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Have the boss mobs in question cast a significant endurance-drain on the MT.  If you've got a good end pool you'll get furious off and part of stonewall/defensive before you run out of endurance.  If not, furious will end and you'll have a tougher time of it.<br />
<br />
Anything but this arbitrary &quot;haha, defensive doesn't work anymore&quot; bullshit.</div></div><hr />

That's what I think is most defective about SoE's approach the trial is not just the boss mob - that's a fact that could have been used to make it a fair challange to any capable group.<br />
<br />
As an aside. Not only did I state that the usual Knight add tanking role would only be preserved in GoD if SoE didn't put in high DI adds, but I also think adjusting adds to make more unstunable is exactly backwards.<br />
<br />
Both Warriors and Knights are entitled to their class advantages and to have them work in content. The goal shouldn't be 3 flavors of the same class.<br />
<br />
But, I guess Raaj is right. If the result is OK and it's only these trials, who cares. There's no doubt a huge list of other sillyness that needs to be addressed.<br />

<br />
It's our only class defining ability.  We have a miniscule skillset and rely completely on gear, as it should be.  It's not a crutch, it's just part of what the warrior class is.<br />
<br />
We have a few disciplines tied now to endurance that allow us to live through things that non warriors are unable to.  That is why we are warriors and it is what we expected when we made the toon.<br />
<br />
Personally I have no problem with them helping knights out because I do agree they should be able to MA these groups because they are after all single group trials however this is just a ridiculous way to handle it because they have swapped target audiences now on this content twice now.<br />
<br />
GoD comes out, mobs are real hard, hit for max alot and do insane dps.<br />
<br />
SoE tunes the content down enabling lesser geared people to complete vexd and through proper healing down tipt boss.<br />
<br />
Then SoE says, well okay lets set the content back to the difficulty level it was at and let's take away the warriors ability to use his class defining ability.<br />
<br />
So now the target audience is set to something completely different once again.  Perhaps it is the target audience that it was intended for in the first place but if it iwas they never should have made that first adjustment and it certainly shouldn't have taken them this long to do it.<br />
<br />
What this simply comes down to is a marketing tactic.<br />
<br />
Now when your done going - Wtf is this guy talking about? , I'll explain.<br />
<br />
SoE is going to release OOW, raising the level cap.<br />

What better way to make people want to buy an expansion?<br />

Level 70 even with the same gear at this very moment will change this trial so much.<br />

All the people who were dong the trials when they were easier will give in run out buy OOW, level up and wallah, the content is magically fixed and SoE has a few million in the bank now.<br />
<br />
This change didn't help the knights who were complaining at all.  If anything it made it harder for them because now once again trash is doing insane dps even slowed.<br />
<br />
This change didn't enable the knights who were complaining to complete tipt any easier.<br />
<br />
All this did is take away a warriors class defining ability that was allowing him to do things at a lower progression level than a knight.<br />
<br />
A warrior SHOULD be able to do just that, it's the way it's always been and there is no real reason to change the game or class in regards to it.  Just fix the content so that the target progression level Knights are capable of doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it ignored defensive totally and hit through it, it may not bother me as much but the fact that it's shifting the hate list around and alterring aggro on the fly based on the detection of the use of a discipline is just insanity.<br />
<br />
I'm all for knights tanking these trials.  I am also all for a warrior having the ability to tank these mobs with lesser gear through our skillset, what little skillset we do have.<br />
<br />
This however simply isn't the answer and is just a sign of their intentions of dealing with future issues and how they plan to &quot;balance&quot; things.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day the knight is still screwed and I still feel bad for them, simply because of the way SoE handled the situation the 9k knight was basically led to beleive they were going to be able to do this content when all was said and done and while they actually can, with the proper group setup and healing, it isn't what they expected.<br />
<br />
I first did these trials when my guild first made it into elementals, with basically VT gear and it was tough but doable and I felt that it was fair that a warrior could do that but it would take a higher hp/ac knight to accomplish it.<br />
<br />
They need to pick a target audience, leave the content geared at that target audience and make adjustments and changes to the content and the classes to accomodate it.<br />
<br />
Let's be serious here, the reason knights are mad is not because of their inability to do this trial at elementalish level but more at the warriors ability to do this trial at a VTish level.  <br />
<br />
If SoE came out tommorow and put up a warning notice when you accepted the expedition that said - &quot;This content is designed to allow full elemental geared knights to tank the bosses&quot; , would you still be upset if a VT level warrior was able to do it?<br />
<br />
The problem is the VT geared knights now wanted to be able to tank it because the VT level warriors were (this is in regards to tipt not ikkinz).<br />
<br />
And that simply is a matter of the knight wanting the target audience of the content to be changed.  What then? A LDoN geared warrior could do it and then LDoN geared knights would want to? There is a overlap in tanking boss mobs in regards to gear and progress, it's always been that way and should be that way.<br />
<br />
I'm happy knowing that I can do things before knights of comparable gear and progression simply because I am a warrior I can skate by on my skillset, it's why I made the class years ago and it's why I still play it.<br />
<br />
This change helps noone and fixes nothing, all it will do is sell a few million copies of OOW a bit faster.<br />
<br />
I honestly do hope they help you knights out and I hope they find some consistency in what they do, for all our sakes.<br />
<br />
Good luck to everyone.</div></div><hr />

They just need to be watched a little closer (through chain runing instead of nuking, or relying on DI, or taking a healer upgrade ie druid becomes cleric, one cleric becomes cleric+druid, or by bringing more dps).<br />
<br />
Yes knights are capable of winning...they just need gear that is several tiers better than a warrior requires.<br />
<br />
Let's be serious here, the reason knights are mad is not because of their inability to do this trial at elementalish level but more at the warriors ability to do this trial at a VTish level.<br />
<br />
The problem is the VT geared knights now wanted to be able to tank it because the VT level warriors were (this is in regards to tipt not ikkinz).<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting close. The problem was the fact that warriors that had never set foot in VT or anything beyond tier 2 PoP could tank these mobs with a much greater success rate than knights that were fully elementally equipped, with some time gear sprinkled in. <br />
<br />
We had a recruit warrior, with zero (0) pieces of loot from the elementals, and zero (0) pieces of loot from VT that was able to tank successfully (with an almost 100% success rate) the named in vxed and tipt and not a single knight in the guild was able to tank Jhiru. I tried multiple times, with the gear listed in my magelo (except for the belt) and failed every time. A warrior with LESS hp than me and *significantly* less AC (roughly 400 less buffed) was able to do it like clockwork, and I was several tiers of equipment above him. <br />
<br />
A warrior wearing a mixture of ornate, cultural, and velious quest armor should not be orders of magnitude better at tanking than a knight that is fully elementally equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-19-2004, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Graal, I sence more than a little Defensive envy at work here. Is that Warrior going to leave y'all behind, do Ikkinz 4 and Uqua, and be looting armor from Q'Vic? No sir he's not. He's going to be moving along with his guild. He's not going to MT in Uqua with that gear. He's going to at best be dragged though as luggage.<br />
<br />
Now I'm agast that a naked level 53 Paladin can outheal me. But I assure you that in the high level raid game which is what we are talking about, it's immaterial. He was retired by me because at level 50 I could and always would out tank him - and that's what I wanted to be a 100% Tank and the best at it.<br />
<br />
Knights need to be concerned with their ability to do their job and not if Wariors are better at MTing harsh mobs - of course we are.<br />
<br />
Can you get experiance groups, manditory individual flags, and do you have a raid role? Yes? Then I think you are fine and needn't be jealous of a class that can't heal a lick.<br />
<br />
We are different classes with different strengths and weaknesses. You seem to focus on our greatest stength and say we are too strong. Yep, that's what we are good at. Your class has it's strengths too. In a platoon the heavy machine gun squad is different from the mortarman is different from the point team. We're all soldiers, but we are specialized.<br />
<br />
Should SoE make one person trials soloing dragons and tweak Warriors until we can do the job as well as a Paladin? The plain truth is in a single group killing a hard hitting mob that can't be stunned a Warrior is the best tank and a Cleric is the best healer. It just wasn't important before. And in truth, it isn't even important in GoD and y'all know it.<br />
<br />
As soon as everything is adjusted, we can all forget this and do raid content. That's what the game is all about at our level.<br />

They made clear that 'defensiv' is not balanceable for single groupe stuff at level 65. How in hell you think they will be able to balance it for 65+ game. They choose the way to nerf defensiv for this single groupe stuff now at level 65. They will choose to nerf defensiv for the level 65+ game to. <br />
<br />
They should fix the balance and not make workarrounds.<br />
<br />
1.) They shall remove all stun components form our spells and keep it as aggro tools only. Stuns are not balanceable.<br />
2.) They should take away all migration disciplines from the game.<br />
3.) Then they should balance Paladins/Shadowknights/Warriors that they are near each other in tanking. Warrior the best but not to far in front of knights.<br />
4.)  Then they should give true melees only offensiv disciplines to counter the knights spellbooks.<br />
<br />
You should solve the problem and not create a workarround. This defensiv nerf is a workarround.<br />

Do Ikkinz group trials regularly, without slower 9800hp Pally can more effectivly tank the whole trial other then named reviving CH unless its the Yellow Con archers most the time while at 12k I have to recive SLs to stay alive.</div></div><hr />

You're right.  They're going to make single-group content less dependant on Defensive/Evasive and more about split tanking or crowd control.<br />

Nope. He was not &quot;orders of magnitude worse&quot; when not using defensive. Where did I ever say he was...and what fucked up logical falacy are you using that says that since the warrior is orders of magnitude better under defensive he must be orders of magnitude worse when not under defensive? <br />
<br />
He had about the same hp as me (just slightly less) and about 400 less AC. He tanked the trash just fine. That same group regularly xp'd in vxed because it was good xp and chavoor and umbiki had a chance to drop spells and items. <br />

Then gee, I wonder how people like Fandaor has tanked Jhiru, Chavoor, Umbiki, Ukun Bloodbeast, and Kyv Hunter without one single piece of Elemental Armor, and with DRUIDS (not even clerics) healing him? <br />

Sure we've died to these mobs before, but its really about dedication, figuring out the right strategies to use, and most of all, paying attention so you can be quick on the draw. <br />
<br />
A good thing that I think helps alot, especially with the named, is when you have a bard pulling, the bard can usually debuff and slow the mob 54%(-minus mitigation) before it even gets into camp. <br />

I tried Tipt 2 times yesterday. Lost both times. Mistic did a great job pulling, stylina roxxored on the pet, it just seems like if you heal anyone with a pet tanking, I instantly get agro and get pounded into the ground. So i have some learning to do as a cleric on these runs. <br />
<br />
On the objective side, yah, we can do these. I myself need to learn them better. However, I cant afford to supply 20-30 emeralds for DI and 10-20 dots per run. I normally dont even carry emeralds, cept the ones zah gives me for raids. <br />
<br />
Bily- amazing what a warrior can tank with /defensive as compared to a paladin or shadowknight. And if you give him some of the top geared druids in the guild with 400+ AA's as healers, then yah, THAT group might be successful. Again, your thinking of a group YOU had. Nothing personal, just putting it in perspective.<br />

I find it very hard to believe that a 1300ac warrior was able to successfully tank trash with a DRUID healer.  Sounds like your guild used pet tanks.<br />
<br />
If your guild is relying on pet tanks instead of players tanking, then your guild is not ready to do these trials, and any whining you have about not being able to successfully tank these encounters is moot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You fail to understand...<br />
<br />
At that point in time, our guild either used warriors as tanks, or used pets as tanks and brought along at least one melee class with an avoidance disc for the named. <br />
<br />
I had done the most trials at the point of any of my guild's knights...and I was along as a PULLER. I didn't tank. Not because I couldn't, but because it wasjust much safer to use the pet. Look at my magelo. I had a lesser belt than what I have now, but that is essentially the same gear I had back then. Is that undergeared for vxed and tipt?<br />
<br />
If my guild wasn't ready at the time, how was it that a 3rd of my guild was flagged for kod'taz? My guild was &quot;ready&quot; because it 1) had chanters, 2) had warriors, and 3) had melees with avoidance disciplines. THOSE were the obstacles to overcome, not a specific gear level requirement. There IS NO gear level requirement, at least there wasn't. Easily 1/4 of the kod'taz flagged toons in our guild at that time were alts that happened to be key classes. The groups that I got flagged with all had an alt chanter (2 boxed) and an alt cleric (2 boxed) along. The alt cleric dinged 65 during our tipt expedition. (got another damn charm)<br />
<br />
How was it that we weren't ready? Can you only hit weaponshield if you have a certain level of gear? Can you only cast Command of Druzzil if you have 5.5k mana or greater? Can you only pop defensive if you have at least 1 piece of elemental loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can a Cleric only cast SL or HL long enough to matter if he's in EP+ gear?<br />
<br />
In the end you state that without EP loot the Warrior was very close to you with perhaps a 400HP advantage. First, a mixture of Kirzak's and LDoN top of the line armor isn't all the bad. Secondly, buff yourself with AoTC and you're both pretty much the same.<br />
<br />
What you're really saying is a Wariror at about the same AC and HP's as you tanks a boss mob better than you. Well duh, that's pretty much to be expected - that's what Warriors get.<br />
<br />
IF SoE wasn't dizzy about all of this they would tune the trials to be challanging to Knights of the level they wanted to suceed. If using a pet to tank and backing him up with a Ranger using weaponshield gets people flagged, so what. If Warriors have an easier time suceeding, so what.<br />
<br />
A guild with Warriors and Knights at 6800HP's unbuffed is going exactly nowhere till they gear up. I assure you, they aren't making it into Q'vic. Jealousy because a Warrior gets his Glyphed Prayer Ring before you do is a little silly.<br />

However, his group didn't &quot;tank&quot; Jhiru.  They used evasion discs and threw a warrior in front of him to pray.<br />
<br />
His guild was trying to pussyfoot their way in, and was upset that a warrior had a higher chance of survival than a paladin.<br />
<br />
Well, duh.  Once your group is capable of having a tank on the trash the whole way up without wiping or needing to take a med break, then that group is capable of successfully tanking Jhiru.</div></div><hr />

I don't want some pissy offensive disc to make up for the fact that I've lost defensive/stonewall.  I'm not a monk or a rogue, I don't do DPS.  I do 1 thing and 1 thing only: Tank.<br />
<br />
You knights play several roles.  If you play a paladin you 1) Offtank 2) Battle-rez 3) Throw in a few heals here and there which can make a difference<br />
<br />
SKs 1) Offtank 2) Pull 3) Fair burst DPS with HT <br />
<br />
The roles of knights need looking at, especially SKs.  Knights need looking at, I'm not denying that.<br />
<br />
But where the fuck do you get off on coming here and asking for defensive to be nerfed?   Because you want fucking tank parity with spellbook superiority?  <br />
<br />
Let me rewrite your asinine suggestions:<br />
<br />
2. Because knights don't have defensive, warriors shouldn't have one either because it's NOT FAIR!!!!  Nerf defensive!<br />
3. Knights and Warriors should be equal in tanking with the only advantage a warrior having is a small innate bonus, while knights get to keep their spellbooks and utility.<br />
4. To illustrate my stupid ideas of class balance and how I feel warriors should be nerfed, I'm going to suggest that warriors get offensive discs so that monks (who already need help) and rogues will be up in a complete tizzy because we're encroaching upon THEIR role.<br />
<br />
For anyone who wants to nerf 'defensiv', I challenge you to use more than 1 brain cell and come up with ideas that don't nerf any class.  Nobody wants their fucking class nerfed and if you think that way you need to remove your head from up your ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-20-2004, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry I misinterpreted.<br />
<br />
Yes, there's a gear requirement to do harder content in EQ. Some classes escape it now and again, others do not.<br />
<br />
Progress does not end at the current level cap of 65. Gear up and your whole guild, not just a handful of members, will find content a heck of a lot easier. I'm pretty sure PoTime can be cleared by ~40 people in less than 5 hours once you have the gear - that's how important it is.<br />
<br />
I'm not putting you down, but at 6800HP's you've got a fair amount of room to improve. Do it and new content will open up and content you're doing now will be trivial.<br />

IF SoE wasn't dizzy about all of this they would tune the trials to be challanging to Knights of the level they wanted to suceed. If using a pet to tank and backing him up with a Ranger using weaponshield gets people flagged, so what. If Warriors have an easier time suceeding, so what.<br />

I guess it escaped your attention, Captain Equivocator, the difference in gear between him and me. I was at the time the best equipped knight in my guild. He was the worst equipped warrior amongst our recruits wearing primarily ornate, with some cultural and velious quest pieces.<br />

We weren't expecting to get into Q'vic, poltroon. Do you see anywhere at all that I so much as imply that I should be in Q'vic or that someone with my level of gear should be in Q'vic. That's why people don't like you, fuckface. You are utterly intellectually dishonest. You constantly use straw man arguments like that above piece of shit to try to make your case. I don't even know what a glyphed prayer ring is, nor do I care. The point is that a guild with tanks at 6800 hps unbuffed should be able to progress through elemental level content, since that is what elemental level tanks will have (at least the knights). Vxed and Tipt are designed as elemental level content. Let's be more accurate: Vxed and Tipt were designed as bazaar level content assuming you had a warrior and were designed as time level content assuming you had a knight.<br />

I wasn't aware Vxed and Tipt were designed as elemental level content. Could you kindly show where SoE has said this?<br />
<br />
AoW can be done with post NToV Warrior's MTing or ~EP Knight MTing. Disparity in tanking ability is not new. As Brenolo stated (paraphrasing):<br />
Like it or not Warirors will always be better tanks than Pallys and SK's..<br />
<br />
Your concern should be if you should be able to do it and can't and not if a Warrior can do it better. Of course we can - MTing hard hitting mobs is our speciallity. It may not be possible to make a boss mob than can equally be tanked by a Wariror and a Knight at the same progression level. The &quot;right&quot; solution might just be to remove these mobs from the trials - problem solved.<br />
<br />
SoE has stated the content was not designed properly. They have adjusted it several times in a variety of ways. Are you contending it is not properly adjusted to be tanked by Knights at the equipment level SoE wants?<br />

This act, and how SOE chooses to impliment changes in the coming expansion for Warriors and Knights will make or break my continued support for this game. If they choose to not announce how the warrior and how the Knight will be upgraded I will not buy the expansion and will rely on feedback in this forum. If it changes where I stand as a pure melee/main tank contrary to what I was born for and worked for - I will cancel my accounts.<br />

If in an LDoN hard Assassinate I pop Defensive and receive less damage as a result no on complains. The reduction% of the DI portion is the same. Some Knights even die doing LDoN hard Assassinates, but no one has ever complained. No one has EVER said Defensive makes LDoN hard Assassinates &quot;unbalanced.&quot; A bazaar Warrior may in fact perform better than an EP Knight. They are one-group only instanced content, just like the trials.<br />

If a Knight can tank these, then I don't need Defensive. That doesn't mean that I'm not entitled to waste it if I wish.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I gave it more thought. This is essentially the auto-selection of appropriate challange, the so-called Baby Trials, by another method. Rather than two different boss mobs, we have one that negates Warriors using their D/S/E defining class abilities. I suppose this is equivilant to a different trial for Warriors with a boss mob that they could and needed to use Defensive to beat. Given that I suggested auto-selection of appropriate challange, I can't really object. Except that negating a defining class ability is an absolutely horrendious and lazy way of achieving it.<br />

<br />
When defensive is not up, warriors and knights are currently very close in tanking, with a slight edge to warriors.  Unless we're talking about old content.  Once content has become more trivial for a group, the knights are usually the better tank.  Rolling through an ldon normal, knights of my level/AA/gear are strictly better.  Period.  It's not close.  L70 will make a LOT more of the older content that way.  On challenging single group grinds, warriors are usually a little better than knights.  Some would argue that point and say that paladins are just as good or better.  I don't know for sure.  And of course on named where they can use defensive, warriors are a lot better.  They should be.<br />
<br />
As to the 30% Minidisc 60 sec MiniDisc will put Warriors out of business :<br />
<br />
500-5500 W/o Disc <br />
500-4000 MiniDisc (for 60 seconds)<br />
500-3000 Disc (for 180 seconds)<br />

A warrior has 1500hp more, and the max hit on him considerably lower.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Wont even mention the fact a MiniDisc would create a huge gap<br />
with NoTank classes, that War/Pal/SK are sure to find groups<br />
at any moment there might be a Named around.<br />
<br />
If content is at all challenging and isn't freaking easily kiteable or something retarded like that, plate tanks have little trouble getting groups.<br />
<br />
Just drop this &quot;give us mini defensive!&quot; bullshit already.  It's been going for months and nothing has changed.  An expansion comes out with a few mobs in a few trials that cause some problems and a bunch of knights are crying that they need an across the board boost.  Give it up.  Go commiserate on your knight board about how warriors suck and knights really need this ability and SOE is the devil for not giving into your demands and get that shit away from here already.  The horse is dead, rotted, and even the maggots don't want anymore.  Stop kicking the bones.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not exaggerating at all. That is exactly how it was working at lower gear levels. As long as you had an enchanter along, it didn't matter what kind of tank you had, since the pet was doing all of the tanking anyway. That got you to the boss, at which point the bazaar equipped warrior could pop furious + defensive and survive long enough for the pet to kill the boss. I know this because I saw it done by recruits to my guild, back before there were any balance changes to tipt. Reread the conversation I posted above between a bard and cleric from my guild. It is not exaggeration, it is FACT. The legs I'm wearing were a rot from the group that had THAT warrior tanking....I tried over 20 times to tank Chavoor unsuccesfully, and that warrior tanked him sucessfully multiple times. He actually had a much higher success rate than a failure rate. <br />
<br />
How am I exaggerating?  <br />
<br />
Or alternatively, you could bring along a ranger and have the ranger WS tank the named while the pet pounded on its back. Generally the ranger would die shortly after WS dropped, but Jhiru would almost always die within 10 seconds of WS wearing off. It was ugly, but it was enough to get the win. <br />
<br />
Notice that in both of those strategies, there is no gear requirement for any of the group members beyond being 65, the chanter having CoD, and the warrior having full defensive AAs and good gear, in bazaar terms. That is NOT exaggeration. I know several warriors that fit that description and tanked Jhiru in the method I described. It isn't rocket science. <br />
<br />
Originally, NO ONE tanked trash except the pet unless you were wearing significant amounts of time level gear. It simply wasn't worth it to risk having someone die when you could simply have the pet tank it for much less risk. Can you tell me why you would have a PC tank act as tank with lets say a 20% chance to die per mob with your cleric chaining SL/HL when you could have the pet tank with about a 1% chance of dying with the cleric using CH? Other than the fact that it's incredibly boring for 3 group members to sit there doing nothing because of charmed pet aggro rules? If the charmed pet wasn't available, then yes, a bazaar geared warrior would die many times on the way to Jhiru...but the charmed pet WAS available. <br />
<br />
They have tried to tweak that picture a bit. First they reduced the DPS of the trash mobs a bit, which made it more reasonable for PC tanks at the bottom of the difficulty curve (elemental knights and bazaar warriors) to tank the trash there. They raised the level of the trash mobs which made it harder to find a good pet. That reduced, by just a bit, the total dominance chanters had in those 2 trials. Neither of those changes really fixed the core problem that knights had with the trials, although they were good balance changes for other reasons. Now they have kept the levels high (I haven't heard otherwise, but haven't done a tipt recently) so that pets are harder to find, raised the DPS of the trash, and lowered the DPS of Jhiru while eliminating defensive from the equation. They have finally made it so that they can force a certain minimum amount of gear for success...at least for the tank. <br />
<br />
None of the other classes really have any minimum gear requirements that are comparable. You could bring along a wizard with a 4k mana pool and bazaar bought focus effects without dooming the trial to failure. You could bring a ranger with the snare spell, the WS discipline, and a heartbeat, and his lack of gear would not doom the trial to failure. You can bring along a cleric with crap gear and while your chance of success will be lower, you haven't ruined your chance of success. (I've done Jhiru with an alt cleric...only had to use CH to heal the pet, and you don't need to heal a WS ranger at all, so didn't need much gear) You bring along a tank with subpar gear and it's pointless, UNLESS...you are going to WS tank the named.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Even the first sewers trial is pretty tough. Meanwhile I know from grouping with one that an elemental geared SK will own it, taking through the purifying plant trial easily. So you're just horribly exaggerating here. Try not to make stuff up in your rush for class upgrades.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sewers trials are not really the same as tipt. You can't extrapolate your experience there and have it accurately portray  how tipt works. It *IS* probably pretty close to vxed scaled down a bit (barring the named, which you don't have to do), but tipt is a whole different story. If you can't kill Jhiru, the whole trial is pointless, and Jhiru is not even in the same ballpark as the rest of the mobs in tipt, at least he wasn't. I guess now he is, after the latest patch.<br />
<br />
The point is that now there is at least a relatively similar gear requirement for knights and warriors to tank in tipt, whereas before knights needed incredibly better gear than a warrior for the same chance of success. <br />
<br />
Ask enchanters how many of the immune flags that an NPC can have affect them. Immune to changes in run speed, check. Immune to stun/mez, check. ImmuneOther classes have had to deal with things like this for a long, long time.</div></div><hr />

Graal, this isn't a case for upgrading Knights.  It's a far better case for nerfing charm or the charmable mobs in the trials.  While I'm sure it's effective, it seems like a pretty giimp approach.  But then SoE has never been able to make charm work well because the mobs always significantly outclass the characters in most every way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Graal, my first thought reading your latest post is what Glatius said, in part because i've been arguing that charm is horribly, game breakingly imbalanced since PoP came out.  They knocked it down a little bit during PoP, but it's still insane.  I got partway through Tipt.  2 clerics had a hard time keeping me alive.  <br />
<br />
So what did we do?  Once we got to a charmed pet, we had it tank.  It didn't work terribly well because we didn't have a druid or ranger snarer.  Charm would break sometimes with no snare on the pet and the chanter would be dead before we could blink.  Add snare and it's a different story.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, we lost, but we got over halfway through the trial with the damn pet.  I literally stood  there doing nothing much of the time.  If I dared attack the mob even with ranged, I'd get aggro right away because of the peculiarity of charm.  But it's stupidly powerful.  Charm should be mostly nerfed out of existence in GoD.  Sony is clearly unable to balance it and people still romp through a large chunk of the trial with a charmed pet that puts out the dps of 2-3 full groups over a long period of time, something the spell line was never really intended to allow.  <br />
<br />
The fact that Sony also boosted the dps of the trial mobs back up really, REALLY pisses me off.  At the guild summit they supposedly acknowledged that the bar was set to high on GoD (L70), that they'd alienated many players including almost all of the &quot;non uber&quot; ones, and the implication many came away with was that early GoD would be made a bit easier.  Before the summit they'd even put in that ATK reduction you mentioned.  Many of us thought more was on the way.  Then inexplicably after the summit they boosted the ATK back up.  The mountain trials, something from the first tier of GoD, are now for fully elemental or partly time geared tanks and higher again.  Unless you use a charmed pet, which is stupid and gimp and should be nerfed all to hell.<br />
<br />
So yeah, none of that has anything to do with knight vs. warrior tanking balance.  I'm just amazed that the devs haven't nerfed the crap out of charm in mid to upper tier PoP and in GoD.  It's pathetic that something so game breakingly unbalanced has been left in for so long.<br />
<br />
Sony:<br />
1. Knock the attack levels down on the pre Kod'Taz mobs.<br />
2. Nerf charm.<br />
3. Restore the effectiveness of defensive where it has been removed.  What a lame &quot;fix&quot;.</div></div><hr />

4. No more freaking 1 group required for advancement trials.  There are 6 slots in a group and 15 classes in EQ (it's 15 now right?).  With single group trials some classes always get marginilized and we end up with a balancing mess.  No more.  Advancement trials should be 2 groups or more.  <br />
<br />
We all know damn well we wouldn't be having this discussion if Sony hadn't put those stupid single group, super high dps, required for advancement trials in the game.  That alone should show that it's a content problem, not a class balance problem.<br />
<br />
Sorry, this thread managed 2 things that tick me off:<br />
<br />
Knights asking for defensive as they've been doing for months.  Go away.<br />
<br />
Charmed pets in GoD.  Nerf this crap.  To use the old whineplay phrase, when we do a trial and I as a warrior have to stand back doing nothing while the REAL tank, the charmed pet, does the job, that's a slap in the face.  Warriors and knights both should be your best tanks at all times, not some f#@@ed up offspring of a goblin and a fairy or any other pet.<br />
<br />
I brought it up on everquestlive and was indignantly told by enchanters there that people couldn't possibly be using the pets to tank in the mountain trials and that it's insanely dangerous to use the pet at all, let alone as your tank.  You took a high risk and you still had to have a player do the tanking.  As we know, that's BS.  It's risky whether you use a pet or not because of the insane mob dps and of course, numerous groups have beaten the trial with pets tanking most of the mobs.  Chanters conveniently forget about their charming success when it's a game balance discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is pretty damn gimp...and yes, it is effective. It happens to be the MOST effective method, barring being massively overgeared for the trial. How do I know what level of gear is supposed to be required for these trials? Look at the augments and gear that drop in them. If they expected time gear, the augments would be type 8 like in Kod'taz. If they expected people to be liberally sprinkled with time level gear, why would the gear that drops from the named be such crap compared to time gear? The only thing that doesn't strike me as utter crap compared to time gear are the bracers that Jhiru drops and the only reason those are cool is because of the effect of cleave. Look at the AC/hp/mana and they are comparable to elemental bracers.<br />
<br />
So yeah, none of that has anything to do with knight vs. warrior tanking balance.<br />
<br />
Yes it does. If a bazaar equipped warrior can get to the end of tipt and successfully tank Jhiru but a fully elemental equipped knight with a few pieces of time gear can't, that IS a balance issue. Or would you disagree?</div></div><hr />

We went through backpacks of emeralds on DI and sometimes a mob would drop me before I knew what even hit me, but it brought the fun back into the game where you actually had to always be on your toes. Jhiru was probably doing too much damage, but the rest of the mobs were where they should be (I don't know if they are harder now than when GoD was released, if so they should be put back to that level). <br />

Warriors are suppposed to tank better than Paladins or SK's. The issue was that Knights couldn't reliably tank them at all. This was a content issue. SoE recognized it as such.<br />
<br />
When a Warrior recieves melee damage under Defensive, for four years it's been true that damage=DB(RND(20)*DI/2). That is the four year time tested Warrior unmatched survivability advantage. It doesn't care what you as a Knight is wearing when it's applied or how many people are in the party when it is used - never has.<br />
<br />
I realize that you don't like it. I'd dearly like a 1500HP heal, 90% Res, best HP buffs in the game, GRC, etc. Unfortunately every class doesn't get everything.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they've adjusted the content (it was a content problem) and Knights that ought to be able to do them can.<br />
<br />
If SoE wants to preclude Warriors that can't do 2 trials without Defensive, etc. that's their descision. I still will take less Damage in LDoN hard Assassinate and you still may die there - thanks to Defensive, which works the same in all other 1 group content (PoJ trials, LDoN) as it always has.<br />

Giving mob +100 to Paladin stun is no different than just having some mobs with outright stun immunity, which they already do in GoD.  After all a resisted stun makes no difference so far as aggro, but it'd cut down how overpowered the ability to stun 4/70 for a trivial amount of mana (currently at 80, if you ever managed to stun a Kyv from doing an arrow flurry you save at least 10 times the mana back).  If you estimate yellow+ GoD type mobs have 500 DPS, that puts a stun at more than 12 to 1 damage mitigated per mana, which is about 4 times better than the Paladin quick heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any boss mob of signicence is either immune to stun, or 70+ or a single group mob that can be will be trivialized by level 70 itself, if a group wants to be half paladins then who cares if the DPS is mitigated all to hell, so will the groups DPS.<br />
<br />
Making random mobs immune to stun to prevent its being overused is fine by me. Too many people are looking at tommorows abilities against todays content, and not against tommorows content.<br />
<br />
You dont see groups of 3 paladins + random people ravaging PoV for unbalanced easy XP, you wont see 3 paladins + random people ravaging KT or Tipt either, sure a few people might do it, but it wont be the best XP.<br />
<br />
Raid encounters? Ikkinz? Who cares if trash is easier you wont beable to get to the boss's, nearly everything is rootable or mezzable anyways,<br />
<br />
Uqua? If some guild wants to bring 10 paladins and make traps easy (not that level 70 itself wont make them easy) and then get owned on Tqivs or Barxt because of lack of DPS, who cares?<br />
<br />
Qvic and Beyond Not there yet so cant comment on specifics, yard trash will be easier i'm sure, and boss's will be high enough that it wont matter<br />
<br />
I'm sure that there are a few boss's/encounters that are lvl 68 that might be made a little to easy if player casted stuns on them worked, make them level 72 /shrug.<br />
<br />
Someone go and explain an encounter or a group that would be &quot;trivailized&quot; by 70 stuns, that wouldnt be trivilaized by level 70 itself, i'm sure theres a few, but heh look at luclin after a few months of PoP, its unavoidable older stuff gets trivilaized.</div></div><hr />

While old content being trivialized by new expansion is the natural progression of this game, there are significant content that are still challenging that'd be made trivial by a stun 70 more so than the typical more ac/hp/etc.  At least in GoD there are significant content on the 66+ range that are actually quite difficult that'd be reduced to trivial if a stun 70 is allowed to be in the game without significant drawbacks (stun immunity or partial spell immunity used throughout GoD).<br />
<br />
I think partial spell immunity would be better than just flat out giving random mobs stun immunity, like GoD sewers.<br />
<br />
I'm not horribly concerned about 5 paladins killing whatever level 70 or under old Uber, even though it's clearly a problem, but at least GoD and OoW should remain reasonably challenging even in light of the new spells.  Certainly I can't imagine having a 10% better heal suddenly makes healing in GoD trivial so why should a new stun completely negates ~1/3rd DPS of everything that's stunnable?</div></div><hr />

I don't necessarily disagree that stuns shouldn't be improved as we all hit level 70 and I'm not even hugely concerned with Knights leveling up to 70 as fast as possible and trying to be the MT's starting with the EP's and PoTime.<br />
<br />
But there is a little hippocracy and it's not by Warriors. Warriors claimed that with Paladins stuns, a Monk stunning via a SoT, a Ranger using WS, an Enchanter charming a Pooka, a Cleric, and a second healer Paladins were able to get through Vxed and Tipt in pretty good shape.<br />
<br />
Now we are doomed to five more levels of Paladins claiming my stuns don't do anything, they're always interrupted, they're partially resisted, OMG lolZ ^_^<br />
<br />
Fear is a defining ability for SK's and it's totally nerfed in the high end game. Warriors first got stuns with Gnollhide Lariat and SSoY. Our ability to stun since the very beginning has been nerfed harder and longer than Paladins.<br />
<br />
Nope, no love fer SK's (the dark-haired changling) or Warriors (the red-headed step-child). The Golden Haired one needs attention. And when getting it may say 'Well a lot of mobs are tagged immune, resist, partially resist, reflect, etc. stuns don't DO anything!!!'. Gah, I can see it now.<br />
<br />
Heck, one Paladin actually parsed a stun immune croc in PoEarth trying to show a poorly equipped Warrior under Defensive was superior to a less poorly equipped but still gimp Paladin. Note he didn't fairly show the Paladin efectively stunning the mob like most of the yard trash in Vxed and Tipt can be stunned.<br />

<br />
Not only that, but what's even more amusing is that the Paladin actually outtanked the &quot;crap warrior&quot; while the &quot;crap warrior&quot; was using defensive, but the measure used (DPS taken) was misinterpreted as that the warrior tanked better, when in reality, the Paladin took a lower percentage of their HP per hit than the &quot;crap gear&quot; warrior, reducing healing intervals, THE SOLE MEASURE OF TANKABILITY.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point.  If the Warrior is still getting down to 40% faster than the Paladin then he's going to require more healing than the Paladin, regardless of the fact he's actually taking less damage per hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see, so L70 paladins with no AA should be infinitely better tanks against most pre-oow exp content (and maybe some raid content) then a L70 warrior with 500 AA?  That's what highly effectively L70 stuns will do.  Healing goes up say... 10%.  Normal tanking goes up... say... 10%.  Paladin ability to mitigate mob dps on all old mobs that aren't specifically tagged immune goes through the roof.  Net Result: in groups especially plus any raids where a boss isn't stun immune, for most pre-oow content plus probably single group content in OoW, the paladin would absolutely blow away warriors and SKs on the tanking front.<br />
<br />
Later expansions trivializing earlier expansions is no excuse for this type of BS.  Multiple effective stuns against any content, if those stuns can be kept up with mana wise, effectively make the paladin the best tank by a fairly wide margin.  It happens on very old content right now and it's not a big deal.  As far as i know it doesn't happen much on PoP content, which is as it should be.</div></div><hr />

If a bazaar equipped warrior can get to the end of tipt and successfully tank Jhiru but a fully elemental equipped knight with a few pieces of time gear can't, that IS a balance issue. Or would you disagree?<br />
<br />
How can this be hard to understand?  The ONLY reason your guild's bazaar geared warrior is getting to the end of the trial is because the freaking charmed pet is tanking for him most of the way through the trial.  That's a problem with charm, NOT with tank class balance.  Warriors rock on named targets.  They always have.  That's what defensive has always done.  Take out the stupid ass overpowered charm though, and the warrior doesn't even make it there.  <br />
<br />
So yes, it's a balance issue.  Charm is stupidly overpowered.  Is it a warrior vs. knight balance issue?  Hell no.<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
To me the main issue with GoD is still how utterly, ridiculously hard they've made the early GoD content.  Sure the late stuff should be harder than Time, blah blah.  But this is pre kod'taz crap we're talking about.  They supposedly acknowledged that GoD was released as considerably harder than intended, yet here we still have the mountain trials as insanely difficult.  They drop gear that the tanks capable of doing it wouldn't want anymore.  That should be a good clue.<br />
<br />
The bigger clue though... THE premeire method for getting through the trials is to use a freaking overpowered as hell charmed pet that routinely takes down mobs in 10-15 seconds, going so far as to tank with the pet if you don't have a fully elem or better tank because it's simply better.  How can any dev with a single brain cell left look at that and not know it's fucked up?</div></div><hr />

Do you seriously think GoD should be an alternate easier path to PoTime quality loot.

I disagree to a point -- expansions are meant to introduce new content, and to sort've trivialize old content.  You can single-group loot in Bastion of Thunder Towers that is VT quality, if you're good enough.  You can single group gear in Ikkinz or beyond for gear that is PoTime quality.<br />

Before the nerf, six people in a night could get 6 time-quality drops (I think -- Haven't done ikkinz3 yet so I dont know if theres 2 nameds there or not) by doing all 3 single-group trials.  That's one drop per person per night.  In PoTime, you can take 50 or 60 people and get maybe 40'ish drops depending on what you get in p3.  Less than one drop per person.  The loot reward for a night is about the same, with the only difference being that it will take you less nights to be completely farmed out.</div></div><hr />

How easy is it for me to single group a solro mini to get VT'esque loot, or a BoT mini, or even some of the minis in the EPs (see water for instance)?  Avatar of War can be single grouped now; Most of Sleeper's Tomb can be single grouped, Trakanon can be single grouped.  A single group in LDoN can get boots better than Boots of Storm, or a better bp than trakanon drops, and the list goes on and on.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz, in my opinion, is on par with the loot.  You can't just take any tank there to win it, you need a high-EP geared warrior to kill the DD, and the loot dropped is an upgrade for the bare minimum needed.  Just like you need a tier3-EP geared warrior for tipt, and the loot there is pretty much an upgrade for anyone involved.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz is a step above Tipt, still.  And the expansion provides loot a step above the previous expansion.  Sounds like everything is where it should be.</div></div><hr />

It is a &quot;Class Definining Ability&quot;. If it weren't meant to be in existance - why would Sony have given warriors Defensive 2.0 (ie Stonewall)? If it were a mistake - they made it twice.<br />
<br />
I remember Brenlo stating that Paladin's simply won't get defensive. Someone here has it in their signature. What has happened now, is the reverse. Inestead of giving paladins defensive to match warriors, we have the result &quot;paladins and shadowknights wont get defensive, so Warriors don't get it either&quot;. If this is the sign of things to come (ie Further removing defensive) then there is going to be a *mass* exodus of warriors. If you aren't going to give paladins defensive because they aren't meant to have it and it's meant to be a warrior *ADVANTAGE* why take it away from warriors for the encounter? IT'S THE SAME END RESULT!!!<br />
<br />
If my cleric overheals and dies, yet we don't wipe. I can't rez the cleric. A paladin can, and you can continue from there. Warriors get to start over from zone in. There are advantages and disadvantages to each class.<br />

The problem here is - as has been said before - the encounter itself. Stop fucking around with/nerfing class abilities and start fixing the *ENCOUNTER*.</div></div><hr />

It's part of the game, not some evil mistake that should be fixed.  If there was no defensive there will be something else that makes Warriors that much better as a tank and Knights will be complaining about that instead.  I estimate Knights currently have about ~90% the tanking ability of a Warrior because defensive exists.  If not, hybrids are supposed to be 75/25 melee/caster, which logically means hybrids really should have 75% the tanking ability of a Warrior, and I can assure you that you won't be tanking anything meaningful if that's all you had.  Instead Knights have 75% the tanking ability of a DISCED Warrior, and 90% of an undisced one, which is why you can actually tank some stuff as opposed to none at all.  <br />
<br />
Defensive discs are what allows encounters to be difficult and warriors to tank better, like the way it should be.  Anyway there's plenty of ways to code around defensive, and it's used fairly frequently in GoD.  One of the easy named in Txevu hits from 1000-1200, so not much help from defensive there.  But even on mobs where you can't use discs, Warriors are still better, because that's the way it ought to be.  That's why you have a spellbook and I do not.  <br />
<br />
On another note, I've been testing my Fleshbiter on various trash throughout GoD.  It appears the lower end mobs have more stun immunity than I first thought (since I can't stun them without a Fleshbiter so I had no way to tell previously).  If they leave Kyvs ~75% partial immune to stuns like the way they are in Qvic+ areas, plus throw in some random immune to stun mobs like what you find in GoD areas, maybe a stun 4/70 won't break the game as much as I thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the only thing hybrids shouldn't be able to excel in above what the &quot;pure&quot; class can is their specific strength.  Knights can never have a claim to pure tank aswell as a warrior, but they can make a strong claim to tank aswell as a warrior when all things are considered.<br />
<br />
They hybrids are just classes who use a different means to get to their specific field.  Rangers won't do the melee damage a rogue will, but their spells will/should push them up well above a warrior.  A paladin/sk shouldn't mitigate as well as a warrior naturlaly, but their spells should make them rough equals, aside from raid targets.  75% of one thing and 25% of another is nothing.  Its not a class that is viable.  Taking parts from two fields to be able to completely fill a certain role is workable.  That is why all hybrid spells should be bent toward their primary field, whether that is tanking or dps.  And...most are.  <br />
<br />
99% of all of this is subjective is all.  Should warriors dominate all tanking or just raid tanking or even that much?  Should hybrids be meaningful classes in their own right or should they be pushed into some horrible mixture of worthlessness?  Is it good to balance all classes for all encounters or just the pure classes?  Should hybrids bend their two halves to one purpose or basically play one of two lower level characters depending on the situation?  <br />

It may be your fondest dream that Defensive will be removed and that SK's will be within a few percentage points of Warriors (easily overcome with a piece of equipment or 2) and still have their spells books, but it's not likely to happen.<br />
<br />
It's not likely to happen because the developers know Defensive is a Warrior class defining ability. It won't be shared, you won't be getting it, it won't be removed.<br />
<br />
From the January 2000 patch message:<br />
Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks.<br />
Guess what, y'all weren't intended to taunt better than Wariors much less that much better.<br />
-------<br />
From the original class descriptions, ocassionally modified and maintained to the present time, Knight have not been equivilent to Warriors and had spellbooks. Y'all gave up some tanking and DPS as a cost of having a spellbook.<br />
<br />
Through reassurances the the 2Hdr update wouldn't threaten the Warrior role as primary tank.<br />
<br />
To a recent reminder that like it or not Warriors will always tank better than Knights.<br />
<br />
Neither Verant nor SoE has ever suggested Knights should be Warriors with Spellbooks. The opposite has been the case - in GoD the content was adjusted, not classes.<br />
<br />
As the game stands now, Knights can not become Warriors simply by equipping a high Avoidance item or obtaining 15% Shielding. Knight are warrior/caster hybrids - not Warriors. In any guild there is more varience between Wariors then that you suggest between the classes.<br />
<br />
So long as Warriors are fundamentally a one trick pony the game is likely to stay that way (and so long as SoE wants to continue having Warrior subscribers).<br />
<br />
I suggest any angst you are experiancing is best assauged by SoE insuring that you can perform your role in raids, which btw is not the Warrior role any more than a guild can do Uqua with 10 Druids healing and all the Clerics staying logged out.<br />
<br />
Four years sir. That's a long time to be playing one class and wanting to play just like another, while retaining all of the advantage of a spellbook.<br />

Yep. The content was adjusted, nerfing defensive.... making warriors pretty much to be paladins, without spellbooks. Our pony got hisself nerfed in the content Knights were bitching about.</div></div><hr />

The use of the phrase &quot;taunt spells&quot; strongly suggests Verrant used the word taunt to mean aggro event generation.<br />
<br />
Ariakkas observes:<br />

I specifically used that quote to indicate early intentions. Since it was contempory, it in fact holds water. Knight claims that Wariors were given a Knight originally intended from the begining class defining ability, adequate aggro, is demonstrably bogus.<br />
<br />
For quite awhile SoE drifted away from &quot;The Vision&quot; much to the detriment of the game. When pure melee pointed out just how far this drift was with the Warrior innate ~386HP advantage after AoTC, Knights having an aggro advantage Warriors were intended to have and in combination with their many spells Warriors largely /lfg in LDoN, and LDoN three zones largely populated with undead to create even greater joy in the Paladin community - I think SoE had to look at how far they drifted.<br />
<br />
Until Smedly suggested that developers were too scared to admit they hadn't completed GoD and it was designed for level 70 characters, the only explanation that made any sense to me was:<br />
<br />
Thwarted in efforts to maintain Knights as god classes when developers looked at the Phase 1 Update and corrected long standing imbalances, designers knowingly created an expansion where the defining Warrior class ability would be unbalanced in groups and addtanking thus accomplishing the same end by requiring either sharing Defensive or having it removed from the game.<br />
<br />
Fortunately either way it happened, flat out error or designers who despite protests to the contrary enjoy creating powerful Tank Mages, content adjustment was made - game over. Knights don't need Defensive.<br />
<br />
Your spellbooks distinquish you from pure fighters. While all fighters must be able to get experiance groups, it is your spellbooks, and the focused specialization skills of pure melees in the one things they excell at that gives us all a reason to exist as distinct classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Blind&quot; era was in no way better for the game than &quot;The Vision&quot; era. It resulted in the loss of many many subscriptions. Developers DO need to remain faithful to major features of the original game and design encounters to reflect the traditional roles of players. In an effort to put their own stamp on the game it drifted from these principles and we got imbalance, &quot;aliens&quot; to fight and one-group trials that could not be in the end balanced with all player abilities intact.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazak</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the original quote:<br />
<br />
Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition to some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks.<br />
<br />
Here's BB's interpretation of it:<br />
<br />
The use of the phrase &quot;taunt spells&quot; strongly suggests Verrant used the word taunt to mean aggro event generation. <br />
<br />
I just don't think this parse of that sentence is correct, or at least I don't think the interpretation is the only reasonable one.  The quote refers to a &quot;change&quot;, and &quot;some of the taunting spells&quot;.  So, there is clearly a distinction between the &quot;change&quot; and the &quot;taunting spells&quot;.  The way the sentence is constructed, the &quot;change&quot; seems to refer to the balance between knight and warrior &quot;ability to taunt&quot;.  This &quot;change&quot;, plus the &quot;taunting spells&quot; is supposed to improve the situation for knights as tanks.<br />
<br />
I have no idea about the actual content of the patch in question.  In reading this out of context quote, it seems to refer to a change in knight taunt skill levels.  I've played a knight since late 2000, but to be honest, I don't remember if taunt skills were changed then.  Perhaps someone else does.<br />
<br />
To me, this seems like a soundbite quote that lacks the context to make it meaningfull in one way or another.  It smacks of sloganeering, and I don't think it adds very much to the discussion.  Perhaps, however, I am wrong in this and the context is well known.  If I'm flat out wrong, you have my apology in advance.<br />
<br />
In any case, I think the point may be moot soon.  Supposedly, the dev team is working on &quot;Class Definitions&quot; as we speak.  If this is true, soon enough, we'll have a clear idea about what they actually intend for the various classes.  Whether that will help balance is another question entirely, but at least we'll have their vision stated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the time, mana and mana regen was nowhere near as abundant as it is today, and &quot;taunt spells&quot; weren't something that could be easily chan cast to maintain aggro.   The change was made because warriors and monks owned the hell out of knights in the aggro department.    <br />
<br />
While I VERY often disagree with BB, this time isn't one of them.   They didnt' change the taunt skill for hybrids just because.... there was a real problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariakkas</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your all for them staying true to the original concept of the game, so long as it furthers your own personal agenda BB...and everyone here knows that.<br />
<br />
people may look back on original EQ fondly, but it's like looking back to when you were a kid, and you did something stupid, got throne in jail....15-20 years later it's funny as hell, would you want to spend your entire life in jail tho?<br />
<br />
i think even you can admit if original Eq would have stayed with the vision, EQ would not be here today, plain and simple...it sucked, it put unreasonable restrictions on people, it required massive and massive amounts of playtime, drops were few and far between, and people HATED the devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazak</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'm very happy that aggro control is now more balanced.  I don't think anyone intended for warriors to be dramatically superior in aggro control, and I don't think anyone intended knights to be dramatically superior.  My contention is simply that this quote describes an intended balance where warriors are superior with the taunt skill, while knight have less skill in that area balanced by spells with high taunt values.  It turned out that the taunt skill alone was insufficient, so they added additional skills for warriors eventually (yeah, it took way too long).<br />
<br />
It seems like BB is trying to make the claim that warriors were intended to be clearly superior in aggro control, and I don't think this quote supports that claim.  That doesn't mean that I think knights should be clearly superior either.  It's possible to strike a balance of strengths and weaknesses in this area, and actually, I think they've come pretty close.  None of the tanks are inadequate in any area of aggro contro, and knights and warriors both have areas of particular strength.<br />
<br />
The interesting thing to me is that this quote refers to a &quot;balance&quot; consistant with the state of affairs in the game at that time, but no longer functional in todays environment.  I think it demonstrates the folly of continually returning to what people thought then as a means to determine what should be done now.<br />
<br />
Another thing that I find curious is that BB seems to always try to be a &quot;strict constructionist&quot;, when it comes to class roles, etc, but that he adds a good deal of interpretation in his references.  It's true that the class description says things about the &quot;most brutal fights&quot;, and such, but nowhere does it mention high DI mobs as equating with this.  He, and maybe others have made that connection, but it's not a necessarily clear one.  One might consider fights with numerous adds to be the most brutal, ones with a nasty aoe, ones with numerous nasty procs, or even ones with high DB to be the most &quot;brutal&quot;.  Who the hell knows?  There's certainly a case to be made that high DI mobs are what &quot;brutal&quot; refers to, but that doesn't make it fact.  My complaint is that BB uses a bait and switch with a lot of his arguments.  He quotes something from SOE as the bait, then pulls the switch and feeds you a bunch of interpretation acting as if it's fact.  All that said, I actually have some sympathy for some of BB's ideas about SK's in particular.  I don't want defensive, and I don't want to tank the boss mobs current to my guild.  Any fix to knights ought to come via the things unique about us, rather than copying a skill unique to warriors.<br />
<br />
Setting that aside, I hope the designers are asking themselves what is good for the game now, under current conditions.  I hope they come up with class descriptions that fit with their answers, and in doing so, come up with clear, fun roles for both warriors and knights, both in and outside raids.  If they accomplish that, I think alot written in threads like this will be moot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My goodness Nazak, I'm going to agree with you!! (in a second)<br />
<br />
What Ariakkas can't or doesn't want to deal with is that EQ does have traditions and a history that grew out of Class Descriptions and some early descisions. SoE has been burned very bad as a result of straying from those principles.<br />
<br />
SoE has an interesting task in front of it. Having focused on expansions (which bring in revenue) they have to look at classes. They can't take Primary Tank from Warriors or Prime Healer from Clerics - they will, I assure you, quit enmass.<br />
<br />
They must decide how pure class superiority at a fundamental role fits with the need for all classes to have a role. I believe the answer is NOT class blurring, but class specialization. Group heals, flash heals, stuns, Root, rapid-fire aggro, etc. ought to make Paladins for example add tanks without peer. Finding a role for SK's is more of a problem, but their ability to &quot;cripple&quot; a mob (which could be equivilant to &quot;burst mitigation&quot;) inspire fear in it and do damage in a variety of ways ought to be the foundation used to create a raid niche.<br />
<br />
I return to the Class Descriptions because they are the best documents we have access to which show class abilities and differences. It is these abilities and differences that should enrich the game and give classes their raison d'etre.<br />
