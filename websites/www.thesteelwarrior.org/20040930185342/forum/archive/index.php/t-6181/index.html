Kerasian Axe of Ire<br />
46 dam 37 delay    AC 5<br />
Str 15 - Dex 15 - Stam 20 - HP 125 - Endu 100 <br />
Rage of Keras (worn)<br />
+40 ATK<br />
+40 HASTE<br />

Ratio puts our 2HS to shame.  Overall its makes all three of ours look pretty gimp.  We got a 36  / 41 whoot.  A simple boost in ratio would help ours.  Maybe all the old ones need a boost.  I know the pally one is weak for instance.   But I do not see this happening.<br />
<br />
It pays to have your class designed later in the game obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well...the Kerasian axe is a good epic and by contrast, the warrior blades are a lousy epic, especially given the amount of work required to get it (and we've all heard this a zillion times before, right? ;)).<br />
<br />
If anything needs to be done to the warrior epic to make it a better set of weapons is to just drop the delay of the one-handers from 24 to 20. 14/20 is still not better than a lot of the stuff that comes out of BoT and other Tier 3 PoP planes, and it's still below the BoC in functionality, but at least it's competitive.<br />
<br />
Likewise, the 36/41 two-hander needs to be closer to 36/36; then it might be used, though 36 is still crappy delay for holding aggro (would personally prefer 30 or 31, but I'm not holding out for a 36/31 epic anytime soon).<br />
<br />
Ain't gonna happen, but it's nice to dream. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A guy in our guild got his Berserker epic this weekend and i have to say it is pretty cool looking and as far as epics go this one blows ours out of the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say they went a little overboard with Zerker epics.  I don't believe that they should be toned down or nerfed, but I do think that the other Epics are long overdue for an update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;It pays to have your class designed later in the game obviously. &quot;<br />
<br />
Not really. Playing catch up, this late in the game's development, is a distinct disadvantage. Even with mudflation in place.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the zerker epic has a better ratio than all the other epics in the game. That's pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
And threads like this are going to be everywhere.<br />
<br />
But it's really kind of stupid. (I'm probably wording this wrong. I'm NOT saying you are stupid. And I'm not attacking you. I'm just trying to make a point about how the panic and fervor and what not over this epic is misplaced, and very nearsighted. So stupid's probably a bad choice of words).<br />
<br />
Anyways, allow me to illustrate:<br />
Who here besides me (with my warrior ALT) actually still USES their epic?<br />
<br />
Even if they made the warrior epic ratio better ... MOST of this community wouldn't bother to get it out of the bank.<br />
<br />
And the same exact fate awaits the zerker epic. Look at the stuff that's slowly leaking out of Gates of Discord. The zerker epic will end up banked or destroyed just like every other in the game that doesn't have a mana-free Rez clicky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You refute what I say with not really.   Then comment playing catch up later on in game  development comment is an distinct advantage.   Pointing out that subconciously you maybe agree Supes.    That is exacly what I was saying.   <br />
<br />
Yes, its kind of irrelevant Superchum.   But  its kind of not fair at the same time but then life is not fair.  I agree that the ratio is all that would need messed to make ours more on line.   Certainly not looking for a nerf of another class or item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They made a epic weapon that has decent stats for the current content that is all.  In the time of Kunark the epics were godly but that is a long time ago.  If you want the old epics upgraded to be just as good then why not upgrade all older weapons to be just as good as todays.  That might not male alot of sense to do but this whole fucking thread doesn't either. YAY for being a whiney bitch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">doesn't have a mana-free Rez clicky <br />
<br />
OR a rune effect with +3 mana regen OR a singing mod OR off hand 41% haste and +ATK<br />
<br />
Believe it or not allot of epics are STILL worth while long after melee have banked there epics. <br />
<br />
I don't really have a point here except epics are not dead and they had to give BZR something to go after.  Plus, some of the BZR mobs are fun to fight )  /hiccups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jofa Hate'Maker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its fair and balanced.<br />
<br />
The epics are class defining, and for the most part, i dont see the problem with giving the zerker his weapon.<br />
<br />
The other *pure DPS* classes, get epics that guaruntee their DPS to be solid.  15dmg backstabber with atk and haste, and bard haste with atk.  <br />
<br />
Given any less, with the current architecture, would place zerkers low on desirability, compared with the other *pure dps* classes.  <br />
<br />
Warriors got an aggro proc.  Paladins can bash without a shield.  Sks get a lifetap.  All appropriate, from a class-defining point of view.  (maybe a group heal proc would have been better for paladins, but meh)<br />
<br />
I admit, the ranger epic is baffling, in how it *defines* the class.  Other than the tree hugger names.<br />
<br />
I am not going to go into the caster epics, they have their own scale of usefullness, and necessity.<br />
<br />
If berzerkers were given any less, it would be an insult to the definition of their class.  DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i saw it when i stopped over at gnomb and kilaara' guild board; it's a neat looking weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They should do what they did with the fiery avenger quest when they added epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, this new zerker epics gives me hope that someday they might make an epic quest upgrade to upgrade the current epic if you already have one.</div></div><hr />

True, but some of this community (those of us in tiny friend/family guilds) might bother finishing the epic and might use it, as opposed to simply going to the bazaar and plopping down 20Kpp (roughly the price of one single MQ piece of the warrior epic) for a CHoS/SotB combo and looking like every other non-raiding warrior out there. :D <br />
<br />
I don't expect that a slightly upgraded warrior epic will be of any particular interest to people who have ST/VT/PoPt3+ gear, but it would be of some value to those of us who still use bazaar or Velious gear for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/shrug<br />
<br />
They gotta find some way to sell this lame ass class.<br />
<br />
Even though I really enjoy the idea of a beserker, that axe was the first time I had any remote interest in the EQ beserker. Only lasted about one day though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">After seeing the Epic of the Zerker, I have to admit I'm really impressed with it, considering the amount of work to obtain it.<br />
<br />
But Its still not enough to make me Level a Zerker to just get the epic, yet.  Still thinking about it, but Probally just use the extra time to work on AA's and some LDON points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Selaradrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I still use my epic.<br />
<br />
i play in a small guild, and quite frankly after all the damn hassle of getting it, im damn well going to use it...<br />
<br />
(oh, and im not in a raiding guild, so getting better weps is kinda dificult)<br />
<br />
but back to the original point, the DMG/DEL really does suck and i never use the 2HS,thats been banked from day one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, if they made an Epic that sucked (like ours or Pally / SK does, compared to bazaar obtainable weapons), they could have just stopped implementing it at all, couldn't they?<br />
<br />
Although I think they went a tad overboard with it, it really should be better than a Windblade or War Marschalls Staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Like a lot have been saying, if they didn't make the Zerker epic worth it every berserker would just be wielding a windblade or WMBS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then they'd be in the same boat as everyone else who's not in a hardcore raiding guild. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LastLizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">... or unguilded or in a small family type guild or just playing with 1-2 friends for the sake of playing.<br />
<br />
My personal rant about the zerker epic are all the people with &quot;I banked my epic 3 years ago and if you haven't, you must be some sort of loser&quot; attitudes.<br />
<br />
For lots of melee epics 2.0 would be a very nice goal and upgrade. <br />
Screw that &quot;fabled&quot; stuff that brings back the old &quot;get in line and wait 3 days for the chance of a camp&quot;. That's so '99 it makes me want to quit EverGroundhogDay .. again :P .</div></div><hr />

I saw something that someone claimed was the epic and I want to see if it's true or not :P</div></div><hr />
