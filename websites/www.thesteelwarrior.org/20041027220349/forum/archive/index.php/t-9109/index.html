<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My helanic BP and Visor  doesnt have the type7 aug slot, altho if u look at magelo it will say that it should have and also on allakhazam,  the other pieces of helanic i have does have the #7 aug slot.<br />
<br />

I'll see about finding some BD's when I get home and whip up a bp and visor.  How many pieces of Helanic do you have?  Need to know if any other pieces are lacking a slot. <br />
<br />
None the same, if they be without slots, I reckon I'll send in a bug and throw something up on EQ Traders as this does sound a bit odd.<br />
