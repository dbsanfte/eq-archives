<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While knights are off learning about magic wouldn't it make sense that warriors are fine tuning thier bodies and finding the best armorers? If this were the case then warriors would be physically able to wear an underlying leather armor and have the time to find the best armorers to make this work. If underneath our breastplates,helms,arms,legs,guants,and boots we could augment our plate with leather type armor would this seperate us from our magic weilding bretheren sufficiently to offset knightemization?</div></div><hr />

Not one of the many Inns in Norrath sports a bathroom, let alone a shower. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this idea has a bit of merit since armor was layered in past history by real knights. plate over chain, leather, cloth etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im not sure if they could even implement the code. Althou it would be cool. There is a larp out there that lets you stack armor you get 1/2 the benifit of the suit under the top and 1/4 and then 1/8 for stacked suits.<br />
<br />
IE Plate upper level full effect<br />
2nd layer chain 1/2 effect<br />
3rd layer leather 1/4 effect<br />
4th layer cloth 1/8th effect<br />
<br />
It would be neat but most likely not going to happen<br />

vack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What good would it do to have 10k AC if the mob won't stay glued on me? That, and I don't relish the idea of having to buy/aquire even more armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Besides, some Leather armor has as much armor as our Plate armor - It would be hellishly hard to balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are 3 areas where I believe warriors need attention: poor itemization (knightemization), increased agro generation, and group utility. Allowing warriors to wear leather under their plate would restore one of these problems ie) the ac/hp gap that mudflation has nullified. Unlike ldon augs, which take time, make this a warrior only quest, &quot;find the armorer&quot;, that can quickly restore warriors to the &quot;far hardier&quot; tank class. This quest should take no longer than handing in a parchment did for casters. Perhaps make a parchment the cost to the NPC armorer to make a warrior a piece of this leather armor. SoE can decide how much ac/hp to be augmentable, a set with 100 ac and 500 hp seems about right to me.</div></div><hr />
