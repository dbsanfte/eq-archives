<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed some really strange things in my parses lately. I need to get some solid length ones put together to try and work out what's really happening but these are some facts:<br />
<br />
When we had our 5% mitigation increase it was supposed that this meant a mob would only hit for max of DB+19*DI on a warrior. Well I clearly have parses of straight up fights where a mob hit me for 20 different values which perfectly fit DI+DB ... DI+20*DB.<br />
<br />
I have noticed some &quot;odd&quot; hits landing on me too. For example a mob who's DB is 129 and DI is 50.25 hit me for 178, 179 and 181. No discs, no runes, no nothing special at all, no shielding or other Time level effects. And yes I removed kicks, bashes etc.<br />
<br />
Another fight on a well known mob that has DB=200, DI=25, I took hits of 213, 225, 238, etc. It looks like I used stonewall or defensive but I absolutely did not. I even checked the log over and over and I didn't disc.<br />
<br />
So maybe some mobs have been given 40 Damage Intervals, it sure looked that way... Here's the real kicker though it hit me for 238, 245 and 248, none of which follow any logical mitigation or a 40 step Interval. Then the pattern follows right again 263, 275, 288, 300, 313 then up pops 319 before back to 325 where it should be. Further up the scale I see 413 and 414!<br />
<br />
The same mob also hit me for 533 which is outside the bounds of stonewall mitigation to put it beyond any doubt that I did not disc. That is a blow for 533 if it were while /stonewall-ed would have been a full hit for 867 which is DB+(26+2/3)*DI, and since it wasn't mitigated by stonewall then how did a mob do DB+(13+1/3)*DI?<br />
<br />
Anyway I see numbers like these on a lot of my parses now and I think it could be something to do with the 5% mitigation. I thought it maybe mitigates Random(DB/20) but that doesn't fit the numbers right. There again on all the fights where I just two-boxed with my druid, that I have looked at so far, the numbers fit the good old 1-20DB rules. Maybe it's something to do with reaching a certain AC, around 1800 or more? Maybe it's a bit of both, maybe it's something else entirely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts? Other than asking me to check my numbers - I spent the last 4 hours puzzling over them and checking logs by hand to be sure my eyes weren't deceiving me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, ignore all the strange numbers then. What about this extra 5% mitigation? Anyone else see mobs still hitting them for 20 distinct values?</div></div><hr />

Posted my thoughts on a previous thread and didn't get much of a dialogue either way:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you have to remove the top di and redistrubite the di over 20 intervals again. and change def/stone from 1/2 to 45%<br />
<br />
a temple guardian      db80      di10<br />
<br />
min 90<br />
max(pre mitigation) 280<br />
max (post mitigation) 270<br />
<br />
resolve for di and stuff<br />
Damage = DB + (x*DI)<br />
DI (Damage Interval) = (max hit) - (min hit) / 19<br />
DB (Damage Base) = (min hit) - DI<br />
x = integer between 1 and 20, inclusive<br />
min hit = DB + DI<br />
<br />
(270-90)/19 = new di 9.47<br />
90-9.47= new db 80.53<br />
<br />
depending on weither our -5% is aways active you should get a spread similer to that. if our -5% is not always active or can be bypassed you will get the pre mitigation #'s and the  post mitigation # all at the same time creating 40 different hits, toss in vie/guard and it adds another 20. vie guard can be bypassed as far as i know allways generating a extra 20 possible hits.<br />
<br />
on smaller di mobs you could easly get 2 numbers rather close 210,211 and if our -di can be bypassed then 210,211,212 if the di is small enough.<br />
<br />
even with our -di the mob still has to hit for 20 intervals that wasn't changed. iirc many have reported the min hit hasn't changed either. because of this def/stone wer changed to 45% instead of 50% mitigation. to = the orginal 50%<br />
<br />
i think i got atleast most of this right Tug would prolly have to clear it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What determines x?<br />
<br />
Sorry if this has been said elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What determines x?<br />
It is thought to be governed by your AC and the mob's ATK.  We have a fairly good handle on the distribution that it produces, after 5 years of analysis, but the exact equation is unknown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jazun</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So each mob has a different distribution as well or does it seem generalized per zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">x is 1 - 20 the intervals it can hit for.  10*di +db= what you get hit for at di 10 or half damage. so temple guargian interger 10 hit pre and post is<br />
<br />
x=10<br />
pre 10*10+80= 180 also max hit in old def/stone<br />
post 10*9.47+80.53= 175.23 (175) need to add one di for max in new def/stone 175.23+9.47= 184.7 (184 i think forget type of rounding) max in new def. commonly called the defencive nerf or sony math.<br />
<br />
this is also all theory till someone can generate proof. <br />
<br />
max 357 min 79 standard normal ldon mob all 65 group.(+- 2 max per lvl of mob. min stays 79 for some reason though) <br />
di = 14.63<br />
db = 64.37<br />
<br />
max 372 min 79 for non war(knight in this case)<br />
di= 15.42<br />
db= 63.58<br />
<br />
esentaly we get hit for slightly less then 1 damage per di slowly working up to 15 at di 20. in a 30-45 second fight against a slowed normal ldon mod it equates to nill difference in tanking. well any real difference can be covered by 1 tick of blessing of replenishment.<br />
<br />
the main thread with all the info is in the library http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=13<br />
<br />
i'm curious if vie is cumalitve or additve subtracting 5% from the real mitigation giving us a full -10% or -2di, or if it goes off our modded di, and we get like -8%(madeupnumber) essentaly our -di from real or innate -5%, and the a additional -5%(-1di) off our new di?</div></div><hr />
