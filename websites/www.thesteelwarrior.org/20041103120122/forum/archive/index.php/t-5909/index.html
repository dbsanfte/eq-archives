<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalantek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">its just kinda bugging me, im wearing really gimp Indicolite ams and dwarven plate greaves,<br />
<br />
as far as buyable goes, the only items in this slot are expensive and dont seem like they are THAT good.<br />
<br />
Ornate is too damn expensive, though i am getting BoT groups and hoping for drops.<br />
<br />
My velious faction is decimated from any standpoint, the ST key drive jacked dragon faction, the dain belt farming destroyed the coldain, and im still threateningly to giants, so velious items are pretty much not a option<br />
<br />
Whats a warrior to do? where can i find some half decent arms and legs with 2 or 3 groups of 65s? im to the point of considering crustacean.<br />
<br />
Im gonna check out LDoN items, but if anyone has any ideas, id appreciate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the 750 LDoN ones are nice, and a big upgrade to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68492 are pretty decent, and seem to be a pretty common drop from the random named fly (Sludge-Eating Fly) in the Lair of Trapped Ones sewer instance.  Also drops this mask: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68498 which isn't too horrible, either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dear god no.<br />
<br />
1) Tae ew: farm scales from 4c area in CT<br />
2) 760 LDoN<br />
3) The orcish greave thingies from EC LDoN reg<br />
<br />
Drawing a blank...I'm sure there are more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Check out the ones from Veksar, that armor series name is escaping me atm, but they are a nice tradeable set of armor, Kylong or something like that.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're doing ST then I assume you're also doing NTOV or heading there after ST.  You will find decent arms and pants in NTOV as dropped loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Check the Malevolent arms and legs on my magelo, they are the EF LDoN plate armor (to get the real stats on the arms, substract the augments hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">EF LDoN vambs and greaves are very nice.  Tak armor seems to be a little nicer generally, but over 1400 points per seems a little excessive to me.  Both EF and Tak armor sets are about the equivalent of ornate though, and have 2 or 3 aug slots each.  Kylong shinguards from the feral lord in Veksar are also good, AC 34 and some nice stats iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a little time, you can repair any one of those factions, if you had to. Or as someone else suggested, hit up NToV for some usable arms/greaves.<br />
<br />
Then again, 760 point LDoN greaves would probably be pretty easy to scrape together the points for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goyan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Whats everyones opinion on everfrost arms verus the nro arms? Is it really worth 2x the cost to get the nro arms if you do not have a lot of points?<br />
<br />
Another thing, would you get tak/everfrost legs if you had ancient wurmhide greaves?</div></div><hr />

It's worth it in the long run to spend the extra points...if you aren't in a fairly high raiding guild(i.e. high end Luclin through high end GoD. If you are in a guild like that don't bother with ldon armor). As far as Wurmhide Greaves go: Tak yes, Miragul's no.</div></div><hr />

kylong shinguards from Veksar - 35ac, 45hps legs</div></div><hr />
