<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have a formula for how much ATK you get from STR at different amounts?  Are there soft caps for the ATK you get from STR similar to other stats?  I know for example that below 255sta I get more than 8hp/sta, but over 255sta it drops to roughly 4hp/sta.  Has anyone done tests to figure out how much ATK you are getting from STR?<br />
<br />
I currently have 213str unbuffed at level 65 and do not have any ranks in planar power (PP).  I have an Ancient Prismatic weapon that procs Avatar though and brings me up to my max of 280str (as will most any good set of shaman buffs).  I'm trying to figure out how valuable each rank of PP will be for me apart from the small hp-from-sta I know I will get.  I figure the AGI and DEX gains at that point would be of less interest to me than the ATK gains I would get from the STR so that is why I focus my question on that.<br />
<br />
I will get PP eventually, but I'm just trying to plan it out and do it when it will benefit me most to do so.  I am still working on my defensive AA skills, so I will at least wait till after I finish those before I do any PP.<br />
<br />
So do any of you have some numbers or formulas for ATK that I might find useful with info on STR above 255 and up to level 65?</div></div><hr />
