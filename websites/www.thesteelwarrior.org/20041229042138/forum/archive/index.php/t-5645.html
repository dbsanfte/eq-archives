<br />
Was in a 4 hour raid in febrisomethingorother last night, killing dk blues junk to red bosses, got just under 1 yellow of group leadership in a 28ish person avg level 65 raid (all ele or time geared, was blender time until we ran into a named &quot;packmaster&quot;...).<br />
<br />
Since the cheapest group leader ability is like 6 pts, they aren't gonna come fast by any stretch.  Pick yer group leaders now and stick with them for the long haul if you ever wanna see any benefit...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience of leading a BoT Tower raid last night:<br />
<br />
Did Auliffe's tower as the raid leader (but not a group leader... wanted to spread the love ;)).  We cleared all giants on the way up to Auliffe with 31 people (way overkill, but everyone likes loot) and in that time I got 75% of a leadership point.<br />
<br />
We were going to go on and do Eindride's tower, but I got killed when I ran off Auliffe's platform without lev (waryurz iz smurt).  Had to leave raid to get an invite from a necro at GY to summon me for rez.  I then got back into the raid and was made leader again.  We cleared up to Eindride, and in that entire time I didn't get any leadership xps at all (and yes, it was still turned on from the leadership window).<br />
<br />
Thus, I'm thinking that it's currently bugged such that when leadership transfers within a raid it no longer attributes the xps to the right person.<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm / refute this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, with regards to &quot;Raid Leader&quot; xps, it's going to work out naturally that the people who lead raids will eventually get these skills.  The raid skills don't really break down into &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots&quot;, as such, because most folks in game don't want the burden of raid leading... the ones who were doing it before are likely the same ones who'll continue to do it in the future (just that with these skills they might do it more effectively).</div></div><hr />

If you click the L button, then turn off leadership exp, when you turn it back on it will give a message that says something to the effect of &quot;20% of your exp will now go to leadership exp.&quot;  It doesn't clarify if this is only aaxp or regular or both, but I would assume it would act like splitting up aaxp and regular, so it would take 20% from whatever you are doing at the time and add it to leadership.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I can certainly see this causing plenty of drama in both exp groups and raids.  Oh joy.  I can also think of a few jackasses who will powerlevel their leadership experience and then use the fact that they are &quot;leaders&quot; to try to get more influence on raids and such, or at the very least spam raid chat with &quot;OMG this is a level 62 cleric with immunity to stun!!!&quot; from 5 different people on every mob that gets pulled.</div></div><hr />

so time well tell but I forsee alot more clerics getting group leadership roles when they are incapable of utilizing it to the fullest by virtue of thier class.</div></div><hr />

More people will be forming groups, rather than joining groups.  Younger guildmembers with more leadership points will be vieing for positions of leadership, based not on their ability to make decisions, but solely on some odd feat they bought with experience points.  And, of course, the community will have to develop a protocol to decide who is leader in random pick-up groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like building up a super-tank for the guild is a bad idea.  Spread the love around between several raid leaders and you seriously reduce the problems of people leaving.  Our guild has about 6 warriors that play MA on an alternating basis, depending on who shows up to the raid, and we don't focus gear on any one of them.  Likewise, we have 4 or 5 people who lead raids on a regular basis, and they'll build up their leadership points gradually to the point where it won't hurt us much if one of them decides to quit.<br />
<br />
We used to auto-assign clerics as group leaders for raids, but recently stopped doing so.  The clerics were getting a little burned out with having to deal with buffing, healing channel info, and group chatter, so we started assigning the group leader roles to officers or exceptional individuals (preferrably warriors, wizards, rogues, etc., who don't have much in the way of buffing duty, heh).</div></div><hr />

Just because they have leadership abilities and are leader of the group doesnt mean they have to be the ones in charge lol. So on a raid when your making groups, see who has the best abilities and make them group leaders, tough stuff.<br />
<br />
And I don't understand the issue with what if someone with the leadership abilities goes MIA. The game worked fine without them before, I just consider them an extra and do not intend on depending upon them.<br />
<br />
Though I force my guild to PL my leadership AA !</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it will be the type-a personality cleric or enchanter who gets the group organized, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problems I have with the leadership points:<br />
<br />
Let me preface this by saying I'm both the guild leader and raid leader for my guild.  I'm not the MT (usualy 2nd tank or ramp tank) but occasionly if the MT isn't on, I do that as well.<br />
<br />
1) Technical problems (bugs and bad coding)<br />
A) In every raid I've been on, both with my guild and guesting with others, the raid leader has also been a group leader.  However, you can not accumulate raid leader and group leader xp simultaneously.  This makes sense, but in order to maximize the xp for your raid, it's now neccesary for the raid leader to not be a group leader.   By itself, this wouldn't belong in this section except...<br />
B) If you transfer raid or group leadership to another person, you continue to receive the raid/group leader points, they don't.  This is at least how it works in raids, not sure if it works the same in xp groups.  This means that if you're forming the raid and you want to maximize the xp, you can't simply form your group and transfer group leadership to another player.  Instead you must first raid invite the person you want to lead your group, then have them invite you.  It's a pain in the ass and adds one more thing to worry about for a raid leader that's already dealing with other issues.<br />
C) The raid leader xp bar is broken.  I'm thinking it's just not correctly updating itself.  When the xp bard fills up, you actualy have somewhere around 1/2 level and it will stay full (and unmoving) until you get enough xp to actualy ding.<br />
<br />
2. Gameplay issues<br />
A) xp groups fighting over who gets to be the leader is not fun.  Restricting these points to just one person makes no sense unless the person designated leader (as opposed to the person that actualy runs the group) is inane.  <br />
B) OMG please give 0 group leader xp to group leaders in raids.  I beg you SONY, do not give them points for leading groups in raids.  I have more than enough issues to deal with while making groups as it is, I don't need 20 people asking me to be the group leader while I'm trying to make balanced effective groups.  I'm having flashbacks to Vellious when everyone tried to be the KS group and get all the xp and I had to deal with that.<br />
<br />
How to fix the system in one easy step:<br />
Take all the group leader bonuses and make them AA's instead.  Let those that enjoy leading groups buy those AA's.  Then when we form groups instead of fighting over who gets to be leader, we can instead figure out who the most effective leader would be based on their points.  People that enjoy leading groups will have the best group leader skills, those that don't won't bother buying them.  Take the raid leader skills and make them drops from boss mobs.  Make the drops semi rare/uncommon and either have boss mobs drop either a) an item that is redeemed with your trainer for a certain number of points or b) a tome like the melee discs that can be turned in for a specific raid leader ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaruk</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Podling is right.<br />
<br />
If leadership abilities were just AA skills, then groups could change leader based on circumstance.  If the group is heavy on casters, then it would benefit from a leader with mana regen abililities, or, if it's heavy on melee, then a leader with the dps enchancement would be optimal.  A group with no crowd control could use a leader that increases the group's hp, and so forth and so on.</div></div><hr />

:Endquote<br />
<br />
Actually, the way it is set up, people have to be willing to tolerate you as a group leader for quite some time before you can get those skills.<br />
<br />
If you could buy them as AAs then someone who has never led a group in their life could just buy them and then claim to be the best leader because of their &quot;points&quot;.  <br />
<br />
There are people out there I wouldn't pick as a groupleader no matter how many AA they had.  And there are people who I'd follow even if someone else had more &quot;leadership&quot; points.<br />
<br />
At least the way the system is, you have to have someone who<br />
<br />
a) actually has to lead groups <br />
b) is selfless enough to give up the 20% of their experience in the meantime to get something that improves their group more than themselves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaruk</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the problem is the competition this generates between group members.  And while it is true that many people will consider it a selfless act to devote xp to leadership for the good of the group, it's also equally true that there are those power-hungry individuals who will use this ability as justification to always be in charge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Podling</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ayida you would be 100% correct... IF being the group leader had any meaning.  Up until now, the group leader was generaly the person who put the group together, or the person who was defaulted when the old leader left and was replace, or someone made group leader for the purposes of evacing to invite a coh, etc...   Being the group leader does not confer upon you any authority.  How many times have you been in a group with someone standing around waiting for an invite and everyone saying &quot;who is the leader&quot;?<br />
<br />
Now the group leader is the one that either wins the argument or the /rand.<br />
<br />
The real leader of the group isn't neccessarily flagged the leader and never has been.  Most xp grinds don't really require a &quot;leader&quot; anyway.</div></div><hr />

It will be trivial for someone with a bot army to accumulate massive amounts of leadership xps in the same way that they do with regular and AA xps now.  Well, ok, not trivial, but certainly not as hard as going the &quot;pickup group&quot; route.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems like while leadership xp takes 20% of your XP it is not based on what XP you earned.  Today I was leader for like 2 hours grinding low blues in Qinimi, got like 1/2 of a leadership AA, and then I was a group leader in a Ferubi raid, and got antoher 1/2 of a leadership AA, and no way that raid's XP came close to what we got in 2 hours of low blue grind.  <br />
<br />
I think leadership xp is a function of the mobs you are fighting and that is it.  That means, if I'm fighting a level 68 mob it doesn't matter I did it with 2 guys with me as the leader or with 71 other guys, it's still the same xp.  Certainly raid XP have to work like that to make any sense (no one would ever make anything meaningful raid XP if it's 20% of your share of raid XP).</div></div><hr />

No other group leader had a noticeable jump in xp.  Is it possible that only one group leader per kill is getting xp?  Or is it a case of the UI being buggy and just not accurately reflecting the xp given?<br />
<br />
Also, the leadership xp defaults to on, but today in order to earn points I had to manualy turn it of and back on again after each zone.  Although the button remained in the &quot;on&quot; position, it appeared to be actualy defaulting to off.<br />

Ahhhh, the good old days.<br />

I agree the whole leadership exp bar and being leader meaning anything needs to be kaboshed and just move those AA's to an optional &quot;Leadership&quot; AA tab with no prereq's except within it's own grouping.<br />

<br />
<br />
Agree.  It's bound to be a point of contention.  <br />
<br />
I've noticed xp in Hard LDoNs is less than usual.... about 60% per (1 hour+) adv instead of 75% or more.  <br />
<br />
At one point during an xp group I was getting zero Leadership exp.  On a RZ raid where I was groupleader I got about a yellow and a blue for the whole  raid.</div></div><hr />

Since our guild can be a bit slow to mobilize at times, I've announced that preference for group leader spots will go to the people that get there first.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are times where group set ups don't allow for this but the response has been pretty good so far.  We're not mobilizing any faster, but it gives me a good way to tell people &quot;No, you can't be a group leader&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With reference to your earlier comment about group leaders, I suspect that is true of more folks than my comment.<br />
<br />
But my personal experience has been that the group leader coordinates a lot more than that and that a good one makes for a smoother better group over time.<br />
<br />
You're also right that the &quot;groupleader&quot; and the group's leader has not always been the same person at the same time, though maybe more folk will pay attention to it. <br />
<br />
My experience this week has been that folks are going &quot;Hey, anyone here giving up their 20% for leadership points?&quot; and having at most 1-2 folks go &quot;yeah, I'm doing that, if no one minds&quot;.  Shockingly civilized....<br />

The leadership exp always turns itself on when I zone. But strangely enough, even if I don't catch it it does not look like the exp is moving in it. I did /bug it tonight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my take on leadership experience. I will refrain from working on any leadership experience until I have finished up most of what I consider the important AA's introduced in GoD. I might even consider knocking out a few more in PoP also before I tackle leadership points.<br />
<br />
My reasoning is this:<br />
<br />
I reduce my AA experience by possibly 20% for choosing to acquire group leadership points.<br />
<br />
The value I gain from choosing leadership experience only kicks in if I am selected to be leader for a group. So, it may very well be that the leadership abilities I have earned may not be used at all at times. Whereas regular AA's are being used all the time whether I am selected as leader or not.<br />
<br />
The value of someone elses hard work and effort for earning leadership experience is shared by the group, so basically I share in the rewards anyhow even though I didn't put out anything for it.<br />
<br />
By not choosing leadership experience I don't consider that an obstacle to me getting a group because for not having chosen leadership points I have gained AA which is permanently available that adds to my effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I could see where getting leadership AA early on would be an asset if you were consistently grouping with the same persons and you were always going to be the leader. This would allow you pretty much 100% use of leadership points spent to be used. Everyone would benefit for it, but you would have been the one to take a 20% loss in your regular AA acquisitions.<br />
<br />
I think they can be fun, and have value. However, for me I see some real nice AA's out there which will keep me busy for awhile. Until I have acquired these AA's I probably won't focus much on leadership AA.</div></div><hr />

I have been /bug-ing, /petition-ing, /feedback-ing since GoD went live because everytime my leadership aa bar fills up I don't get a point. Now I know why. I'm at 4.8 bars filled now (I try to make one each day to see if it's fixed!) so I should finally get a point tomorrow!<br />
<br />
Raiding you do need 18 people in the raid to get Raid leadership points. If you have less then group leaders earn group leadership points, if you have 18+ they stop getting it and only the raid leader gets it (though that's bugged to hell too).<br />
<br />
Grouping you need 3 people to get leadership exp. I need a third PC and account now... /cry.</div></div><hr />

I mean, a target thing, dessignating a MA? Bah all that crap are mainly UI fixes that EQ missed from day one and other games give for free.<br />

Seems to me like it is worth it, and honestly there are so few useful points in it, it shouldn't take long for a lot of folks to have it maxed. You can earn what, 8 total points?<br />
<br />
I say, if someone wants to deal with the pita of being a group leader just for points, let them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe it is 8 max saved, just like 30 max AA saved.<br />
<br />
I agree though that it won't take terribly long for people to max out the good ones and move on.</div></div><hr />

Does that mean you won't be getting LR/ID either?  You could join a group where you won't be selected as tank, therefore it would be better to maximize your DPS AA first since they will be used all the time whether you are selected as the tank or not?</div></div><hr />
