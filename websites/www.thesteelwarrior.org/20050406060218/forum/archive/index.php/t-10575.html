So far I've gone from Shimmering Flat's the Basilisks lower 30's drop very fast.<br />
<br />
Scralet Monestary for SoS and Shield then Alterac Mt's the Crushridge Ogres (Non-elites) (Also great area for mining Iron and Some mithril) Late 30's to low 40's<br />
<br />
Badlands quests and Uldaman for a while until I completed all the quests.<br />
Anyone else used the ogre caves in the SW corner of badlands. The caster ogres drop in 6-10 seconds for me and are 200-300 exp. The lords take a short bit longer but can be solo pulled just as easy, just remember to clear behind you and pull them away from other ogres since they call for back-up when they get low on life. (Also great Mithril spot)<br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna go grind on the Dunemaul Ogres in Tanaris see how fast they drop for me now that I'm a couple lvls higher.<br />
Does anyone have any good undercon exp grind quality spots for late 40's early 50's on up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there are any undercon in the sense that you've a mob that cons level 50 but somehow hits 50 damage lower than anything else, I'm not aware of them.<br />
<br />
If you mean easy to kill mobs, almost any caster is easy to kill.  Dunemaul ogres are easy not because they're really that easy (brutes are actually really hard for their level) but because half of the spawns can be casters (Warlocks/Magis).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK then does anyone know any high caster population low 50's on up spots I should look at after I spend a few lvls pissing off dunemaul Warlocks/Magi?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jaedenar guys in Felwood is about half caster half melee, but respawn seems static (i.e. static melee always respawns as a melee) so you might be able to do better than 50/50 on those.  However, the mage type there do have Fire Blast which is 100% uninterruptible.</div></div><hr />

I heard the Ironroot in Felwood are good 50-60, but I just went back to questing over doing those.<br />
<br />
I honestly think it's more worth it to get instance exp 55+, BRD/LBRS etc seemed to give as much exp solo per kill not to mention you're killing faster and you usually get a few quests done each run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gin</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From 50-53ish I ground on the Harpies in NW Feralas. <br />
- low HP<br />
- rarely contested<br />
- lots of mobs<br />
- humanoid, so they drop cloth for bandages<br />
<br />
From 53-55 I have been doing the Scourge in western plaguelands.  They range from 50-56, with areas being conveniently broken up by level.  Sorrow hill (congested) has mobs 50-52, Felstone Field (lots of room) has 51-53, and Dal... Dalt... the next field over has 52-54.  And so forth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trivan</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I am only 35 atm - I cant help with the higher lvl - but can come up with a few good lvl 25-35 spots !<br />
<br />
In general Harpys are uppa exp mobs imo - low hp, soft armor, low hp run !<br />
<br />
<br />
Lvl 15-18 (Horde only)<br />
NW part of Barrens - Harpy area - area divided into 2, one half are lvl 14-16 the other lvl 16-18 mobs<br />
<br />
Lvl 25-29 <br />
Charred Vale in Stonetalon Mtn - area is kinda divided into 2, one half has lvl 23-25 harpys, the other lvl 25-28<br />
<br />
Lvl 29-32<br />
1000 Needles, harpys again, at the cave where you do Test of Endurance (horde), mobs are lvl 28-30 - biggest problem here are the INSANELY fast repops<br />
<br />
Lvl 32-36<br />
Desolace - Centaurs - there are lots of them, also fast repops - and nicely split, so you fairly easy can kill one at the time<br />
<br />
I have been doing these centaurs for the past 2-3 lvls - at lvl 34 I was bringing in 10k exp pr. 30 min solo - no buffs - no help - if it wasent so boring I would be leveling faster - hehe<br />
<br />
Anybody know where I can find lvl 35-40  Harpies ?<br />
<br />
Trivan<br />

<br />
These were exactly who I was going to reccomend.  Dont hit that hard and seem to drop very quickly.  No to mention they are spaced very nicely and never a single add unless you want it.  There is a quest for them in Gadgetzan too.  Plus, mining nodes.  TSilver/Mithril/Iron yum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ogres -  cept the the ones in deadwind pass, lightning shield sucks...when i grind out xp, i do it on ogres, then go back to quests around 2+ lvls above me hopefully...<br />
<br />
drop cloth for bandages...and they seem to be average AC and damage output<br />
<br />
duskwood level 28ish<br />
hillsbrand&lt;sp&gt; level 30ish<br />
alterac&lt;sp&gt; 34ish<br />
badlands 36-42ish<br />
blasted lands..dont remember level<br />
tanaris 46-48<br />
deadwind 51ish i think?<br />
burning steppes 52ish..dont remember for sure<br />
