<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple question.. Is it worth trying too hold agro with a 2H weapon for HARD ldon adventures.. If so what weapons do you recomend. I can get an anger3 aug for it.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where in the game are you? It's worth keeping aggro with whatever gives you enough aggro to let others do the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What I forgot to write was.. stupidily.. Was I wanted a 2H weapon too lessen ripostes.. I dunno what I was thinking.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What level are you? What weapons do you have access to? What weapons are you using now? <br />
<br />
  Sure a 2 handed weapon is less ripostes and generally more DPS, so in general the answer to your question is yes, it is worth it if you can hold aggro. If you're putting anger 3 on a finesteel greatstaff, then no, it's not worth it. <br />
<br />
  If you're over 56 and using bazaar bought weapons, do a search on any of the 100 threads on Greatstaff of Thunder. If you're swinging around a Darkblade of the Warlord and Edge of Eternity, then you're going to take an aggro and DPS hit with basically any weapon you get and it's probably not worth the lessened riposte damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a Greatstaff of the Four Winds auged with 125 ykesha that I can use in some Hard LDoN groups.  It's minimally acceptable agro in my opinion.  I'm considering auging a GSoT with 100 ykesha just for use in hard missions where I need more agro.<br />
<br />
2-handers are the way to go for most hard LDoN and PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">65 100+ aa's. I never have money that I can spend cause I'm always saving up for something. Any ideas on 2H weapons are fine. I always find a way too make the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GSoT or WMBS is the best buyable way I can say for pure DPS and agro. I can hold agro very well with my GSoT at 55 in LDoN and PoP and I paid a whole 46P for it in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used an unaugmented GSoT just fine until I got GSo4W and put angerIII on it, both work well for LDoN hard. GSoT didn't do enough dps for me though.</div></div><hr />
