<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do SoDs still drop on your server? If they do, then sure its a viable option for an agro weapon if you can loot one. If you are going to have to spend plats to get one, I don't think its worth the ridiculous price when you can get a weapon that is 95% as good in a couple of hours of exp or if you are really lazy you can buy one for under 20k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err, that's not a complaint.  That means it's a great weapon, your friend is just an idiot for using them when he's not tanking.<br />
<br />
The SoD is an insane weapon, but definitely not worth the price tag these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but as I stated before should I get two Enraging Blow weapons or one Enraging Blow weapon and a DD weapon like OSoW ect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDON provides the opportunity to buy DD procs so especially now I'd focus on EB weapons.  So far we dont see any +hate procs coming close to EB, but there are DD's out there.</div></div><hr />

I still think SoD kicks ass , along with BoC I shouldnt have any troubles. But hey , if im going to spend 200k on one its worth it. The point is that for 200k+ that it will cost you to get an SoD, you could get a Copper Hammer and quite a few upgrades that would give you FAR more benefit than the slight difference between a CHoS vs. SoD.<br />
<br />
On my server, there is an SoD for sale for 225k. For that money you could buy:<br />
<br />
1. Copper Hammer - 10k<br />
2. Helm of RZ - 80k<br />
3. Featherwood bow - 60k<br />
4. LDoN Warlord gaunts - 60k (I forget the name, 90hp 34ac and stats)<br />
5. Mosquito leg earring - 15k<br />
<br />
So which would you get more use out of? That's why for MOST people buying an SoD is a waste of plats.</div></div><hr />

slap something on that thing :D<br />
<br />
definately if you can smack around AoW that thing isn't out of reach for ya's.</div></div><hr />
