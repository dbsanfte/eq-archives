I was curious as to if mirror 3 is good enough agro to want to keep that sucker mainhanded over MoM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wouldnt mainhand a mace of memories. slow delay. if i were you id ditche the ornate stone battlehammer and get a real agro weapon, like a copper hammer of striking, for obscenely less pp than an ornate hammer costs. other offordable solutions include sword of the bloodsworn, and even the cheap sludge covered short sword has better stats, ratio, hps, and a lifetap proc which is probably better agro than the ornate hammer due to the direct damage alone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried the Ornate Stone Battlehammer in my late 50s and went back to the CHoS/ SoBS combo. I realize the latter is used by many but in addition to being a &quot;thrifty solution&quot; they are good aggro. Maybe sell the Ornate Hammer and buy and armor upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mirror has aggro similar to someone casting a buff on you during battle.  In other words, not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarvok</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just won this hammer as a cash roll so before selling I thought I would play with it for a while. I have done no real parsing with it, but I did group for about 4 hours in WoS with it. I had no agro issues at all, I tried small experiments like had the enchie chain tash, Rogue run duelist, Wizard overnuke, and pally chain stun. There seemed to be an agro snap back when M3 proced.<br />
<br />
I have WA5 and I mainhand a BoC with Anger 3 aug, so I generally dont have agro issues, but I didnt see any difference between the battlehammer and CHoS.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would share my experience with the weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks but next time try to give relevent test result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you were off handing the Ornate Stone Battle Hammer with the BoC mainhanded.  Well of course you didn't notice much of a difference with it in offhand in that setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The proc itself causes little or no aggro but if you reflect a spell that can generate aggro, then it will.  ie. mirror proc lands on yourself, it reflects a snare spell, aggro generated.  From parsing the hammer with my beastlord, it had a terrible reflect rate and should not be relied upon for aggro generation if you have other weapons available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if we could reflect Touch of Vinitras (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2859) or Cazic Touch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=982) with this Reflective Skin (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6494) spell from that Mirrored Mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=56017).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since Cazic Touch is a completely unavoidable proc, and Touch of Vinitras is a casted, avoidable( well timed DA or group DA bard song) spell...I'd be willing to bet you can avoid Touch of Vinitras with that mask, and I'd LOVE to be the guinea pig!</div></div><hr />

Means 1.5 sec you would be vulnerable and you wouldn't be doing any melee dmg. That basicaly makes you worthless for a fight.<br />
<br />
Only time would be good is say on inc cast before mob gets there and head on to tank.</div></div><hr />

1. it's 5s cast time<br />
2. it isn't a DA. You aren't invulnerable. You can still fight and cast spells but all spells casted on you will actually hit their casters not you. thus the exiled would Death Touch himself for 20kHP !!! and you can still melee.<br />
but yeah, you can't really chain click on it (especially us with our uber 0 chanelling skill) since you would get onnly 1s to move or do whatever you want.<br />
but still, on timed heavy spell hiter it can be efficient for a none MT to step back and cast that just before the 3kAE pops up.<br />

have fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Modified Mirrored Mask, so it is no longer no rent and poof on death, however the click effect only works inside Anguish.<br />
^^^^ from patch</div></div><hr />

What I originaly posted.<br />
Duration 1 tick lol. 6 sec you are invulnerable to spells and its self only with a 7.5 cast time. Means 1.5 sec you would be vulnerable and you wouldn't be doing any melee dmg. That basicaly makes you worthless for a fight.<br />

<br />
1. I conceed I read wrong it is 5 sec cast.<br />
2. a. I never said it was invulnerability I wrote &quot;6 sec you are invulnerable to spells&quot; but good try. <br />
b. &quot;you wouldn't be doing any melee dmg&quot; you can not melee nor cast other spells while you are casting an item even a clickable. I was not saying while the spell was on you you could not fight try reading into stuff more eh?<br />
<br />
The point of the item is the let you avoid the zi ae for anguish I believe.  Don't quote me on that but as I recall it's like a death touch and the key to anguish protects the others part of the 85/15 gimping plan not positive.</div></div><hr />
