i thought it was rather humorus at first, but after i read it i started to really question if other classes knew how agro worked. in the forementioned thread, aside from one person, it apears everyone has a small portion of the information, or is totally in the dark. <br />

Still, if all the first poster was doing was the heal, I can't figure out how he ganked the warrior's aggro. I wonder if he left out the part where he slowed/debuffed/dot'd the mob or something.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
 DPS is *the* most important factor for aggro generation of a tank. Whoever tells you otherwise, doesn't know better.<br />
 <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
 A Warrior using Stonewall has a lot better hate generation than a Warrior using defensive and that's because of the higher DPS as the proc rate remains the same. <br />

While I wasn't on this particular raid he speaks of, I can pretty much guarantee that he's competent and wasn't slowing/debuffing/DoTing the mob before the heal that gained him aggro.  The nearest thing I can tell is that on the instance he speaks of the MT perhaps got stunned on inc and didn't have the chance to incite, get any procs off, or attack at all.  I personally never have any trouble keeping aggro off of him.  On the bright side my brother seems to have mostly payed attention and appears to have more of the basics down than some of the fools over there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
last year, when SoE separated the disc into four timers, we gave then name depending on their aim : utility, defence, offence/DPS, immunity. and of course furiousgets in immunity. <br />
thus we can argue that furious isn't an defencive disc since it isn't in the timer for defence, but some could say that being partially immune is a kind of defence thus furious could be seen as a particular type of defencive disc.</div></div><hr />

The ac debuff effect on the proc is generally considered to be decent aggro, and obviously anger3 is as well.  Lord knows I've kept aggro pretty well with 2-handers that are vastly inferior to that ( Gaudralek, for instance).  I don't really know why you'd pull aggro over that club with one smallish heal.  Maybe his 2hb was at 10 or so and was trying to skill-up while tanking.  ;)</div></div><hr />

I have no idea at all why he wasn't able to keep aggro off of you. In fact, if other melee had engaged for very long, that heal shouldn't jump you over them, either. Let alone anyone else doing anything nasty to the mob with spells.<br />
Were other healers on the raid having this difficulty?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the potential threat aggro of the weapon,but,your bro prolly told you that.I switched to my BOW from my BF/BOC combo.Aggro actually got better not worse for the most part because of the higher dps threat of the weapon.Yeah,over time I gave up some procs and sometimes some hate,but, on engage the BOW was better.My wifes a shammy and chain slows dots and stuff for xp groups.No aggro problems at all.I MT'd for my guild from POP thru Time and still tank stuff when I have time or there's something about the tanking that I want control of.Even with trash if I want I have np holding aggro most of the time with my knights chain stunning and debuffers cranked up on incoming.Two handers are not all that bad.Our BOW warriors have good aggro on our raids even with the 1k aa mages and wizards blowin stuff up.WTB mages concussion tho...  :eek:  <br />
<br />
When RZ finally drops a 2nd DBOTW I'll upgrade.Hehe ,still holding onto my DKP.We had one that went to our third assist and his aggro is still not hugely greater in practice tho he lacks some offensive aa.I still MT tough aggro mobs /shrug.None of our warriors had a VDD.This board always considered it has a poor mans BOW tho.That ac debuff is good aggro.The high ratio is also good aggro.Neither alone would do it well but the ratio,proc and an a3 aug should do fine.Especially, if you're talking about shammy heal/slow aggro.So I dunno where the problem was.A bad day...whatever.VDD is the best weapon a lot of warriors can get their hands on for awhile.I prolly wouldn't of dropped my BF for anything short of a BOW,but, I assume he was using the best he had.<br />
<br />
The shammy board folks should stick to casting stuff omg.At least they should come read the last couple years of Steelwarrior. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A VDD is a pretty solid ghetto aggro weapon. If he has A3 in it, you shouldn't have any trouble. Hell, I can tank with my GSo4W with a lifetap and get away with it most times.<br />
I have to wonder if he had managed to incite the mob already, or if he even had attacked. Perhaps the mob attacked him on inc, and stunned him, and he literally hadn't gotten a round off or managed to incite.<br />
<br />
A smarter tank probably would have hit furious or fortitude immediately so you wouldn't have had to panic-heal him.  Then again, maybe there were down from that last scary pull.<br />
<br />
Also, I've noticed shaman heals to be pretty high aggro. I was botting my wife's shaman through an lmm backflaging run the other day and kept getting aggro for healing the bard in my group with tnargs. It seems unlikely that it would be higher aggro than other heals, but who knows.</div></div><hr />

While my original post on the shaman boards sparked a heated debate on agro generation (and enabled a few shaman to display thier lack of knowledge) I do not feel anyone there was able to sufficiently answer my question.<br />
In that case, this place would be a good place to try the question again. :)<br />
 Why would a warrior with access to a weapon like Vanazir be using it to tank? <br />
Depending on what other weapons he might have, the Vanazir could quite easily be his best weapon. And considering the fact that he takes less ripostes while using a 2H weapon, it makes sense to use it.<br />
<br />
Could somthing as simple as weapon selection contribute so significantly to my repeated trips to bind that evening.<br />
Yes.<br />
Within reason offcourse.<br />
<br />
In the case I used as an example I had not malos'd, slowed or doted (I don't even mem dots on raids) before I died. I simply watched the tank engage from range. His hitpoints droped very quickly (probably a high 1 round damage spike) to 70% so I started a fast heal to help buy my clerics enough time to get the heals rollin. My fast heal (Tnarg's AHA2, IH4, 2.6 seconds with 20% spell haste) landed for a grand total of 1648hp. It was not a crit and it bounced him from 40% to just above 50% (about what I would expect on an +11k tank). The king turned on me and squashed me.<br />
In this case, it looks more like a fluke of some sort.<br />
<br />
It *is* quite possible that he has been stunned right at incoming, in which case he'd have almost no aggro. Lets assume  a worst case scenario, where he only had one round of attack to build aggro before he got stunned. No procs yet would be likely, and he might not even have had a bow shot. He might, or might not have gotten off his Bazu Bellow (level 69 version of provoke line), but we'll allow for it. That's still not a lot of aggro !<br />
<br />
Using the hate formula that Valkargen supplied in the thread, we get a formula something like this :<br />
<br />
 Mainhand = (D + DB) x HM<br />
 Offhand = D x HM<br />
<br />
D = Weapons Damage<br />
DB = Weapons Damage Bonus<br />
HM = Hate Multiplier<br />
<br />
Vanazir, being a 2H weapon, is therefore a Main hand weapon.<br />
(it has a Damage Bonus of 47 at level 70 according to LUCY)<br />
Thus you get :<br />
<br />
(60 + 47) * 1.2 = 128.4 hate per hit<br />
<br />
If he's unlucky, he doesn't roll a double attack either and Ripostes don't count as aggro AFAIK.<br />
So now all he has is what his bow gave (if he used one) + Bazu Bellow + 1 round of attack.<br />
<br />
Lets say he used a bow with real low damage (ie. low hate too), or he skipped it on that one and opted for Bazu Bellow right away instead, we remove that part. We already saw that 1 round of attack with a 2H weapon can be as little as 1 hit and no proc = 128.4 hate. And Bazu Bellow is 600 initual and 100 every tick afterwards for 1 minute.<br />
<br />
That's 128.4 + 600 = 728.4 hate as a minumum, probably a tick as well ... so 128.4 + 600 + 100 = 828.4 hate.<br />
<br />
I do not know how much hate a heal generate .... but if it's half the amount healed (that's what I've heard once long ago, for direct heals), you could have had 1648hp / 2 = 824 hate.<br />
<br />
That's awfully close, *and* you did it more recently, so that might affect the AI to pick on you too. Offcourse, this is all speculative, since we do not have the source code and all that. And most of this hinges on how much aggro you get from the spell.<br />
<br />
You might want to ask an SK to help you figure out how much aggro your heal gives.<br />
<br />
Similar stuff happened to me all night long. I don't believe I did anything that I wouldn't have done in support of a guild raid that night yet I died many many times. Understanding this is important to me because I spent far to much time on that raid getting rezzed, re-buffed and cannin back enough manna to be useful again. Your thoughts brave warriors?<br />
Personally, I don't think you did anything wrong either.<br />
But from playing a cleric to 61, I do know that fast direct heals tends to be more hate giving than any other heals. So one have to be careful with them, or you might have a MOB wailing away at you real soon.<br />
<br />
Heal Over Time spells are *much* less aggro btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xolerus</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well guys, first of all you need to think that everything in this game depends on the situation. For some mobs (I would say most of them) your DPS isnt a big deal if you have good proc weapons, I mean, with a Bloddfrenzy + Innovator´s Hammer I could easily hold aggro on all mobs I tanked including PoTime ones, ALTOUGH, there were some particular situations where I couldnt hold aggro at all with that combo (not that both weapons were anger3 augd) and everyother tank with for example BBB (Seru´s Weapon) could do it easily and over aggro me, that happened with Plane of EarthB nameds. Yeah, those guys have a self mem blur that was being cast all the time, SO, anyother person in raid with more DPS than me was &quot;stealing&quot; aggro.<br />
I am one that prefers dual weild instead of 2hands, but thats just MY preference, other tanks just prefer 2hand weapons and thats fine. If you have a decent weapon, and believe me, VDD is a really good aggro weapon, doesnt matter what do you prefer, you will be able to hold aggro for most situations.<br />
So for people saying that aggro is only based in &quot;proc rates&quot; you are wrong, and the ones saying that DPS is the only thing that gives aggro you are wrong too, depends of the situation and in most cases aggro will come from both sides, procs and DPS.<br />
<br />
Xolerus<br />
<br />
PS: Note that high DPS is better for initial aggro, while more proc rates are better for long term situations.<br />
Thats my 2 cents, fell free to agree or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, Xol it's a blend hehe.Weapon setup aggro is determined by the quality(Procs &amp; Ratio) of what you are using.Not just if it's a 2hander or 1hander.Yeah, there's a tendancy for 1handers to generate more procs and 2handers more &quot;threatening&quot;swings ,but, it's not that simple.I loved dual wielding and now I like both.Saying all tanks must dualwield is dumb and it's totally false.<br />
<br />
Atm the best aggro setups use 1handers.If you don't have one of the uber one handers you use what you have.I tank Quarm and time Zeks every week.I tank lots of hard hitting trash and GOD stuff as well.We tend to assist very quickly and I hold aggro fine with my BOW.With GOD and OOW ratio stuff flying around I do want a DBOTW (yeah there are other good alternatives) soon,but, RZ is being reluctant to drop another one. <br />
<br />
A VDD is a good aggro weapon choice for a lot of warriors imo.<br />
<br />
Bardeil,My wife is a shammy.We have duoed and she has mainhealed and slowed in groups with me alot.She has mainhealed me in Riftseekers,PG ,KT,whatever.I don't like it .Always prefer a cleric its easier, less stressful, faster pulls etc.However, she does fine and has kept me up on multiple pulls in KT and PG with a suddenly missing cleric without out aggro problems despite chain fast heals and slows.Fast heals are of course  aggroey at the outset of a fight.Timing is everything,but, thats not the problem here imo.A VDD is enough to hold debuff and reasonable heal aggro.It would fall a little short of a BOW on average aggro hold for the DPS casters.Timing is key tho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My best guess as to why this was happening repeatedly that night is that the warrior probably did not have Stalwart Endurance and as such was getting stunned alot right off.<br />
<br />
As I was reading the thread linked, I saw this comment:  <br />
<br />
Its also important to note that the increase in proc rate from increased attack is minimal. Mobs heavily mitigate more than they have exceptionally high AC...hence hits are often reduced to 0 and show as misses. Proc determination however occurs prior to mitigation and its why procs can land on misses. Increased attack has a tendency to raise AVG hit far more than actually increase hits landed...so in terms of proc intervention its affects are minimized. <br />
<br />
Can a hit be mitiagted to 0?  I always was under the understanding that the most a hit could be mitigated was to n = 1.</div></div><hr />

As best I know, you are correct.<br />
<br />
Any hit that lands, will do at least 1 point of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct, its either a MISS or MIN. A hit can not be MITIGATED to 0. It doesn't matter how high your AC is. HIT% will always be the same and is based off your avoidance. Only difference is that AC will move the damage distribution to MIN most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I read somewhere that you were doing the bert event...<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is true, I've healed one as a cleric before,  and it wasn't really pretty.<br />
<br />
Fast heals are high agro, yes?<br />
<br />
If he was dropping as fast as you say he was, he probably didn't get much of a chance to build agro (especially with a 2hander such as VDD), other then the incite or whatever he used.<br />
<br />
So what probably happened a multitude of times was he was relatively low on the list, you pop in to save his ass and you get eaten. I've had it happen when I tanked, I had it happen numerous times, and I think that is what happened to you. Especially considering that the bert event is a very fast paced if-you-don't-kill-fast-it-sucks-to-be-you event.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, I wouldn't think too much that the warrior sucked, just that he didn't have time to build enough agro (more swings) before shit started to fly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of agro DPS makes no difference.  You obtain &quot;potential dps&quot; damage even without bane that gets attributed to agro.  Ironically this is the core reason why defensive and stonewall have the same &quot;dps agro&quot; (potential damage attributed to agro being the same in both cases).<br />
<br />
 lowest is n=1  <br />
<br />
In most cases this is not one damage.  Rather it is 1/20th of max damage.<br />
<br />
 A hit can not be MITIGATED to 0 <br />
<br />
I believe that is because fractions are rounded up after mitigation/shielding is factored in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beafly</div><div class="date">11-09-2004, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great stuff guys thanks.<br />
<br />
Yes it was a Bert event. And those can get hairy for sure. I was in group with the tank for the whole raid and I do recall the cleric in my group getting whacked a few times also. I'm gonna chalk it up to extreamly bad luck and move on with a little better understanding of agro.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if some of the smart folks here at TSW could put your collective knowledge together and produce something like &quot;The Definative Guide To Agro&quot;? Such a document could be nailed down here and then promoted to the other class and server boards. I think it would go a long way if the warrior community could come together and dispell alot of the myth's about agro floating around out there.</div></div><hr />

Warrior aggro is generated in various ways, including (and this is not in any particular order):<br />
tagging incoming mob with range weapon<br />
using the incite line<br />
potential damage from melee weapons (and slam/kick)<br />
weapon procs<br />
proximity to mob (closer= &gt;hate)<br />
taunt<br />
certain AAs (area of effect taunt and weapon affinity, two take two quite different examples)<br />
<br />
Notice that most of these require some time to build; a warrior with decent aggro-generating tools will almost always have much more solid aggro late in a fight than he does in the first few rounds after he engages the mob. Incite is instant, but procs are come in streaks and are progressively more important to warrior aggro as the warrior advances. The warrior in the original thread could face the same mob twice, try to do the same things in the same order, and your fate as fast healer could be different.<br />
Say, in case one, warrior tags incoming mob, incites, gets in a couple of rounds of melee, gets a nice proc, a couple more melee rounds and then your heal lands. Very likely, the mob stays on the warrior &amp; you live.<br />
But in another case, warrior tags incoming mob, incites, mob stuns warrior on first round, warrior recovers, gets round of melee, gets stunned again, doesn't get a proc, your heal lands...oh oh. If the weapon here has a fair proc, it even doesn't much matter whether the warrior's got a two-hander or two one-handers in the second case: neither will be procing or adding potential dps hate if all the warrior is seeing is a stun message and a spinning room.<br />
Neither you nor the warrior did anything different; the random number generator simply doesn't shake your hand the same way each time.<br />
<br />
Theoretically with this warrior, there are three avenues of cutting down on the likelihood of the second scenerio: <br />
1) the warrior can increase AC/hps/resists/AAs so that he lasts a little longer before he needs a heal and is less likely to be stunned (and thus gives his weapons more time to proc/add potential melee damage)<br />
2) the warrior can increase the quality and number of his weapon and hate augs<br />
3) The guild/group can attempt to use a Knight for ramping early aggro as Anker suggests<br />
<br />
Depending on the mob and random number generator, none of these things is a lock, though. If they do start being a lock for a given mob, it's quite likely that you'll just move to a tougher mob and have a new/improved set of problems.<br />
<br />
Of course, maxxing any aggro reduction tools you have (including AAs) wouldn't hurt, but I doubt any lack of AAs on your part or the weapon the warrior was carrying was the &quot;only&quot; thing that caused the results you experienced. <br />
The fastest fix of course for you as a patch healer is to quickly volunteer to be in a different group than the main tank, lol.<br />

<br />
<br />
:eek:<br />
<br />
think of Furious before saying so ... Dathor maul is great for furious because it has a large aggro per swing and that furious will provide you the large swing per secondes because of ripost.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : Beafly, wizards have a great threat on Graff that sum up basic hate mechanics and some spell hate value, add in Brutall taunt test and Breal's swing hate parses on SK.org to complete the thead in our labrary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aamen</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that, from my experience, aggro is also a function of time.<br />
<br />
I envision an aggro scale, with a zero point, +10,000 and -10,000 (the actual value doesn't matter).<br />
<br />
'Your' aggro will start at zero and fluctuate over time.  If you generate some aggro, then stop (all aggro drawing actions are done) then your aggro will 'float' lower, over time.<br />
<br />
At the same time, all other PC's aggro is floating as well, up or down.<br />
<br />
I say this because, the theory that misses contribute to aggro as well (linked above) could easily be described by the 'floating', since that sk was doing nothing over that time.  And the aggro was pulled at the same time in each instance, regardless of hits or misses.<br />
<br />
This is one of the failings of, well, drawing conclusions when you don't have all the facts, really.  I could expound on this a lot more, but this will suffice for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still remember Druids who thinks they can DOT, Snare, Nuke and Melee without getting aggro. *boggle*<br />
And they got pissed when they got aggro too<br />
<br />
I used to play a Dr00d on raids as a bot. I would Snare at 90%/get summoned (almost 100% of the time)/Nuke/Beg/Sit/Nuke/Snare for the guilds amusement if the raid had people sleeping. I would of course inform everyone on what I was doing <br />
<br />
&quot;bastage sumon me, eat this nuke!, Hey gimme some plat bisatch, hmm, time to change spells, fukker, hit me while I sit, eat a nuke!&quot;<br />
<br />
Good for a laugh, but of course my main is a Warrior, and knew exactly what would happen, at worst I woke everyone the heck up, esp the cleric in my group  :D (I would warn the cleric before hand)</div></div><hr />

So after a while, we got a single and I debuffed, slowed, DoT'd, nuked and nuked again and then started spamming &quot;On me! On me!&quot; once the mob turned.<br />
After the mob was dead, I /g &quot;Dang! I debuff, I slow, I DoT and I still had to nuke the mob twice--I thought I was never going to get to tank!&quot;<br />
Was good for a laugh.</div></div><hr />
