<br />
level 1-5 noob zone. (usually qeynos)<br />
<br />
level 5-10.  zone into PC from shadowhaven, and pay a druid to succor you across the zone to the hollowshade moor side.  those mobs (underbulks) are level 7 and very doable.<br />
<br />
level 10-16, move in more and find a nice dead end area where no one is killing lower level fiends, underbulks, and mushrooms.<br />
<br />
level 16-20 move in farther closers to shadowhaven (just around the bridge area) for the higher level fiends, and high level mushrooms.<br />
<br />
level 20-24 you can solo the C1 and C2 camps.  this starts slowing down at level 23 but you won't want to stay thru level 24 here. <br />
<br />
after that you can do HHK goblins and/or SK spires.<br />
<br />
actually got to level 28 in 1 day using this method.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For 20+ (I leave PC at 20 when I level an alt), I recommend Unrest.  Head straight inside the house, and work your way upstairs as you level.  The 2nd/3rd floor is good to about level 28 or so.  Then head to the basement til level 30.<br />
<br />
After level 30, you kinda run out of high ZEM zones to level in.  But I have been having fun PLing a couple clerics in ToFS lately.  Note, this is for PLing only, or a full group, soloing probably wouldn't work too well.  Head to second floor, park the PLee(s) just inside the entrance to the floor.  Then have the PLer go pull 5-10 mobs (depending on their level and gear) and tank them til they go OOM, then bring them over to the PLee to tag each and get the kill.  This is a good spot until 35 or so, then maybe a higher floor would work.  Once 40, head to the Hole (ok, ok, ruins of old paineel)<br />

My main went in offa Shadow Haven at 18 or so, my alts start there offa Shadeweaver's Thicket at level 1 with a guardian.<br />
<br />
The min. level varies a lot depending on which zone in you start at - there are three zone lines, although the most commonly known (and the one where most of the trains are) is at Shadow Haven.<br />
<br />
At your level, go in from Shadeweaver's Thicket and explore.  Try to find mushrooms to kill, as they don't add onto each other.  The beetle thingies are also doable, but you'll often be doing two at a time as they tend to spawn in pairs - and roamers are a trouble.  Avoid the phlergs later, they have a nasty disease DoT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahael Gibran</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive found PC is good exp from 1 until 26 especially with the 85% modifier, most of the times though 1-5 is done in noob zone and then it goes like this<br />
<br />
5-10 beetles by SWT zone<br />
10-15 phlerg fiends (lower level ones)<br />
15-17ish patog fiends (higher level ones)<br />
18-24 bandits (in group)<br />
<br />
after 24 you have no problem soloing bandits and you can even do it with good exp until level 26 or 27 after that ive found that doing goblins in sol a until 32 or so then doing the gnomes at castle/cubby till 40 is great<br />
<br />
you could also go to highkeep and do guards (drop great moeny 2-6pp per corpse and they drop a FS sword which sells for 5pp to vendor so thats 7-11pp per corpse) which are great exp or goblins. most people are worried about guards faction but the factions are utterly useless for most warrirors. sometimes you can get a group where they do guards and goblins now those are fun and the best exp :D. anyway you do that till 38 maybe 39 even 40  sometimes. then at 40 do nobles in HK that is the hands down best exp for 40-50 and you can even do until 54 or 55<br />
<br />
hope this helps, good luck</div></div><hr />

A couple things about your post suggest to me that you're not twinked or being powerleveled. Also that this might be your first character, and you don't have lots of pp. If that's the case, then the following advice might be useful (and if it's not the case, just ignore me and eventually I'll go away):<br />
1. Scrape together whatever cash you have and head for the bazaar before you go to PC. Do searches on all weapon categories (one-handers and two-handers) filtering for warrior and your race and the amount you can afford to spend. You'll have a damage cap in effect until you're level 20, but search around. You'll find something weapon cheap &amp; better than fine steel.<br />
2. If this is your first character, mix and match your hunting: experiment with indoor and outdoor zones. Learn the pathing characteristics, abilities, level ranges, spawn rates and locations of the mobs you hunt.<br />
3. Group as often as you can stand it. Yes, you will meet many many annoying people this way, but you'll also meet a few very cool folks. And you'll learn how groups work and how they fail to work.<br />
4. Get a bow &amp; start making your own arrows. Learn to pull with it, especially in outdoor zones. (requires fletching skill: look at EQ Traders online for tradeskill info). For a long time range&gt;damage for your bow as a pulling device. I'm suggesting this because two of the better places for the non-pl'd, non-guilded tank to get groups later will be the Overthere and the dreadlands. These zones do not have experience bonuses, but if you become known as a good puller, two things will happen: you won't have to wait more than two minutes for a group invite, and as puller you control the the rate at which mobs arrive in camp. These two things are important if you are in a position of having to rely on pick-up groups, because after you can no longer solo efficiently, the two practical factors that are most likely to slow your experience are: First, you can't get a group. Second, people in your group keep dying. <br />
To get a group, you need to go to popular zones: Blackburrow, PC, the Aviaks in South K., High Hold Keep, the Overthere and the dreadlands, for example.<br />
Many pick-up groups will have members who seem to think that the fastest way to get experience is to pull faster and faster. Actually, the fastest experience is to pull at the maximum rate that particular group can kill mobs without getting killed (death in pick up groups cause rez and re-grouping delays and often lead to the break-up of the group, all of which slow experience far more than anything else). A puller who can hit the risk/reward curve perfectly will be much in demand. Another reason to pull if you are untwinked is that as puller you'll hold agro better than if you try to take it from someone else pulling.<br />
Soon--by level 16 or 18, for sure--start learning as much as you can about the issues your casters face. What buffs do they have? What spell components do they need? What problems do they face? Always do what you can to help your group fight better.<br />
No matter what level or zone you fight in, one of the best ways to make a pick-up group fight better costs absolutely nothing: when you see someone do something good, compliment them in /g. It's often shocking how much more fun and effective a group is after a couple such compliments.<br />
Finally, if you happen to be on Fennin Ro, let me know &amp; I'll find you and lend you a hand.</div></div><hr />
