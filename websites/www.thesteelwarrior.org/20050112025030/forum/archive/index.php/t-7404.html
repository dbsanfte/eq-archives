<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ahve been playing around with magelo looking to see what kinda armor would be good for a level one to start out and then run him to 65.<br />
<br />
I have an ok set up as at level one i have over 600 hp and 300-350 ac.<br />
<br />
what i am wondering is what kinda weapons can i get that will deal out the max dammage the fastest for leveling while under level 50.<br />
<br />
I am looking for somehting fast and that hits hard that will not cost me an arm and a leg just to look at it and then drool over it...<br />
<br />
Currently i am looking at one of the following combo<br />
<br />
swiftblade of zek / velium swiftblade<br />
<br />
any other suggestions...<br />
<br />
also i do not know all the short hands as i am just now really gettign into a warrior....  Yes i am a warrior noob  :eek:  but a shaman vet... :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does he have a haste item? If so, look for something better than the velium swiftblade. Goranga spiked clubs still aren't that bad, and I'm sure your shaman could go kill until one dropped. Basically, just look for weapons that have the best ratio until ~ 40, then speed gets more and more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The haste item i was looking for was either this sword of the 21 pct earring out of GoD... it sells for 10K on my server and i was goign to sick my puppie on him and try to get the ground spawn from around the named before it kills me...  workers earring of efficency or something like that  it is 21 pct haste 18 ac and 55 hp<br />
<br />
and i will have no one helping me get any of the items i am after but a 63 + shaman and a 56 SK (if i 2 box him) or 62 necro friend if he logs on.<br />
<br />
so i will need to either buy or beable to solo with a shaman..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aryl Paingiver</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe a horn of Hsagra 13/20 1h piercer, 100hp and 15 sta if I remeber correctly. also has now recomended lvl. not sure what it costs on your server but worth looking into in my opinion. can't remeber if it had ac or not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aryl Paingiver</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">correction: stats on horn are 13/20 1h piercing,<br />
                                               35ac, 10sta, 25sv cold, 75hp<br />
stii a great wep pre55 in my mind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">velium swiftblade is an excellent offhand between levels 15 and 19 (!) and then not much good after that. :) ... the haste is great and you cant hit anything with your offhand in those levels anyway :p and the damage cap means you dont lose a lot of hitting power in those levels anyway. also if you use the hsagra in your primary at least you will get a little slashing practice in .. again not much.<br />
<br />
and i agree .. in the early levels there is no damage bonus so go straight on damage delay ratio in the early levels. .. except before level 20 you want to keep the delay as low as you can get it as long as damage is at least 7 or 8. it will help you skill up faster and that in turn will get you through your first 20 levels faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i would use a Reaver till some of the better weaps with level requirements are available. great weap for 20-45ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage caps are what 20, 30, 40, 50?????<br />
most of the weapons that are nice have a level restriction to use it then another to get the stats to max out.<br />
<br />
I am looking for a weapon that will place out some good dammage to get me to level to mid 40's to low 50's. At that time i will probally be over hauling the warrior i will be changing my armor out for cultural or better around this time.<br />
<br />
so i am looking for suggestions for weapons that a low level can use as a stepping stone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aryl Paingiver</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">like I saud aboce, The Horn of Hsagra has NO lvl restriction so it will do alot of dmg fast (13/20) and keep you going till droga combo procs for you and will at that time out agro the Horn..... that is if you can aford the Horn prolly 15kish I would think by now<br />
The damage caps are what 20, 30, 40, 50?????<br />
