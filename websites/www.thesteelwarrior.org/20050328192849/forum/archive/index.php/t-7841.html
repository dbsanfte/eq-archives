I had two questions, primarily:<br />
<br />
Cloaks: is it pretty well defined that it's either Quarm cloak (with shielding) or Rallos cloak (with 10avoidance)?  I see folks with a Fiery Crystal Guard, 10 more ac but no avoidance.  What's the deal?<br />
<br />
The other question I had primarily had to do with Avoidance in general.  Other than Rallos cloak, are there any avoidance items that I may have overlooked?  Anything worth getting over what I have listed in my PoTime wish list folder?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or perhaps go for both, and use symbol just for clickie?  That seems like a waste of DKP, but I could be off</div></div><hr />

I dont have symbol or any self proc buff and i never ever have a problem with aggro.  sotp is a waste of a loot at your point in the game.  Aggro in time is rather easy.</div></div><hr />

Read my post on shielding vs avoidance.  Avoidance 10 lowers dps taken by 47ish, of course it depends on the max hit of the mob.  avoid 10 = shielding 4 on quarm, but thats only because his db is very large.</div></div><hr />
