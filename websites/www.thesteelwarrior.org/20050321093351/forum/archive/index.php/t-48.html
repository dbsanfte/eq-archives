<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has recently decided to head into NToV. We're somewhere in between a raiding guild, and a family guild. Our raid force usually consists of 30-40 people on good nights. What should we need to know before goin into this place. I'm talkin things like:<br />
<br />
Respawn times on drakes<br />
Damage output (max hit/slowable/flurry/rampage etc) on Flurry Drakes<br />
Tips on Ikatiar, Eashen, and Aary<br />
Respawn on Named<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried to look up info on allakhazam but they seem to be lacking credible info about NToV.<br />
<br />
How far do you think we could get if we caught all the mobs up and uncontested (won't happen, but lets say it did =P ). My guild normally kills mobs like:<br />
<br />
Vindi<br />
Doomshade<br />
Rumblecrush<br />
Gozz<br />
Telk<br />
Dozekar<br />
Klandicar<br />
<br />
We have gotten a CH rotation down pretty good IMO. Also, we have 2 65 enchanters, would they be able to mez/charm any mobs with some of the higher level PoP spells?<br />
<br />
Any input is appreciated and I give thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galuvian</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you killed Lendi?<br />
<br />
Hatchling respawn is 18 mins<br />
Drake respawn is 72 mins<br />
Named drake respawn is 24 hours<br />
<br />
I really can't describe flurry drakes, you kinda need to experience it for yourself.  They are less DPS than doomshade.  The hard part isn't killing one, it is killing all of them in a reasonable amount of time. But you don't need to worry about Flurry drakes until after you have killed Aaryonar.<br />
<br />
Eashen and Ikky are similar fights to Vindi.  Eashen has fire/cold AEs, I don't remember if it is exactly what the wurms have.<br />
<br />
Aaryonar is a real learning mob.  You need to figure out how to position him so that your casters don't get AEd.  After that the fight is cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirle1</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aary IMHO is one of the hardest Nwing Dragons if you can get past him, then you know you are ready for Nwing.  Have you guys been in ST at all, i saw that you've killed ST key mobs.  Lendi would be another good target for you guys.  Should be able to take Ikkatier and Eashen without to much of a fight. Aary is the touh one to learn but easy once you get the strat down for your particular guild.  After that it doesn't take much more effort, after a clearing or so you'll get it down, and it only takes 5 or so clearing to outfit a guild before you could potentially move on if you wanted to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have yet to kill Lendi yet, only because we have not found her up. We have only killed Klandi once, as he/she goes down real quick like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aary- hits for 950ish, triples... aoe is a mana drain/dot, but its buggy sometimes (can't exactly explain, maybe someone can explain her aoe better)... best thing to do is position her around corner from ramp down to itak/eashan, casters on ramp, melees around corner.  Pin her against wall near corner, and call ae... 30 seconds on the ae so once you call it, casters have 30 sec to come around corner and nuke a few times, then duck back.  would be smart to position a group near casters to take care of the hatchlings that add during the fight. aary is definately the most annoying fight there, and shes tough.<br />
<br />
Eashan is unslowable, hits like 650ish tops... gimpy aoe.  IMO hes the best RvR mob in Ntov, because he drops a lot of decent stuff (Claws of Lightning, Fist of Lightning, Mask of the Sky, Cloak of the Sky, Twisted Steel Bastard Sword, Onyx chain sleeves), and hes quite easy, and can be killed without dealing with aary since hes before her.   Itak is even easier than Eashan, but doesn't drop nearly as nice of stuff, but still has a few good items.<br />
<br />
Overall, Eashan and Itak are good mobs, but if you cannot kill Aary yet then you shouldn't bother with NtoV, because there's quite a small limit to how much you can do just by killing the two of them, and the time to get to them alone isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
Best way to get there is to have a mage in your guild stay non kos and run in, and coh people.  On the down side, this mitigates the usefulness of this mage on the raid down to mod rods, since if they nuke even once they'll suck the faction hit that will quickly make em kos.</div></div><hr />

NO they cannot mez stuff in there. They just can't period. They MAY be able to charm stuff. I know using CoD we can charm the red drakes and white wurms in HoT. Haven't been to NToV lately, hehe :)<br />
<br />
Also... PoI dragon should be on your list of things to do... its not really that hard and has some very nice loots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do NToV with way less than that. We have a guild on our server that has done NToV with 30ish cause that's all the members they have. How they do it, I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Briq</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NToV, imo, once you get past aary it's all down hill from there and the only mobs after Aary that you would have trouble with would be Vyemm, Zlex and Lady Nev.<br />
<br />
For the most part, most of the dragons are slowable.  Only one I can think of that isn't is Kreizenn, but he isn't terribly tough.  Oh and Ikky/Eashen are not slowable either.  All the rest basically are.  Once slowed most are just easy and it's just a matter of how fast you kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Briq</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Telk = much harder than most NToV mobs so if you can kill him without much trouble, NToV should be falling to you in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most ppl coth up to the hallway opposite of ikiatars room. you can pull ikiar, eashen, and aary right outside the hallway in the 4 way without having to worry about hatchlings respawning on you.<br />
<br />
ikiar is bit of rough pull with small numbers from there unless you get a decent split but not much room for your monks to work with, we just yanked em all last time. before we would pull iki and eashen to zone in with a bard speed monk.<br />
<br />
its the best time saver though, coth in and just pull all three right outside the door you cothed to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do NtoV with 30 with an average raid lvl of 62,we do often have more but we have done both Vyemm nad roy with that amount so not to hard....<br />
<br />
Few other guilds on server do with same amount..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of the above are good info. But I am surprised no body mentions PULLING. <br />
<br />
With today's standard, all the named are not really difficult to tackle, even Aary. Strategy has been posted in many boards many times. <br />
<br />
Yes ikiar and eashen are easy if you can get them alone. <br />
Aary has 2 guards<br />
Flurry drakes add.<br />
<br />
IMO, the key to NToV is a good monk(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roshinbertson</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bah we did some ntov named with 18 people...its not the numbers...its the skills that count....if you have the right teamwork you can do a lot of mobs with 20 people...<br />
<br />
don't get me wrong..things are easier with more numbers...<br />
<br />
<br />
but for my guild it seems if we get over 30 people we whipe more lol.../shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galuvian</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It isn't about the numbers. It is about balance.<br />
<br />
With the right balance, the majority of NToV mobs are not a race.  Doing all of NToV with just 18 people was possible before PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aary is a great test to see if your ready for NToV, if your capable of killing him you should be able to do the rest easy. <br />
<br />
For the most part named are quite easy and rape drakes are managable when you get used to em.<br />
<br />
Vyemm is the hardest, followed by lady nev imho but if your clerics keep MT alive and MT keeps decent taunt your sweet (same with all mobs i guees =p) ,once you learn the strat for each mob you will find its cake but NToV is not too hard with 30sh give or take.<br />
<br />
Discipline &gt; numbers<br />
<br />
1 more thing, Dagarn has a fake enrage, can hit through it, unless they changed it, been a long time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skycrasher</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NToV is cake w/ good pulling. Reasonable DPS, and smart clerics. you can go in there w/o knowing any crystal clear strats for mobs and learn your own, and more than likely you'll succeed. Ntov is a great place for a guild to learn and upgrade and play w/ each other better.</div></div><hr />

Ntov is damn fun when you get the hang of it.</div></div><hr />

It's down right easy.. they are right.. higher lvls have made some of the tougher mobs easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Roys guards are easy now with pacify,which is a nice tip...<br />
<br />
I think Lady Nev is the hardest of all of them purely because that spin is so GD annoying.Sometimes she has a streak where she just chain casts it,leaving you screaming and poundig your keyboard...<br />
<br />
If you have the displeasure of fightitng her.. Make a /sit,/stand,/attack on hotkey when you get hit by the spin click that to pop down and up and attack again.You will remain stunned but will stop spinning and if you are quick enough you will still be facing her so won't take those nasty claws to the back and won't have to spin yourself round when your finally unstunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify the Aary AE thing ...<br />
<br />
It was already mentioned that you need to possition your caster out of the AE or they will end up OOM in no time. Even if your casters are around a corner, your UI is going to show that they got hit and their mana is going to drop as if they took the AE. This is just a ghost AE but it will keep them from casting because the mana check before casting a spell is done locally and your UI thinks you have no mana and a mana DoT AE on. All the casters need to do is click any insta-cast item to clear the ghost AE and restore their mana. Even j-boots work to clear the ghost. All casters should have at least 1 clicker to fix the AE or you are going to have a rough fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i cant say for sure since its been a while, but last time we had our clerics around the corner, the ae didnt ghost through and they kept KEI the whole time. <br />
<br />
if the ae does ghost through, jboot(even though they dont work), the see invis bracer, or any spell that you cast like yaulp iv will fix your mana back no prob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my advice ... Skip NToV, go straight for Ssra/PoP stuff.<br />
<br />
we only did NToV like 3 times total.  people got bored about halfway through our second clearing, and we sorta never went back after the 3rd, cause the stuff outta NToV sorta sucks these days.  <br />
<br />
Head straight for Ssra, start gankin the Rhag cycle/creator (easiest fights in Ssra IMO).<br />
<br />
But, if you really wanna do north, listen to the other guys here, cause they know more about it than I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do North with 20-30 peeps, key is DPS imo.  Once Aary is slowed 1 cleric can keep me healed.  In fact that is with all NToV mobs that can be slowed.  No rotation is needed.  Though with Eashen and iki you need to heave at least 3 clerics on a rotation about 8seconds should work.  I think the fights with unslowable mobs are way more fun.  After aary I think its rather anticlimatic.  Most dragons are gimp.  It still alot of fun, and expect to go from Max ally to max KOS in 1 clearing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its a long fight, without decent dps you wont kill her before mana runs out. of course make sure you clerics got rods, a bard close by, necros, bst crack etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We rely on DPS, its a must.  Bard resist songs dont help here at all, and we neevr seem to have a bard online when we need him so we learn to deal without.  Like the previous post mentioned place clerics right atthe end of the hallway in that little nook, should keep them out of AE, and be sure Clerics get shrink.  1 - 2 clerics on a 15sec rotation on MA, and the rest healing your raid.  Keep her slowed!  And enjoy the whirl to you hurl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We would have skipped it to go straight to Ssra, but frankly, right now, there's just too much competition in there with 2 guilds farming it full time and two more taking half stabs at trying to get what is missed by the previous two. We've taken down the HP once when we got lucky, but it was just that...luck. Not in the takedown, but in finding it available.<br />
<br />
We've taken down Grummus and Terris, AoW, Greig and quite a few others, so we thought that taking down Vulak would be well within our reach, so we recently took a stab at the Vulak cycle which was alot of fun. Had some trouble with the first of the splitting drakes in wave 7 and was wondering if anyone had any insight. We got down to the last 4 but they suddenly went right for our healers the second they cast, which the others hadn't. We also weren't expecting that kind of split...were thinking it was going to be along the lines of the reavers, which it isn't.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any insight as to exactly how the split works? It seemed to me that you the first two drakes, call them A and B. We hit A full on while one of our tanks off tanked B. When A went down, we got 2 drakes. Hit one, off tanked the second and then quickly took it down. It then looked like we got 2 sets of 4 drakes, which really wasn't a problem until B went down adding 2 more. Made things a bit interesting.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts and/or strategies? Can you go a second time if you fail? We didn't try as we were short on time.<br />

We were killing the newest drakes first btw. That didn't seem to help much as a tank alone, with no help, was killing too fast. I guess the encounter was never meant to use lvl 65 characters, heh.

Do you pull Iki's guards before pull aary to that location?  We tried him there once only to have someone aggro them mid fight.  Normally we just take him up in his hallway and deal with the hatchlings as they add.</div></div><hr />
