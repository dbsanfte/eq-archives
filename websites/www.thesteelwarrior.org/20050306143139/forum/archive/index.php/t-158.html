I worked 12 hour days for a year and a half, and I had insomnia for a better part of that time period.  Go to bed at 8am, get up at 11 am and spend the rest of the day doing crap because sleep was a lost cause.  End up tired as hell all day long, go to work in the evening and come home wide awake again.<br />
<br />
Seems to go in cycles for me...a month of insomnia, a few months off.  Right now I should be sleeping but that's not working out for me.  Spring time may have something to do with it...and that damned daylight savings time crap.  The longer the day, the harder it is to sleep (especially when you're on overnites).  <br />
<br />
It's all good tho, I deal with it because the entire reason I met my wife was the fact that I had insomnia and was up all day.  Had I been sleeping, we would have passed by each other silently and never known the difference.</div></div><hr />

I haven't had a normal sleep schedule for over 3 years now.  I worked a 12 hour 6pm to 6am shift as a supervisor at a plant a few years back.  That, coupled with alternating that shift with the 6am to 6pm shift on consecutive weeks to train my replacement when I was leaving... well that just totally cocked up my body rythyms.  I do better when I can manage to go a few days without caffiene, but then the headaches are horrible.  I sleep when I can now, sometimes a long nap after work (normal 8-5 job now), sometimes a regular nights sleep, sometimes 3 or 4 hours just before work, sometimes no sleep at all.  In general though, if I end up staying up till within 2 hours of when I need to be somewhere, I just won't go to sleep, or it will be a lost cause.  I won't wake up.  I suppose it really is much better now.  Most nights I sleep from midnight to 7am, but it is really easy to slip back into staying up all night, and then it takes 3 or 4 days to reset my clock.<br />

Good luck on your finals.</div></div><hr />
