<br />
After one week of intense bazaar camping I managed to make 37 kpp, wanting to buy a Fungi. I am still short of like 10k for the Fungi though (they are like 50k on Trib), and I'm wondering now if I shouldnt go for some gear upgrades instead of buying a Fungi.<br />
<br />
So, here are my options :<br />
<br />
1. Work (hard) on 13 more kpp and buy DA FUNGI;<br />
<br />
2. Not buy anything but keep camping the bazaar to make my fortune even bigger;<br />
<br />
3. Sell my Windblade and buy DA FUNGI and maybe a WMBS to have still a DPS weapon;<br />
<br />
4. Spend this money on some gear upgrades and just play like anyone else instead of spending my time in baz<br />
<br />
This leads to this question - what gear upgrades should I go for, based on my current magelo ???<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or to solo with (limited at 61)?<br />
<br />
I would sell the Windblade and get the WMBS anyway for a dps weapon. Then get some armor upgrades with the plat you have. But again if you really want to solo get the Fungi, but warriors were not meant to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viladdar</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea I know perfectly that warriors arent designed for solo, BUT having a fungi would let me do at least some cash and item farming, since I have the ToD already (I can farm even without a fungi but it takes a lot of bandaids and it is pretty long to recover my 4k hp; a fungi would make it much faster I believe). Plus, this fungi would be very useful to my shaman on my 2nd account, hehehe (NEVER will I play a pally, oh Father, do something against those dumbass pallies !!! :)  ) And, finally, since I am a casual player, sometimes I only have like 1 hour or 2 for playing. That's not enough for serious grouping, but for some solo play that's fine.<br />
<br />
So, you think I should sell the Windblade anyway ? Do the WMBS really outdamage it ? It sounds weird, the ratio on Windblade seems superior to WMBS's ratio... Can someone enlighten this please ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The WMBS is a very viable alternative to the Windblade.  I currently use the WMBS as my DPS weapon when not MT...with Ferocity 3 and PB 2 it works real well.  I'd think for the relative cost delta; 15k vs 3.5k (Fennin Ro prices) I'd definately use a WMBS.</div></div><hr />
