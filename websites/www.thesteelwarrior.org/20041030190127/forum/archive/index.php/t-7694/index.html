<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well had to sell a 100K horse for the money but picked up a Moss Covered Twig (del 10, damage 3) for 165K. Only the 2nd time I have seen the item for sale in over 3 years so I figure it worth it for rareity. <br />
<br />
But I have no idea what to do with it, is there a good agument for it? Slot 4.<br />
<br />
Is the DPS a ton? <br />
<br />
Naturally I plan to main hand it, in what situation is this item of use? What AA should I get to maximize its effectivness...<br />
<br />
I have WA5 but not many offensive AA... (all the defensive though).. <br />
<br />
Can't use if for awhile cause i am maining on the PvP test server right now and won't get back to SZ for a week or so at least.</div></div><hr />

Well still its kinda like a rare item... one of the few buyable items I have never owned. And its not like 165K is anything to someone with well over 3 million worth of stuffs...

<br />
Ya true enough a fool and his money are soon parted oh well, thats life on the internet, somedays yur pixils shine and others they dim..... <br />
<br />
Offhand has damage bonus...? hummm but does the delay effect the offhand at all? Well I guess I gonna have to try it out at least... maybe get ambidexatry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't try it out. Ratio is god in offhand, and I doubt the offhand dmg bonus AA will change that enough to make the twig useful. Aug'ing it with a dps aug will not make the aug proc more often, as weapon delay has nothing to do with amount of procs in a given time. Try reselling it for a profit.<br />
<br />
And if your gear cost you 3 mill plat, you've been screwed much worse than this in the past...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well 3 million total over 7 toons, Im probably the top merchant on my server. I bought 5 earthshakers for:<br />
<br />
7K<br />
15K <br />
60K <br />
175K<br />
200K<br />
<br />
I Am using one and have one for sale sold 3 for:<br />
<br />
444K<br />
390K<br />
360K<br />
<br />
With 250JC and all the JCAA I do ok.... heh.<br />
<br />
Well I gonna give it a shot before I resell it, still its kinda bragging rights as a merchant to own one, even if it turns out usless. Its so rare this is only the 2nd time in 3 years I have seen one for sale on SZ.... I might even put it out for more (199K) just for its rarity value.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya weapon delay has no effect on procs.. I kinda forgot how offhand &quot;delay&quot; is calculated, is it just a chanch to make it based on each mainhand swing? Seems then you would want a low delay mainhand and a huge damage offhand then, regardless of ratio ... well let me look it up...<br />
<br />
<br />
http://b5.ezboard.com/fthesafehousetrainingstudioqafornewbies.showMessage?topicID=20345.topic<br />
<br />
<br />
Cause I wanted to know…<br />
<br />
The question of whether the off-hand DB AA, Sinister Strikes adds a fixed amount of dps, or if it performs better or worse at higher or lower delays has been a subject of debate in my guild recently. What follows is a mathematical answer to that question. I humbly await the inevitable corrections which will follow, but ask that you keep in mind the purpose of this post is *not* to determine exactly how much dps SS adds, but rather to determine if having SS should make any bearing on your weapon choices.<br />
<br />
Facts:<br />
<br />
The DB for the AA scales with delay. The generally accepted formula is round(delay/3.5). <br />
<br />
Observed values for DB are 5 at 19 (Sincro), 6 at 20 (Sincro), 7 at 24 (Hagin of TR), 7 at 25 (Sincro), 8 at 28 (Sincro) 9 at 30 (Brogett). These observed values are determined using the Finishing Blow AA, and observing the damage done with an off-hand blow. 3200x where x is the off-hand DB.<br />
<br />
Damage done by off-hand DB is determined by hits per second.<br />
<br />
Assumptions:<br />
<br />
60% of swings will hit. This is based on large data samples from multiple lvl 65 rogue parses. 60% is a little on the stingy side.  <br />
<br />
With max skill, you will dual wield 88% of the time, and double attack 88% of those times with your off hand. These numbers are the most nebulous of the ones in this post. If someone has hard numbers for what percentage of time you both dual wiled and double attack when at max skill, I'd love to hear it. Tables can be adjusted to reflect those new numbers.<br />
<br />
For a lvl 65 rogue with maxed dual wield and double attack, the off-hand will swing the following number of times per minute: (60 seconds / (delay / 10)) * .88 * 2 * .88 * (1 + (haste% / 100))<br />
<br />
<br />
Hits per minute will be that number times 0.6. dps will be hits per minute times DB divided by 60.<br />
<br />
Caveat: The numbers generated on this able are not actual off-hand dps numbers. If you happen to hit 62% of the time, and determine you DW and DA 90% and 90% of the time, these numbers will be a little low. If you only hit 55% of the time, and DW and DA 85% and 85% of the time, these numbers will be a little high. If you've got 30% bard overhaste, these numbers are going to be a lot low. The point of the table is to determine whether off-hand dps is fairly constant regardless of a weapon's delay, or if higher or lower delay weapons are better.<br />

Upon reflection of the data, one thing stands out, and that is the poor performance of the 19 delay weapon. This is a direct result of the way the DB works. Two other delays (17 and 18 ) also have a theorized DB of 5. Results for those theoretical delays is:<br />
<br />
delay        haste        DB        spm        hpm        dps<br />
17                000        5        54.66        32.80        2.733176<br />
17                040        5        76.53        45.92        3.826447<br />
17                100        5        109.33        65.60        5.466353<br />
                                        <br />
18                000        5        51.63        30.98        2.581333<br />
18                040        5        72.28        43.37        3.613867<br />
18                100        5        103.25        61.95        5.162667<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upon reflection, this makes absolute sense. Since all three weapons have the same DB, then the one which swings the most will generate the most DPS from the bonus. We have a lot of experience with this for primary hand weapons, which is why 7/14 is *far* better then 14/28, even though they have the exact same ratio. In this case, the 17 delay weapon has a dps number right in line with the higher delay weapons, therefore there is no bias towards or against weapons with low delay. 19 delay just happens to be a low spot, and 20 and 30 seem to be high spots. However, the overall difference of 0.68 dps between the best and worst weapons at 100% haste hardly seems worth choosing a weapon simply based on off-hand weapon bonus. <br />
<br />
I therefore submit that the old adage of ratio is king for off-hand dps remains valid.<br />
<br />
A better question might be: Why did I spend 15 AA for 5.xx dps… <br />
-Sinc<br />
<br />
There is no I in team, but there is a U in suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok the number of swings from offhand seems to be related to offhand delay right? Thats good for twig, but then the DB is Delay / 3.5 which is like 3 or so which doubles the damage of the twig.<br />
<br />
Well I dont have time to crank out all the numbers right now, got to play some pvp on the beta server - having a blast heh. Ill crank through it tommow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, the AA will double the damage of the twig.<br />
<br />
Twig + AA is still inferior to, say, a Splitblade of Destruction *without* the AA.<br />
<br />
And far far far inferior to something like a Velium Gemmed Shortsword.</div></div><hr />

You can get a feel for pvp on the Beta Server, with the mellee range increased 25percent and mellee damage mitigation decreased 20percent against everyone warriors is doing very well indeed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">ps- since youre boxing 3 wizards for dps and no slower, you might want to offhand the Scim and throw the BoC into the primary.  with casters, strength of proc is somewhat more important than quickness of proc.  unless youre just looking for that early proc to counteract high quick dps or an early slow, the scimitar is way outclassed by the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">ps- since youre boxing 3 wizards for dps and no slower.<br />
<br />
Last I checked enchanters can slow pretty well.   :) <br />
<br />
Everyone here needs to understand the mentality of people who play on PvP servers.  They all have big egos, trash talk, and think they are the shit.  Sam is no different, the ego is just a little bit more overinflated.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Sad thing is the top people on the PvP servers have their ego solely based on their success at PvP within a game.  Masking a little insecurity there I would say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mossy twig is probably the best offhand 1hb &quot;trainer&quot; weapon in the game, so it's the shitz for skilling up skill deficient twinks I suppose.  Same deal with the mossy branch for 2hb.  Twig works great with heal-shielded mobs too, but there aren't any really big (relative to current hp totals) reverse damage shields out there now.  Would probably be pretty useful for PVP to interrupt casters, but killing them with higher DPS is arguably more important than interrupting. ;)  And, depending on how finishing blow is coded (i.e. like a proc/dly based-&gt;wouldn't help -or- a set chance per swing-&gt;would own) it could be quite nice for that as well.  <br />
<br />
But the absolute, hand's down best thing about the twig is the MASSIVE amount of combat spam it generates; at max haste + bard overhaste, it generates a truly epic amount of spam even when offhanded.  Was even better when you could DW the twig and the whip, and there weren't any combat message filters in the game. ;)<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. still got a twig and a branch somewhere, never did manage to obtain a whip for anything more than testing.  Permabanked with a monsoon and a sunderfury for purely nostalgia value. ;)</div></div><hr />

less is more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">ps- since youre boxing 3 wizards for dps and no slower, you might want to offhand the Scim and throw the BoC into the primary.  with casters, strength of proc is somewhat more important than quickness of proc.  unless youre just looking for that early proc to counteract high quick dps or an early slow, the scimitar is way outclassed by the BoC.<br />
<br />
Isnt the ac debuff/dd proc of the OSOW like 450ish-550ish Hate vs. like 700ish Hate for the BoC? I dont think that i would say its &quot;way outclassed&quot; as far as Hate Generation of the Proc. Anyone have a feel for the amount of Hate the OSoW generates? And given both have Anger3 agument that helps even them even more.<br />
<br />
Still havnt had time to play with the twig spending all my time on the pvp beta server ... Can't transfer any bazzar mule items over there unfortunatly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">OSoW is slightly less aggro than a stun proc ... i have both EB and stun with anger3 ... in grouping the difference really isnt all that noticable, but on raid bosses etc the difference can be rather large.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have WA5 it adds up to around a 400-500hate per minute difference.<br />
<br />
3 procs of 400hate and 1.5 of 700 = 2250 hate<br />
3 procs of 700hate and 1.5 of 400 = 2700 hate<br />
<br />
OSoW has a slightly increased proc rate, so the real numbers may be a bit different, but it's enhanced proc rate isnt as good as say a BBoTE or a BF, so it's not worth the tradeoff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then again, it's all really moot anyways unless you have som serious aggro generators.  your combo will be more than enough aggro either way you look at it in 99% of the situations you'll come across.  The difference is there, but its rather miniscule.  Seeing as you bot wizards for dps, then i bet you'll make sure you get 1 or 2 procs in before nuking .... 1 or 2 EB procs &gt; 1 or 2 debuff procs ... but like i said it doesnt matter too much with your weapons.<br />
<br />
The only time i would favor a weapon with more procs but less hate PER proc  is on serious aggro generating melee .. like a highend monk or rogue where an early proc &gt; str of proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>tasdamon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">this is kinda a page or so late, but i thought i'd shed some light on the offhand bonus thing.  there is no damage bonus in offhand.  this means that discounting procs, ratio is all that matters for dps.  this is well known.  what isn't, though, is how Sinister Strikes effects this.  the bonus that SS adds scales with the delay of the weapon.  this means that ratio is still all that matters.  it simply adds ~5dps regardless of the weapon delay or ratio.  due to the EQ engine rounding off the bonus, there is a very small difference between the dps of the damage bonus of weapons of different delays.  however, as that parse shows, this difference is less then 1 dps and can easily be thrown out due to margin of error of the parse and well...just not making a difference.<br />
<br />
on another note, that wasnt a bad buy Sam, its a collectors item.  much like rubicite or a manastone, both of which have no use to today's standards :oP</div></div><hr />

They get a passive Disc or AA or whatever that increases their mellee accuracy. <br />
<br />
He says he is getting hits in the 60s with the twig and his skills went from like 60 - 140 in a day heh... <br />
<br />
His plan was to use it for pvp and get a stun proc, which he didn't know would still only fire 1 time per minute (he thought that it would proc a lot cause of the low delay). But still he is very happy after seeing the high damage it does, due to his Pathfinder Disc or AA whatever it is.<br />
