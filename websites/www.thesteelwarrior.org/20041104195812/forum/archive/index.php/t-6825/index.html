<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumblecrush, Zlexak (the camel guy in UP) Vindi, Statue of Rallos Zek, King Tormax, Rhag 1 and 2, Maybe Grieg, Maybe Itaer Vious, The Rat guy in PoD, If you have enough clerics  and DPS you can do the Dain, and most of the velious dragons, Klandicar, Zlandicar, Yelinak, WToV dragons (The keeper might give you problems with adds if you can't kill fast enough) Deffinately be doing Dozeker for quest items you'll wear them to the elemental planes, a few if auged will suffice to PoTime. Velketor, The Va'dyn, Doomshade, Vhe'kiz the Shade, BoT Towers (best bang for your buck and up every 8 hours if i remember right)  That should be enough to get you started.</div></div><hr />

My guild is in a similar situation and we did IV with 14 a couple times.  All you need is solid tactics and some patience (I was MA the last time and went defensive twice on that fight  :D ... but nobody died so it was all good.)  By the way, we wiped with 18-24 a couple times before we got our tactics down and us tanks got our defensive aa's.  Oh yeah, and you need RGC for IV...that blind is a pain in the arse.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thraxnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well just os you know you can also do mobs like xanamek and don't forget the riff cycle in Kael.. nice target for practice could also be CT with some nice drop off some of the deeper cycles and some nice camps when you get them broken (Boots of the Flowing Slime for your casters and Lizard tooth earing to name a few)<br />
<br />
ps - have done xana with 18 people before so it can be done (most in ornate or less equipment)<br />

edited to add ps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hinedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you need to work on raid tactics a very good NPC is Nathyn Illuminous in Katta. he is on his own faction and does not have anyone to add. etc if you clear out his guards ahead of time. MY guild killed Nathyn our first attempt. Was a hour and 15 min long tho. We had the MA and SA die twice but managed to recover and win the encounter. Drops a +100 cha robe that  is awesome for Enc and Nec.  We had approx 20 people with a ave lvl of 58. My 2cp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BOT towers are made for guilds like that IMO.  The staff in your hands should tell you that.  Ornate BP's for people, awesome hybrid shoulders, FTII helm for wis casters, GBoS is great aggro weapon, very nice rogue piercers, etc.<br />
