I been checking in bazaar for a few weeks now, have not had much luck.   I would like to know if anyone has bought one in bazaar or actually went down the hole and killed an animated construct.<br />

I would recomend checking with other warriors on FV to see what the situation is like there with this quest.</div></div><hr />

You might want to search in the forum for information regarding maybe single pulling the guards using necro/sk pet-fd method.  I read that it works.  We usually just bring three tank-types and 2 groups to take all three down at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it really is fairly easy to get it, you can just jump down into the hole from the paineel entrance, and either use DA or try and land in the pond to avoid death. <br />
<br />
Also, without checking alla or anything, I believe the item you need is fusible earthen ore, not INfusible earthen ore. So if i were you, i'd check the bazaar for &quot;fusible&quot; and see if you get any results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zcao</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes it is fusible not infusible, anyways i have been checking on fusible earthen core for weeks no luck yet.  I have bought all the other pieces.  Kinda just like waiting and see.  I am not sure if it is a good idea just go to pok and organize something cuz for one i have no experience with the terrain there.<br />

I forget...)spell, cast it on yourself, and immediately jump off of the cliff in Paineel into The Hole.  You'll land right where Guardian of the Seal spawns with his 2 guards, the animated constructs.   They will not agro you.  However, be careful when poking around, as there are mobs behind one doorway who will agro and kill you.  Use this cleric as your &quot;tracking&quot; toon, to see if Guardian is up, and when a guild is moving in to kill him.  When you see a guild OTM in to kill Guardian, ask if you can loot the ore when it drops. (I know on my own server, the ore frequently rots, but obviously this doesn't necessarily hold true on your own server).<br />
<br />
Hmmmm just remembered something about FV only allowing 1 toon per account ?   If that's the case, then you're sorta fuggered in regards to using this method, I guess.</div></div><hr />

lol, I saw yours pop up so many times while fighting Guardian.  While the following is Druzzil only kinda stuff (which isn't very interesting on class boards), I was fighting Guardian once when someone's tracker popped in.  Of course, he just stood kinda of next to Guardian when he changed forms and died to the AE, hahaha.  I think it was Kaludram (Shadow Congress), but I'm not entirely sure.  I rezzed him though.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok just wondering is there a server where items are different than other servers? Zcao you say you bought them? They are all No Drop that I know of. I did this quest just a few months ago and they were all no drop includeing the ground spawn one in Sky Fire Mountions. Now unless some servers have different item rules which is possible cause I have only ever played on 1 server I would have to ask are you sure you are getting the right quest items. Now for the single pulling issue I can tell you that you can single pull him. Might take a bit and the monk died like 4 or 5 times doing it but he was finally able to single pull the one closer to the door. The on the other side of the GotS (the one between the GotS and the wall) we did not even bother trying. We just killed them together. I just thought I would throw that bit of info out there but I would definately say check and make sure you are getting the right stuff man.</div></div><hr />
