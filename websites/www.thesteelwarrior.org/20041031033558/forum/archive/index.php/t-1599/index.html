<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dps:mace/mallet<br />
aggro:bca/frostbringer or GHL X2<br />
dps 2hs:weighty polearm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lol I don't get why everyone says mainhand BCA over frosty.<br />
<br />
DON'T!<br />
<br />
The proc's on frosty and bca generate almost exactly the same ammount of aggro, and frosty's 12/22 is so much more dps than bca's 9/21 that there shouldn't be an argument at all.<br />
<br />
Aggro: Frosty/BCA<br />
DPS: Either jade mace/ GCM or GCM / Centi, those two combo's are neck and neck for dps, and gcm/centi gives you a ton more hp/str.<br />
<br />
Best bet for you is to get 51 and buy a 1:1 ratio two-hander. I have frosty/bca as my dual wield aggro weapons, and a 44/44 for dps, and I almost always use the 44/44, because the pure damage it puts out generates as much aggro as frosty/bca, and mobs drop a lot faster in groups with it. The only time's I would use frosty/bca are when you have no haster in group, or your dex is so high you get crits like mad with frosty/bca.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Take a good group to Veksar and kill the Remains of Sythrax or whatever his name is. He drops a no-drop 15/23 1HS that procs a 250 hate spell as well as a 12/19 +1 cold damage 1HS that procs a strength debuffer (probably decent for agro). He's in the house where those insane highborns are walking around, although he's on the 2nd floor and in a room to himself with only one PH. He can be killed with 4 people relatively easy (killed him with me, an enchanter, cleric, and druid). He dropped the 12/19 1HS for us the first time (which I let somebody in the zone loot), and a decent 10AC/STA 50 hp necklace the 2nd time (anybody wanna buy it? :p). For once they actually made it possible for non-uber guild warriors to get some decent taunters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aggro: Frosty main, snare whip offhand<br />
DPS: Jade mace main, Frosty offhand.<br />
<br />
your dual wield DPS atm is more than you would generate from the Weighty Polearm.  sell everything else EXCEPT the ToD.  Look into buying a Stone Bladed Axe of Dismay, any of the Tae Ew war weapons, or Tae Ew smithed 2 handers.  (the Tae Ew 1 handers would be a good choice for DPS as well as they are 12/20)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Frosty/Silken Whip is a good agro choice - I used that combo for a long time. If you are fighting in PoP and having extra agro issues I highly reccomend finding a sarnak warhammer - that weapon served me better.  Offhand either of the above with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It should be as simple as this<br />
<br />
1) Aggro combo - Frosty/ BAC<br />
2) DPS - Get a two hander (weighty polearm is cheap and good ratio)<br />
<br />
DPS is so much better for 2 handers that you shouldnt be using duel wield for dps.  Duel wield is for aggro.  Once you get the GSoT you got both aggro and dps in one item  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For aggro I would main Frosty, off Silken Whip.<br />
<br />
For DPS I would main Guard Mallet, off Frosty.<br />
<br />
You may want to try Weighty Pole arm for DPS, not sure of your damage bonus on it yet or rec level, etc.  You would have to play around for a couple of fights to see what you like better.  Also, if you are worried about aggro when DW for DPS (ie not wanting it) go GCM main/ Centi offhand.<br />
<br />
You are lvl 50 according to Magelo.  The Jade Mace IMO won't get enough of a main hand bonus yet to overcome the inferior ratio compared to GCM or Frosty.</div></div><hr />
