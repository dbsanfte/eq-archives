I specifically chose a human for their general, rather average stats. However, after a while I can't stand the look of them. After spending disgusting amount of plat on illusion potions (omg the comments were hilarious, &quot;... I swore you were a halfling last time I grouped with you.&quot;) I've decided that I need something more cost-effective.<br />
<br />
I've decided to complete the Crown of Deciet quest. However, I am unable to find &quot;An Old Froglok&quot; in Upper Guk so that I can speak to him and check my faction, and then get the piece I need. Does anyone know where he spawns in Upper Guk? Also, what increases my faction with whatever-faction-he's-on? I was told killing in Lower Guk and Sebilis helps. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There. The full map is HERE (http://www.eqatlas.com/uppergukmap.html) . There is either a froglok shaman or an old frog on that spot. Every 30 minutes it respawns automatically, and has a chance of becoming either an old frog or a shaman. Just run EQ in the background while reading the boards or something, and make sure you can see the frog. The old frog is alot smaller so it's easy to see when the shaman changed into an old frog. I waited an hour - 2 respawns - until it turned into an old frog. You don't have to kill it btw. Oh, and you need warmly faction, if the frog replies to hail with a Frrooaaakkk, do your turn ins.</div></div><hr />

If I kill the shaman, is it possible he'll respawn the old froglok? Or is it better to wait for it to change?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can also check your faction by conning any live frogs in lower guk as well if you dont want to run to the old froglok every few minutes checking faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhagulim</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the only way to access Lower Guk in order to kill undead frogs for faction through Upper Guk, or is there a way I'm missing?  Im an ogre so I'm KOS with Upper, and if I had to fight my way to Lower every time it wouldn't be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can just run through invis... or just not care about agro, once you know the path the froggies can't hurt you much on the way down, particularly if you have run3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">exactly, cloudy potions are less than 14pp  with Ogre cha and work nice till you have an invis item. I would suggest keeping at least 2 on you at all times.</div></div><hr />
