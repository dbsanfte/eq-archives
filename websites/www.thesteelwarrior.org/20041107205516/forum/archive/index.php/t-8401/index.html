<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snogirl Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everybody, I've been out of EQ for almost a year now but I plan on starting up again in the near future.  It seems that there have been quite a few changes to the warrior class since I left and I was hoping for a little help in catching up :)<br />
<br />
What I'm most interested in is the new discipline system...  Judging by what I have read from posts here it would appear that each disc now has its own separate timer, is this correct?<br />
<br />
Also, I have read a lot about an ability called &quot;incite,&quot; how exactly does incite work, and do we have other new abilities since with the addition of GoD (excluding the new AA's).<br />
<br />
Any help in understanding these new features would be greatly appreciated. I wish I new about this community while I had previously been playing EQ, you all share a wealth of fantastic information and I'm greatful that your all around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Incite is a disc that adds hate + hate DoT on your target. You can buy the disc in EC tunnel. Hand it in to any warrior trainer to learn it. Same goes for all of the old discs. Since you are level 57 you will probably use Bellow instead of Incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a new &quot;Combat Effects&quot; window accessed using Alt-C.  It's basically a &quot;spellbook&quot; and 8 &quot;spellgems&quot; for disciplines.  Your &quot;spellbook&quot; will be empty until you buy the &quot;tome&quot; for each discipline, and then give the tomes to a warrior trainer.  The tomes are all sold in the EC tunnel, and also in Plane of Knowledge.  You'll see other classes' tomes on the merchants too, so be sure to get the warrior ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the biggest changes is furious &amp; fortitude are on a separate timer from defensive/evasive/stonewall.So now you can chain them and pop furious say on a particularily nasty  mob and go defensive upon it dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a new button on the commands/socials buttons, its called Find, click it in PoK it gives you a list of NPC and what they are, click the NPC then find and a floating yellow line appears for you to follow to that person.  Makes finding the tomes much easier.<br />
<br />
Some new &quot;tomes/Disc&quot; are<br />
<br />
Healing Will  lvl 10 i think<br />
<br />
Throw Stone lvl 1 (just for shits and giggles) but seems unresistable hehe.<br />
<br />
All the tomes describe their function when you right click and hold so you can decide, oh and the hate/aggro line do not stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In PoK in the library on the same balcony as all the clerics is a Barbarian NPC named Heldin Swordbreaker. His /loc is n100, pos 1110, n28. He sells the warrior /disc tomes. All the early ones cost essentially nothing: 1 copper-ish. Buy the tomes from him. Take them to any warrior trainer &amp; you have the discs.<br />
The discs have been &quot;unlinked&quot; as poster above describes; they are now on various timers. You can't use more than one disc at the same time, but you can use them one after another as long as the discs are on different &quot;timers&quot; and you have the &quot;endurance&quot; for it. That's what your &quot;endurance&quot; bar is for, by the way. Also you will notice that the refresh times for discs have been changed. As posted above, ALT C gets your disc window to pop up. You can see what discs you have, and you can make hotkeys for them by clicking the &quot;make hotkey&quot; button (sorry, guess that's well into the &quot;duh&quot; category).<br />
(Off topic, but if you hold your pointer over your regular buffs now, you can also tell how much time is left on each buff).<br />
<br />
Timer 1<br />
Evasive (lvl 52) 3 minute duration, 7.8 minute refresh.<br />
Defensive (lvl 55) Three minute duration, 10.5 minute refresh<br />
Stonewall (lvl 65) Three minute duration, 10.5 minute refresh<br />
<br />
Timer 2<br />
Furious (lvl 56) Two tick duration, 40 minute refrsh.<br />
Fellstrike (lvl 58) Five tick duration, 25 minute refresh<br />
Fortitude (lvl 59) Two tick duration, 40 minute refresh<br />
<br />
Timer 3<br />
Charge (lvl 53) 5 tick duration, 25 refresh.<br />
Mighty trike (lvl 54) 5 tick; 25 minute refresh<br />
Precision (lvl 57) 5 tick; 30 minute refresh<br />
Aggressive (lvl 60) 1 minute duration, 30 minute refresh<br />
<br />
Timer 4<br />
Focused will (lvl 20) duration 1 minute, 5 minute refresh<br />
Resistant (lvl 30) 5 minute duration, 30 minute refresh<br />
Fearless (lvl 40) 1 minute duration, 30 min, refresh<br />
Spirit of Rage (lvl 61) 2 ticks, 30 minute refresh<br />
Healing Will (lvl 63) 1 min, duration, 5 minute refresh<br />
<br />
Incite line (adds a clump of hate instantly, then adds smaller amounts over time). I forget the refresh time on these, but they come back fast--you'll be able to use them every fight, sometimes more than once, depending of course on the length of the fight.<br />
Provoke (lvl 20) 100 hate + 40 hate/tick, 500 hate total<br />
Bellow (lvl 52) 200 hate + 50 hate/tick, 700 total<br />
Berate (lvl 56) 300 hate + 60 hate/tick 900 total<br />
Incite (lvl 63) 400 hate + 70 hate/tick<br />
<br />
There's another lvl 1 disc in there somewhere called &quot;throw stone&quot; or stone throw or something. Short range, 1 damage. There's another thread in here somewhere about it. Not useful except to newbies, but there is a possibility of someone eventually getting a screen shot of themselves gettign a successful finishing blow with stone throw, at which point no doubt the beer will flow freely.<br />
<br />
I might be a bit off on the lvls for these things here and there. As always, inspect everything before you buy it.<br />
<br />
There's some post or other in the library that's no dobout better organized than what I just typed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snogirl Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you all, that is lots of great information.  Your chart of the disc timers is very helpful!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good post Brabble, but Fellstrike is grouped under timer 3 I think with mightystrike.  Also unless they changed it I think evasive resuse is 10 mins 30 seconds now also, the same as defensive and stonewall.</div></div><hr />
