<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was barely sitting down when I heard a voice from the other stall saying: &quot;Hi, how are you?&quot; <br />
<br />
I'm not the type to start a conversation in the men's restrooms at a rest stop but, I don't know what got into me, so I answered, somewhat embarrassed, &quot;Doin Just Fine!&quot; <br />
<br />
And the other guy says: &quot;So what are you up to?&quot; <br />
<br />
What kind of question is that? At that point, I'm thinking this is too bizarre so I say: &quot;Uhhh I'm like you, just traveling east!&quot; <br />
<br />
At this point I am just trying to get out as fast as I can when I hear another question. <br />
<br />
Can I come over to your place after while? <br />
<br />
Ok, this question is just wacky but I figured I could just be polite and end the conversation. <br />
<br />
I tell him, &quot;Well, I have company over so today is a bad day for me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then I hear the guy say nervously... <br />
<br />
&quot;LISTEN, I'll have to call you back. There's an idiot in the other stall who keeps answering all my questions!&quot;</div></div><hr />
