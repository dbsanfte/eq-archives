<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smackadabut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sure that something to this effect has probably been brought to the surface in the past, or when LDoN first was introduced, but I have a serious quarrel with LDoN.<br />
<br />
I am sure you are all familiar with the &quot;trapped&quot; chests, boxes, and what-have-you.  I have also noticed that nearly every class has some special ability to see if it is trapped, how it is trapped, and disarm the trap.<br />
<br />
What are us warriors supposed to do about this?  Just stand there, and pray someone doesn't set off the trap?  Or do we just smash the daylights out of it, like we did to the former owners of this object?<br />
<br />
I seriously think we should have the common sense as warriors to at least look at it, to see if we should bash the crap out of it, but our mighty creators have apparently deemed us too simple-minded to take on such a task.<br />
<br />
Apparently warriors such as myself are too dumb to figure out what the difference between a normal box and a trapped box looks like.<br />
<br />
Am I alone in feeling some sort of frustration over this?  Or are we supposed to be nothing more than meat shields, existing only to take damage and scratch our heads when asked a question?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are looking for RP justification of having a sense magic skill or something like that then I think you may not find a good one. We as warriors do not spend our time learning about magic, but instead about all things combat. In a roleplay sense we would recognize the more common detrimental spells being cast because everywhere we fight we see some finger-wiggler chanting the exact same mumbo jumbo and then we feel burned/sick/poisoned etc. <br />
<br />
Traps are the land of the rogue, and I would leave it to them. Since magical traps are now in use they are the land of the magic user. When no one else can get into a box for whatever reason, I let them zone out after the adventure, then I sometimes go mad-nasty on the box. I could die, I could get drunk, I could just synge my eyebrows, but I won't endanger my group to do it. We have an ability to open these, but truly it is a last case scenario.<br />
<br />
Btw, /inspect a box and it will tell you if it has magic runes or whatnot. In the beginning it would sometimes set off traps, but for the last month I have not had one go off because of /inspect. Think in an RP sense, you are inspecting it ( shaking it to hear a rattle, or running your fingers along it to see if it has magic dust on it etc etc). Would you really try to get into locked safe with a crowbar if you thought it could be rigged with dynamite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The answer to your last question is yes. <br />
I don't care about the chests and boxes at all. Usually my groups just ignore them. The last 4 I have seen opened have contained: 2 x Potion of Illusion Iksar, Potion of Charisma and 5pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">arf arf<br />
<br />
One single charge, no drop invisibility potion ... cuz Cloudy Potions are hard to come by ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/inspect <br />
runes caster/priest chest<br />
no runes but a lock rogue chest<br />
no runes no lock melee chest<br />
<br />
when you find a melee one /open<br />
it will either be unlocked or a bash object<br />
if it doesnt open bash it<br />
loot goodies<br />
<br />
we normaly get barrels and other things you would smash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lynetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Off the subject Doggabone but Cloudy potions are sold on a vendor in PoK. If I missed the sarcasm forgive me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">arf arf<br />
<br />
It wasn't sarcasm but a ham on wry ;).  (Even the house druid uses Cloudy Potions sometimes, more reliable than her camo.)  I mentioned the vendors and the 11-ish plat price about a dozen times when the fella in the dungeon was saying &quot;Isn't anyone gonna roll?&quot;.  It wouldn't have been quite so ludicrous if it was droppable /sniggle.<br />
<br />
Now ... a single charge of Illusion:Giant would have been cool.  To look Vindi square in the eye instead of dead into the toenail for once ...<br />
<br />
I have seen a couple that were guarded ... the &quot;lock&quot; was the MOBs in proximity to it - kill 'em all, the chest will open.  Just last night, on an alt, I got to open a chest while the party was fleeing it in terror.  /inspect (&quot;The edges have worn smooth from the wind and the sand&quot; or summat, no runes no locks) ... /open ... &quot;Who wants to roll on the STR aug?&quot; :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Augustus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only way I can see them implementing something for warriors is to maybe make a door/chest/something &quot;Stick&quot; where it would need a person of considerable braun to open it. Then the &quot;finger wigglers&quot; would need us to open em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still a bit new to LDoN stuff, but aren't there already chests/boxes that we can bash open?<br />
<br />
The door thing is a neat idea, but it'd only be &quot;fair&quot; if the door was to open up into an area with loot, or a named (something not essential to the adventure)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Augustus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree. It would need to be something that is not necessary to the adventure. Like the chests are. Would be really cool to have to bash a door open though so that we could get to a named mob or something.</div></div><hr />
