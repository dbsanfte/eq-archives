If you want a decent range go for a Charm of Defense like you said originally, off some named in the first castle in Fire.<br />

Dunno what all you guys farm and your luck with loot is, for us haste shoulders from Peregrin rot, haste bracers are close to rotting, and we've only ever gotten one ring from Air and belt from Coirnav.  For me I'd say go for shoulders or bracer, not much difference between your current set up, and they're fairly common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my ring im going to replace is 20ac so i would be losing 11ac. the charm is like 3more ac and 50hp or something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go Band of Swirling Air for ring, or Double woven Kelp Cord for belt.<br />
<br />
Whichever dropped first and you were able to get. The ring will be the biggest HP upgrade, but you'd lose more AC. The belt you would only lose a little AC.<br />
<br />
If I was in your situation and had a choice, I'd take the Kelp Cord and wait on a ring from Time. But I wouldn't pass up a ring if it did drop.<br />
<br />
Plenty of decent rings in time if you get a belt, and even Rathe ring is very nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be a downgrade for him. And no way is his guild going to farm Dozekar for that. Thats the worst piece of advice I've heard this month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-Kai-</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should I wait for Woven Kelp Belt, Haste Ring or Croc Shoulders?   Not interested in bracer...will wait for Raex's.   We've killed croc about 4 times and gotten Priest item everytime.  How rare are haste ring or Kelp belt?  <br />
<br />
Click sig for magelo...man, Belt of the Destroyer use to be the sh*t.....sad times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinekus Aleswig</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The flowing moss mantle drops off the boss of the rock ring, not the croc, he drops different shoulders.  I would say the flowing moss mantle off the rock ring in PoE would be your best upgrade.  The ring would be nice too, I guess I would take whichever came first.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Advice was for Kai, not first poster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What others said. Kelp Cord would be best if you can hold out for it. Otherwise Band o Swirling Air, which hasn't been that rare for us at least. 3 in 6 kills I think. Really your only 2 good choices. You already have nice shoulders, and cloak so can't move ensorcelled there so Flowing Moss not the best choice(plus you'd lose 5hp, oh nos!).</div></div><hr />
