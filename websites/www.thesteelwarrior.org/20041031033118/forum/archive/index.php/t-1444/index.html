<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Belwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I plan to reactivate my account within the next month or so and would like some information.<br />
<br />
my barbarian warrior was lvl 52, IF he hasn't been purged in the last 12 months since i quit (crosses his fingrs and prays HARD). since this was my first character i'm kinda attached to him and REAL broke. i think i have 2kpp in the bank.<br />
<br />
i have a lammy/venomous axe combo<br />
with a BBoT and CoT in my weapons bag and Felhammer for 2hs. i believe my ac was around 1000-1100.<br />
<br />
i have no clue what /shield is and can only drool when reading about the weapons alot of the posters here mention. will i be in bad shape when i reactivate my account or not.<br />
<br />
ps  why the hell do knights need hate generating spells??? i never had much problem with agro before unless grouped with total morons but from what i've read they have gotten even lazier since last year:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'll be in good shape for now.  You might have some trouble getting a group but with mudflation that 2kpp will go a long way towards buying new gear.  Also if you're a Rallos Zek follower you'll be in luck because you're going to be able to pick up some really nice armor when you get the money.</div></div><hr />
