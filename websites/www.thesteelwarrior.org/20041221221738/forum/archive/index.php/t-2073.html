But I am against haveing to spend hard earned exp to get to do it when other classes do not have to do so to get the benifit of those stats right away or the benifit from ac/stam/hps.<br />
<br />
AA's are nice, but they can't be a replacement of actuall fixes to warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
everyone will want items with mana and int etc...<br />
<br />
theyll have to put mana on every item..<br />
<br />
etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're absolutely right, (along with everyone else who's making similar comments) but I have dreadful news.  For Sony, EQ = Money; AAs that are necessary = more /played time = more money.  Expect any meaningful, nonnerf fix that comes from Sony to be an AA or a quest.<br />
<br />
Why do Rogues and Monks need more HP? The proliferation of HP to classes that aren't supposed to tank is one of the reasons why tanking is so screwed up today.<br />
<br />
Monks and rogues need hp for survival purposes.  Though in retrospect, &quot;Smart mitigation&quot; (which seemed like a good idea because it gives less to hybrids / casters) should probably be warrior or warrior+knight only.  Nontank classes get plenty of AC from mudflated gear.<br />
<br />
then all warrior only items will become crap<br />
I'm sorry, I thought the consensus was that Time items already did that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe but I don't find their (as in Monks and Rogues) comfort level a really compelling issue.  Although it is my opinion, I see too many Rogues and Monks with 7K HP.  I really don't understand why they need more.<br />
<br />
With that said, I don't mind Warriors having something like this to convert more &quot;useless&quot; stats to something meaningful.  Although I wonder, how much more HP/AC will it take to be &quot;useful&quot;?  Monster mitigation isn't the bonus it once was....</div></div><hr />
