I have 91 AA atm (7 unspent I think), and was planning on finishing out the old AAs (Flurry 3, Double Riposte 1,2,3 &amp; Ambidexterity) before moving on to the PoP AAs.<br />
<br />
Questions are .... is there any lvl 61 AAs you consider must haves?  Would you consider any of the ones I am about to buy junk?<br />
<br />
I use a GSoT as a 2H blunt, but find myself more often than not using my epics in BoT, HoH, and PoTa because I cannot otherwise hold aggro.  This is why I include amibdex, even after reading what has been said about it.<br />

Although everyone says lvl is greater than all, I pefer to group with a 61 AM3 ranger over the more common 65 ranger with not one AM AA.<br />

Gear, AA and Level.. it all counts.</div></div><hr />

I would never want to group with a 61 warrior if I was any of level of any other class.  Your taunting ability is the suck, yes more so than at 65 and you are missing out on HP, added damage mitigation, DPS.  Did I miss anything?  Maybe its different on your server, but when a 65 war and a 61 war are lfg in same zone, 61 would never be chosen, regardless of AA, hell no one even asks about AA.<br />
<br />
Back to your original Question about PoP AA, I'd say LR and Innate Defense and PD are definately worth getting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Since we are now off topic.  Let me add some thoughts.<br />
<br />
A level 60 warrior with 91 AA is in fact better than a 60 warrior with no AA (no one would argue this).  I would go one further and suggest a level 60 warrior with 91 AA is better than a 61 warrior with no AA.  <br />
<br />
I'm not really sure where the cut off is ... but I hope you understand that level is only greater than AA if you want to be that level.  Time spent gaining levels or AA only matters if your bored doing what your doing.<br />

<br />
You sure you would not group with me if you were say a 55-60 cleric?  Or would you choose the level 65 warriors hunting in old world (oh yeah.. there is none cause they have been exiled to play only in PoP).  <br />
<br />
Until SoE decides to turns the old world from green to blue again, I will not be going for level 65.  As for groups, my wife is a cleric.  I have not a trouble in the world getting groups and being MA, even in tier 3.</div></div><hr />

PoP AAs are same old shit as Luclin AAs so there are no MUST have pop AAs like run3/AE taunt/ND. As on which pop aa is better do a search that topidc has been beaten to death, but really I mean AAs are pretty self explantory decide for youself what benifits your play style the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stalwart endurance is a damned fine AA, I highly recommend it.  It even works at 60 too, so get it, and die back to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No matter what lvl you are i would not spend points on those dmg aa's before getting PoP aa's like lightning relfexes and innate defense.  And after you have most of the aa you need, i can say dont waste aa on double riposte, was the biggest waste of pts i ever spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kriegartorv</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">double riposte is a nice aa... 80 percent chance to score a double riposte isnt bad when killing a lot of green mobs =o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angre</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I have to reply to this. I speak of first hand experience.<br />
<br />
Right after I dinged 65 I had 3 AA (run3). We had a guild warrior at the time that was 61. He had run3, regen3, CF3, ND2, PE, AET and flurry3. Was pretty cool he had his Marshall title and I didn't even have Baron.<br />
<br />
We were buffed with Virt and Vallon. Both of us had Windblades and he had about 50 more HP than me. I had 7 more AC than him. So we were pretty dead even on HP, AC, Atk and melee stats in general.<br />
<br />
We dueled...Not dancing around or using discs. We just went head-to-head...face-to-face...no fruffy stuff.<br />
<br />
He died before I went into berzerker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yroc Morf</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure that proves anything.  I understand PVP is not quite the same as PVE.<br />
<br />
In many ways its too bad you did not try testing the diff between the two of you in a PVE situation.<br />
<br />
i.e. <br />
<br />
Had you attacked equal single targets at the very same time...... then seen who died first and how much health each of the mobs had left when each warrior died.  That would have been a good comparision to know the difference.<br />
<br />
I personally don't think the 61 would hold up to the 65.. but I would bet it would not be same result you got from PVP.<br />
<br />
In the end, I don't think its important how much difference there is.  The reason I have not leveled to 65 is because old world would turn green con and I would get bored of PoP only content quickly.  Right now I have options.. and I like that.  When they change the cons.... or I get sick of old world content.. I will ding to 65 ... until then.. no go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angre</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can understand your non willingingness to go to 65 if you still like the old world zone.  A lot of fun can be had there and several zones to choose from. Plus maybe your friends aren't up to par with some Tier 3+ zones.<br />
<br />
However, if you have a guild that can get the tactics, torment, and BoT flags...there is a lot of fun to be had (even more than OS). I mean, there is nothing like sitting in the SW corner of the tactics pit with 5 mobs in camp and you see the stampede message.  Go ahead Mr. Enchanter. Mez that piglet but don't die because we have 5 adds here. Not to mention you get an AA about every hour and half if you have a high DPS group.<br />
<br />
It's all in where you want to go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not all in where you want to go.  Some people don't want to be 65, it's that friggin simple.  The question wasn't about what level he should be, the question was what AA he should get out of the PoP brackets.  Save yer levels &gt; all crap for a thread that asks.  This guy isn't asking for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bridgecrusher</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming there are good reasons for you not to level to 65, there are a few PoP AA's you should consider before getting ambidex and flurry 3 at level 61:<br />
<br />
tactical mastery 1 - Killer AA for the 2 points and WILL increase your agro ability<br />
stalwart endurance 1 - If you're getting stunned alot this will help, and less time stunned = more time hitting.  Nice AA for the 2 pts.<br />
Ferocity 1 - Increased number of successful double attacks for 3 points, again useful for more agro generation.<br />
<br />
PD 1 is nice for hps, but you'll get more for leveling to 62, so its up to you on that one.<br />
LR 1 - more avoidance is really good, especially since your level will allow tier 3 mobs to hit you alot.<br />
ID 1 - more damage mitigation is good for the reason above.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you get all the above before snagging ambi dex or flurry 3, due to AA spent vs gain.<br />
<br />
TM1 (2pts), Fer1(3pts), SE1(2pts), LR1(3pts), ID1(3pts), PD1(3pts)<br />
<br />
for a total of 16 AA you get alot more gain than the 18AA you'd have to spend for flurry 3 and ambi dex.  I'd also buy them in the order I've shown.  Then get your ambi dex, then flurry 3, then whatever makes you happy :)<br />
<br />
Just realize that level 62 will probably add more for you than those AA's, at the price of less AA exp per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikkorak</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use those 7 aa up, then grind it, you will never regret it.  Mitigation a lot higher at 65 too.<br />
<br />
Stalwart Endurance.  Get lvl 1/2.  Even gives you a nice message when it works.  Invaluable, not only does it give non-ogre's the protection against stun, it gives us one up, and works on hits from all sides.  Running in WW is THAT much easier :)<br />
Honestly, this increases dps simply due to the fact you are stunned less.  Tired of being stunned in PoV or wherever when the mob runs in and hits you for 10 points ?  Get it, you wont regret it.<br />
<br />
Then do 65, you like aa, aa comes faster at 65 imo, more groups, more resists, all the aa available, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Angre your post on PvP dont really belong here and if you like to compare AAs that way first off you'd have to duel a lot more then once, becuase of luck factor. Also you dont state if you were hasted the same which would make a huge fucking difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I were you I woulnd't think of PoP AA's being linear after the older ones.  There's a serious buttload of quite valuable AA skills from the PoP tree that have no requirements of previously spent AA.<br />
<br />
If you're not an Ogre, Stalwart Endurance is one of the best values in AA's.<br />
<br />
If you're done with CA, then finish up LR before moving on.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery is also quite a nice DPS upgrade if you tank a lot.</div></div><hr />
