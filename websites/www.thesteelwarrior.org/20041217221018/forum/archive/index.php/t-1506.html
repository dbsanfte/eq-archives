So far we've done Va`dyn, Talendor, and Zlandicar. What else could we try? Velk? VS? Chardok King/Queen? Vaniki? I have 5900 hp unbuffed, primal, etc, Monk has primal and horns of chaos, cleric has roughly ft7, 4.5k mana, any ideas are good. Loot isnt necessary really, just the challange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trak is always a fun 1 group target. Vindi can be done but he's pretty tough to one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One grouping Trak would be interesting to see done since the manaburn nerf.  Plan on having 2 people in the shroom maze after 45 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI - there is an easy way to beat Trak touch. Have the tank get first agro, soon as he gets ported, sit down and Trak will summon you back. Trak should be dead before 2nd port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breogan</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dozekar is a nice 1-groupable target. Those quests are still awesome items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chardok is an easy 1 group.  As is Doze, but with Doze, be prepared to have a boring fight, 6 people don't go through 400k very fast I've learned.  General for rogue epic is nice to say you've done with 1 group, but you'd need a rogue to spawn the thing.  Could also try the new veksar dragon, don't know much about him though.</div></div><hr />

Zelnithiak is a long fight but can be done.(Druid, me, Mage had fun on that one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The named in Nightmare are all one-groupable.  The spider and the big gator are easy.  The Shade is a challenge but we did him with one group + a couple bots.  The good news though is that he regens slow so if things are going bad just camp your cleric and reset.  I always wanted to try Velk but never got around to it.  Master Yael is kind of a fun 1-group kill because of the Deathtouch, but he's not hard and it's tough to find him up.  Any kunark dragon should be pretty easy as well.  A warrior on TM recently did Vindi with 3 bots and a monk but his gear is quite a bit better than yours.  I think all of the UP named are probably 1-groupable these days also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One group PoS named are one of the hardest things I have ever done.  Try this.. its a must (beware of the storm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfeye</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i did vindi last night, 3 clerics me and a monk.....<br />
<br />
had some added baggage of friends but that group coulda done him easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One group trak is trivial... Mage, Cleric, SK, any 3 other people...<br />
<br />
Person tanking get's touched, COTH.  Trak turns to run and you know he'll gate?  HT disc does 8800...<br />
<br />
I want to leave Mourningloree home one day and play a guild SK and bring my gf's Magician to see if i can't triple box Trak with the cleric tanking while the COTH is going...  I think it's doable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bugbok</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">was just curious, hence the mage wouldn't the pet be better to have tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive 3 boxed doz with a cleric shm and warrior, trak takes like 3 people..4 max.  Klandicar is fun to do with 1 group, not because hes hard just because he has a shitload of hps.  All up mobs are 1 groupable so is all of ntov.<br />

<br />
The adds were the hardest part since we bascialyl only had one person on each add so even they took forever to kill..</div></div><hr />
