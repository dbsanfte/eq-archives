<br />
My max hit with BF is 108 non crit. 16 damage weapon. If I put my blackout main hand, 16 damage + 2 cold damage. The max is still 108 non crit. <br />
<br />
Anyone have some logs they could check to see if elemental damage ever raises your maximum damage? Just starting to wonder how little elemental damage actually does.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, it should add to the effective maximum of the weapon. Try using it for a longer period of time against low level mobs where you know the cold damage won't be resisted.</div></div><hr />

Fight something low level for a while and you should see higher max hits.  Try smacking a low-level twink in the arena while he's sitting.</div></div><hr />

Most of the time, it seems like my max hit is 181 .. I'll see the number alot over the course of the night. Very rarely though, I'll see a 197.<br />
<br />
If you /really/ want to test this, go grab some phosporescent torches from the guards in Tenebrous by Katta, since they're like 1 damage with 6 fire damage.<br />
<br />
Edit: Duuuuh, didn't even finish my thought.</div></div><hr />

After thorough parsing, it's obvious that my max hit non crit is 439 normal, 445 with the +1 Magic Damage.  Magic is usually the most debuffed resist on raid and xp mobs, so it's probably the best overall.</div></div><hr />
