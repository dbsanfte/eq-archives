<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kharse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, another quick question.<br />
I realize the warrior's primary job is to take damage, therefore most of you suggest maximizing defensive AA's before most others. How would a warrior that maxed offensive AA's stack up to Rangers/Shadowknights/Paladins and Monks for DPS at higher levels though?<br />
<br />
How would a warriors DPS stack up against a Ranger/Shadowknight/Paladin/ Monk pre 55?<br />
<br />
<br />
I realize it's largely gear dependent, but assuming equal gear can a warrior equal the dps of a Shadowknight or Ranger?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kharse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry SQ I guess, just visited the SK Forums, seems I just need to get something called &quot;furious&quot; and a nice 2hs and it's good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused here.  Are you trying to say a warrior with good offensive AA post 55 will equal or outdamage a ranger?  Heh... not even close... not even in the same ballpark... a ranger with a good bow and AM3 / EQ AAs will destroy a warrior's dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">seems I just need to get something called &quot;furious&quot; and a nice 2hs and it's good. <br />
<br />
I dunno what you really mean, Furious is a discipline that all it does is riposte all your incoming damage for 12 secs. Sure that if you get a heavy 2h and use it, you might get some good amount of hits.... for 12secs. Furious is not a mainly offensive discipline, so it's not good for the topic you are asking about, you have much better offensive disciplines like Fellstrike or MightyStrike, that last longer.<br />
<br />
And yeah, a ranger with his Class AAs and a good bow is much better at DPS than a warrior with Offensive AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good thread in the library about this.  It is using time weapons, but pretty much everybody is using the same level weapons and have all their offensive AAs so it's a good comparison.<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6989</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a ranger with a good bow and AM3 / EQ AAs will destroy a warrior's dps.<br />
I disagree... AM3/EQ produces decent dps (and IMO it's decent enough, given that archery is mana-free, low-aggro and low-risk), but a warrior with a common weapon like the Auliffe staff and equivalent number of AA's spent will come very close to a ranger with AM3/EQ and elemental bow.  Trueshot disc is another matter entirely (as are warrior offensive discs, for that matter).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm confused here.

Heh... not even close... not even in the same ballpark... a ranger with a good bow and AM3 / EQ AAs will destroy a warrior's dps.<br />
<br />
Once they hit Time, most rangers will opt for melee rather than archery since their dual wield setup will generally outparse their archery sans TS.  With the darkglint blade and timespinner, 250 worn attack, all relevent offensive AA, rangers will sustain 200-215 dps mixed in with their 2 nukes.  A similarly equipped warrior with DBotW and EoE will do 200-210.  I wouldn't consider that 'destroying' a warrior's dps.<br />
<br />
I just parsed Bertoxx in Time - ranger 50.2k 193 dps, ranger 45.3k 185 dps, warrior 45.1k 173 dps.  Further down, a war using VDD instead of DBotW / EoE did 38.5k 154 dps.<br />
<br />
Give warriors fero and ferine and you'll see another 15-25 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As I understand, rangers often use their attack buffs over BSS, adding more DPS over warriors. Just an additional thought, the buff difference is considerable atk.</div></div><hr />

Either your class is an offensive one or a defensive one.  Logic dictates that as soon as you begin to get more of one, the other needs to decrease correspondingly in order to maintain balance.<br />

<br />
Callon, thats EXACTLY what I'm saying.<br />
<br />
The problem with ranger DPS is that all they need is buffs/mediocre gear and a bazaar bow thats only marginally worse then their Time bow. There's no other class who can rack up the same damage(melee based damage) with bazaar bought shit.<br />
<br />
and no Luna, Pallies should always be the worst DPS in the game. it only seems fair that way.</div></div><hr />

Becasue a warrior is a master of weapons too, you do realise that warriors have higher weapon skill caps than knights? A warrior is supposed to do more damage than a knight, in fact they should and do do decent damage compared to other melees classes. Sks should exceed warrior damage with spells, but soe fucked up on their spells and they dont.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but I could honestly could care less what WAR are supposed to be (master of weapons or what not)--  the bottom line is, you can't have it both ways.  Either your class is offensive or defensive.<br />
<br />
WAR want to be the best defensive melee class in the game?  Fine--they should be.  The clear drawback of that should be LOW DPS. <br />

Read earlier link for WAR DPS.  I'm refering mainly to end game, but, in theory, it should apply equally across *all* levels. <br />
<br />
It's very high and most WAR that I know don't dispute it.  Hell, some even say that (essentially) in this thread.<br />
<br />
Gear makes WAR DPS come at later levels?  What kind of logic is that?  All other melee classes should get loot that makes their DPS go up accordingly.<br />
<br />
And LOL--DPS is *NOT* &quot;one small part of the game.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">lunaticfringesk, your assumption that we must be either a defensive powerhouse or an offensive one is a false Dichotomy.  I understand your point, that you believe a class would be overpowered if they were masters of both, but what you don't realize is that EQ isn't broken up into those two areas, offense and defense.  There is a third area that often is as important as both of those, and it's called utility.  While time geared warriors are putting out some decent DPS, and are hands down the best damage absorbers in the game, they still lack any broad means of utility, keeping their power somewhat in check.  Pally's and SK's have agro tools warriors don't, not to mention things like snare and stuns which are situationally helpful.  Monks have pulling (though I'm willing to conceed that they in some ways need more).  Rangers have buffs and snare.  Rogues have sneak (though I'm thuroughly in the boat that they need more).  And so on.<br />
<br />
Just because warriors are good damage absorbers doesn't mean that they shouldn't be able to put out some damage as well...  it's the wage for having no other utility... your job is to simply hit and be hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Small part I was refering to were Time geared toons.  Just like knights were asking for class changing abilities, using a small part of the game as justification (GoD zones).<br />
<br />
It is obvious that you are trying to pick a fight, have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lunatic, for whatever reason, Verant decided to make one class that has by far the least utility out of all 16 classes. That is the reason that we can &quot;have it both ways&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Medium DPS + top defense + least utility = balanced.<br />
 <br />
You may not like it that EQ is balanced on three axes (the 3rd axis being utility), but that's the reality of this game. Don't blame warriors, blame Aradune and the rest of the original &quot;vision&quot; architects of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sorry, but I could honestly could care less what WAR are supposed to be   <br />
<br />
And we could care less what you think a warrior should be. <br />
<br />
Show me where it says that a warrior should have the lowest dps because of survivabily. Altho i dont have a copy (someone here might have it) its says in the warrior class discription that warriors do considerable damage, maybe you should do some research before making stupid posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>aabuster1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">WAR want to be the best defensive melee class in the game?  Fine--they should be.  The clear drawback of that should be LOW DPS. <br />
Sorry, but it's very clear.<br />
<br />
I think its your sense of balance that is at fault here. You are saying warriors should have low offensive ability because they have high defensive abilities. Comparing warrior skills to other sets of warrior skills is like having weight only on one side of the scales.<br />
<br />
What you should be comparing/balancing warriors with is other classes in the game. For example Paladins get spells and other innate abilitys(heals, LOH, and all that nonsense) so there abilities had to be lessened to balance them with the other classes.  <br />
<br />
Warriors pretty much do two things, Hit and be Hit.  They should do both pretty well.<br />
<br />
In comparison to other classes I think warriors are fairly well balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lunaticfringesk,<br />

I disagree pretty much with many of the posters in this thread. Even with PoTime lvl weapons, attack modifiers, and higher haste Warriors still produce base level DPS. A simularly decked out Rogue, Monk, Ranger, etc. can do better. I happen to believe even Knights get a very subtantial DPS improvement with PoTime lvl weapons, attack modifiers, higher haste, weapons dps augs, their superior weapon buffs, and in the case of SK's - DD, DoTs, debuffs, and pets.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't really the most &quot;defensive&quot; tank. Paladins out solo us and perform better in normal experiance groups, showing that even with their lower DPS, their capacity to heal, stun and Root blue mobs etc. gives them more overall survivability. Only vs. high DI mobs do Warriors enjoy a substantial advantage - especially for 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Warriors surely aren't the most &quot;offensive tank&quot; either. Furious is nice, but any PoTime SK can run rings around me.<br />
<br />
What you and other Knights seem to be complaining about is that Warriors are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battle and are masters of all weapons - just like it says in our class description.<br />
<br />
True, Knights would be much more powerful if they had everything (or nearly everything) Warriors get PLUS powerful spellbooks, but that wouldn't be fair would it?<br />

<br />
As monks and rogues are suppose to.  The ~ 20% monk advantage / 40% rogue advantage holds true for most expansions, Time and GoD is no different.  I don't recall anyone in this thread stating Time equipped warriors will outdamage rangers, monks, and rogues; it was just stated that warriors aren't as bad as people make them out to be.  Once geared in Time, the same warrior will easily outdamage any ornate / BoT geared rogue or monk.</div></div><hr />

That's really some utility.<br />
<br />
Funny, I thuoght we had some minor necro utility... which apart from FD (this is not the monk instant cast FD btw) and summon corpse is pretty much available to warriors through clickies and... omg necro type DPS (wtf!) spells which form the bulk of our spell book.<br />

Anyways it seems to me that when it comes down to it, the Warrior has to deal a decent amount of dps to help maintain ownership of aggro and take most of the hits coming in which is the main reason for the existence of the class to begin with; high hit point max and high AC = the ability to take a beating and be needing a heal rather than a rez after the fact. And whether the damage a Warrior deals is dealt by bash or procs or just by direct damage, etc., it's important for a warrior to be able to dish it out and as far as I can see; a warrior can dish it out pretty well. Taunt will only do so much, a mob needs to be smacked around quite a bit by the warrior before the warrior can consistently maintain aggro... I could be wrong, but I think that's basically how it works. I mean until they give us the ability to kick a mob in the nuts and not just in general locations, we'll probably have to rely on our weapons and that's pretty much all I've needed so far ( I know things get tougher further down the road so no snide comments please, lol) I just love hacking away on a mob, makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside; and when it comes right down to it, that's why I play: to have fun. It's good not to get too hung up on which classes are better at what, although it is good to know which classes are better at what, but what I mean is that especially when the difference is such a minor one, it's not really an issue worthy of too much arguing. Just enjoy your class and do as much freakin damage as you possibly can, lol. Oh yeah, I'd like to see how a Ranger or SK compares to a warrior in terms of defense not offense, seems like the warrior would have a clear advantage... and as far as AAs go, I will not rest until I have every last one of em'. :)</div></div><hr />

I happen to agree with you to a large extent. Personally, in my view, warrior DPS should *barely* be above paladin DPS, and lower than that of SKs by far. We're made to take hits. Pallies are made to take hits and smash the unholy. SKs are made to make things mad and hurt them, but we all take hits. Warriors should do it better than the rest - we each need our own special niche. Warrior being to take hits all over, Pallies being good tanks that can smack down the unholy, and shadowknights - well, we'll find them a spot. But honestly, we're made to take the hits, not do the damage.</div></div><hr />
