lol nice.  Best close call I ever had I was killin a named in Tipt I think it was, I was using a bot cleric and healed myself for 10.5k when I only had 10.8k or somethin like that.  Yay for crit heals!  I've been FD'd/purple clubbed a couple of times but not against big boss mobs, though I think there was one time on Rallos Zek(tactics) a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

According to that, he gets heal for 4800 and must thus have at least 4800 hp. How can 2 hits(1425+1740) then bring him to unconscious? Seems odd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prusuming all the numbers are right, this could give some insite in to how DI works, if you are about to be killed by a hit and DI fires it may prevent damage from that hit or attack round first then heal you the rest reporting it all under one figgure.<br />
<br />
If it did work like that then some of the hits may have been not be shown or changed to something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i was under the impression that DI could in theory only partially fire.</div></div><hr />

The DI that was on him was cast by a cleric with UD3 in case you were curious. (Note that it wasn't MY ch that wasn't on time....FROG)</div></div><hr />

Now, Yes....dropping ang getting up like that is cool; But the never say die attitude trying to stab the bastage after getting knocked unconscious is much cooler.   Guess maybe thats just when the training take over eh?<br />
