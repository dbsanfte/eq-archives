The Fishbone earring he drops still sells for 3kish and that’s a lot at that level, hes on a 12 hour timer and spawns at the campfire next to the hut at the lake that’s straight out of the Surefall zone in Q Hills, its actually a bit to the right. You can time killing him and rack up good pp pretty fast =D I know I farmed him to hell until I had my Ykesha =D</div></div><hr />

Might be 6 now, still an awesome way to get pp at smaller levels</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curfang</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You've probably already verified the camp for yourself over the weekend, but when I camped Hadden, his spawn was 5.5 hours +/-20 mins.<br />
<br />
Also, he does not drop the fishbone earring every time. In fact, it's probably 1 in 10 or worse. I got the earring on the second spawn and proceeded to camp him several more times with no more earrings. Also, unless you are a fair amount higher in level, Axe Broadsmith and Rephas will add ... or so I've been told. I was high enough level that they didn't add.<br />
<br />
Also, Hadden comes with a minor Qeynos faction hit.<br />
