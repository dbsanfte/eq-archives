<br />
As of right now, skills cap at level 60.<br />
<br />
It is unlikely skills will go up from level 65, but we can hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khur sed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll be piss if its another 30hp per level thats it expension...<br />
<br />
Really really pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno, all I've seen in Lucy is just caster spells, no abilities for meeles or anything.<br />
<br />
Dont think they will raise the caps :( They've always said that 252 is most skills's cap.<br />
<br />
Im gonna be very dissapointed if this is another &quot;Shaft Meeles with Nothing but Gear&quot; expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pious Remedy, Word of Vivication and Omen-Cleric-Root will end up going straight to the back of many clerics' books. As will Pious Light and everything but buffs and nukes unless meditate and specialize alteration skills go beyond 252 and 200.<br />
<br />
An expansion where warriors get a few hp per level and mobs hit 30% harder? Sounds a lot like an expansion where clerics get a few mana per level and spells cost 30% more. Casters get 30% better nukes, melees' new damage tables at 68 and 70 will balance that. All melee classes got new damage tables at 63 and 65, and since nearly all GoD spells are just PoP spells with numbers increased by 30% (except Pious Light, which is only 15% better than HL, and costs so much mana only a 7k+ mana pool could sustain it), two new damage tables will definitely exist in Omens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Combat skills has nothing to do with power gain.  If they feel like letting you hit more often or more accurately they could always just give you more attack/accuracy for leveling up.  There exists items that modify just about any attribute related to combat right now, so the cap has nothing to do with whether character gains are possible.  I.e. if defense is to become better you could just get say 3X Improved Parry/Dodge at level 70 innate.<br />
<br />
And of course stuff will hit more accurately to balance out the new power so in the end there's no difference between not getting stronger and mobs get slightly harder, or we get better but mobs get a lot harder too.</div></div><hr />

on my window all the damn time, it doesnt matter how much damage a weapon does if you miss 70% of the time :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you hit more often the mobs would just have more AC or HP to balance.  If people can hit 100% over night, the mob will be roughly twice as hard to kill overnight as well too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes, but you cant get the oh so precius aggro procs on a miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes, but you cant get the oh so precius aggro procs on a miss.<br />
<br />
  Yes, yes you can. Weapons proc on misses. Mob innate procs don't.</div></div><hr />

/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm, thought they didnt proc on a miss or something like, so people use evasive on some of the luclin AoE proc monsters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mobs do not proc on a miss.  Weapons do.  Actually, even a mob wielding a weapon can proc on a miss (e.g. fight a giant using a velium whatever).  It's just that you pretty much will never find a mob wielding a weapon that has any significant proc so weapon procs are pretty much nonexistent with mobs.<br />
<br />
Innate procs that mobs get can only fire off on a successful hit.</div></div><hr />

Are you beta testing Omens or something?</div></div><hr />

F**king NDA... I said nothing, forget it</div></div><hr />
