Buff MR and use pillars to hide, no point to kill the guards at door too, watch TV during 30min depending of your raid size / dps and get loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep. Hide healers behind a pillar, have melee just chill out and wait for adds if there are any, and just nuke and dot him down. 1 MT, just keep him cured. It's a timed AE. Kill him and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Planning to use 3 groups, some under 65.<br />
<br />
Pillars? (could use more info on this)<br />
<br />
Is he slowable? does he have special attacks like rampage etc? and how do you deal with his AoE if you get hit with it (and I am thinking you use the pillars to hide from AoE right?)<br />
<br />
do you corner em? (on that note, which is the best corner to prevent adds)<br />
<br />
The AoE is timed? timed duration or it is timed to go off at regular intervals? what cure spell do I need to have the raid load up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On another thread, someone described him as a BoT Kriger with an AE.  That is pretty accurate.  There are three main ways to fail this encounter: 1) you get early aggro on Seru and/or fail to position him correctly, 2) you aggro too many adds at some point and get overwhelmed, 3) you lack sufficient healing to run the battle indefinitely.<br />
<br />
The healing situation is fairly straight forward.  Bring enough healing mana to keep your tank alive against a BoT kriger indefinitely, and some extra healing to account for occasional heals to everyone else.<br />
<br />
Positioning is solved by patience.  There will be a large number of trash mobs to clear around Seru's perimeter, which take ages to kill; you might even run into respawn issues; patience is a virtue for this.  Eventually you will have an opportunity to enter Seru's chamber without trash aggro.  Position Seru inside the main room, against a pillar around the wall.  If he's 2 pillars away from the corner of the room, then I believe the healers in the corner won't get hit by AE, and the roamers outside the door won't assist.<br />
<br />
Adds arise when people are poorly disciplined about staying away from doors, or if Seru ping pongs due to poor tank aggro (Seru's stun can make aggro nontrivial).  This again comes down to patience, making aggro control and survival of all raid members the top priority, rather than trying to burn him fast.  The tank doesn't need bane weapons, he should use his best aggro weapons instead, because he needs the aggro.<br />
<br />
With the patience and positioning taken care of, Seru is practically a free source of terrific loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A little investigative work would help you out with some of your questions... check Allakhazam's (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/) for infos about slowing, AoE, and AoE removal.<br />
<br />
Also of note, is for melee to hurt him they need seru bane weps... some crappy ones drop while you are clearing up to him, but aren't really worth it.  Yes, you use the pillars to hide casters from AE, they are all over the room.  I've seen it down with Seru tanked on one side of a pillar reverse cornerd with the healers on the opposite side of the pillar and dps casters standing in middle, its really an easy fight, don't even bother with melee, and if you get some of the stuff needed for bane weapons, just give them to rangers for bows, so much easier to do it that way than worry about curing/healing extra melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, got some new questions<br />
<br />
1) how many healers would you recommend<br />
2) necro twitching viable here?<br />
3) can he be mana tapped? <br />
4) where can I get some bane weapons for my raid's melee types such as rogues and rangers, do rangers need a bane arrow/bow?<br />
<br />
thanks for the excellent info so far.<br />
<br />
Off of what you say I am thinking of putting each group of melee damage types with 1 BL, have them back up when they get to 50% and have the BL do paragon and then go back into the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He lays hands on himself mid fight<br />

Which gives him about half of a percent of health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've got a question about getting the key for Seru.

This is a corner in Seru's room, if you haven't been there, you have no clue what i'm talking about. 1 is where the clerics ect stand, 2 is where I tank him - I do him with 6 people usually. Need to move around constantly to avoid being pushed to clerics/pushing LIS</div></div><hr />

Did like 160dps to me just the other day, but that's at 2226ac.  I was able to keep myself alive indefinitely with just my cleric.  The only reason we wiped is because my computer crashed at about 70% and I didn't drop for 6 minutes.  Being the only tank there, that kinda fucked everyone over.<br />

<br />
<br />
The less people there are in a zone, the less server stability support it has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Here is my old raid template for LIS:<br />
<br />
Meet up at the enterance to Sanctus Seru (near DSP zone), form groups, and buff up.  Then, the first group will teleport into the Arx and dispatch of the first few guards around the port in area.  After that, the key holder will gate back to the enterance of the city (bound there), get invited by the next group and port them into the Arx with the rest of the raid party - Rinsing and repeating until all of the raid is inside the Arx.  We will then make or way upstairs and to the maze enterance, killing whatever guards get in our way.  The Praetorian guards within the Arx are pretty tough and hit hard, but they can be slowed and mezzed. Then we will make our way, single-file, through the maze (no mobs).<br />
<br />
=&gt; Map of the Arx Maze (http://www.thekreator.com/graphics/arx_map.gif)<br />
<br />
At the end of the maze is a teleporter pad which will take us into Seru's inner sanctum.  The sanctum is basically a large square room with a door on each wall, and a hallway that circles the room.  We teleport into one of the corners of the hallway where there are roaming and static guards.  Seru himself is in the center room along with a guard posted at each door.  We will kill the guards in the hall and one of the door guards from the room, and then head to a corner of the room without aggroing Lord Seru, who is in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
=&gt; Diagram of Inner Sacntum (http://www.thekreator.com/graphics/seru_sanctum.gif)<br />
<br />
Once we are situated in a corner of the room, we will be free of agro and can buff up again, load spells, and prepare to engage Lord Seru.  The room is lined with pillars along the walls, which will be a key strategy to the fight.  As the diagram indicates, the MT will back into a pillar with Seru facing him and away from the rest of the raid with other melee attacking Seru's back.  Behind the next pillar (to avoid AE) will be the healers and non &quot;line of sight&quot; casters, and behind the next pillar (to avoid AE) will be the nukers and other &quot;line of sight&quot; casters.  When the fight begins, it is necessary for the MT to establish strong agro before anyone else engages, so no sitting, nuking, attacking, etc. until called for by the MT.  Once the raid does engage Seru, it is just an endurance fight to control agro and preserve mana while pecking away at Seru's HP.<br />
<br />
Some Info on Lord Inquisitor Seru:<br />
<br />
=&gt; He has near 1,000,000 HP!  Once engaged, it is not uncommon for it to take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour of pure combat to kill him.  This is why it is very important to conserve mana throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
=&gt; He hits pretty hard (in the 500-700's) and can flurry, so we will need a solid CH chain with spot healers.  Luckily he can be slowed though, and because of the length of the fight, he will need to be reslowed/debuffed as they wear off.<br />
<br />
=&gt; He has an ability called Stunning Strike (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1968), which stuns his target for 20 seconds!  It can be resisted with a high MR, but the MT will find himself stunned through most of the fight, and if this stun lands early on before strong agro is established, it can be bad news for the raid.<br />
<br />
=&gt;  He has another ability called Torturing Winds (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=2061), which is an unresistable non-directional AE curse that if lands on you does 300 damage every tick until it is cured or you die.  This is why we have as many people as possible hiding behind the pillars to avoid it.  It can be removed with Remove Greater Curse (single target) and with Radiant Cure I (group), so if we have enough healers with these abilities, then we can have more melee with bane weapons engaged.<br />
<br />
=&gt; He is completely magic resistant, and can only be harmed by melee with Seru Bane Weapons (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1997) and casters with fire, poison, and disease based spells.  If melee do not have bane weapons, or if we do not have enough healers that are able to cure his curse on them, then melee other than the MT will hang back with the casters to avoid the AE and sit tight or help with potential adds while Seru is engaged.  A damage shield on the MT and pets that can proc some damage are also helpful at slowly eating away at his HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rpgexpert article linked above has a terrific diagram explaining the layout of the room, the respawn locations, and the goal of positioning.  Read the article, post the diagram on your guild's web site.  By the time you have seru bane weapons made, everyone should understand the positioning diagram.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Final question, how do you handle a wipe?<br />
<br />
If everyone dies, you summon corpses to the zone in.  Or, if you get a cleric camped out in the corner, you hope s/he can log on and res you in (corner is safe once seru resets)<br />
<br />
Edit to Add: the Seru lag was mentioned by a dev as being caused by the massive amount of roaming mobs and buffing mobs in the zone. Supposedly it's like 10x the average and causes the massive spikes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Did they say they intended to fix those spikes?<br />
<br />
Anyhow is there any way to get the corpses without using the gate key? (like summoning from seru)<br />
<br />
Guess I had better figure this out soon, could be a big mess if we fail</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">When he said &quot;summon corpses to zone in&quot;, he didn't mean the &quot;gate key zone in&quot;, he meant the Sanctus Seru zone line to Dawnshroud or Marus Seru.  You get the whole raid to run to Sanctus Seru via Netherbian Lair etc., and summon everyone's corpses as usual.  No gate key required.<br />
<br />
*Note, I think everyone could actually be bound in Sanctus Seru, if you could find a safe spot for KOS people!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I placed a petition about the intermittant zone-only lag in SSeru and actually got a response.  They said the issue is a known one, but there was no easy fix.  ...whatever that means...<br />

The lag is odd, too, because it's obviously zone lag.  You still are able to chat just fine via channels/etc...just not raidspeak or whatever.</div></div><hr />

But ... but ... i thought raiding was just for the loot  :eek: <br />
<br />
:wanders off aimlessly<br />
<br />
PS- everyone here has told you pretty much everything you need to know + a little bit.  3 groups will make the encounter relatively trivial at this stage in the game, as long as you have 2 or 3 clerics who can work together well for long periods of time.  <br />
<br />
PPS- dont worry about the zone lag ... seru doesnt hit anything/anybody while the zone lags, so there really isnt much danger in it.  Just have a druid around to toss a patch heal after the lag hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
be careful, the best seru fights is when you have 16 people geared in NToV gear and he warps into the hall, and then runs back in to bring 8 adds.<br />
<br />
Also, if you suck on gear, 4 people in CHO grp, 1 necro, 1enchanter. Keep a mob with mana mezzed the whole fight, mindwrack. Keep this mob too, cause your necro is GONNA dot it :p they always do.<br />

You can use a paladin if you want. No banes are necessary, kill him with damage shield / DoT/nuke. ae is a short range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">it's probably been hashed and rehashed but reading 4 pages of stuff on seru is :( , so ..<br />
<br />
be careful, the best seru fights is when you have 16 people geared in NToV gear and he warps into the hall, and then runs back in to bring 8 adds.<br />
<br />
Also, if you suck on gear, 4 people in CHO grp, 1 necro, 1enchanter. Keep a mob with mana mezzed the whole fight, mindwrack. Keep this mob too, cause your necro is GONNA dot it :p they always do.<br />

A warrior can tank without bane weapons no problem.  Those aggro weapons work just as well even though they're not doing any damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">BTW, chances are, you can skip the bane weapons for seru. A couple wizards, a couple necros, and a couple shaman can put him down no sweat, it just takes an ass long time. Other melee can kill door adds to keep from dizing off.<br />
<br />
Get your rangers Ytrium bows and you won't be disappointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">The guards drop bane bows right?<br />
<br />
I had an idea, why not use the 175 damage procs on bows, the proc from time to time would drop em faster.<br />
<br />
Also do the GoD fire/ice AA arrows for rangers work on him? If I remember right they count as fire and ice damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Only thing that drops from the guards is mega craptastical (Like 6/24 ratio) melee weps iirc.  Myself and another ranger tried using out bow procs (125 dd on Warmaster's Bow) and the proc rate was so horrid that we just ended up chain nuking and sitting lol.<br />
<br />
I went and gathered the pieces for my own Bane Bow and have been waiting to use it, but my guild hasn't gone back to hit him since (/glares Apo)...  And yes the GoD AAs would work on him, but I beg you not to even think about asking your rangers to spend points on them, all they do is add an extra chance to proc to your bow, and the whole time they drain mana, regardless of the number of times they proc.  They are really crappy AAs and not worth it, just have your rangers chain nuke seru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Wasn't going to ask them to, but 2 or 3 of our rangers already have it, not much to do but grind AA's between raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">OK well we decided to go have a play with him, 10 chars between 6 people and we were doing just fine til an add from the door jumped me. Is it possible to go the whole fight without aggroing any guards? Normally we would just kill them on a raid but with so few numbers and a few bots it was too much and we evacced when I died.<br />
