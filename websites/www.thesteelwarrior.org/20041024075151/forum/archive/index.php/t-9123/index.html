<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:11:46 2004] Taromani says 'Greetings, Iksar. You have certainly traveled far from home. To what does Taromani owe the pleasure of this visit? Have you come to tell me a [story]?'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:12:06 2004] You say, 'what story'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:12:06 2004] Taromani says 'Splendid! I relish an opportunity to swap tales with mortals. Allow me to go first. In a shattered realm, there existed a twisted overlord that ruled all. He laid waste to entire worlds, destroying or consuming whatever he touched. Those that resisted his influence were quickly annihilated or enslaved. His lands were governed with an iron fist and later abandoned when they no longer served his purpose. This overlord was universally feared and despised. Yet, while his presence was eternally felt, the despot was rarely seen. He had sealed himself away in his citadel in the sky, flanked by his most trusted underlings. None [dared challenge] him there.'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:13:21 2004] You say, 'who dared challenge'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:13:22 2004] Taromani smirks and continues, 'The reason no one challenged the overlord was because his realm was fatal to all but a select few. The forces of chaos magic present there would tear most beings to shreds. Only with the proper protection could a mortal hope to enter the citadel of Anguish and survive the experience. It was the ultimate defense against invasion. However, there was a [flaw] in the overlord's plans.'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:14:15 2004] You say, 'what flaw'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:14:15 2004] Taromani licks her lips and whispers, 'The overlord failed to consider what would occur if a certain Iksar named Kinniku were to do a few favors for a Pyrilen named Taromani in return for her protection. Now it's your turn to finish the story. How does it end? Does the Iksar assist with the [favors]?'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:37:05 2004] You say, 'i wish to assist with favors'<br />
<br />
[Sun Oct 03 19:37:05 2004] Taromani says 'Very good. A life in Mata Muram's army is a dangerous one - often nasty, brutish, and short. He must regularly replenish his ranks, promoting the most talented individuals of the lower tiers to replace those that have fallen. Seek out and eliminate these promising soldiers, the up-and-coming members of his forces. Bring me their insignias in this case to prove completion. This will slow down their progress considerably. When you have done what I have asked, I will follow through with my part of the bargain and provide you with the protection you need to access his citadel.'<br />

Taromani gives you a 7 slot container:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lot more to it than that, dont waste your time blocking signets from those who can use if you're not in a high end raiding guild... and no offense intended, but if your guild is anywhere near able to get to anguish... you'd already know how to get the full key/flag quest done...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinniku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Information is power, i guess...<br />
<br />
Im uber and your not....right?  Its a quest that is accessible to all 69+ people.  How is trying to complete a quest blocking anyone?  Your post makes absolutely ZERO sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Davan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think what he is trying to say is that this doesn't provide access really to Anguish. In order to fully be able to do Anguish you need this quest and you need to do all the MPG Raid Trials. Not the single group ones but the raid ones. Either way I could care less who kills them they respawn pretty fast so its not really a issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What does completing all 6 of the single-group trials do for you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Horaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What does completing all 6 of the single-group trials do for you?<br />
<br />
some need it for epics from what i have read.<br />
<br />
Signets does not equal access or part of the quest to gain acess to anguish.<br />
<br />
completing the 6 raid trials = anguish access.<br />
<br />
Signets = block zone wide AE, think uqua.<br />
<br />
Thats why the person above said if you are not in a top end guild don't bother blocking on the signets, though the mobs seem to spawn quite regularly and for all non instance zones i beleive there are two different spots in the zone that they can pop.<br />
<br />
Its just not worth people who aren't in guilds that can beat the trials to spend time camping these items.  Anyway you can get all 6 signets in a weekend quite easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>athos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The raid trials give access to Anguish.<br />
<br />
The Signits block the zone AoE, like Uqua, as staed previously. Not sure if it means u cannot be productive at all without signit quest, or, if like Uqua, its jsut alot easier without the AoE.<br />
<br />
The one group trials add to your total resists, i believe 8 8 8 8 8 10 for a total of 50 to your max resist cap. And they drop 200 hp items!<br />
<br />
PS - only 1 guild in anguish atm i think,  CD on Veeshan. Others are close tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">will be a lot of guilds entering anguish over the next few days probably. &lt;3 mind.<br />
<br />
think of it like doing your VT key.  Hooray, you can collect your Lucid shards... but what good is it going to do you if you aren't even remotely close to doing Emp ssra?  luckily the signets are considerably easier to get then those hideous shards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">oh well, people worked on getting their VT shards long before they were in guilds capable of killing the emporer.  Like others have said, the mobs seem to be common enough, so if gathering up the signets amuses you, whether you're in a high end raid guild or not, have at it.  Just be aware that it won't get ya into Anguish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>axxeman01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I understand that I won't be able to access Anquish for some time, my guild is in potime however.  I know that does *not* equate to Anquish, but my hope is to make it there at some point.  At any rate, I'd like the personal satisfaction of completing at least this portion of the quest.  I still need info on the following spawns:<br />

<br />
Discolored Signet ID = &quot;Obtained from a Dragorn in the Sewers of Dranik&quot;<br />
NEED HELP ON THIS ONE - Ie, location and ph/name<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, generally speaking, does a level 70 have to request the expedition to get the 'named' or proper PH's to pop? Or could say a level 55 request the expedition, then level 70's do it in an all green field?  Just conjecturing here.   I've done about 5 expeditions, and haven't seen a named yet (requestor either 67 or 70).<br />
<br />
Thank you - Axxe</div></div><hr />

<br />
they fixed this a couple patches ago, supposedly, to keep folks from exploiting mobs for runes. Don't know for sure if it's fixed, but probably level based on who you can invite to the expedition.<br />
<br />
as for the 2 signets, can't help ya since i still need 'em and haven't tried any of those expiditions lately.</div></div><hr />

Catacomb exp can be got in dranik scar  and the mob pops in the room one of the named does sorry don't know how else to describe that.. it does have a ph but not a special name for the ph.<br />
<br />
sewers exp is off of dranik city if you go left out of zone in over the first bridge and hug left..  this is the one i don't have yet so don't know but i assume it is the same as catacomb where there is a spawn point w/ a ph.<br />

100% slow?  If thats the case that means you won't be attacking or casting at all!  What an aoe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No it just means you'll be attacking at half your speed with how EQ works.<br />

So every other round, all spell take twice as long etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, someone is pulling your leg. There is no zone AE in Citadel of Anguish. The signet is a secondary flag that you need to zone in after you have a seal, nothing less and nothing more. If you have the seal and signets aren't completed, you are just blocked from zoning in all together. The turn-in to Taromani doesn't result in an item, it's a flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">the AE in CoA is a -500 Str debuff plus 100% Melee and Spell Slow effect. Unresistable<br />
<br />
impossible, 100% slow can't be calculated. you may confuse with this Mata's gaze (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5685&amp;source=Live) which is the worst spell that I is in lucy up to me.<br />
<br />
Note : with 90%slow a 35 (darkblade) delay  weapon will have one round every 35s so at best you have 7s between each swing (flurry plus triple). thats damn long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No it just means you'll be attacking at half your speed with how EQ works.<br />

<br />
<br />
nope, slow and haste is the same thing but have different power.<br />
100% haste means you attack twice has much<br />
50% slow means you attack twice less<br />
200% haste means you attack three times more<br />
66% slow means you attack three times less<br />
<br />
and so on<br />
<br />
so 100% hasted doesn't mean fully hasted (obvious), but 100% slowed does mean you are fully slowed (still obvious).<br />
and when you are fully slowed you don't move at all in an finit time (ie you need an infinite time to attack).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">will be a lot of guilds entering anguish over the next few days probably. &lt;3 mind.<br />

Collecting lucid shards was one of the funnest two weeks ive ever spent on EQ.<br />
<br />
I don't know why, it just was.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you remember the fun we had in ahkeva !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>srogue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">nope, slow and haste is the same thing but have different power.<br />

and when you are fully slowed you don't move at all in an finit time (ie you need an infinite time to attack).<br />
<br />
Exactly my point :)<br />
<br />
100% haste = 2x original speed<br />
50% slow = 1/2 original speed<br />
100% slow = No attack, you are frozen.<br />
<br />
Same way with snare, when a mob falls below a certain amount of health, that 60% snare combines with the reduced movement rate of an almost dead mob to come to about a 97% movement rate reduction.  Thus, with snare, a mob appears to not be moving, but its actually moving at 3% of its original speed if I remember correctly, which makes it appear to be rooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Slows at or over 100% slow is meaningless.  Spirit's Touch in Uqua used to be a 130% or so slow but you can definitely still attack.  It'd appear the game simply treats 130% as 30%.</div></div><hr />
