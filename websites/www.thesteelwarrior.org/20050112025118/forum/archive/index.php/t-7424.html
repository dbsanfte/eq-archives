<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You refuse to recant on your prior stance that warriors maintain a 12% tanking edge over knights when there IS nothing to support that. If you believe we are wrong in this break down the numbers, explain WHY a war has a 12% edge in tanking but a monk does not have a 3% edge.<br />
<br />
I want to make this as simple as possible for you, so let me break it down what you have done.<br />
<br />
Random letter by dev saying knights mitigate 39% and wars 44% divide two numbers and you got 12%<br />
<br />
Now you went and said that statment backs up your argument that a war has a 12% advantage over knights because war dps taken and paladin dps taken are 12% difference (this is true you cannot deny this unless you edit your prior posts)<br />
<br />
Then when asked which is better tank, the monk or knights (monk having a 3% less dps taken then the knights) you say the knights. <br />
<br />
How could you say the knights when the measurment for tanking better earlier (dps taken) was used to determine what was better?<br />
<br />
Now on to the next point<br />
<br />
You say the monk is a poorer tank because of the average damage taken per hit. I totally agree.<br />
<br />
And if we compare the average hits of the war and paladin we do see your fabled 12%.<br />
<br />
But! here's the MAGICAL part. when we take the warriors average hit of 223.3 and ADD to it the amount his shielding took off (14damage per hit so we can add that straight to damage per hit average since DB is a constant) That fabled 12% advantage you claimed shrinks now to just a 8%ish advantage. want to then see about the AC impact?<br />
<br />
The SK with about 100 less ac then the knight took about 13more per average hit then the paladin, we could say that if the paladin had a 200ac more he'd have a slightly lower average per hit because of a higher ac, we'll say the result is only half though because of diminishing returns. so 13damage per hit less, <br />
<br />
So now, warrior average per hit is at 237.3 and the paladin is now at 242.1<br />
<br />
Now the mitigation difference is 5%. Guess what, your DEV STATMENT does back that up.<br />
<br />
Want to know the tanking edge the warrior has in this scenario (it's impossible to say I'm acurate that 200more ac would of taken 13 dps off per hit, but it's not a stretch to imagine) about 2% advantage in mitigation.<br />
<br />
Now since I'm just EXTRAPOLATING data, it's not a given without testing, but I trust in equal gear (read same ac, same shielding, same avoidance) you would find a 5% mitigation difference.<br />
<br />
This is a logical step based off of your data, which I haven't refuted but I factored in the AC and the mods into it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we've been over and over this. Why do you insist on bringing it up like it's a new thing?<br />
<br />
Warriors at the level are going to have the shielding and the AC advantage that the knights lack. This is reflected by REAL Magelos of REAL people in the game, so I'm not talking out of my ass. Therefore your subraction of AC and shielding like a paladin at that level is going to have the same gear as the warrior is false. There's a reason why BOTH Pal and SK have less of an AC than the warrior, that is through loot choices. There's a REASON why on EQRankings, there's a difference in AC between warriors and hybrids.<br />
<br />
Secondly. You then take the dev statement of 39-44% as if THAT's a new thing... we've been over THAT one. <br />
<br />
When you're talking about a relative comparison as +/- of 100%, you CANNOT go &quot;well, the difference is only 5%&quot; when you see a difference that's under 100%. You have to CONVERT it to get the proper RELATIVE comparison (IE of + or - 100% of a base number), you cannot just subtract it, or you're comparing two different things. And we're talking RELATIVE comparisons in the parse, not ABSOLUTE comparisons.<br />
<br />
You're taking the absoute number and attempting to compare it to a relative number... it cannot be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">um....  here's where you're off though.  Take all your parses of all levels of gear and i'll show you one constant (this is a guess btw) I'm going to guess the difference between CLASSES not gear but CLASSES is going to be about 5% more mitigation and a bit more avoidance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors at the level are going to have the shielding and the AC advantage that the knights lack.&quot;  but it's a different number for everyone, and possibly not there.  YOU were stating these were a inherent taning differences between classes.  The differences you state are between specific characters not specific classes.  The general number is going to be about 5%.<br />
<br />
your last point is off by a bit.  see devs want warriors to mitigate about 44% of damage, and knights to mitigate about 39%.  AKA they mitigate 5% more damage then knights.<br />
<br />
You cannot say because the number 39 and 44 turn out to be 12% difference that that's what the dev intent was.  <br />
<br />
Do you see the errors of saying it's a class difference as opposed to a character difference?  YOU cannot say that your parse acuratley shows gear differencers either when in the same parse you have clerics with shielding.  Why would a Cleric and a WArrior both have shielding but the paladin not?</div></div><hr />

You need to talk about gear, as well, or you pain a false pircute of realitiy.<br />
<br />
If you talked about JUST class, you'd see casters clsoe the gap due to buffs, and monks tanking better due to avoidance having a huge effect when naked comaprego to geared up.<br />
<br />
In aboslute terms, you're right in class only bonuses, but that's not the whole picture.</div></div><hr />

Add to that the warrior's 12.5% innate better tanking ability<br />
using a parse with unequal gear and shielding as evidence that such an INNATE advantage existed.<br />
<br />
When questioned about the unequal gear used in that parse, he argued that Paladins were forced to use gear that from a tanking perspective was inferior and repeated that Warriors had a 12.5% INNATE advantage. When shown PoTime gear indicated this point was untrue, he said PoTime gear didn't count and argued no one has proved a Warrior 12.5% INNATE advantage didn't exist.<br />
<br />
When finally a parse with near equal stats and gear proved any 12.5% advantage was NOT INNATE, he denied it did.<br />
<br />
Finally, he tries for a 2-Point Reversal and declares:<br />
....when you're tlaking about balacne, you can't JUST talk about what's innate to the class....<br />

<br />
Actually, no, I proved that it does exist by posting comparisons between real people at that level. Got any proof to show that Paladins really DO have the exact same gear at that level? I thought not. Therefore, you claims are just that - Claims, with no basis in fact, only in theory.<br />

Way to quibble. Fine, I'll drop the &quot;innate&quot; leaving it a &quot;12.5% warrior advantage.&quot; Take ANY post where I used it in that context and drop that word, totally invalidating your little attempt at ridicule by quibbling over the word.</div></div><hr />

Fine, I'll drop the &quot;innate&quot; leaving it a &quot;12.5% warrior advantage.&quot;<br />
Near perfect. But since I'm quibbling, lets' make that &quot;12.5% Warrior advantage in unequal gear with unequal stats.&quot;, shall we? Accuracy is everything.<br />
<br />
And since you've already stated you don't read PoN and were unaware that some Knights have asked for full Defensive, a varying amount of Defensive, or Defensive to be removed, your reply to my statement that:<br />
The Tank Parity (and Spell Book superiority) people see this as an opprotunity to reduce or eliminate a Warrior 3 minute tanking advantage that has existed for 4 years and is a Warrior class defining ability.<br />
(you do see the phrase &quot;reduce or eliminate&quot;, neh)<br />
I have to take issue with Battleblade's claims that Paladins want &quot;tanking parity&quot; (and spellbook superiority). That's flatly not true. NO Paladin has asked for a full defensive disc, and have not asked for ANY evasive disc, in any suggestion I've seen.<br />
<br />
ANY Paladin that has asked for defensive has asked for a PARTIAL defensive ability, of about 25-30% mitigation, and no evasive disc. Add to that the warrior's 12.5% innate better tanking ability, and that in NO WAY would acheive even close to parity between the warriors and hybrids. Course, those suggestions are moot anyway, because defensive (according to the devs, who have a track history of changing their minds, &lt;cough&gt;lvl70&lt;cough&gt;) won't be whored out to other classes like so many other warrior abilities have been.<br />
<br />
BB's claims that hybrids want tanking parity and spellbook superiority is just propaganda/rhetoric, with no basis in fact.<br />
seems to be quibbling with my assertion which, whoops is fundamentally correct.<br />
<br />
Some Paladins want not just the content adjusted so they can perform their traditional roles, but want as big a bite as possible of Defensive, or Defensive removed from the game (see SoleDragon's thread on PoN for Paladins wanting these things). And there appears to be no INNATE 12.5% Warrior tanking advantage when not using Defensive.<br />
<br />
Discussing the consequenses of Paladins receiving half or more of Defensive can be left for another thread. But with regard to your reply to what I stated, many of your comments lacked much basis in fact.<br />
<br />
Glad we had this quibble.<br />

Near perfect. But since I'm quibbling, lets' make that &quot;12.5% Warrior advantage in unequal gear with unequal stats.&quot;, shall we? Accuarcy is everything.<br />
Let's not, considering I've shown that the differences in stats relflects every day differences in game. Why do I get this sense of Deja Vu, like I've just said this... Right, because I just did, but you ignored it.<br />
<br />
 to be quibbling with my assertion which, whoops is fundamentally correct.<br />
No, it's NOT fundamentally correct, it's a fundamentally misleading statement.<br />
<br />
You're trying to take the statements of a FEW extremist Paladins, and somehow turn it into the WHOLE COMMUNITY wants that. It's just as incorrect to say that the Arabic world wants us dead, when in reality it's just a few extremists. That's called propaganda, and it's false.<br />
<br />
Many Paladins want not just the content adjusted so they can perform their traditional roles, but want as big a bite as possible of Defensive, or Defensive removed from the game. And there appears to be no INNATE 12.5% Warrior tanking advantage when not using Defensive.<br />
Whether it is innate or not is to all intents and purposes irrelevant and misleading. The fact is, warriors as a class, and as a rule, have a 12.5% (or so) tanking advantage over paladins at the same level of progression within the game. The fact that is EXISTS is relevant, the question of if it's INNATE or not, is not relevant. Why? Because when do you see *any* plate melee fighting without their gear and only using what innate advantages they have? The answer is never. <br />
<br />
Discussing the consequenses of Paladins receiving half or more of Defensive can be left for another thread. But with regard to your reply to what I stated, many of your comments lacked much basis in fact.<br />
The same can be said for you, although you specialize more in propaganda and rhetoric. See above.</div></div><hr />

citing among other things Brodda Thepp's parses (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5868) using a parse with unequal gear and shielding as evidence that such an INNATE advantage existed.<br />
<br />
When these discrepencies as well as another parse (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7414) with near equal stats and gear proved any 12.5% advantage was NOT INNATE, Daemonwynd conceeded:<br />
Way to quibble. Fine, I'll drop the &quot;innate&quot; leaving it a &quot;12.5% warrior advantage.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Well hehe, this is clearly true for the one parse where unequal equipment and sheielding made it so, but more accurately:<br />
<br />
With equal gear providing equal stats, equal tanking AA's, etc. the expected Warrior &quot;-1 DI&quot; advantage accounts for much of any differnce noted. The remaining difference is so small that it could be attributed to a relatively short sample.<br />
<br />
- Warriors do not have an innate 12.5% tanking advantage -<br />
<br />
Other than the &quot;-1 DI&quot; Warrior mitigation advantage, equipment alone determines how well a Paladin and a Warrior tank compared to each other when no discipline is in use.<br />
<br />
The only tanking advantages a Warrior has other than Disciplines are ~386HP innate Warrior advantage after AoTC, 500HP Sturdyness AA Ability, and the &quot;-1 DI&quot; mitgation advantage when not using Defensive.<br />
<br />
As Gyrfalcon Softwind posted on PoN but substituting more realistic numbers:<br />
<br />
Defensive 40% damage reduction over 3 minutes - Total 120%<br />
&quot;-1 DI&quot; 3% reduction over 7 minutes - Total 21%<br />
<br />
Grand Total 141% reduction over 10 minutes or 14.1% average reduction.<br />
<br />
It's perfectly clear -<br />
<br />
- Knights tank 85.9% as good as a Warrior even taking Defensive into account and have a Spellbook!! -<br />
<br />
This excludes DD, innate procs, etc. which we don't reduce and the affect of self-healing or stunning the mob.<br />
<br />
What Knights can not do is tank as well as a Warrior in those brutal battles where Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability, is a decisive factor.<br />
<br />
Defensive provides Warriors with unmatched survivability when Tanking the most brutal battles.<br />

Except that there's been another parse that's come out saying about the same thing.<br />

<br />
Actually, that's where you're wrong, yet again. The INNATE avoidance advantage that warriors have over hybrids accounts for much of the overall advantage that warriors have over hybrids in damage taken, as shown by the math I did to demonstrate earlier in the thread.<br />
<br />
The warrior also have the benefit for nearly all of the game of having a greater ability to specialize in tanking, without having to ignore the casting side to a greater or lesser extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Torinak,<br />
You ought to read the whole thread and other related threads. There are a number opinions expressed over on PoN ranging from:<br />
<br />
Give Knights Defensive<br />
Remove Defensive<br />
Who said only Wariors should be raid MT's? There should be 3 equal tanks.<br />
Close the gap and give Warirors DPS.<br />
Close the gap and give Warriors utility.<br />
<br />
Thus far I've read maybe 4 posts anywhere on PoN that have said (paraphrasing) Paladins and Warriors are distinctly different classes. One should not be overly concerned with how much better Warriors MT than our class - Paladins do not generally raid MT. Rather enjoy playing an extremely versatile class and be satisfied being able to plow tank, add tank, and ocassionally offtank harder mobs and even ocassionaly MT raid boss mobs designed especially to be vulnerable to our strengths.<br />
<br />
One view is focused entirely on Tank Parity (and spellbook superiority) and the other is focused on Paladins being able to excell at those roles they have traditionally excelled at in raids.<br />
<br />
IMO SoE sould have adjusted the Ikkinz trials if they haven't or at least two of them. Because with rare exceptions, Knights should be able to take on the vast majority of single group content a Warrior can do sucessfully.<br />
<br />
BUT IMO Knights aren't entitled to MT raid boss mobs and brutal splits until they become trivial. If they become trivial (and most of GoD's raid boss mobs are far from trivial atm), then they will in the natural course of events be able to do so as they acquire improved equipment from the new and more difficult expansion.<br />
<br />
But I'm not convinced that is what most PoN posters want. They want as much as possible the equivilent of the defining Warrior class ability that makes them MT's or to see that ability removed. They want to tank most of the hard hitting mobs that even Warriors are forced to use Defensive to succeed in tanking. We aren't talking add tanking here. We're taking hard hitting brutal mobs.<br />
<br />
Ya see, to them Raid MTing is a tank role and there are 3 tanks (sorry Rangers, they don't count you. They must tank head and shoulders above you. Tank Parity (and spellbok superiority) doesn't include you. You get Tank Inferiority (and spellbook inferority). Your Taunt button is an oversight.)....<br />

<br />
PoN is a board full of posters who are all &quot;poor us, we suck so bad&quot;. It's a VERY biased board.<br />
<br />
To get a true feeling of what most reasonable Paladins want, it's MUCH better to go to the EQLive Paladin board. It's why I do not visit PoN, and DO visit the EQLive hybrid boards. The views found there are MUCH more reasonable, and the administration is MUCH more fair and even handed.<br />
<br />
I think just about everyone with half a brain has discounted PoN from having any real impact in game balance, due to its extreme bias, both administrative and from posters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladins who make these gear decisions do so for a variety of different reasons:<br />
a) they want to have caster/healer focus<br />
b) they want to have DPS gear<br />
c) They just made stupid decisions and took crappy gear for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
In all of these cases, then they dont want to be the best tank they can be, and their complaints about not being able to tank well are moot.<br />
<br />
If a paladin wants to tank like a warrior, they should choose equipment like a warrior.  If he *doesnt* choose gear like a warrior and instead gets things like healing focii or improved accuracy or extra resists instead of AC, then he doesnt want to be a tank, and he doesn't have any right to complain about not tanking as well as a_warrior_01.<br />

Yeah I have to admit I don't understand this thread either.  My eyes got tired trying to figure it out.<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, Warriors have 5 percent innate DI drop, a 1 to 2 percent innate avoidance (due to higher parry/dodge/riposte etc) and at most 10 percent more HP.<br />
<br />
Is this thread an argument of how to add 10 + 2 + 5 to get 12.5 percent?<br />
<br />
Help a brother out, I am confused.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The inherent flaw in YOUR argument is that assumption that because they get focii, they don't want to be a tank. That's a truly ridiculous statement. What will you say next, casters get melee/HP/tanking mod gear because they don't want to be a caster?<br />
<br />
Going by your assumption, some Paladins want to be group healers/buffers instead of the tank for their group. After all, they don't want to be a tank, and healing/buffing is their only other role, so obviously they want to play group cleric instead! lol<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and think for a minute before you open your mouth and embarass yourself. The reason why paladins take focii as well as the best tanking gear, instead of just tanking gear alone, is because they don't want to ignore their casting side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamce</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understood Daabu's point to be that Paladins can chose multiple paths when they upgrade their gear. Some may chose to focus more on tanking then on casting, others will chose casting, and most will try to balance between the two.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone chose an alternative other than balance is beyond me, but they have that choice.<br />
<br />
For that matter, warriors who chose to take an offensive AA track will not tank (absorb damage) as well as a warriors that take a defensive AA track until they fill in the missing defensive AAs.  <br />
<br />
In regards to using Magelo profiles, only authentic profiles should be considered when comparing classes.  <br />

If I wanted to know what the difference between a warrior and a paladin really is at any level. I would make sure that they have the same exact AAs (when appropriate), skill levels, etc.; next I would remove all gear from them; and then see where the numbers fall.<br />
<br />
In the end, all classes have options available to them to accentuate one stat/skill over another.  It is the decisions the player makes with gear that determine how well the player will function in a particular role.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason to compare the difference between a raid tank and group tank that didn't focus solely on tanking.<br />
<br />
Paladins that focus on focii and non-tanking related gear should be drug out from thier homes and shot if they bitch about not bieng able to tank as well or that warriors with straight tanking mods tank better so they need compensated.  <br />
<br />
Saying paladins HAVE to choose the focus effects is a argument made to make your base claims seem valid (daemon) When in all actuallity paladin gear choices and warrior gear choices are not the different.<br />
<br />
Dae will refuse to see that 3 different sources have three different numbers.  he will change those or manipulate those in opposite directions until they come full circle to where he wants them and then say they back him.<br />

Daemon deserves nothing but outhouse threads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If paladins want to tank well...<br />
<br />
... they should pick the best tanking gear, like warriors do.<br />
<br />
If paladins dont want to ignore their casting side....<br />
<br />
.... they need to make sacrifices to their tanking side.<br />
<br />
If paladins make sacrifices to their tanking side....<br />
<br />
... that's their CHOICE ...<br />
<br />
... and they forfeit any right to complain about not tanking well enough.<br />
<br />
In other words, if they want to be comparable to a warrior, they should make gear decisions like one.  If they want to be a HYBRID and take both tank and hybrid choices...<br />
<br />
now listen to me carefully, cuz this part is very important...<br />
<br />
THEY CONTROL THE PERCENTAGE!<br />
<br />
Yes, that's right.  That paladin you keep citing CHOSE 12%.  Other paladins choose 5%.  Some choose 20%.  THATS THEIR CHOICE.  THEY CONTROL HOW WELL THEY CAN TANK.<br />
<br />
Any time a paladin whines about not being able to tank ikkinz, and I see him wearing a focus item instead of shielding or avoidance, I wanna bitch slap him.  If he wants to tank like a warrior, he picks the best tank gear he wants.  If he doesnt want to tank like a warrior (cuz warriors cant cast!), then he picks other options. Its up to him, and if you look at every one that complains about how sucky they tank, I bet buttons to dollars he's not equipped to be the best tank he can be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors suck at tanking, because I got all my offensive AAs and no defensive AAs...&quot;</div></div><hr />

And remember, it's not always either/or. For my (53) Paladin I'm after Mana Preservation and Improved Healing when tanking. The focus item for increasing the duration of buffs I can put on when buffing. That's it, that all. I'll be skipping FT in fact. When fighting a hard mob, FT does not to my mind generate enough mana to justify compromising the ability to tank.<br />
<br />
But at the highest levels of the game, big-time compromises really are not ncecessary unless for some reason you CHOOSE to be more of a caster and less of a tank.<br />
<br />
The same goes for buff slots. If I'm tanking, SD gets turned off so I can have Wrulan if I've run out of buffs slots. When the choise is tanking or casting, with my Paladin I'll choose tanking. I suspect this is why my main is a Warrior.<br />

<br />
Hybrids are NOT warriors.<br />
<br />
Just like beastlords are NOT monks, and are NOT shamans.<br />
<br />
Hybrids are a unique class, and they have looting priorities which reflect this uniqueness.<br />
<br />
Their choices in loot DO NOT mean that they cannot bitch about tanking as well as a warrior, it just means that they are a DIFFERENT CLASS, a class whose casting abilities COMPLEMENT their tanking and help out themselves and their group.<br />
<br />
To hear you say that paladins MUST gear up like a warrior or they have no right to bitch about how well they tank is fucking stupidity. They're a DIFFERENT CLASS. That's like saying the only time Beastlords have a right to bitch about casting versus shamans is if they gear up completely like shamans and ignore the other parts of their class.... or like saying the only way rangers have a right to bitch about their healing and buffing abilities compared to a druid is if they gear up like a druid first. It's arrogant, and narrowminded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you have to gear up like you're a wannabe warrior, or you have no right to bitch about how well you tank.&quot; Fuck that... I say you gear up however you feel you're getting the MOST out of YOUR class, and don't try and copy and make a wannabe other class, just so you can have some &quot;right&quot; to bitch about tanking.<br />
<br />
This is the way the dev's balance. They balance to what PEOPLE are going to do, they don't go &quot;well, they didn't do it the way WE feel it should be done, so they have no right to bitch&quot;. How judgemental is tha,t and how long do you think the game would have lasted if they balanced to what they felt people SHOULD do, not what they actually did?<br />
<br />
It's the same way here. The dev's aren't gonna balance to the choices THEY feel a Paladins should make, they're going to balance to the choice that paladins DO make... they're going to balance to having knights support both facets of their class, so that they can remain good tanks, but still improve their casting abilities as well. What supports this fact? Knightemization. GIVING states that support both the caster side and the melee side, because they KNOW knights need to support both facets of their class. The fact that knightemization has gone too far at the moment is a topic for another day.</div></div><hr />

In order to be able to cast spells, Knights give up some tanking ability.<br />
<br />
If they focus on tanking and make the fewest and best possible compromises, they will tank as good as possible.<br />

<br />
And if getting the MOST out of YOUR class involves tanking better, then choose better tanking gear.<br />
<br />
It's about sacrifice.  You want to do two things, you have to choose which you're going to work on.  When you play D&amp;D and want to dual class, you have to choose which class gets what experience -- dual classing doesnt just give you double the utility for the same work.<br />
<br />
In the real world, if you have TWO girlfriends, you have to choose when to spend time on each one, and who to spend the money on.  If you're going to spend most of your paycheck on the girlfriend who's great in the sack, you're not gonna have any money to spend on the girlfriend who you can have a lot of fun with on dates.<br />
<br />
IF YOU DONT LIKE WHERE YOU ARE, YOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE IT.  Not having as much fun on your dates?  Spend more money on girlfriend_b.  Want better sex?  Spend more on girlfriend_a.  You have a LIMITED source of income, and you need to pick how you want each to perform.<br />
<br />
What you're asking for is the ability to do more.  You want to keep your casting ability the same, while increasing your tanking ablity.  You're asking SOE for a raise, and you're doing it here on the fucking warrior boards like we give a damn.<br />
<br />
And the part that absolutely baffles me is that you claim to be a warrior.  WTF?  Why are you crusading for the paladins?  Why do you even give a damn?  You're not a saint, crusading to right the wrongs in this game, you're a troll.  <br />

Again, being narrowminded. For many knights, getting the most out of a HYBRID class involves tanking better AND casting better.<br />
<br />
IF YOU DONT LIKE WHERE YOU ARE, YOU HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE IT.  Not having as much fun on your dates?  Spend more money on girlfriend_b.  Want better sex?  Spend more on girlfriend_a.  You have a LIMITED source of income, and you need to pick how you want each to perform.<br />
<br />
Not really a valid comparison. That assumes an either/or choice. With knightemization that either/or choice is largely removed. Still there, but not as big.<br />
<br />
What you're asking for is the ability to do more.  You want to keep your casting ability the same, while increasing your tanking ablity.  You're asking SOE for a raise, and you're doing it here on the fucking warrior boards like we give a damn.<br />
<br />
Actually, that's not clear at all. Many paladins want better tanking ability with spells staying the same. Others want better casting ability with spells remaining the same.<br />
<br />
And your usage of &quot;you're&quot; is incorrect. You're stating that I as a paladin is asking for it. I'm neither a paladin, nor am I asking for it.<br />
<br />
And the part that absolutely baffles me is that you claim to be a warrior.  WTF?  Why are you crusading for the paladins?  Why do you even give a damn?  You're not a saint, crusading to right the wrongs in this game, you're a troll.<br />
I'm not crusading for anything for an increase to anything of Paladins, that's only your perception. I'm simply stating the tanking differences between the two.<br />
Even the removal of defensive is to remove an IMO overpowered ability with rebalancing, not to increase paladins.<br />
<br />
Why are you trolling our boards, Daemonwynd?<br />
I could ask you the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont understand what the point of everything he's saying is.  I asked why he's trolling because he spent 20 pages arguing why defensive should be removed from the game, when every single warrior on the board disagreed with him.  He resorted to personal attacks and the &quot;ad-hominem&quot; crutch to avoid answering entire posts.  I asked him why he's generalizing two classes based on two individuals within the class (and somehow, I have never seen him argue the fallacy of composition accusation.<br />
<br />
Fallacy of Composition: if A, then B != if B, then A.  If a man is gay, he wears a pink shirt.  Tha man is wearing a pink shirt, therefore he must be gay.  Since it is not an If-and-only-if statement, this is incorrect.<br />
<br />
If warriors are 12.5% better than paladins, then a parse will show every warrior tanking 12.5% better than an equal paladin.  That warrior parsed better than that paladin, therefore warriors are 12.5% better than paladins.<br />
<br />
He very well may be right; but we all know that one piece of evidence is not enough to make claims like this.  One parse on the procrate of my bloodfrenzy does not generalize the procrate of every weapon, just my bloodfrenzy.  One parse between a warrior and a paladin with (VERY ARGUABLY) equivalant gear does not substantiate his proof.<br />
<br />
He then goes on to link other sources to help back his claim, one of which does the exact opposite (see the last link, where the warrior was only something like 8% better).  I'm sure I could find a warrior and a paladin in the same guild where the warrior tanks 25% better.<br />
<br />
It is not possible to say that a warrior tanks X% better than a paladin due to &quot;REAL CHOICES by REAL KNIGHTS&quot;, because every knight makes different choices, and every warrior makes different choices.  Until you poll a substantial number of knights to see their stats at every level of the game and create a good mathematical model to reflect it, you have no basis to make any assertions, save that of your OWN OPINION.<br />

It's not that simple, and it's not an across the board claim. Obviously, it changes as per gear, progression, AC differences, ETC, but 12.5% is a good AVERAGE number. I thought I've made that EXTREMELY clear by now. Obviously I was mistaken.<br />

Warrior that's real has 22 shielding and 15 avoidance.<br />

you parse those two together I bet you'll see about 10% difference.  Less if it's on mobs that don't care about ac above 1500<br />

Again, you're taking your numbers from the wrong level. That level is the farmed the crap out of time level, where the difference drops quite significantly. That's not the level that either A: the parse is at, and B: reflective of differences for the majority.<br />

That might be because if you're going to say partial time gear (warrior getting the best pieces) and paladins none and say it represents 99% of the population is the most asinine suggestion and thought I've seen on the boards in a long time.<br />
<br />
do a /who all war 1 <br />
and do this for all levels 1-65<br />
then tell me what percentage has even one time drop...<br />
<br />
But you're saying this is representitive of the advantage warriors have across the board over paladins! so a time farmed war should have that advantage over a time farmed paladin right?<br />
<br />
But your'e wrong so you HAVE to say I'm wrong even if it's based off less substance then a fart in the wind.<br />
<br />
a) you've provided no basis for a generalization like you have done.<br />
b) when generalizations don't fit you either force the numbers like some kid forcing a square peg into a round peg hole or say it's not accurate. <br />
c) you have provided three different references (one only pm'd to me for some reason and not posted) and all three DO NOT MATCH why is that? I'll tell you why because none of them are based off of the same things.<br />
<br />
You say a warrior mitigates 12.5% because 39/44 = 12.5<br />
you say because a warrior takes 12.5% less dps then a paladin that = 12.5<br />
you say a second parse done proves you right when it shows it at about 8-9% a huge drop from 12.5.  Since you like numbers the second parse droped by about 33%<br />
<br />
The only constant with those three things?  it's not the warrior tanking advantage if that's what you're trying to say.  it's a 5% more mitgation from damage taken then the knight class.<br />
<br />
You want to say something?  say warriors mitigate about damage 5% higher then knights.  You have three independent references for that.  Matter of a fact I bet if you found 4 more parses they'd show a similiar number.<br />
<br />
But a number that won't match in any of those on a consistant basis or close?  if you said warrior tanking advantage you'd be right.<br />
<br />
If you can't see your problems after this there is no hopes for you and I will no longer post considering your retarded statments.</div></div><hr />

Thank you. Thank you very much... you've just shown beyond a doubt that you just have a clue or understand comparisons or class balance. I might as well just say that the difference between apples and oranges is the fact that the orange has a peel, and the apple has a skin. While that is technically correct, it is also wrong... because THAT'S NOT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE. There are many others.... An orange also doesn't have a core, while an apple does. Similarly, warriors have an avoidance advantage over paladins, warriors typically have an AC and tanking mod advantage over paladins, etc etc. It's not JUST the mitigation difference, much as you try to posture and spout that that's all it is.<br />
<br />

As I belive I already stated to you though, in regards to the AC difference found between warriors and hybrids.. it's in another thread somewhere. I believe I found the average AC difference to be somewhere between 150-200.<br />

EqRankings is great for seeing a broad cross section. So is Magelo. Those are two tools that I used. Next. (emphasis mine)<br />
Don't have one, nor is one necessarily needed.<br />
<br />
A simple average of the class difference in guilds is sufficient.<br />

It compared things at the highest end content...a comparision you said was completely pointless as they are in the top 0.1% of the population (and also at a point where warriors are focusing more on AC augs than paladins are).  So why dont you try again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, easy enough. <br />
<br />
5 warriors in my guild, and 5 paladins:<br />
<br />
Warrior avg AC: 1756<br />
Paladin avg AC: 1627<br />
<br />
See? It doesn't matter where I go, there's still the advantage there. Some places higher than others, buton average, probably 150-200 on average. With so many places that show the advantage, anything where I actually DON'T find an advantage is an aberration, just like the aberattions I could find where the warriors have 300AC or more on the pallies.<br />
<br />
And yeah, /nods to the hybrid self buffs that drop the difference some.<br />
<br />
Hell, other guilds on my server average around the same amountof advantage AC wise, if I remember correctly. If you don't want to believe it, go right ahead... I'm not going to bother to show someone whose only action is going to try and question it and pick it apart. If ya got an open mind, sure, let me know, and we can explore it together. If not, well... kindly stop wasting my time/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to the land of college.  Everything you write that is &quot;new&quot; is going to be picked apart by your peers<br />
<br />
My guild: 2 paladins, 3 warriors with their magelos linked<br />
Avg Paladin: 1713<br />
Avg Warrior: 1595<br />
<br />
One of the paladins has 6 pieces of slot-8 gear, and the other is in EP gear<br />
One of the warriors has 2 pieces of slot-8 gear, and the other two are in a hodgepodge of EP and pre-Elemental<br />
<br />
These must be taken into consideration.  If you have 5 warriors who all raid every day, and 5 paladins who average to log in twice a week, there's going to be a disparity.<br />
<br />
Still, though, I'd like to know where the 12.5% average came from.  Because now your defending something that doesn't have anything to do with the argument I made: that you can claim a 7% difference due to mitigation and avoidance, but you cant claim a distinct gear advantage without some actual calculations.  I don't see the bridge between &quot;Average EP-geared war/pal difference&quot; and &quot;percent dps advantage between two classes&quot;.<br />
<br />
You claimed your disappointment in our not agreeing with you, and I'm claiming the desire to see raw evidence before you can so easily pick a number out.</div></div><hr />

No, an average will NOT do in this situation.  If you have a greater percentage of your guild as active warriors than as active paladins, then an average will NOT suffice.<br />
<br />
Okay, assume this:<br />
Two warriors are in a guild.  Both are very active, and have gotten 10 time drops (one every time they went).<br />
Both warriors have 2000 unbuffed AC.<br />
<br />
Now there are 3 paladins in a guild.  One is very active, with 10 time drops, and has 1900ac.<br />
One is sorta active, has gotten 8 time drops, and has 1770ac.<br />
One only shows up on occasion, and has gotten 3 time drops.  1600ac.<br />
<br />
Please tell me how the average tells me anything about my warriors and paladins.<br />
If anything, that survey will say that warriors are more active raiders than paladins.<br />

I find it very interesting that you pick apart a parse that I've made, saying that it doesn't actually contain a 12.5% advantage, and then when it suits your purpose, turn 180 degrees and all of a sudden claim that it DOES contain a 12.5% average.

<br />
No I'm biased agains complete retards that can understand anything laid out in simple terms.   I have never once said or agree'd there was a 12.5% advantage between warriors and paladins.  If you think that you're really REALLY living in your own world.<br />
<br />
The man you were pointing out was pointing to conjecture and nothing based on reality was pointing out that comparing gear levels with people in a guild is not accurate specially if you don't factor in attendance.  Those who attend more then others tend to get better gear faster thus increasing a gap.  If you have a guild where paladins raid more then warriors the warriors will end up being behind in gear to the paladins (unless you're a guild that only farms stuff out until everyone has everything and THEN move on but most do not)<br />

<br />
Now.  As to what I've said without proof?  Let me play a little recap<br />
<br />
I'll start with the first post of this thread.<br />
<br />
You refuse to recant on your prior stance that warriors maintain a 12% tanking edge over knights when there IS nothing to support that. If you believe we are wrong in this break down the numbers, explain WHY a war has a 12% edge in tanking but a monk does not have a 3% edge.<br />
<br />
The reply to this?<br />
<br />
Some nebulous crap about relative and absolute numbers hrmmm  mob dsp on 45minute parses is apparently too random to then say x class mitigated y% of the damage delt?  no it wasn't but you wanted to say it was?  no you wanted to say that wasn't a good way to do it because although the more accurate way of demonstrating the differences and SHOWING a actual difference you wanted to use large 2 digit numbers when a smaller more acurate number would of been better.<br />
<br />
Now.<br />
Whether it is innate or not is to all intents and purposes irrelevant and misleading. The fact is, warriors as a class, and as a rule, have a 12.5% (or so) tanking advantage over paladins at the same level of progression within the game. (you saying that by the way)<br />
<br />
Now fastforward to much later.<br />
<br />
Again, you're taking your numbers from the wrong level. That level is the farmed the crap out of time level, where the difference drops quite significantly. That's not the level that either A: the parse is at, and B: reflective of differences for the majority. <br />
<br />
I took the two top dogs on my server, in the same guild at the same levels of farming (unlike the thepp parse they haven't had a warrior get x drop before anyone else they had both classes with all the drops availble.)  In the fact that they are both in a sense MAX for thier class those two would show the difference in the classes more accuratley, but those numbers won't suit you.....<br />
<br />
now.<br />
<br />
Actually, that's where you're wrong, yet again. The INNATE avoidance advantage that warriors have over hybrids accounts for much of the overall advantage that warriors have over hybrids in damage taken, as shown by the math I did to demonstrate earlier in the thread. <br />
<br />
Hrmm let's look at the thepp parse.<br />
Warrior Dodge 4.2%  Parry  5.9%  Riposte 5.3%<br />
Paladin Dodge 4.1%  Parry 5.5%   Riposte 4.7%<br />
<br />
So... the overall advantage then is because of a 1.1% advantage in d/p/r....<br />
Now we factor in the warrior advantage of -1di of say...  let me see DB of mob was 102 (taking out shielding since that's a gear advantage) and with DI of 22.1 which would make the MAX % of dps saved per hit to (DB + (di(22.1) * 20)/ (DB + (di(22.1)*19)  in other words -di saves at a max 4.1% of the damage.<br />
Now lets go for the AC difference in mitigation?<br />
hrmm about 200ac difference in the paladin to the warrior and about 200 from pal to sk, the sk and pal mitigation difference was about 10dmg per hit... sooo just guessing that the warrior has almost same advantage so...  his superior ac (which most warriors have) would net about a 4.1% advantage at max (we know diminshed returns of higher ac so probably alot less.)<br />
<br />
<br />
So we can say safely based on your conclusions and your flawed math that 1.1% advantage in d/r/p + a MAX of 4.1% advantage per hit from -1di and a MAX of 4.1% 9.3%?<br />
<br />
Again a MUCH different picture then you would like to paint otherwise.<br />
<br />
This is all a reasonable calculations off of thepps parse.<br />
<br />
You see I factored in shielding but left the superior AC in there, my statment is actually closer to a accurate warriors tank z% better then paladins then yours where you just rip'd the numbers and divided (from DPS which if you compare only that a MONK tanks better so you can't)<br />
<br />
BUT you then say there is more then DPS to factor (so we have to ignore your 12.5% remark because that's what it's based off)<br />
<br />
But you can't do that because it's a different number.  No you're right I didn't link other information because yours was enough.<br />
<br />
Now as to more wrong comments by you?<br />
The only constant with those three things? it's not the warrior tanking advantage if that's what you're trying to say. it's a 5% more mitgation from damage taken then the knight class.  <br />
<br />
(my qoute above)<br />
Your reply?<br />
Wrong. Man, it's funny to see how you just don't get it. I'm past the point of bothering trying to exdplain why you're wrong too. <br />
<br />
Now to show you why I'm right?<br />
First Thepps parse again (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5868) <br />
Take mitigated dmg of warrior? 71.1<br />
Take mitigated dmg of paladin? 68.8<br />
the difference is the warrior mitigated about 4% of the damage more then the paladin.<br />
Now the other sorce?<br />
<br />
Your dev statment you PM'd me as opposed to linking<br />
As a point of reference PC mitigation abilities look about like this for <br />
average gear: <br />
<br />
War: 44% <br />
Pal: 39% <br />
SK: 39%<br />
<br />
So in this case the warrior mitigates about 5% more of the damage then a knight does.<br />
<br />
Now for my third reference<br />
Sad fate of bieng a valorium guard (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7414) <br />
<br />
Warrior damage per hit 230<br />
Paladin damage per hit 241<br />
<br />
Now I know I don't have a %T of dmg mitigated number to compare so we'll say if they were max hits?<br />
the dps difference between that and what they take is mitigated dmg right? (probably right)<br />
Max possible damage per hit is 526<br />
so war mitigated 56.3% and the paladin 54.2%<br />
so the mitigation %  difference is a astonishing 2.1%?<br />
<br />
hrmm well I guess I was wrong about the 5% it's in fact much less then that at times. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usage of the word is various. In some usage, a troll is a communication such as a usenet post, and a troller is the author of such communication. In media where communication isn't discrete, a troll is the creator of such communication. <br />
<br />
A troll is deliberately crafted to provoke others with the intention of wasting their time and energy. A troll is a time thief. To troll is to steal from people. That is what makes trolling heinous. <br />
<br />
Trolls can be identified by their disengagement from a conversation or argument. They do not believe what they say, but merely say it for effect. <br />
<br />
Trolls are motivated by a desire for attention by people and can't or won't acquire it in a productive manner. <br />
<br />
Someone may be insufferable, infuriating, fanatical, and an ignorant idiot to boot without being a troll. <br />
<br />
Also note that a troll isn't necessarily insulting, snide, or even impolite. Only the crudest, most obvious, forms of trolling can be identified so easily. <br />
<br />
If you find yourself patiently explaining, at length and in great detail, some obscure point to someone who isn't even being polite to you, then you are probably being trolled. <br />
<br />
I didn't bother to read entirely your post. I skimmed through it, and I saw how you still are making assumptions like mitigation is the only thing that matters, which if you actually WERE something other than just trolling you would understand, because I've explained it to you about 5 or six fucking times now, that MITIGATION IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS, DUMBASS. Am I going to boether correcting you? No. It's an utter waste of time to try and correct a troll. Not only that, it's full of assumptions, and no solid math anywhere in this &quot;rppf that you've proved me wrong&quot;.<br />
<br />
Are you wasting my time and time and energy? CHECK. Proof? How every single time I reply, you reply with yet more BS for me to respond to.<br />
<br />
Are you disengaged from the argument? Do you not believe what you say?CHECK. Proof? You'll go back and forth from claims that one parse doesn't prove a 12.5% advantage, then say, oh yes it does, then in another post you'll say it doesn't all over again, if it's convenient.<br />
<br />
Are your arguments non-productive? CHECK. You provide nothing positive nad zero proof yourself. You aren't looking for any positive attention by showing anything positive yourself to prove that things might be any different, you only do the negative attention by attacking anything I say.<br />
<br />
Have I been forced to explain why this advantages exists in geat length and in great detail to you, when you weren't even being polite to me? CHECK. Proof? HOW long have these stupid threads become? HOW many times have I been content to leave it be as is, but come back to reading the boards and there's yet ANOTHER post attacking me or my viewpoints? Exactly.<br />
<br />
Take the fucking hint. Go troll someone else. I'm done feeding you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, your own source explains how labelling me a troll is a mislabel:<br />
<br />
It should be noted that there is no official definition of &quot;troll&quot;, and that the term is almost always applied as an insult; for example, an individual posting honestly-held opinions that are considered controversial by the majority is often labeled as a troll. A troll's primary incentive is said to be the incitement of hot words, paranoia and bad feelings. See the section on &quot;Usage&quot;, below. <br />
<br />
The term is frequently misused to discredit an opposing position in an argument. This usually amounts to an undefensible ad hominem argument: many views that have met with opposition and even the ridicule of experts have subsequently been found to be justified, so the label &quot;troll&quot; used this way is actually likely to indicate a correct but controversial position that is stirring up flames precisely because it has challenged a doctrine others actually realize is wrong. (It is quite possible to stir up controversy with a wrong argument, but these can more effectively be met by simply responding to the substantive issue.) <br />
<br />
Yep. They're honestly held opinions. Yep, they're considered controversial by the majority. Oh look, I'm &quot;labelled&quot; a troll without actually being one.<br />
<br />
And who started with the ad homenim attacks? Oh right, you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have NEVER EVER ONCE said that a warrior has a 12.5% advantage over a paladin.  Your proof? no where CHECK<br />
AD Hominem attack in every post almost, CHECK.<br />
<br />
My arguments have brought nothing but facts and rebuttal to the table.  TO say I'm a troll means nothing from you You're so frustratingly dense it's not funny.  <br />
<br />
You have not gone to great lengths, you've done mediocre math that when held up to scrutiny by anyone and EVERYONE no one agree's with your result.  <br />
<br />
I HAVE patiently explained to great lengths why your &quot;hard proof&quot; is about as hard as jello, others have too.  What is your replies?  nothing but ad hominem attacks and nothing to refute what was said.  <br />
<br />
Trolling is not limited to a single person and in a normal usage of the term (ie most the net) it refers to someone that will go to a forum and post material or threads with the sole intent to incite or create conflict.  The only one here that has fitted that discreption has been you to be frank or do I have to remind you of your &quot;remove defensive thread&quot; and other bull shit like 12.5% that's not substantiated anywhere EXCEPT in two unrelated areas DPS taken and Mitigation of a mythical set up in a hardly credible but not deniable &quot;dev statement&quot; <br />
<br />
You provide 4 points of reference, one of DPS taken to say the 12.5% exists, then one of dev statment on mitigation (different then DPS taken and different then tanking) so one of those statments (DPS chiefly since you said that can't caculate tanking ability which is the stem of the debate) so it comes to mitigation and ALL THREE PARSES show different mitigation rates and differences in that.<br />
<br />
YOU ARE WRONG YOU ARE STUPID.<br />
<br />
I know it's a simple word, but yes you are stupid.  <br />
<br />
Your great lengths to explain it has consisted of &quot;you have no proof I do so nah!&quot; and other equally useless qoutes.<br />
<br />
You said the sky is blue.<br />
I said the sky is colorless but it allows the most blue light so what you see is blue light coming through the most giving the appearance of it bieng blue.<br />
<br />
your reply?<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
something along the lines of &quot;see I told you he'lll disagree with anything I say!&quot;<br />
<br />
But the problem is not in the disagreements, but that you can't see when you're wrong.<br />
You will say the sky is blue when it's scientific that's colorless and merely allows the blue light in the most so we percieve it as blue.<br />
<br />
You see numbers and immediatly assume they mean 12.5% when in fact they don't.  You're not factoring in REAL information and differences.  The differences you brush away as &quot;real game choices&quot; when they are anything but.<br />
<br />
The sky appears to be blue but it is not blue is what I said<br />
you said the sky is blue.  <br />
<br />
There is a huge difference.  It's the same with your 12.% difference and me saying there's a distince mitigation difference but not a distinct 12.% war adavantage.  Don't doubt there is but to say 12.5%+ is based on nothing.<br />
<br />
If you are so tired of wasting your energy on stupid posts that say nothing but whaaa pumilio doesn't like me and says I'm wrong fine go on whining about it, otherwise prove where I AM WRONG.  But you can't so it's ad hominem for you because you can't hold a real debate with real information much like on every god damn thread you've created here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Add to that the warrior's 12.5% innate better tanking ability, and that in NO WAY would acheive even close to parity between the warriors and hybrids&quot;<br />
<br />
You said that.  You're wrong refuse to admit it and the person that's taken the time to explain how and why you treat like some 3rd grader saying shut up ever three seconds insteed of talking like a adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, your own source explains how labelling me a troll is a mislabel:&quot;<br />
I didn't label you a troll actually.  If you're so hypersensitive to it that you will assume others think you one, you might be one.  I have no doubt of that.<br />
<br />
I may have started saying you were talking out of your ass why?  because you had nothing listed or stated to base your 12.5% advantage.  There is no banner on TSW that says welcome warriors you tank 12.5% better then paladins!  The reason why there isn't a banner saying that? because that advantage a) does not exist and b) is not concrete.</div></div><hr />

Keep diggin, Sir Troll. The more you post, and especially the CONTENT of your posts, shows how you are just trolling.<br />
<br />
(And yes, I know, this post could be feeding the troll even more. bleh)<br />
<br />
Are you now going to post another reply with the intent of provoking a response and wasting my time, Sir Troll? You know, doing something that fits the VERY DEFINIOTN of trolling?<br />

Funny thing is, every time you do it, you prove yourself as trolling even more. The only way to stop it, is to STOP REPLYING to everything I say.<br />

<br />
Actually, that post count has been since this baord has been active, not just from the past few month, and previous to which I had a few hundred on the old board.<br />
<br />
Nice try, troll.<br />
<br />
As for me being a troll, I'd be happier if certain people just shut the hell up and leave me alone, which is a direct opposite to which a troll wants, which is to have people waste their time responding. Therefore by DEFINITION, I am NOT a troll.<br />
<br />
So if I hadn't made myself clear yet... please... STFU and let this thread die, and stop fucking trolling me.</div></div><hr />
