<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has lately been discussing trying to put a greater focus on Ssra keying and moving into VT once we kill Emp.<br />
<br />
Currently we are taking out the BoT Tower bosses and PoTactics named (not any Zeks though) with very little trouble with 3-5 groups depending on who's on.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure VT is a wise step for us, due to the horror stories I've heard about it, and I kinda think just going to NToV and staying focused on our current targets would be easier for us with a faster reward for some loot that is still pretty damn good and an upgrade for alot of us.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">doing VT adds more possiblilities for loot that will help the guild advance and if your a raiding guild then its got one of the best loot per hr ratios there is.<br />
<br />
the keying is the part that can make or break guilds though as some will not be able to get parts as fast as the others.  if you can make it past that stage then your golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone asks this about every month. Most people think it's worth it, possibly just because they had to though. The loot's great, better than EP loot in some cases. It has lots of strong focus effects, and haste/vengence in hard to upgrade locations.<br />
<br />
 If you're killing tier 3 minis, then Emp would be some very nice loot for ya, and probably quite a few people would actually wear their emp ring. The rest of the VT key isn't too bad if your whole guild is doing it at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Two things to ask yourself:<br />
<br />
1. How crowded is VT on your server? If there are lots of guilds hitting it, then you may not see it much...unless you can beat them there. <br />
<br />
2. How committed is your guild? Are people willing to put a month aside to farm keys/banes/shards? You will need the whole guild to do it obviously, so if you only have a handful of people willing to put forth the effort, you might not get good results. <br />
<br />
VT is definately a great place to get lots of high quality upgrades in a short amount of time though, so its well worth it if your guild is willing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your guild makes VT keys a priority ... and is able to get to the content once it is fully keyed and ready to clear ... then YES, it's worth it.<br />
<br />
The volume of loot will gear up even a large guild rather quickly.<br />
<br />
I am biased however. Click on my monk's magelo and you'll notice that VT has been very very good to me. So keep that in mind when I say yes, it's worth it.<br />
<br />
However, prior to Elemental Planes it was the easiest, highest quality loot my guild was getting. And it is still competitive at this point for much of the guild (I belong to a big guild so EP farming's gonna be awhile before lower attendance peeps get some of those upgrades).</div></div><hr />
