<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for having two to six members. <br />
<br />
As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 80% bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before being distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the experience gain to be divided by 6. <br />

<br />
One issue we have is the amount of slots available in any one group, and right now due to ease and lazyness people choose Pallys due to tankability, aggro generation, heals so on.. with the advent of the raid feature they cut xp over 6 members, why not add xp, I saw it mentioned on the Wizzy board some people want to raid all the time some dont but they want to get XP.<br />
<br />
How about a fix for more than 6 member groups, as stated above 2 - 5 goes from 20 - 80% bunus, why not add 10% per member above 6 divided by said members, so a 9 person grp/raid = 110% bonus divided by 9, dropping to 5% after 18 members, this would open up more slots in groups, would eleviate the &quot;perfect group&quot; makeup issue, would allow raiders to raid for viable xp, and would allow a Warrior the ability to get MT position without cutting a Pally out of a xp spot, which would then allow any class changes that NEED to be addressed with Warrior's and other melee classes to be fixed without cutting any other classes group slots. <br />
<br />
Where anywhere was it said that any group of adventures &quot;HAS&quot; to be 6 people or less? long ago in the day maybe this was possible in EQ, but with now adding new classes (13 now) and pawning so many more people into this game, the lines of classes balances have been blurred to obscurity, the perfect group is nearly never a possiblity, how many times have you zoned into a zone only to find the zone filled with groups divisable by 6 ie 25, 31,37 including you.. you know your screwed,or sending a tell to a friend asking what they're doing only to find out thier group just filled, or having a group and having 2 friends looking for xp but only having one spot (and knowing the raid feature is a negative XP factor) this one change would alleviate that issue, you could then choose to stay a 6 group or go raid without a hit to XP, actually it would offer better XP.<br />
<br />
Think of a group of 11 people clearing an area, with 2 tanks in one group ones a War ones a Knight, puller brings mob, Knight gets it holds it, its slowed gimped crippled, while Warrior finishes last mob with group, grabs aggro of new mob, puller is out getting another, repeat scenerio 1 again, rinse repeat talk about chain pull !! <br />
I am so tired of one class hating another because SoE has put constraints on groups thats what this whole imbalance is about only so many spots and more people than spots, most classes have varities of ways to play yet each one gets pigeon holed into playing one way because of group makeup, and causing other classes to be stiffed, this alone could resolve alot of group issues. Of course a 12 man raid could have 2 Pallys instead of 1 war one Pal but the tanking of the War would step up and releave mana usage if the Pal could do what he does best babysits the mob until the tank took over) think about it. Better buffs since you could have more classes per group, better everything basically mini raids with group+XP and classes could then do what thier classes were ment to do without infringing on others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At present, in a raid setup, even though the entire raid gets experience, there is a 50% xp penalty to overcome from raid setup. If SOE would just remove this penalty, and apply no bonuses, I can see more small raid setups for XP happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So you want more spots in a group, so that if a warrior is lfg... he could be invited out of pity, since there is room?...<br />
<br />
sorry but no...<br />
<br />
I want to be invited for what I do... not because there's room.</div></div><hr />
