<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Below is the list of weapons I have.  However, tactics I do know but my skills in weapon choices are lacking.  So I am asking my fellow brothers for assistance in this matter.<br />
<br />
What I am after is this.  Based on the weapons I have which would be the best to use to keep agro and the best to put anger augments in?<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help you can give me in this matter as I am stumped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GBoS and the Obsidian Scimmy are the 2 best aggro weapons you've got listed. I don't own a GBoS, so I'm not positive which weapon to mainhand, but I think they are both fairly similar for aggro purposes. Mobs hate both stuns and  ac debuffs quite a bit, so anger-auging either of these, or both, would be a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would almost have to say go with the Great Blade of Storms and the Blade of Strategy. The Blade of Strategy has a nice 500 hate hate proc on it plus a 100 dd. The hate proc is only 200 less hate then enraging blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would do GBoS and Bonechiller =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The question was which setup would be best for aggro. Bonechiller has a straight dd proc, which sucks for aggro. The epic is terribble dps, and while the proc is good, it really isn't much (if any) better than GBoS or the scimmy.<br />
<br />
Stun+DD procs have been parced to around 500 aggro iirc, and the scimmy is nearly that much as well. 14/18 and 15/19 destroy the 14/24 epic, it's not even close. Either go GBoS/OSoW or OSoW/GBoS. Bank the epics, and keep bonechiller for dps if you dont have a good 2hander for when you're not tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bugthurn1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">go with the GBoS/OSoW, that is what I use and aggro is pretty much a non-issue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the great responses everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blade of Tactics i mainhand with a heat blade proc and Bonechiller in offhand with Mirror III proc...best aggro evar!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GBoS/OSoW imo...anger 3 aug the two of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">GBoS/OSoW is probably the best overall combo a warrior can get out of PoP before elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The OSoW and GBoS have a Slot 1, type 4 augment spot in it does this mean I have to do Guk to augment these items or will EF work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do Everfrost adventures. Thats the standard 'proc' slot name, for all weapons other than Time level and above.<br />
<br />
Anger 2 is 400 pure hate, 510 points in EF<br />
Anger 3 is 600 pure hate, 1150 points in EF<br />
<br />
It's *very* tempting to get anger 2, since it's less than half the price of anger 3. However I personally recommend saving up for anger 3, if that is a combo you see yourself keeping for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">IMO, put Anger III on GBoS and do nothing to OSoW and offhand it.  If after a week you find yourself lacking aggro, Anger III the OSoW but I would give it an honest test first as I don't think it will be necessary.<br />
<br />
What this will give you is a good aggro combo, GBoS/OSoW and a good DPS set up Bonechiller/OSoW.<br />
