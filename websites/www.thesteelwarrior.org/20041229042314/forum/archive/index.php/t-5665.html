<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, our guild was in PoTime tier 3 today, clearing, and I notice something really strange. I've had bad luck with taunt before, but I never saw anything like this. I had a streak of 60+ failed taunts. In fact,  I don't seem to recall a single successful taunt the entire time I was in tier 3. It was weird, since tier 1 was working fine, and everything else was more or less ok. I sent tells to some other warriors on the raid, they said they were having the exact same problem.<br />
<br />
So, do you think this is a bug, or is tier 3 just naturally impossible to taunt in?</div></div><hr />

In general that tier is just a bitch, though. But not because of the fails, but because everyone is trying to play aggro jockey.</div></div><hr />

Knight_02 tells knightchannel: &quot;OMG this is teh pwn,I been doing it all night.our warriors will all be fired soon , obviously we dont need them since we have been tanking stuff anyway muhahaha&quot;</div></div><hr />

Even if taunt is successful the mob may or may not attack you due to being in the middle of a cast, not to mention slide around a lot...which I hate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">must be a bug on my server then. I sent in feedback, which will of course be cordially ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure you're getting 100% fail rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I dont recall the level of the mobs in question, but assume alot of them are 66+, so naturally more difficult to taunt than blue or even cons.<br />
<br />
Also I am pretty sure I read on the monk board something about SOE having the ability to individually set FD failure rates on a pr zone basis, and that it was set high for PoTime. Now if they can do that, I would imagine that they might have the ability to change taunt as well. Or maybe taunt+FD use the same &quot;failure rate&quot; zone setting.<br />
<br />
Or.. maybe the RNG just struck again :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread is silly. And feedbacking it, then complaining about lack of servic, is just as.<br />
<br />
Come on. . .  I'm quite damn sure that there isn't some ridiculous bug that's only subject to your server in regards to taunt in a particular phase of Plane of Time. . .<br />
<br />
The phase is like that. The mobs are all red con (Read: Above your level, much, much, lower chance to succesfully taunt) and the fact that there is 100 or so of them, with everyone trying to nail them dead asap, and Warrior agro being unreliably dependant due to procs, is the problem at hand here.<br />
<br />
There is no bug. I promise you this.</div></div><hr />

Most of the time I can taunt ok, getting agro is a bitch tho with an entire raid of people debuffing, etc.</div></div><hr />
