<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what ive read on the boards, and not personal experiance, it goes BF &gt; HG &gt; BoC. You shouldve just searched, as there are already ~4 threads on this topic :rolleyes:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hereward</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did research it. I know BF&gt;HG&gt;BOC. But that is also due to better ratios. In those threads some people said HG procced the same as BoC, some said better, just trying to get a concensus.  I'm also looking for people with personal experiences not what they read, Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">would you take a hg over boc? its a hp lose but 1 less dly... dosnt seem really worth it to me, but depents on conditions if its a dkp looting system would it really be worth yer while?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hereward</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm just asking about proc rate, sorry if I didn't make that clear. Which procs more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It has 25 more raw ac, better ratio (but only by a bit), minor hp loss and supposed higher proc rate.. Doesn't look like a newb lammy either :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cm66</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a BOC and a Hategiver, from my own personal experiance, it seems that the Hategiver has a higher proc rate. And Yes I would use a hategiver over a BOC if i had to pick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a HG and it procs more often than the BoC I used to borrow.  I usually get 4+ procs in a 2 minute fight with maxed dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wouldn't 4+ procs in a 2 minute fight be right around the 2 proc/min rating that most weapons have, BoC included?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I never had luck with the BoC.  The damn thing just didn't proc for me.. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Somebody should really parse this.  I don't see how somebody with both could really tell a difference in proc rates unless it was huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shrug, no BoC here, but I mainhand a SoD over my HG because it taunts better and the DPS (parsed many times) is much higher.  I do OK with my setup, vs wars with Time weapons and BoWs, but HG certainly isn't everything I expected when I got it.  <br />
<br />
EB weapons and their taunt is mostly overrated IMO.  DPS, Stun, DD is by far my favorite route.  Having a lame effect that doesn't do anything but taunt, just seems like a gimpy hack that SoE did to try and 'fix us'.<br />
<br />
I've yet to try a rune type proc, but I'm hoping to sometime soon, seems like it might be my new favorite route, if it works out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I talked to my friend and he said BF &gt; BoC and HG, and that BoC and HG are almost the same, with the HG pullin up ahead by a bit, he has used all 3<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">GBoS &gt;&gt;&gt; BoC imo<br />
<br />
The DD/stun is better than a pure hate proc i think. I mean paladins get insane aggro from the stuns , makes sense that stun procs do the same. <br />
<br />
 Does anyone have an approximate hate value for the GBoS or maybe a SoD proc? I remember reading that 1hp of damage is roughly equal to 1 hate? , if thats true then i would guess the GBoS proc is somewhere around 500hate (total best guess here) and when u combine that with the better DPS and better/faster ratio for a more steady damage stream , Id have to rank the GBoS ahead.  A bit off topic sowwy . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I remember reading that 1hp of damage is roughly equal to 1 hate? If this where true then our tanks would have to proc their BoWs somewhere around 35 times in a 5 minute fight to keep the wizards alive. 7 procs per minute is a lot higher than what has been reported by anyone who has parsed proc rates.</div></div><hr />

GBoS &gt;&gt;&gt; BoC imo<br />

I disagree with this statement VERY much. Having had both for a while, I would say the GBoS proc-rate is very subpar. I went from a SoD to GBoS and noticed my ability to hold agro went down, because I was procing less than my old SoD.<br />
<br />
Also, after I got BoC I noticed it procing a good amount over my GBoS. <br />
<br />
If the sword is gonna rot, grab it. But dont go out of your way for it, its a upgraded Copper Hammer of Striking, and it doesn't proc a lot in my experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I'm not tanking and dont want to draw agro, I mainhand GBoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Man, that's weird... 305 Dex I get about 3-6 procs a minute from my GBoS. I had a SoD before and the SoD couldn't hold agro very well at all vs some of the new PoP weapons, but the GBoS did just fine. I offhand the BoC and of course get fewer procs, but still enough to make me /heart the thing.<br />
<br />
If I got a Hategiver, I'd turn in my BoC for DKP most likely, to offset the prices of the HG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've got all 3 and BoC &gt; GBoS &gt; SoD if you ask me, but YMMV.</div></div><hr />
