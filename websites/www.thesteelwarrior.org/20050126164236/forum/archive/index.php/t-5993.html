Any quests?  LDoN advice?  Take note that Im only getting 12-19 pts per LDoN win.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't like the choice of gauntlets you have.  Worn Zraxthril Gauntlets are likely a cheap option for you.<br />
<br />
But overall your gear is fine - keep on leveling and saving your pp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right off I can see some good upgrades for you from there, notably the Kylong Shinguards and Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets. Also the Kylong Darkmail Visor and the Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer (although those last two might be a tough fight for a group your level).<br />
<br />
The Kylong Darkmail Coif is another option as well: same AC as your flameguard, but better stats for a warrior otherwise. :)</div></div><hr />

hmm Eyepatch of plunder is doable storm feather is easy to kill, but i am afraid you will die of boredom before he even spawns.  If you can stare in front of your comp for 24 hours waiting for something to spawn go for it.  You also have to realize that it is overly camped there is always someone there</div></div><hr />
