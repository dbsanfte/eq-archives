<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naerron</div><div class="date">01-27-2005, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i got this 1% shielding aug, and like, the only place i could put it i would lose either HP or AC, 25AC or i think my lowest HP aug is a 30 30 30 aug.  should i just keep the shielding aug banked, put it in AC, or drop the HP aug? i am at 24% w/ out shield atm, and shield takes the palce of epic so no real gian or loss when equped except for the AC bonus of course.<br />
<br />
i used to have 4, 25 ac augs from RS, and 3 20 ac augs, but i decided to load a bot team one day, and farmed all 8 of the HP augs from RS, so like i dropped a lot of AC from that and been pretty concerned about dropping so much AC, befor ei got those augs i was reaching near 2750 or so buffed, now i make like 2600.<br />
<br />
a follow up question to all of this is, do yall think the 540 HP was worth dropping like 150 AC?</div></div><hr />

I banked 1% and 2% shielding augments because for me trying to get 1 less DI<br />
is a lot more important than shaving off 10 or 20 (actually a lot less).<br />
<br />
You see 2300/14000 warriors and 2900/12000 in eqrankings.<br />
So my guess its more of a personnal feeling, than universal solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also put AC in every single slot except one 70hp from RSS, 90hp+ and the bic. AC20 aug &gt; hp70 for me, but then again I'm a AC whore just like Emilia.</div></div><hr />

Being high on the Eqrankings list doesn't mean they have a clue what they are doing hehe.  We had one of the Ferubi 15 AC augs drop on the way to the Smith  last night (I already had it) and none of the 6 or 7 tanks on the raid put in on it.  Went to a beastlord :P.  I guarantee if it had been a 30 hp aug they would have been all over it hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exept for a few &quot;perfect beasts&quot; most seem to go either hp or ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's safe to assume that at all personally :)  I've known a few of those guys that &quot;totally clueless&quot; described perfectly.  All it takes to be a &quot;top warrior in a top guild&quot; is to tag along with one of those guilds long enough to get invited and then start collecting DKP. :)  Back on my prod server it never ceased to amaze me some of the people who I knew to be total morons but still managed to get into a top guild and climb to the top of the EQrankings ladder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brutul is correct, about 5% of players have half a clue. Watched Warriors struggle with aggro, because they decided &quot;LDoN&quot; wasn't worth their time. Then Orb of the Sky drops and none bid except one Warrior (the one with the best aggro)?!<br />
So a kid joins his High Schools guild his buddies are in (and yes some guilds that are top guilds are these types) and gets all the gear. Doesn't mean he knows anything at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">01-29-2005, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">high AC over high HP.  generally speaking, if you go high AC, the hp will follow.  You may not come away with a 14k tank if you have 3k unbuffed AC, but you'll be in the 13's, and considering every major raid encounter in the game right now save tunat/mata is tankable with a 12k tank, 2600ac, max shielding, 50 avoid tank, there's no real reason to disregard the other stats and go balls to the wall for 14+, unless you can do so and keep your ac/shield/avoid all very high</div></div><hr />
