<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trying to decide what to get for my aggro weapons.  The choices that are either available or will be shortly are:<br />
<br />
SeWs + A3<br />
Vanazir + A3<br />
Timeless coral greatsword + A3<br />
EoE + A3 and save up to buy a BoC + A3<br />
<br />
My guess is that the EoE + BoC is the best aggro option, I'm not sure if Vanazir is &gt; than SeWs aggro or not.  And no clue what the aggro on invigorate is (TCGS), would guess low but dunno.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in your opinion is that ranked something like this<br />
<br />
TCGS &lt; SeWs &lt; Vanazir &lt; EoE + BoC<br />
<br />
until I have enough money it would probably be EoE + Copper hammer, with that combo does it still fall at the top in your all's opinion?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">TCGS &lt; SeWs &lt; Vanazir &lt; EoE + BoC : true</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angry_Tank01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Save up and buy armour with your DKPs, not weapons. <br />
Guessing your not a primary tank, you could tank with a sharpened twig once you hit AET.<br />
<br />
Get saving now, then you can grab your first DBoW, alternatively, VDDs will go cheap after a couple of months in Time.<br />
<br />
Just grab what you can, but don't burn your points on anything, except for a DBoW perhaps.<br />
<br />
Have patience young jedi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably going to be quite sometime before I get a DBoW the first 3 are going to be awarded.  I'm about 4th in the hp/ac line of tanks, I MA every now and again, and trash tank abit more often.  <br />
<br />
Our award system is a bit different too, it's kinda like dkp except that everything is valued at 1, they use a win to loot ratio to determine who is up for it (except on things that are being awarded to specific ppl first like the DBoW).  So as long as something isn't being awarded it's no more expensive now than later. <br />
<br />
But like you suggested I'm mainly concentrating on hp/ac upgrades atm, although the EoE could be a decent hp upgrade in addition to the aggro upgrade, not sure if EoE + Copper hammer is worth messing with atm or not though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Headboss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I own all those weapons but EOE.<br />
<br />
Heres my order:<br />
<br />
Timeless coral greatsword + A3 (weak agro, banked it)<br />
SeWs + A3<br />
EoE + A3 and save up to buy a BoC + A3<br />
Vanazir + A3 (will come out top, just based on dps, and proc rate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I won a VDD last week, and it's great for aggro alone without aug...<br />
If I MA, when the mob comes in I fire an arrow, incite, hit furious, then defensive and I rarely lose aggro...i was amazed by it, the damage output alone keeps you high on the list...when I anger 3 it then boy it's gonna rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Interesting, so 1 vote for EoE+BoC and 2 for VDD.  You all feel the VDD will outaggro the EoE+BoC or just that it's plenty of aggro to do the job?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gry, I feel EoE+BoC. SO my BoC doesn't rot in my invetory anymore pls.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I will be third for DBoTW. So I am going to go with the DBoTW and EoE combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya, I'm leaning that direction atm too.  If I had a BoC rotting in my inventory I'd really be leaning that way, saving up 300-400k is doable but hurts lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gry, pm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i'd go with the VDD. if your not the MT it's probably ganna be a long time until you see a DBotW, also early agro lock wont be as important for you as it would be for the tanks above you. VDD is a great weapon. good DPS and can hold agro if needed. DBotW will eventually come your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VDD + Aug imo, cheap the dps is insane, and its awesome aggro.  I'ed never trade my VDD for anything but a DB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gry, you need a 2h. I'd take Vanazir probably if i was that high, and save rest of the dkp/notbuyingitems factor to get a darkblade, then at that level you should be doing ikkinz, get a JOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Better aggro will be EoE / Boc aug'd by a decent margin over A3'd Vdd.  Vdd was and still is a strong weapon dps and aggro wise.  I'd personally go for eoe / boc if you can, but if a vdd comes first you wont be disappointed with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">2handed weapons!!!  If you already have a SEWS I wouldn't bother with getting a VDD, unless you REALLY wanted one.  If you don't, snag a VDD and never look back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scylls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Best dual Aggro weapon for me Is Dbow + EoE with Anger or  Brutish Blade of Balance + EoE whith Anger 3 too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Best dual Aggro weapon for me Is Dbow + EoE with Anger or  Brutish Blade of Balance + EoE with Anger 3 too ;)<br />
<br />
1: Brutish Blade is a mined link than has never legitimately dropped on live servers.<br />
<br />
2: EoE is significantly outagroed by several GoD offhanders, starting with JoS from Ikkinz Raid2 that any PoTime farming guild should be able to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">WTB Increased Darkblade drop rate :   2 / 29 !<br />
<br />
<br />
Get a VDD, Put Anger3 on it.  It will serve you very faithfully for a long time.<br />
Wait for a Darkblade (if it ever drops).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scylls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">WTB Increased Darkblade drop rate :   2 / 29 !<br />
<br />
Tu n'as pas de chance stou :p<br />
<br />
she don't have any chance to loot one soon :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1/15 now on DBotW<br />
<br />
i use JoS + HotT both ykesha auged and can't complain<br />
<br />
basicaly it's:<br />
VDD is cheap and good dps but 2H is always weaker in agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kenyi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So, gonna ask my question here rather than make a new thread about more early time weapons.<br />
<br />
How would you all rank these combinations of weapons in terms of aggro.  In the one hand cases, EoE is main-hand.<br />
<br />
Blade of War + A3<br />
Vanazir + A3<br />
EoE + A3 and Sword of Primordial Power + A3<br />
EoE + A3 and Eth. Destroyer + Yak DD Aug<br />
EoE + A3 and Eth. Destroyer + A3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You basically can't rely on time weapons to drop. We cleared P4 around 19 times and P5 + Q 15 times. In that time we got 1 dbotw, ~8 EoE, ~6 VDD, 1 Shinai, 2 SoT, 2 Rog piercers, 3 Q hammers. On the other hand, other guilds got ~5 EoE in like 30 clears. Its just too fucking random, except dbotw that seems to be just too damn rare, all over the servers. <br />
Thats why i (and most other warrs on my guild too) went for JoS from the second ikkinz raid. Its fairly common (4 x loot out of a loottable of 6 items, 3 days lockout) and every time raiding guild should be able to beat it without too much trouble. If you farm ikkinz2 you get get 1 - 2 every week, almost guaranteed. Its awesome dps for the level raid you need to get it and pretty good aggro with anger3 (simply from dps, the proc  isn't that uber). I paired it with an EoE and offhand it since we finally had our first dbotw after 15 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shareel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have to aggree. The droprate in Time is streaky. We killed 21 Saryrn/TT/TZ, 19 VZ/RZ, 17 Inno/Q.<br />
The results are 13 VDD, 6 CoVH, 15 EoE, 2 TA, 5 HB, 4 SoV, 6 Shinai, 2 DBoW, 6 TS, 5 GBoC, 5 SoT, 4 SotE, 4 JTB and 4 HotTW.<br />
The overall droprate of weapons its ok but Darkblade of Warlord and Time's Antithesis drop rate sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i'd go with the VDD. if your not the MT it's probably ganna be a long time until you see a DBotW, also early agro lock wont be as important for you as it would be for the tanks above you.

<br />
<br />
Currently we only have about 5 wars that play full time. I understand they're rare and stuffz.  But shouldn't be too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm very happy with the way my JoS+A3 and EoE+A3 has done.  Just waiting on DB or FB now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>issu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">more than 40 clear, 3 DBoTW dropped so far <br />
unless you have advance pt in war team, DBoTW will be far  from you for a long time</div></div><hr />
