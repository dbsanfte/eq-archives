<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following is a &quot;list&quot; of epic concerns being passed along:<br />
<br />
1. Galuk Drek in Veksar and Dragorn Champion:  <br />
<br />
2 day respawn on a named mob that anyone can engage in an open zone, and must be done &quot;in order&quot; is an issue.   Particularly Dragorn Champion.  In a zone where groups of relatively powerful players are hunting, and wiping out powerful nameds, these mobs need to be similar to the monk epic 7th hammer fight, where the mob can be spawned by the warrior doing the quest if he's ready for it, or not engaged by anyone not prepared for the fight.  <br />
<br />
2. Epic Click Effect:  First, this needs to be *either* instant cast time.. *or* a buff which fades when the damage is done, like a rune.   The current incantation is not appropriate for really anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why the outhouse tho?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Frodlin, I hope you have stressed the Galuk Drek problem enough to the developers.  Because Galuk can be looted out of order, he is being camped by whole guilds 24/7, regardless of whether their warriors have even started the epic.  This is posing a worse bottleneck than the Dragorn Champion.  He really needs to be made triggerable (a quest like the Garudon spawn quest would suffice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All of the above handles the serious concerns. in the Post Script please include something about the lame letter opener look lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vengeful Scorn needs to be reconsidered imo. 15% increase in agro done by our incite line would be much more appropriate.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dragorn is fine because to loot it, you need to be at that spot. Galuk Drek's spawn time OR make him unlootable unless at that phase needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It already has a 10 minute recast doesnt it? Hard to spam that. Also, it seems to me that almost noone is happy with thier class clicky effect. When you complete the 2.0 step, do you get a new proc? Or do you just get improved stats and a particle effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, it's unspammable, it's 10 min recast timer.<br />

And if Paladins aren't happy with their click effect, then it's not possible to be happy with anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe we can trade our clicky with paladins, and then we'll both be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Leelron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I personally agree with these concerns but also don't like the fact that the 1.0 alternate quest involves killing the Diaku overseer which is not only a 24 spawn but pharmed for the ornate chain BPS which it drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Conanette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agree about the Diaku overseer bit - he's being perma-camped on my server at the minute.  24 hour respawn seems a bit steep, especially if he also drops ornate bps - a 2 or 3 hour pop that was only useful for the warrior epic would perhaps reduce congestion on this first step.</div></div><hr />

that's what i was replying to :D a rune is okay, just not insta-cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Champ actually isn't fine, since it's in open zone with 100ish people hunting for anyting named and engageable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most of those people probably know that is an epic mob already and the average WoS group can't take dragorn.<br />
<br />
Monitoring the last time he was killed and making plans with people in advance, that's what I did, i logged in a day and was planning Dragorn, and another warrior told me why can't i loot the eye, told him you had to be at that step, made my way over to WoS just as the corpse decayed. I had a good planning of when he would spawn the following day, and made arrangements with friends - Wasn't hard at all, actually had 10 people for it. People who kill it probably aren't at that step and won't be able to loot it.<br />
<br />
Drek on the other hand, needs to be changed to unlootable except if you're at that part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;that's what i was replying to  a rune is okay, just not insta-cast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Insta-cast would have absolutely no effect on power balance, and there'd be no way to spam it since it has such a long recast. All insta-cast would do is let us use it once every 10 minutes without getting interrupted, since we have no channeling :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I know I'm a little late on the conversation but...<br />
<br />
Even if the clicky doesn't disappear when the dmg is absorbed, that seems good since it auto-casts the 15% resist thing.  So what if it takes two buff slots then, this is unheard of ability for wars and you can click off the rune effect thing right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Both of these two mobs are not fine, the mobs are easy to most people who are capable of obtaining the epic, but EPIC is not suppose to be sitting on my ass waiting 3 days straight for a mob to pop (SOE should learn people have real lifes beyond this game as well). I'll rather they make the encounter harder with the mob being TRIGGERABLE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, being Time geared doesn't mean anything about how fast you regen endurance.  Stop pressing it every 30 seconds and you won't run out as often.  It's not meant to be able to be used every chance you get, you know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Pappee Puddlejumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gear effects your max endurence<br />

You missed the point however</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The solution is spelled triggerable</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you missed the point.  If you use Incite/Bellow as soon as it pops every time, you will run out of endurence.  Therefore, no one uses it as soon as it pops.  Therefore, lowering reuse time is pretty much a waste.  Further, lowering reuse time by 2 seconds does not even allow you to 'oh shit' use it to regain agro any better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The solution is spelled triggerable<br />
<br />
Absolutely correct.  Other classes (SK in particular) have almost wholly triggerable spawns.  There is no reason for putting a 3-day spawner on the warrior epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You guys talking about how these mobs shouldn't have a 3 day spawn. I take it you did not do Epic V1.0. Golems and Hand of Maestro were a bitch to find up. I have no problem with spawn cycles, just make it to where we can loot the stuff out of order. But if we have to loot in order, then make things triggerable. Just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The Champion and Drek need to be made different.  How I dont know, but putting them smack dab in the middle of an exp zone. Where groups are farming named isnt a good idea.<br />
<br />
Drek is right in the middle of Veksar farm alley.  Groups exp/farm the almost night and day.  He is 1 groupable, they see him and they think he drops loot and kill him.  So, if it's changed to unlootable that doesnt help.  The corpse will just rot and you have to wait 3 more days hoping you can take 3-days off to get the spawn. Have friends online and waiting or buy 5 accounts and 5 computers to ensure you can get the drop.<br />
<br />
It's not an uber vrs. nonuber thing so leave that out of this it has no place in this.<br />
<br />
They need to be triggerable, or only attackable via turn in or something.  But having them available to anyone is a major bottle neck.  And yes I did epic 1.0 on a necro, warrior and cleric. I know what it's like.<br />
<br />
But, epic 1.5 isnt designed to be as long as epic 1.0 was.  Also, all of the epic 1.0 had one to several bottlenecks each.  But with 1.5 some do and some dont, which is why people are really complaining.<br />
<br />
Thank you for addressing this problem. Making it only lottable by a warrior at that step doesnt solve the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't assume anything cuz you come off lookin like an ass.  One check of my magelo would have cleared up your question and assumption.  I suspect many of the warriors presently to Galuk or the Champion had previously done 1.0.  This isn't about walking in the snow up hill both ways, okay?<br />
<br />
The point, my dear friend, is that we ought not have to sit through these bullshit cockblocking maneuvers again.  Sony learned the mistake the first time.  That is why many of the 1.5 epics have triggerable spawns now.</div></div><hr />

the ratio is fine for its difficulty to get, knight 1hs have ALWAYS blown warrior 1hs away. ornate broadsword is about equal to JSoFF off jiva for their respective classes so theres not alot of room for complaint. <br />
<br />
also what will you be offhanding it for? the only pre time weapon that approaches it is a bloodfrenzy and your magelo doesnt show one. i have a bagged bloodfrenzy and once i get around to the epic i plan on mainhanding 1.5 and offhanding the frenzy</div></div><hr />

reposted from another forum:<br />
Focus Effect: any one of - small range extention or end preseveration or small hate bonus (clerics get -3% agro from theres perhaps +3% that stacks with EoA) or incite line duration extention or any number of effects that will have some effect on a constant basis but not be over balanceing. Though the best one I think would be a range increaser or a +10% to incite agro effect.<br />
<br />
Click Effect: 5000pt vie line buff that blocks both spell and melee damage at 5-10% rate. Reuse of 15 min and buff duration of 20, self only, instant cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have you tried actually selecting which aug to remove first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">1. making Galuk Drek lootable in order of progression ... OK<br />
2. making Galuk Drek trigerable ... OK if there is a limiter on recycle timer (need to wait one day or more before trigering its spawn again)<br />
3. making Dragorn Champion trigerable ... OK if there is a limiter on recycle timer<br />
<br />
<br />
4. cliky effect : making it 0s cast time instead of 0.8s ... OK<br />
5. cliky effect : making it last untill fully consums ... OK for the absorb part, not for the spell resist part that should stay at 1 minute.<br />
<br />
6. the focus : in its current form its 15% timer reduction. It's usefull only when chain cast on mob but it consums so much endurence that it becomes useless. Making it 15% more hate would be to much overpowering (it's more progress than between incite and below of the mastruq). thus they could put the 15% in endurance conservation, so that it doesn't making more powerfull on single cast and it would generate the same Hate/End ratio when chain cast.<br />
<br />
7. the ratio ... OK for the 1.5 RvR<br />
<br />
8. the augs : there is still issues with having two procing aug on it, and there is issues when removing them. Should be fixed.<br />
<br />
9. additional idee (idee not ask, thus it's open to discusion) : with OoW we get shields AA that wants to make the 1Her+Shield viable. but our primary focus is aggro, for now (as far as I know) 1Her+Shield is less aggro than 2Her. Since epic 1.5 is good for none Time+ warrior and only viable in offhand when compared to Primary-only 1Her. It would be nice to tune/tweak it so that its aggro power is bigger with a shield. for exemple, making the cliky a proc with -100 proc rate mod when dual wielding and +100 ( or +10, it's open to balance) when a shield is equiped. this would allow us to have 10ppm in epic+Shield combo (heavy imbued proc at 4ppm + 2x aug proc at 2x3ppm +buff proc at 1ppm since it will be 'eaten' by the previous ppm. resulting at around 4 + 2.7 + 2.6 + 1.1 = 10.4 ppm which equivalent to 3.6 + 2.8 +1.6 + (3 + 2.9)/2 = 10.85ppm). this would be of course only for the epic+Shield combo, not for 1Her+Shield, not for epic+1Her, not for 1Her+epic. Thus it would really be a game change between having and not having the epic (1.5 or 2.0, the diff being only in the ratio, inbue, and focus power), so that our epic isn't 'just another weapon'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Actually I am offhanding it because IMO, it is much to slow to main hand...especially since no aggro proc.  26 delay is slow for main hand ... seriously slow.   I guess I just come from the old school idea that faster is better in main hand.  I have not ever had a problem with that method.   <br />
<br />
If this weapon was just a little faster, I would main hand it above my BoC .... and may still main hand it when I get it augmented, but with out an anger proc of some kind on it, I don't feel I can even think about mainhanding it above my BOC(with anger III aug) untill  I get it double augmented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Darkblade and Fleshbiter both have a 30+ delay, so i see no problem there.<br />
<br />
I think that the Dragorn Champion and Galuk Drek need to be a triggered spawn, that way some of us that only have a limited amount of time to work on Epic 1.5 can actually do it.<br />
<br />
Only concern I have is that I currently dont know what i'm going to put in the second augment slot.  I know Anger 3 for one but still not sure what i'm going to put in the other slot, I was thinking Ykesha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has anyone ever confirmed if Weapon affinity works on Augments as well as the innate procs?  Last I heard was indications it does not.  Which would mean that even with augmetns, and BoC with an Anger III augment would proc considerably more than the epic with 2 anger III augmetns, or 2 yakesha aug's... or whatever the case may be.  Maybe my desire to offhand it is lack of knowledge, and if so please let me know.  But untill I see that it would generate more aggro for me in the main hand that my BoC and angerIII augment, then for my 1hs option, I'll off hand the 1.5 .<br />
<br />
Now, if it has been proven that augments can proc as much as innate procs with weapon affinity, then that changes everything.</div></div><hr />

1.  Instant cast &amp; longer duration (both have been mentioned)<br />

2.  the graphic of the sword is quite lame it atleast needs to be oversized as well as the 2.0 version so damn unorignal. hi epic 1.0 w/ red glow every other class got a neat new look to theirs and we get a fucking cut and paste from 1.0.  YAY.  The sword already looks like shit for an epic and the least they could do is give it a cool effect.  i mean shit even if it glows red make the damn eyes glow on the hilt since there was so much about the jewled eyes in the lore of the sword.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Multi day spawns are no longer acceptable.  The reason they're no longer acceptable is that other classes do not have them.  This is what most preople refer to as &quot;unfair&quot;.   In essence, 2 hour respawns like the rogue and monk epic are ok, they prevent people from &quot;back to back&quot; doing them.   3 say respawns are not ok.   This isn't Kunark where the populace of EQ players are spread across all sorts of levels, most people are 65+ who play EQ, the target range the quest is designed for.   <br />
<br />
Comparing respawns to epic 1.0, which I did pretty darned early in it's life cycle is well, retarded.  Comparing them to the current epic quests is not retarded.   There is nothing &quot;epic&quot; about camping or the ability for a single 6-boxer to block the epic progression of an entire server's warriors.</div></div><hr />

Looting restrictions are not the whole answer.  The mob is already dead by the time someone finds out there's an unlootable epic piece on the mob.<br />
<br />
Respawn quest (as with Sol C), warrior trigger (as with Vxed), wakeup phrase (as with Lanys), wakeup trade (as with Krekk) ....any of these would be good solutions.</div></div><hr />

We can do the whole epic with 2 groups (even for ssra-vt) level folks, devourer and krekk are not a problem as long as you have a bard and the debuffing.<br />
<br />
I still believe the Champion is an okay spawn, as a warrior not at that step cannot loot it and it is a one day on the mark (i believe) spawn, only takes a bit of planning for this.<br />
<br />
However, the Galuk Drek problem, I agree with.<br />
<br />
the spawn isn't *too* bad, it could be reduced a bit to make it easier, but it definately needs a fixing for the book, we can't have people looting that out of turn, imo.<br />

This quest doesn't exist in a vaccuum nor is it compared to Epic 1.0.  You compare it to other epics.  I agree that the combat part isnt' extremely tough, but I'll tell you what, I fought 4 7th hammers in 20 mins the other day.<br />
<br />
There isn't a fight other than the final mage fight that I've done that can't be back to back spawned in a maximum of 2 hours by simply entering the zone.  The only possible exception is Spiritseeker Nadox and that's SUPPOSED to be working the same way as the other epic fights but it's broken.<br />
<br />
I did epic 1.0 as well, and went through the whole Sev thing.   That was bad... these epics were supposed to change that and DID for everyone but us.   <br />
<br />
No named mob in an exp zone should be combative unless intended to be by those doing the quest or clearly like.. indiff of a different type (Example:  The druid Dark Elf and Human in Harbingers, no one confuses them for regular zone nameds in a hunt for runes, or accidentally pulls them to their exp group)</div></div><hr />

right, I am sorry to confuse the 1.5 and the 2.0.<br />
2s on 30s is 7% time reduction, and 4s on 30s is 15%.<br />

Actually a 7% reduction in endurance cost rather than a 7% reduction in recycle time would be alot more useful towards allowing the ability to be used a little more frequently.<br />

There will be no aggro difference in having 6000 Endurance or 100,000 endurance. Once you are at a certain point, you are g2g - unlike mana, guess thats the uniqueness of endurance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I don't think I've ever really needed to use Incite more than twice per fight. I have good aggro, but even so, I knew what aggro lockdown was a long time before I got my DBoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">The warrior epic is fairly decent in stats. However, its effects, I believe, suffer from poor design and should be upgraded. The only thing epic about them is how bad they are.<br />
 <br />
Take the reduced recast time on the Incite line. This reduced time does next to nothing to help with aggro generated by incite, and on top of which excaberates the issue of running out of endurance when using incite often, especially with the newer ones.<br />
 <br />
With a two second cast time decrease for Incite, a warrior can get in around one extra Incite for each 15 or so uses of the skill. <br />
 <br />
With unfocused Incite, the aggro generated on 15 incites chained every 30 seconds (450 secs duration) is 11,250. Endurance cost is 3,750.<br />
 <br />
Focused Incite, the aggro generated on 16 incites chained every 28 seconds (448 secs duration) is 11, 650. <br />
 <br />
Operating under the assumption that each incite overwrites the previous incite, therefore losing the other 30-32 seconds of taunt DoT, this works out to only a 3.5% increase in aggro generation... with a 6.6% increase in endurance used.<br />
 <br />
At the end of the day... that focus gives nearly an unnoticeable increase in aggro, with a FUTHER increase in endurance used... and the issue isn't aggro generation any more, especially with TWO aggro procs available on the epic, it's a question of running out of endurance. Issues are starting to arise with running out of it, this makes it worse.<br />
 <br />
The focus effect on the warrior epic, therefore, is designed poorly and therefore should be fixed.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
To find suggestions for a better focus effect, first I ask what the warrior's role is:<br />
 <br />
The warrior specializes in generating aggro on mobs to make them the focus of all the mob's attacks.<br />
The warrior specializes in being able to take a beating better than all others, and survive.<br />
The warrior specializes in melee weaponry, being able to use all weapons with equal ability.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Taking ideas from previous items in the game that have helped warriors, as well as looking to other classes epics, there are many suggestions for a warrior epic's worn focus effect:<br />
1: Increase aggro modifier of all actions taken by the warrior: 20%<br />
2: Increase aggro gained from usage of incite by 25%<br />
3: Decrease endurance usage from disciplines and/or incite by 20%<br />
 <br />
All of which are truly useful focii to have. The first, and preferred, one is already in the game as a 15% version. These all scale up to the next epic.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Next, the epic click effect:<br />
 <br />
Warriors don't buff people. We just aren't that type of PC. Most especially, we do not cast clerical line group buffs... if ANY tank should, it should be a paladin. NOT a warrior.<br />
 <br />
That clicky effect might be useful for all it's shortcomings, were the warrior epic not able to have two seperate aggro procs, and were the warrior constantly having aggro issues. With the epic at least, this is not the case. Therefore, the group will not have any meaningful benefit from this spell. Without the rest of the group gaining benefit from the spell, the analysis must be of how much the effect improves the warrior alone, and the analysis is dismal.<br />
 <br />
In one minute, with a minimum DPS of 125 (very reasonable), the warrior's DPS is reduced by 10%, for that one minute. On higher end fights of 1000DPS, the DPS reducion by this clicky goes down significantly, a 1.25% reduction, FOR THAT ONE MINUTE. The clicky has a refresh time of 10 minutes, so in sustained terms, warrior damage taken is reduced by a maximum of 1%, to .125% or lower.<br />
 <br />
That is just abysmal. Epic? Hardly... in fact, it's barely even useful, as that 750 damage taken makes a difference of one half of ONE bubble of health or less... even the worst healers can heal that easily with a single heal.<br />
 <br />
There are many suggestions for click effects that warriors would find useful, even once every 10 minutes for a 8 sec casting time:<br />
 <br />
-Clicky self-only large rune+DS (1500pt rune, 150ptDS 1.5, 2500/250 2.0)<br />
-Clicky self-only Voice of Thule variant<br />
-Instant click Warrior's Tenacity of significant power (minimum 5000pt for 1.5) balanced as the warrior doesn't keep the health, it goes away.<br />
-Clicky AETaunt+AEIncite<br />
 <br />
etc etc.<br />
 <br />
Any of these suggestions would make the warrior epic's effect actually useful. And face it, it's the effects that make the weapon, not the stats. Looking back to epic 1.0, all epics that had decent stats for the day were quickly outmoded by the next expansions, while those with a good effect (post-addition war epic, bard epic, cleric epic) were found useful for years.<br />
 <br />
Please change the effects on the warrior epic. They absolutely suck, and there could be better on them without screwing up game balance. They are underpowered in isolation, and compared to other epics, the effects are laughably pitiful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">The effect says reduces timer on abilties that inspire hate in your target...<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to have the same percentage deduction from incite (30-28) formulated into AETaunt and Normal taunt.<br />
<br />
That'd be ok for me, nothing overpowering but nothing too wow, i'm not sure if we can do anything harder then this though without pushing it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">I origianally felt the Warrior Epic 1.5 had little to recommend it to players who completed PoTime (two expansions old) or had progressed beyond QVic (last weeks news). This is a new expansion after all - Epic 1.0 was a lot closer to the top of the heap when it first came out.<br />
<br />
I've changed my mind. Many Warriors that completed that huge list of flag mobs to reach PoTime and then did Uqua and the Ikkiniz raid to reach QVic and beyond (a horrendious amount of effort) are using DBoW and EoE.<br />
<br />
Concidering Epic 1.5 is &quot;intended&quot; to be for those Warriors that aren't in hardcore raiding guild it's close enough to a DBoW. There's also a 19/19 weapon with a stun effect available as a less difficult raid target - close enough to an EoE.<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5 (and the offhander previously mentioned) are in fact a bit to close to the weapons IMO that many top 200 serverwide Warriors are weilding.<br />
<br />
Make the focus effect and right clickable effect sensible. Fix any mob access problems. But I fail to see any need for adjustment beyond that. The Warrior 1.5 isn't too weak - other Epics are just too powerful.<br />

I am satisfied with the HP, AC, saves etc etc .... the ratio...well it COULD be better IMO when compared to the other epic's....  But, as far as the Clicky and the Focus.  I knew about them.  But thought that the clicky Just MIGHT be more usefull than it appeared on the surface.   So, I'd thought after I started playing with it, I might find uses for it that makes it not suck as bad.   I can't find much benefit to it.  Only times I can find that I might even benefit from using it  just beofore engaging a Mob as MT for the added mitigation, or is in teh case of adds when a caster's start's getting beat down to give them some added mitigation...but in that case there are more important things I need to be doing...like getting aggro.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The focus I knew was crp from the start.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if there was any new's about the concern's passed along.  Any new's at all from the dev's would be great.<br />
<br />
IMO. .. the Clicky as potential.  It truely does.  They just need to lengthen the Duration by ALOT and shorten the cast time by about half.  The focus is totally useless though...might as well not even be on the sword.<br />
<br />
Also, does it aggrevate anyone else that the clicky takes up 2 buff slot's?  IF I am the only one seeing this,  I may be bugged, but still it has happened everytime I clicked it.</div></div><hr />

That's because it gives two different buffs, one gives a 15% increased chance to resist spells.<br />
