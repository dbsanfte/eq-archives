<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use the extra 5k for a Barbed Ringmail and some jewelry: 2X 6ac 65hp rings and 2X 2ac 35hp ears. And yes, SCHW + spider fur belt is better than FBSS + any cheap gloves I can think of.</div></div><hr />

Dont understand me wrong its ok if he stars a new cahr or star on a new server - because he nwo how to play. But dont do this if he is a bloody newb to EQ <br />
<br />
I also make this failure and twinked a friend with around 7k (he was a EQ-newb) 2 things happen <br />
<br />
1; he lost 80% of the first gear he got from me ( leave them on corpses etc...)<br />
<br />
2; he is 35 now and have no idea how to play- because he always have so good gear ( up to lev 30) that nothing can happen to him.</div></div><hr />

If you start with nothing and have to play in crappy armor and crappy weapons, you really learn how to play your class.  You sort of have to.  (but admittedly, once you know how to play, it's fun to be a newbie in high level gear and own everything you fight until you grow into said gear)  Also, when you start buying gear for him, dont go all crusty.  There are a few pieces of crafted that have better stats than crusty, so it's better to mix and match.</div></div><hr />
