<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe I'm hallucinating or something. But i swear, it seems like they nerfed proc rates on BoW. I log on today to an XP gorup in BoT. And I'm looking at my proc rate, which is usually fairly high: I usually get about 2 or 3 procs per fight. But today for some reason, I can't buy a proc for the life of me. I mean, my 2-hand primal; 13 higher delay and usually has very poor proc rate is going off at least twice as often. Hell, I'm going 3 or 4 straight fights without a proc at some point.<br />
<br />
Question, anyone else notice similar results? I got 290 dex so I dont' think it's lack of that. Max haste of course. I'm using my Orb of the Sky, and thats proccing often, like it always does. But, the procs are supposed to be independant of one another so I doubt thats the problem. So, has anyone else experienced similar results? I don't know if this is recent or has been going on for a while, I just noticed it today personally. If SoE stealth-nerfed proc rate on BoW as part of this whole &quot;fixing&quot; elemental/PoTime weapon movement, I'll be in flames.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Works just fine for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elidroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I noticed the same thing. Proc rate for me is WAY down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, different weapon, but I bagged my BoC last night because I couldn't get it to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try parsing for more than a couple hours. I had my BoW proc 7 times in 8 hits once, doesn't really mean anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same, I noticed a very slight decrease in proc rate, down to about 1 proc per minute or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">imo, dps has always been the primary source of agro with it, 48/32 is the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well procs help a ton, especialy when you're evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have not  noticed a change in proc rate. i will do another proc rate parse this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did a fairly large test rigth now. 35 mins, 52 procs. Thats about 1.5 proc per min. Thats with 305 dex constant.<br />
<br />
I dont have a similar test from before the patch, but people are saying it was 2 per min before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Carrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">still seems fine, as random as ever.  It did seem reluctant to proc right after the last patch, but only after I heard about a possible proc rate reduction in chat.  placebo effect =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aren't carrots on the receiving end of the Ginsus? What are you doing posting here? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The procrate did get a nerf or change, whatever. However a few days after it was changed back /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mojak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
I've found that if I right click my jboots, it ups the amount that my Blade of War procs...<br />
