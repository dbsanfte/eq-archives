<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys i'm a 57 warrior with no real clue where the best place to gain some levels is right now. I have been in PoJ from 48-53, PoI from 53-55 and mostly PoN to 57 with the rare PoD/PoS group. I was wondering because i like being in the planes(thank god for player graveyards, they saved my ass ALOT) what would be the best levelling strategy to get to 65. Alot of groups don't want warriors these days i find and i'm LFG for hours on end and the groups i do get are garbage and falling a part. A friend told me a good way to get a group is  to call a camp check and send the leaders of those camps a tell asking to reserver a spot, so far no luck...any other tips?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvil</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best bet IMO is to stick to PoN until you hit 60, and then try to move on to PoV.  Not sure how it works on your server, but about the only chance anyone below 60 has of getting a group in PoV is if they 60+.  <br />
<br />
That said, PoV whenever you can get there is sweet exp, espicially if you can get an Inner group.</div></div><hr />

I mean I have always stayed with the fastest delay offhand as well as main for aggro or am i missing something?</div></div><hr />

You could do anything from the half pipe of the Hole to HS to Veksar to CT until 65 if you really wanted to.<br />
<br />
The fastest XP (meaning most consistent as well) to 65 will be in POV/POS/BOT.<br />
<br />
POV is usually the fastest since it requires the least amount of brainpower and therefore usually has a group to join if they will take you.<br />
<br />
Getting from 60 - 65 in POV takes a week of exping 5 hours a day.<br />
<br />
BOT would be faster when you reach 62, but your likelihood of getting one of those groups to accept you goes down.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think PoD Courtyards to 61, then POV to 65 will be your fastest route.<br />
<br />
If you can swing a PON guardian group or a POV group at your level, you should take it.<br />
<br />
There was a guy on Drinal who hated the idea of POP so much he exp'd to 65 in Cazic Thule while farming stuff. <br />
<br />
It took him about 5 times as many hours as anyone else. <br />
<br />
He still got there.<br />
<br />
This all depends on group makeup, btw. If you get a rocking group in HOH or CoD, they can exp you faster than POV. But all in all straight easy LFG to Group to XP and stay there all night,<br />
<br />
The caves in Plane of Valor are hard to beat.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp on how things work on Drinal.<br />

If you play at around the same time each day, establish some relationship with them and the game will be alot more fun.  Its not where you go, its who you meet.  <br />

I'm only saying crusty because that by far is the best looking hp equip that you can get a full set for under 1k</div></div><hr />

Next time I see you ill be sure to ask for some manly warrior tips instead of under-handed rogue'ly tips that u dont know bout :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree with this 100%. at level 57 you can tank PoD courtyards or castle easily.  Or even do PoI factory if you get the chance.<br />
<br />
Don't even think of tanking PoV / PoS until you're 61 unless you got some kickass gear.  You can xp there with another higher level tank doing the job, and you on dps and backup tank.  But those things will eat you up pretty quick at 57.<br />
<br />
Once you're 61, try to get into PoV and PoS giant groups.  Or take PoD castle, PoN guardians, or PoI factory.  Otherwise, stay out of those zones. hehe.<br />
<br />
Then at 63 try for BoT groups first, with PoV / PoS as backups.  Forget about first tier unless you want to help someone.</div></div><hr />
