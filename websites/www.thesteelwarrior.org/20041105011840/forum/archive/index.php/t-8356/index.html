<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cafard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
We have an heated dicussion in my guild on whatever the warriors not Main tanking should use High or Low aggro weapons.<br />
Warriors, including myself, are geared with SSra/LDoN items. We all have EB + TB proc items with Anger 3 or 2 on each, and WA5. (see my magelo)<br />
<br />
One point of view is that warriors other than the Main Tank should have a rather high aggro. <br />
<br />
The other point of view is that all melees classes other than MT should equip the weapons with generate the least aggro. That is : no-one but MT is dual-wielding and no 2h weapons with aggro procs (stun for example) are allowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to have your opinion on this topic please. <br />
Can you also post info on how your guild do manage aggro ? (if it manages it at all).<br />
How are you geared during a raid when you are not the Main Tank ?<br />
<br />
Also, are you using the Voice of Thule spell on the main tank ?<br />
And the Spirit of Rage disc once defensive drops ?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMHO if you're not a MT or offtank ( when needed ) or on a rotation...your aggro weapon should be bagged. pull out the biggest pure DPS setup or the equivelant you got and go to town. Nothing; and i mean NOTHING can screw up a MT rotation faster than some random_toon095 grabbing aggro off your MT and causing most likely about 6 deaths if not more.<br />
<br />
For aggro management within your guild; it' all about knowing the people you're working with and it's their job to control their aggro. Usually once you get to the elemental or equivelant level if your guild doesn't know aggro management you're not going much farther ( or even get close really ) when a critter can one round each and every one of your guildies :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on how things are going and what you're hitting.  For our tanks, we have usually 3-5 guys who can MT pretty much anything we fight.  On the clearing, most of us don't bother bagging our agro weapons.  We have enough hps to take a few hits =)<br />
<br />
On a specific boss mob, espically if its one who likes to splat tanks, we'll keep them out as well, to build up our place on the agro list.  With furious disc, we can pretty easily get agro on another tank if they go down or whatever.<br />
<br />
So its really up to your tank crew.  We make sure that if the clearing MA loses agro, one of us is normally there to keep the dresswearers alive.  On a boss, if you can't control your agro, like anyone else, you'll get splatted.  Personally on bosses if I'm not in the first few tanks, I'll use my DPS weapons to contribute.  If I see the first tank go, then 2nd, I whip those out and get ready to tank while the healers catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Shik. You do NOT want other warriors getting aggro early and dying. Dead warriors are VERY bad. Think of it this way: If your MT goes down, and there isn't a backup warrior, you have to rely on crappy knights. And we all know they aren't up to snuff. Ehm, sarcasm aside, having your backup warriors down is the worst thing you can do. Where you are on the hate list doesn't affect taunt successes... It's better to have a few wizards die until a warrior can snag aggro than to have warriors die early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, there's an obvious differance between boss encounters and moderate trash...<br />
<br />
Imho,rule of thumb on boss fights...I agree with Shik especially if you have tanks with ae taunt.Before that point your SA will probablly find it easier to run some aggro with care under the MA.If the mob doesn't blur and it hits hard relatively speaking, then assists should run dps setups and bag their aggro weapons.Your job on a hard hitter is to be ready and healthy to step up when the tank in order ahead of you dies.If you're say sa and you croak off the bat because the rng put you ahead or the ma was stunned etc ...then you just tossed away some insurance.Also,somebody is always likely to divert heals to you instead of staying focused on their job,this can cause bad stuff to happen.You should not cause any unnecessary resources to be drawn off to yourself,just like the dps.AE taunt makes stepping up easy.<br />
<br />
On some bosses that blur, especially ones that don't hit hard(like poa avatars for ep ppl  or some poe mobs)I'd say you may do better with at least one  or a cpl extra warriors carefully using aggro weaps.<br />
<br />
Trash...Is this what you are talking about?On trash that doen't hit hard we have all tanks taunt and use aggro weapons.It's better to let aggro slide to the heaviest tanks of course,but, the main thing is keeping robes up while it gets evaporated.I'm always happy to see a tank take my aggro when a non enrage trash mob go's under 20 pct so I can get to my next target and start aggro.I don't worry about aggro much here just that it's on a tank and not being held or pushed in a bad spot.Minis and hard hitting trash(ie for us the fiends on the way to Fennin) are better treated as a boss mob as long as your ma has aggro.<br />
<br />
That stuff said aggro is a fluid thing.If troubles occur fall back to the basics,but, tanks should learn to play with aggro and know when to employ some has back up and when not to.When in doubt don't take any aggro on a boss until it's your turn.<br />
<br />
I like to have  knights in places where aggro is difficult to either ma while I mt or at least back up the ma's target on breaks.A good knight is gold imo hehe...they just gotta be ready to die a bit. :)<br />
<br />
Aggro management is fluid.The best dps people can run under the ma's hate production with a narrow margin giving some cushion for luck.If stuff gets wacky calm people down and go to the basics.Otherwise good raiders can play speed of assist and dps to their own tune quite often.<br />
<br />
If I assist on a boss I always switch to a dps non aggro proc weapon.I can swap in my BOW in less than a second if I need it.Generally ,I prefer assists to bag hate weapons on simple aggro bosses.<br />
<br />
I love VOT when i get it for tanking...no anger and proc effects stuff yet.<br />
<br />
I only use spirit of rage when my aggro is weak...say a blur mob that doesn't hit too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I usually dual weild DBOW/EoE even when not maintanking. I take aggro from the MT maybe once every other night for a split second.<br />
<br />
IMO, all tanks should keep their aggro up there and be ready in the event of a death. Some people cannot do this without taking aggro, in which case yeah they should just do DPS. I find its not that hard to keep aggro under control, and that way I am ready to jump on RZ/ect if the MT dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think any of us bag our agro weapons. We just learn to control our agro. Learn to turn your attack on and off. Watch for agro procs. You want agro if the current tank goes down. Go max range on mobs, hitting them about every other hit. Things like that will make it a lot easier without bagging agro weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my opinion, the worst possible place for a second tank to be is 2nd on the aggro list for a hard hitting boss mob (up to elemental level, no experience with anything higher).  The reasoning behind this is that your main tank just died with a heal wheel on them.  If the mob turns immediately on the second tank before they can hit furious/defensive/evasive and aetaunt (in that order), they will most likely be a stain along side the MT.  You need time to /disc and get the heals coming in and I have watched tanks in my guild die because they got aggro before they and the healers could react.<br />
<br />
I usually keep my aggro weapons in on raids for boss mobs, BUT I cycle attacks like crazy.  With quad procs you have to or the RNG will put you too high at some point.  Tank transitions are fairly trivial with AEtaunt and Furious anymore except for the healers imo.  There is no reason that you have to be that high on the aggro list with aetaunt.  I see from your Magelo that you have it and I would assume any tank in a raiding guild would have it as well.<br />
<br />
It may seem cruel and heartless to purposely watch a guild mate die, but to save a raid it can be a necessity.  There is nothing more frustrating to see the healers all &quot;healing Target, healer_02 next&quot; cause by the time they targetted who had aggro and tried to cast they were dead.  Heck, I have offered to be a sacrificial tank before to my guild to grab aggro and die so that they healing could switch to the true second tank and buy them precious seconds.  I would rather get rez'd in after a win than CR with the raid.  The healers /veto'd my idea though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just my thoughts on it, so take it for what it is worth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What prompted the &quot;heated debate&quot;Cafard?<br />
<br />
I have never seen a tank using aggro weapons not get unwanted aggro at some point.Although,it usually is trivial... I have been and seen SA's dying out of order to this.By the time you are raiding in time/god I hope tanks have good enough aggro sensitivity to control their output with most weapons,but, those people probably wouldn't be asking this question.Obviously ,we all know there is more to aggro control then what you're swinging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">dps just for the heck of it. limits a rng mt agro failure. and accadently dubble procking a2 can be bad let alone a3.<br />
<br />
so i just slap in my ghoc with 100 ice aug and &quot;a&quot; then afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shirion;<br />
sorry to interject; but once the basics of the whole 'aggro management' deal is attained; than most certainly they cn all use dps/aggro deal weapons. <br />
<br />
i know firsthand when i raided my BoW was out....and i never was a MT for elemetals+ ( my gear was sucky at best ) .. but my guild knew aggro management and it was never even a factor.<br />
<br />
But for Cafard; i'd say it would be havoc or a catastrophe to recommend them going all aggro weapons at this stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My guild has two primary tanks on most boss fights.  We generally both use our aggro weapons.  I give the other warrior about 20 seconds at start to build aggro, and I always stop attacking for 10-15 seconds at some point in the first minute.  That plus incite are sufficient to keep a respectable aggro gap between us, while keeping me at or near the #2 position.  I for one have always found it advantageous to be #2 on the hate list.  I don't recall ever dying before I can hit fortitude, but I do watch the fights like a hawk, and hit Alt-3 within one combat round of the other tank dying.  I find it very satisfying when we must perform an unexpected tank transition, and no other people die or even show up on the HOTT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know it drives me out of my freakin mind when I'm trying to tank a boss with my BoW and other warrior's names keep popping up on HoTT because they refuse to bag their bloodfrenzies.  As 2nd or third tank, I like to be high on the aggro list, but never want to take aggro even for a second.  If you are 2nd tank and pull aggro for one round, then the MT dies before you get a heal you're sitting at half health and you're gonna get owned more than likely.  What I usually do as 2nd tank is start the fight with my ornate greatblade, and then swap in the BoW 20-30% into the fight.  By then I will not get aggro but I will be high enough I won't be totally relying on AE taunt to get aggro if the MT dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I aggree with Brutal and Gunnar; some combination of dps weapon to let the MT have a head start is a good idea, and the tougher the mob, the more critical it is that everyone disciplines themselves with respect to aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have 3 weapons which i use on raids atm<br />
<br />
BoCarnage + A3<br />
OSoW + A3<br />
Great Blade of storms (unaug'd).<br />
<br />
When Maintanking i use BoC/OSoW (mainhand/offhand) for maximum aggro output.<br />
<br />
When Assisting i use GBoS/OSoW (mainhand/offhand) for maximum duel wield dps output and decent aggro generation.<br />
<br />
I always wait for the assist call and sometimes a few extra seconds when the assist is called early.  The aggro output is enough to keep me close to the top but neve enough to bump me over the MT.  If, by some chance, i do steal aggro ... then whoever is tanking doesnt need to be tanking anymore until they can get themselves some decent aggro weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is what I am saying....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Usually, our guys are very good about it even when wielding their BF's and habitually I,or,our gl call assist in about 3 -5 seconds.I gotta admit we're an easy going bunch of part timers and people often engage on their own.It's let slide as long as we don't have any problems.I'd say the biggest hassle I normally have is with the fast assist early movement of the mob can be tough when warriors got hate weapons going and I have to rely on push sometimes.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of ways for assists to control aggro output.Warriors tend to have a desire to show their aggro strength tho and assisting on a hard hitter is not normally the correct time hehe.DPS weapons allow for fast hard engage and are more efficient and safer for the assist role genarally.A lot of warriors lack dps weapons of near quality to their aggro setups tho because obviously their concern is tanking.<br />
<br />
I remember one time on Reparm some wars were using their BF's and the sa had his dps a3 auged dualwield set up loaded.We called assist very fast as is our norm.Anyhoos,right after they engaged Reparm knocked me back pretty far and stunned me.He turned and flattened the SA then summoned me in.I stayed up so no biggie,but, the SA was no longer an available resource.Warriors can use aggro weapons assisting with care np,though often imo they'd be better off using dps setups.<br />
<br />
I was sa a long time and never had a problem snapping aggro with ae taunt/fort &amp; Furious and swapping weapons.Was tough before ae taunt in ntov and stuff hehe. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tuddar Raddut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For big bad mobs, only MT has aggro weapons out. Everyone else has their dps gear on. If MT goes down, next tank AE taunts, hits furious or fortitude depending on the situation, hits Incite, and uses that time to switch out weapons.<br />
<br />
For trash mobs, it's not really a big deal either way. Personally I like the OT's to use aggro weapons. I taunt it off and have a huge aggro lead built up on the rest of the raid, fast burndown. If I don't taunt it off, OT maintains aggro and rest of raid still burns it down. Also, dps setups can be a pain on long OT's if you are dealing with gating mobs.  If the mobs aren't gaters, then it's really no big deal either way.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The time I'm most careful with this is when non-guild friends invite me to some raid with their guild. My guess is that if you are a guest and you gank the MT's aggro, heh, you'll have a lot folks doing /guild WTF who invited that asshole?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hardway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When he's not MT, Carfard has this combo : Freshgrind + 150 DD aug / Dedgerex's Flintforged Cudgel + 125 DD aug.<br />
<br />
Is it a suitable combo knowing the MT has Blade of Carnage + anger3 / Cord Hilted Spike Driver + anger2 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It should work.However,what matters is...does he draw inappropiate aggro?It's his job not to do this.Delaying assist ,positioning and attacking with care will help,but, if he can't control his aggro on a boss then he should bag em for lower aggro weaps.Aggro is a team sport. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My standard tank setup is BoC - A3'd // SotBS - A2'd  <br />
<br />
I have weapon affinity 2, which keeps me comfortably ahead of MOST Knights and their snap aggro // stun garbage.  On raids where I was not a MT, and I was seriously concerned about stealing aggro off a Marshall with WA5 DW'n BoC and a BF or something, I use a GSoT ( I can't ever get a GS4W !! ) or even the 2hs Epic blade.  The epic proc is almost always resisted, as is the GSoT's stun proc, and generates considerably less aggro than the MT, I have found.  I will say that even with a Marshall with WA5 and a BoW - A3'd, I can still snap aggro him with my DW setup.  'Course I usually go down in a flurry of mews and hisses, and flying fur since the MA is gettin the heals and not I.  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You're not really ahead of the knights in snap aggro they are allowing that to happen.Anyone can get aggro at the beginning of a fight it is luck,positioning and speed of engagement...er never mind taunt ...Your job in some situations is not to get aggro.Weapons with hate procs have to be used with common sense.If you're going down like that for no reason then you've screwed up.Yer aggro penis not withsatnding hehe. :) <br />
<br />
Sounds like you should get a nice slow dps'r and engage slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am warrior class lead for my guild and I let my guys all watch thier own agro. I have not had any major problems so far. Plus when that 3-4 mobs come in cause someone saw thier monk groupmate 1/2 health and heals em I like all wars able to pull consistent agro quick. I absolutly love the cycle target option sony added and find it increadibly helpful, compared to finding that 1 mob stacked double teaming some poor person. We as a guild have had horrid luck in agro wep drops so far though 1 BF in lost count of cursed kills, 4 BoC in like 40 kills, 0 BoW in 5 or 6 kills lost track, 0 SEWS in 2 rings(wtb influence on other officers to do ring more often as well as RZtW) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Don't over think this. If you can use your agro weapons without turning the mob, use them. If you can't or think you might turn the mob, use something else. Once you get a good feel for your weapons and the agro your other tanks make, you should be able to keep your agro weapons equiped. AET doesn't always work and more often than not incite won't be enough to get agro is AET fails. The longer it takes you to take over agro in case of MT death, the more DPS/healers you are going to lose in the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">AE taunt doesn't always work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">AE taunt doesn't always work?<br />
Nope.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think I've ever gotton an AEtaunt on quarm, but his box is pretty large.<br />
<br />
I know I've tried to AEtaunt AoW, and it's not worked, but his hitbox is also large.<br />
<br />
You can't always depend on Aetaunt, and I've seen cases of where it has actually given &quot;you have failed to taunt your target&quot;, although it hasn't happened to me personally.<br />
It's failed for me when I've needed it a lot  it seems and it's nice to not be so low on the agro list that you can't get it with a few swings.<br />
<br />
I usually use a sews for DPS. It has decent agro, so that I'm not on the bottom of the list, nor at the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">MMM..I've heard of axis issues but I sa'd for 6 months and never had a problem picking up aggro with ae taunt.I still use it at times and always works for me given proper range and no immediate stacked aggro.Be interesting on Quarmm.Through Luclin and pop I have never had ae taunt fail in my memory,although, I've ma'd since pre- elemental and use it to recover aggro mostly.</div></div><hr />
