<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some parses might be useful to determine how good this AA is.  Just taking some rough educated guesses, but keeping in mind that ripostes as a percentage of the total damage I take against a mob vary widely depending on how much the mob is and can be slowed, it looks like a good skill...<br />
<br />
If my offhand swings account for 40% of my total swings and my riposte damage taken when dual wielding accounts for 20% of the total damage that I take from a mob (a not unreasonable number, I don't think), then 0.40 * 0.20 = 8%.  So 8% of the damage i'm taking would be coming from offhand ripostes.  Slippery Attacks 5 apparently eliminates all offhand riposte damage.<br />
<br />
If ripostes are only 10% of total damage taken, then I still save 4% with slippery attacks 5, but I think ripostes are more than that for me.  I may have to parse and take a closer look.  Let me know if anyone else has a good parse already showing ripostes against you as a percentage of total attacks on you.  Since I dual wield a 1hs and 1hb, it will be easy to check what percent of my swings are my offhand.<br />
<br />
Of course if you have a great 2 hander and don't need to dual wield for consistent aggro generation, you won't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where did you get the 10% number?  Seems high to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Corpsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thought it varied greatly on the mob you are fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless it's a mob with a special riposte damage table, riposte damage is always the same % of the total damage because pretty much everything hits at the same speed and riposetes at the same frequency, so in essence riposte is just the same as if a mob has an extra round every so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Corpsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh..well I guess those rumors about GoD mobs having a higher riposte rate are just rumors.  Don't know because I never did any parses and haven't seen any posted here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Little parse of ripostes prob not very accurate.<br />
<br />
In bot for 61 mobs then Draniks causeway for 40 mobs with me lvl 66 warrior mediocre gear no offensive aas, average xp group with shammy slow.<br />
<br />
Mob hits: 1757<br />
Mob misses: 1093<br />
<br />
Ripostes hits: 246<br />
Riposte % of total (hits + misses): 8.6316%<br />
<br />
Offhand riposte %: 44.84127%<br />
% of total damage taken by offhand ripostes: 3.87052%<br />
% of total damage reduced per rank: 0.77410%<br />
<br />
This is measuring the % of total hits which were ripostes, I think this is the same as % of the total damage taken by ripostes? correct me if Im wrong.<br />
<br />
so basically in my average xp group around 8.6% of total damage is from ripostes, with 3.9% from offhand ripostes. So with slippery atks maxed i would get a reduction in damage taken by just under 4%.<br />
<br />
damage from ripostes would be less % with a lesser slower of course as a higher % of total damage will be from mob normal hits.<br />
<br />
again just a quick parse for me dunno how it would be different in harder zones / harder mobs or with flurry aas etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">grr... I keep forgetting to check my parses.  I have them, I just need to look at them.  <br />
<br />
What weapons you're using are important information, Fel.  AA including ambidexterity, flurry, and ferocity would also make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keep in mind that the delay of your offhander effects these numbers.  I'm not sure how much but it could be significant.  Ambidexterity also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Unless it's a mob with a special riposte damage table, riposte damage is always the same % of the total damage because pretty much everything hits at the same speed and riposetes at the same frequency, so in essence riposte is just the same as if a mob has an extra round every so often.<br />
<br />
Oh, so riposte is the same frequency regardless of weapon delay sort of like procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, so riposte is the same frequency regardless of weapon delay sort of like procs?<br />
<br />
No.  Ripostes against you are based on your swings, not the mob's, so weapon delay does matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No.  Ripostes against you are based on your swings, not the mob's, so weapon delay does matter.<br />
<br />
Yes, that's what I thought but I think I interpreted what Phantron said wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, that's what I thought but I think I interpreted what Phantron said wrong.<br />
<br />
I think you interpreted it correctly, but he is mistaken.  Happens to the best of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yes sorry forgot to say I had 11 delay offhand (and mainhand) and no offensive aas.</div></div><hr />
