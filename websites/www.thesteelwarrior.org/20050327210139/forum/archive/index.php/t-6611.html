So far all i've come across is this guide, Plane of Innovation (http://www.speakeasy.org/~dudley/ctg/poi.html), but this doesn't go too terribly in depth regarding the fight itself.<br />
<br />
What kinda advice or stratagies do you folks have? Anything in particular we should be aware of thats isn't mentioned in there on the allakhazam link to Xanimech? Our curent raid force is about mid 50's average and we can get 3-4 full groups usuallly.<br />
<br />
Any help or info would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild farmed this for the CHSD and haste neck item for a while as its a very easy encounter and fun as well.  The encounter starts by walking Nitram (and keeping alive) to xanamech and then killing the dragon.<br />
<br />
We run this as a chaos raid -multiple tanks clearing the way with an ench wrangler that mez/mem blur's nitram along the way as we walk him towards Xana.  You will need a few items to hand to Nitram to start the event.  The only problem we run into enroute is occasionally leaving Nitram too far back and he runs into respawn, which is really not an issue.<br />
<br />
Once you get to Xana's loc, have the ench keep Nitram on ice while the raid finishes up buffing.  Then everyone gets in position leaving a path for Nitram to get to Xana.  You will need to have the dragon face away from Nitram if you want to keep Nitram alive for the factory flag.  So the MT will be opposite the door and uses incite/ae taunt to get the dragon facing where he wants it.  Get a slow on xana as soon as you can as it makes life easier.  Also be warned that nitram will summon Xana to him if he gets to far so don't be surprised when the dragon moves on you.  Lastly, if anyone aggro's Nitram during the final kill, he will not hand out factory flags.<br />
<br />
Xana has 2 ae's that are annoying.  An AE snare and dot.  One of them can and will interrupt heals so short heals like SR are much better.  We usually have a paly set to loh along with a DI in case the healers get interrupted before the slow gets landed.  We also have at least 2 druids MGB  SOTW and 1-2 clerics MGB EE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your guild may have a few problems at first, given your average level and will need to make adjustments to find a tactic that works for you.  Code started doing this with about 30 folks lvl 60-65 and now are doing it with about 14-18 lvl 65.  The good thing about this encounter is you can do it often as it just requires Nitram to be spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is the strat i used when i was doing this raid for my previous guild.<br />
<br />
tankline up is set up behind xanamech (before he's activated), rogues in front and other DPS on the sides as evenly as possible. pet classes place their pets under xanamech. the healing chain (or spam chain, whatever they use) set up on the left of the tanks, just out of range of the stun proc not too far from the wall. the debuff team moves into melee range. xanamech casts an AE snare, so if your debuff team is across the room and suddenly pull agro it's ganna take your tanks some time to walk AAAALLLL the way over there and reagain agro which will most likely kill the agro hi-jacker and everyone around him. once everyone is ready you release the gnome (i assume an enchanter is mezzing/bluring him). xanamech is activated and usually bombs his AE right away, tank spins him around (so the gnome doesnt get wasted by ripos) pets hammer away at him from underneth, debuff team gets to work, healing chain spams away, assist is called and hopefully everyone is evenly placed. you dont want him moving around too much since everyone is snared and there are no flat walls to pin him on. <br />
<br />
xanamech quads for 1400s max, and uses 3 AEs, an 800DD -300 fire resist, procs a 300DD  centered on the tank with a 1 second stun -200 magic resist (200 range, you want the healers far enough to avoid this) and uses an unresistable snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just a note on getting to him. this is a GREAT encounter to pratice offtanking and corridnating assists. usually what we did was have a monk run up ahead and pull mobs 2 or 3 at a time. offtanks moved a little ahead of the raid with a few healers and a slower or 2 while the raid assists the MT/MA as they move up to the adds. if you have any tanks not tanking a mob they should move up to catch one of the incoming mobs. using the chain pull method we almost never had to mez the gnome unless we got to a large room. make sure you get a good head start before activating the gnome. we usually cleared the path on the right down to the door before activating him. our typical raid force was around 40 people 60 to 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We never bothered with pulling, just kinda plowed our way along.  Xanamech is very easy once you get him down.  You can find his stats just about anywhere.  He is slowable, but it's not easy to do (Bard with MR debuff helps alot).  We never bothered with resists because of the modifiers on his AEs.<br />
<br />
One bit of advice from someone whos done this - don't use AE Taunt if the Gnome isn't mezzed or something.  I AE Taunted my first time and the nome went right after the clerics.  Dropped 2 of them before we could figure out what was happening.  We lost.  If you are doing him for Factory flags, definitely avoid AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Additional notes from experience:<br />
<br />
Put away the knockback weapons<br />
While its funny to see Xana do his own version of 'whirl till you hurl', it just plain sucks for maintaining aggro and keeping casters and healers out of his AE range. Not to mention Xana getting some ripostes in on Nitram.<br />
<br />
Do not use F8 to target<br />
Had a guildie caster that just simply didn't raid, or be online, very often. It was discovered after the fact, that he had been casting his nukes on Nitram during the battle, instead of Xana. This led to ...<br />
<br />
Do not /q out<br />
Guild killed dragon, but pally got aggro from Nitram. Pally /q'd out, got the LD tag, and became an NPC. Then he killed Nitram in short order. Very bad.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, make sure you've all got resist gear (FR and MR) and any bards you can get will help tremendously.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lastly, if anyone aggro's Nitram during the final kill, he will not hand out factory flags. <br />
<br />
Sure he will....If Nitram agros anyone during the final battle that person just needs to die....DO NOT....i repeat DO NOT try and mem blur or mez him during the fight with the dragon.  Then he will not give out flag.  This has happened many times to us and whoever got agro just waited for the dragon to die then he removed all his buffs and let Nitram kill him, or he can commit suicide to the dragon if he really isnt needed too much on the raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to have the gnome follow and not aggro the raid is to have a pally just chain stun and hold aggro and walk him along as the raid moves through and up to the trigger area.  Once ready, setup and memblur him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xano is a super fun and easy encounter!  To get to the gnome, we have a few tanks who pull as their mob dies.  Adds are locked down, or someone tanks them.  For this method, its good to have atleast one healer per group.  To better organize your peeps, just call out a number of tanks as the puller/assists, and go from there.  With 12 people, we can usually clear to Xano is less than 30 min (I think, something like that).  We have always had a gnome control enchanter.  It was their responsibility to mez, mem blur, etc the gnome as the raid cleared in front of it.  <br />
<br />
Xano is pretty easy, have melee circle him, call out when he's getting pushed alover the place, defenesive tank, yada yada yada.  Have healers coordinate a couple of MGB heals and no one &quot;should&quot; die.<br />
<br />
Good luck and phat lewtz =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I aggroed Nitram once with my Shambot, good part is I did it by slowing him and Shammy just stood there and tanked nitram through the fight. Was easy enough keeping Quiessence running and helping with spam heals on the MT. As soon as dragon died Nitram seemed to respawn as the flag giver and was non aggro to the shammy at that point.<br />
<br />
So far we have tried Xana 4 times and are 2 and 2. Scary part is we won the first attempt and only had 2 clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Few things missed:<br />
- Make sure person that spawned  Nitram is the first to hail him<br />
- Nitram has to open the door to the dragon room, so don't open for him<br />
<br />
This fight is all about MA keeping agro, getting slowed fast and good push.<br />
<br />
Clearing is fun, just get every plate tank pull a mob when theres is dead.  So should have 3-6 tanks clearing way.</div></div><hr />

Someone earlier In the post said it could be, in realitly it all depends n your tatics, the wall on the right is where we posioned all our ranged DPS out of teh AoE raing the wall in the left is where we had our heal chains to keep them close to the tanks<br />
<br />
These left and right walls are where you see them looking at xeno from the door, Tanks Always faceing the door all other melee dps standing infront of him blaa blaa blaa was stated earlier  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, you have to run in there and die a few times to really get a feel for how to do it, but once you get your basic tactics down, you can easily farm the crap out  of it =)</div></div><hr />

It's easy for some, but you won't be taking out this mob with 3-4 groups of average level mid 50s.  The best thing for a mid 50s guild to be doing is getting your levels.  Go run LDoN adventures.  If you just want some practice on multi-group raiding, start hitting some of the old velious stuff.  If you can't smack down the likes of vindi and velk easily, there's little point in attempting xanamech.</div></div><hr />

(I have all mitigation AA's)<br />
<br />
Also, the MA should NOT use AET because that will agro the gnome and cause issues with getting the flag (see earlier posts about gnome agro.)  <br />
<br />
To start off, I use Incite followed by Furious and it works fine for agro.  I wait until I get a couple procs before I call for assists, although the slowers can cast after 5 seconds (everyone else waits for the call.)<br />
<br />
To avoid push issues we always kill all pets unless they have pet hold.  BL and Shaman pets in particular are bad due to push.<br />
<br />
If push becomes too much of an issue, just walk him around in circles in the middle...stay away from the walls with all of the current dx9 issues. :p  <br />
<br />
Good luck!  (it's a fun fight)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">**This is my experience and is not a bible. Use it at your own risk**<br />
<br />
I have ran this a few times as my shammie.<br />
When you get out side the windmill. Do your prelim buff. Assign one tank as the main assist 1-2 more as alt assists and off tanks for the clearing. Enter the zone and have everyone asist the MT and just slaughter the path to the gnome. Clear around him and them move on.<br />
Have your Chanter and turn in person have a timmer. The respawn is 18 min if i remember correctly. Wait 10-12 min or untill your raid force gets just out of sight if they area high dps and slaughtering everything fast. Then start the gnome walking. If the gnome gets to close to the raid just have the chanter mez (40 sec one) for tunnel areas and the 90 sec one if they are in a big open area clearing out. Once memblur should work after each mez. <br />
Once you get to the opening to the finnal walk up to the gate keep clearing up to the gate and then inside the gate. Mez the gnome just before the finnal tunnel up and after everyone is rebuffed (if needed) then blur the gnome and let him go.<br />
<br />
Set up...<br />
The asigned tanks MT 2MT 3MT get behind the dragon. Clerics off to the right as your looking at the dragon with your back to the gate. Have them target the MT and get the proper distance from him. Pets under the bellie and have all your nukers off to the left as you look at the dragon and have them target a pet and use it for range. <br />
Here i have the Slower/tasher off to the side a little so if they draw argo they should not get anyone else  in the line of fire of the AE's.<br />
<br />
So if your looking at a clock. The gate is 6, the MT's are 12, the clerics area around 3-4, the nukers are around 8, and the Slower/Malo/Tash 'er are around 10-11 ish area.<br />
<br />
Perfect fight...<br />
When the gnome goes in a cleric hits HoT on the MT. The MT will argo the dragon. Spam heals go off on the MT at 50% (this depends on the HP of the tank) 98% the 2MT, 3MT attacks and the debuffers start debuffing around 95 %... Pets will be auto argo because of the AE's unless they are AA'd parked. At 90% the tanks light em up, at 85% the nukes start dropping. The nukers should know to space them out to not draw argo but if needed tell them one nuke every 5%,  Then at 30-40% ish burn him down.<br />
<br />
The clearing should take 30min to 1 hr depending on your DPs. The dragon should drop in under 1 min any longer then 1:30-2min and you run a high risk of wiping and the clerics going OOM.<br />
<br />
**EDIT**<br />
NO AE&quot;S SHOULD BE USED unless it is a heal or heal like action.<br />
**mages like to use their rain spells and that is a NO NO!!**<br />
<br />
**This is my experience and is not a bible. Use it at your own risk**</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would think so. Evasive is used in situations where the monster has an innate proc that is somewhat nasty. Since innate procs cannot fire on a miss, evasive can come out ahead in terms of damage avoided during the fight. I don't believe that Xanamech has any such procs, so I would load up defensive or stonewall, depending on how your placement is.</div></div><hr />

Ok, excellent link thanks for that, but is it based on the same understanding as this post (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=13) ?<br />

The steelwarriors post is excellent, but hasn't been updated for a while to include mobs we're either doing now or thinking about (the va`dyn, xanamech, etc.).  The post you provided does include them, but I just wanted to see if you knew if the information had been worked out using the same theory?</div></div><hr />

yes I know. Actually there is a second thread here (but not in the library) that wanted to develop further the first thread on the library, this link comes from there. Unfortunatly it hasn't been update since its beginning so there is no EP+/GoD/OoW mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No problem, we'll learn.<br />

But checking through the logs, I see Xanamech feels annulled - 5 times.<br />
<br />
Does he self-Annul or as I fear, was someone in there with us casting Annul magic on him (or procing it)?</div></div><hr />
