<br />
Anyways, the reason I made this post is because I was wondering if he was actually slowable or not.  We were completely boggled whether or not the slow would haste him like it did originally.  So, well, we killed him unslowed. :)<br />
<br />
My question is, is he legitimately slowable now?  If he is, I'm sure it ain't by much (10% maybe?).<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, spoil mah!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope if my Warrior gets high enough I can see Solusek. He just looks so cool.<br />
<br />
I plan on making a guild when this Warrior is around level 50. So who knows eh? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
His minimum hit is just over 1k, and his maximum hit is just under 2k.  I think 1064/1940. Those numbers are probably a little off though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's slowable but he might as well not be.  He slow down something like 5% at most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Fennin never hit me over 2000 before the 5% mitigation addition.<br />
<br />
Max hit 1914<br />
Min hit 942<br />
<br />
max hit might be true now, haven't tanked him since the mitigation addition, but your low hit there is with Bulwark of Vie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious, how do you take him down? Dosn't he AE mean stuff? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lots and lots of arrows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 high HP tank and lots of arrows lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, so thats what they were doing in the Arete video of that raid? I thought it was kinda weird. They had one tank and shiz load of arrows.<br />
<br />
But why? Does he have some mean DS or AE that would kill everyone thats close? Or is it that your guild wants to be a smart ass and show off? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He has an AE rampage. That'll pretty much wipe out all the melees in a short time full out meleeing him. Some people &quot;joust&quot; him (running in and out of range meleeing), some people probably do just straight melee him and use AE heals to keep the melees alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">do mass arrows cause push? i know every time i've done FR and sol ro, they start out away from any walls but end up there very fast. i was never sure if it was from arrows, nukes, or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arrows have very minor push, but it does add up. Cleric nukes have push, some mage nukes have push... Frankly, if all nukers with push face towards the arrow shooters, the push should equalize fairly well. Most casters don't think of it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are going to be trying him out soonish, and if it is a ranged fight anyone happen to know what spells he is resitant to?  Knight Archery skill = crap so supplement that dmg w/ my spears and lifetaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically...<br />
<br />
You send your biggest, baddest tank out there on Fennin. I assume you wouldn't want to corner him so you can move out of rampage when he goes nuts. So just run in, run back out, back in, out again? And just do this over and over?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile all the other Warriors shoot off bows? And I will assume &quot;if&quot; your tank dies you quickly send in a new one? Like a tank rotation?<br />
<br />
I'm no raider, and I've never fought a God before... Hell the biggest thing I've ever fought was Trak. I'm just trying to get my strategic thinking up some. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The MT doesn't get hit by the rampage. He stays tanking the whole time. You don't corner him if you're using range attacks, because the arrows won't hit due to the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forgive me here, like I said I have no experiance on this. :)<br />
<br />
Ah yeah. Thats right, same with dueling on a ranger. Back into the wall and the arrows wont hit you.<br />
<br />
So how does the MT not get hit by it? I know I sound like a newbie, I am to the raiding scene. But my neighbor does raid some of the planes. And the guild leader, &quot;a bard,&quot; takes the rampage. How is that done?<br />
<br />
I'm just a very curious guy is all. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You really don't need to do this fight ranged. If you have a guild full of people who can't count/follow orders or just love the Fennin encounter so much you want to make it last even longer, then by all means, do it at range, but if you want the big goofball dead fast, then melee him down and move oor of AE when needed. It's a timed AE with a cast time- if you can't avoid it then I commend you on making it to the elemental planes with such limitations :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sevius</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should study how rampages work. From what I understand they hit everything within range. But does anything happen while he rampages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">then melee him down and move oor of AE when needed <br />
<br />
why bother moving.  his ae works out to 4k / minute damage which is &lt; using 1 cleric + druid ae heals / minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seveirn</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never used Ranged Vs fennin Ro, Always full out melee, almost never get hit by AE rampage, Everyone move's out when AE's due, Just takes some patience and Attention to command</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wargo</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed.. all of our ranged fights vs Fennin were wipes. Second time we attempted the script we just used max melee range and it worked like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fennin's rampage isn't AE, it hits 6 people (maybe more, but I've seen at least 6 die to it each time).  Given the gear you can expect while fighting him it's almost guaranteed death for any nontanks that got hit by rampage and even tanks could get dropped by a rampage.  <br />
<br />
You can avoid the AE or not, it's to you.  There's really not much you'll lose from meleeing him.  At worst all your melee gets splat but if they got even some melee time at all it's got to be more DPS than they'd have done from range.  At the gear level you're expected to fight him, melees simply die too fast so that the chance of accidentally moving FR is quite slim (you got to be alive to move a mob!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need a big bad tank either.  I tanked him with 9500 hp and no raex.  we fight him ranged however since following orders is hard (either that or reading)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I skimmed the topic but couldn't find any information about how long you have to complete the event after you kill the trigger to start it. <br />
<br />
Can someone tell me how long? 4 hours? 8 hours? 12 hours? # hours?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />
