Recently the game has changed quite a bit for me.  Due to some nastyness, I had to remove myself from my guild. :(  Currently I pretty much just EXP/quest with some RL friends.  Since I am pretty much gonna stay a EXP/group tank, I would appreciate any advice on gear upgrades that i should consider and that I can get with 1 group.  <br />
<br />
My usual group consists of:<br />
59 Paladin,<br />
59 Druid,<br />
58 Ranger,<br />
<br />
Sometimes we can add 1 or 2 others around our level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
After that...umm, upgrades are kind of going to be more along the purchased line than mobs you'd usually be fighting at your level. Since you got some buds to hunt with; well; umm, ...only thing i can think of is a nice regen item to save on some of your friend's mana pools..Fungi Tunic may be a viable purchase if you can get the plat...<br />
I'd start doing some legwork on finding ( or, hell, maybe even form ) a guild depending on how much time you want to invest in the game...at your level now on up you can do a lot with not a total abundance of people ( like Hussar's guild who are relatively small in terms of size but their accomplishments really are a testament to their dedication as a unit and to each other )</div></div><hr />
