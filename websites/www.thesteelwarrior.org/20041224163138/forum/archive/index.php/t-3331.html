<br />
I just want to say again what a great site this is!!<br />
<br />
I have a somewhat silly question and would greatly appreciate any help you can offer.<br />
<br />
At level 35 I put some points into the Disarm Skill (took me to about 50 I believe) So being the good warrior that I want to become I made a hot key for Disarm along with Taunt.  I figured this was a good way to max out the skill quick.  Needless to say I didn't improve, not even one point.<br />
<br />
So, I made a hot key for just disarm.  Still Nada.  I am now level 40 and haven't improved any.  <br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong??<br />
Do I have to fight an opponent with a weapon to improve the Disarm skill??<br />
<br />
Again thanks in advance for the help.<br />

Hope that helps.<br />

I think, not certain, but you can give green mobs weapons and then disarm it from them, kill them and then do it to the next. I used to sit outside Guk and give the goards rusty weapons and then take my weapons out of my hands so I could just sit there and disarm while not doing very much damage.<br />
<br />
I think those frogs were green but not sure. I know I did get some skill ups just standing there disarming while they tried to hit me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to point out something.  You can no longer give mobs weapons to allow you to disarm them.  That came about when they changed it so mobs give you back something unless it's for a quest from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of old world guards can be at least decent to hunt for experience anywhere from late 20s to early 50s (depending on faction concerns and who you group with).<br />
<br />
They also usually all have weapons, so you can just gain a level or two guard killing and max out the disarm skill at the same time. No need to bother with greenies just to skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To bad the disarm skill is fairly useless.  Every few months you might disarm a quadding mob's offhand weapon, but other than that it doesn't do too much.  That said I have it hotkeyed and always use it just in case it adds to agro :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's useful in PvP, but not much in PvE.  As for aggro.  It gives aggro when you first use it on a mob, but zero aggro after that.  Both Varaho and I did tests to prove that.  So you can free up that hotkey spot =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walkka</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At lvl 40 the Sarnak Bersekers are still blue and easy to kill,<br />
they all have a war braid, you can practice disarm on them.<br />
<br />
Other benefit is that if you collect the war braids you can build your OT faction too, to eventually get the OT gate hammer. <br />
Well at least if you are non kos to start with, otherwise you'll be better off charming the quest npc etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, disarm has proved to be pretty useless. Just keep it around and mash it everytime it refreshes when fighting mobs with weapons. There are some mobs, and it's been so long I completely forget which, who have given me skill ups in disarm when they were not weilding a weapon, but had it on their loot table. /boggle<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't pay too much attention to it. Just work it whenever the beasties are armed. Mine didn't max out until the high 50's, and since then it's been off of the keybank and hasn't been used.<br />
<br />
Of course, you could probably never train it and be fine...but that would make me feel icky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember hunting for my Block of Permafrost in Perma in my early 50s. Fighting one giant, I got a disarm off and in a moment of stupid pride, I /ooc'ed it. Turned out there was a more experienced warrior in the zone who replied, &quot;Congrats, now it hits faster.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember not using disarm anymore in my 20s. Have not missed it and have not needed it. Actually, somethings I did disarm hit harder once I disarmed them. Cant disarm magic weapons only non magic. I say save the spot and the wasted time and just dont use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HeartView</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When disarm actually works, what happens to the weapon?  Do you get it?  Does it fall to the ground?  Does it just pop into the inventory of the critter?  Very curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a successful disarm, the weapon appears at the feet of the mob. The graphic you see is a little bag rather than the weapon in question as it would be if you dropped it.<br />
<br />
The master-looter in my regular group was a ranger, and she used to yell at me for that because she was maxing out Forage...and leaving tons of little bags of her own all over the ground.</div></div><hr />

thought Disarm became available at level 36 or so? :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InarianSZ</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't see as disarm is very useful in pve but i max'd it out of boredom and it's godly in pvp.  At 57 i was disarming L65s who wouldn't realize their weapon was on thier cursor for a good 30 seconds or so.  Pretty funny watching a L65 ranger slap you with thier bare hands without even realizing why they're getting their ass kicked by a green warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best place IMO to level up disarm is in LDoN. Not enough mobs in PoP wield weapons to really get the skill up so mine was always low. But I think now in LDoN I have went from about 50 to 150ish on those mobs. Doesn't work alot but it still disarms the mob from time to time. LDoN&gt; all for disarming skills. Usually get 2-3 skill points in disarm per fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ill second that. in all the tie i was in pop i dont think i ever saw a disarm skill up cos no one seems to carry weps there. but lol ldon is disarm heaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maleron</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Morning all,<br />
You might also watch your spam the range on disarm is closer then kick so you may just be out of range for successfull attempt. I would also point out that if you cant get it raised don't worry much, it's not very usefull imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it incase it does give aggro. I think it does because I've had mobs turn back to me when I've hit it when they ignored my most recent tuant.<br />
<br />
Leveling up tho using it on armed mobs can be bad, I have had mob dps go up when they lost their weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disarm raises on green mobs, I went to blackburrow at 51 and disarmed gnolls til max skill, once they drop the sword cpl swipes dead move on to next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BAH ok so you get it at 35, so long ago who knows, seemed early on I stopped using it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got most of my disarm points fighting in old Chardok, where lots of mobs had weapons. So many mobs now are unarmed it's probably hard to train up in the normal course of exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I worked mine up in CC in my early 40s.  Alot of mobs carry the velium weapons, and the miners carry picks.  Plus, when you get done disarming them you get to pick up a sword that's actually worth selling, instead of rusty :)</div></div><hr />
