<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinro</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, i'm new, this is my introduction thread, say hi, sup, @#%$ you, whatever's on your mind.  <br />
<br />
I just came back to EQ after 8 months or so away, lotta stuffed changed.. i've never had a warrior before, and I started a beastlord when I got back 2 weeks ago. Leveled him to 40, farmed a good bit of cash, and got bored as hell. <br />
<br />
I was doing a LDoN adventure with a badass ogre warrior as our tank, and I started talking to him. He had a 65 wiz as a main, and said after awhile he just got sick and tired of dealing with mana and being so frail and weak, and now &quot;I just want to bash stuff&quot; he said. Couple hours later it hit me how bored I am with my beastlord (laziest class bar none, seriously) and now I just want to bash @#%$. So i'm selling all my gear on my beastlord, and will just use him to continue what i've been doing, farm spider silk for easy cash, like 1.5k per hour. <br />
<br />
I'm rolling up a iksar warrior (there's like 6 on my server, TOTAL) and i'll be lurking around here a bit looking for info and asking Qs every now and then. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
**I copied and pasted this from the old boards after I learned there were new ones.. you guys should remove the old boards or just let the link to them lead to the new ones or something, it's confusing as hell**</div></div><hr />

<br />
we can't remove the old boards or redirect to here...that's partly why this board exists in the first place. I know it's confusing but there's not much we can do 'sides bumping the link every couple weeks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm an older Iksar myself, and I think one of about 4 Iksar Overlords who regulary play on my server.<br />
<br />
The good news, is Iksar are much better off at low levels now. You can, for example, pick up a set of Trooper Scale Armor easy. If this armor doesn't have a big selling base in your server (Likely not, Iksar warriors aren't big) then you can do the quests very easy with your beastlord. Trooper Scale is what we Iksar have instead of Crafted.<br />
<br />
You might also look into some of the newer armor sets- Crusty, I beleive, took over for Trooper/Crafted in many cases, and that should be availible in the Bazaar easily.<br />
<br />
Iksar originally had a &quot;No Plate Armor&quot; rule. This rule was forgotten early in Velious, so any modern drop/quested armor you will have no problems with. The only modern downside, IMO, is Cultural- Iksar Cultural Armor seems to be Chain Armor designed for Shamans, with lots of wisdom and mana, and not much AC, HP, and sta. This is called Fearsome Skyiron. The only other minus to this rule is that we can't use Cobalt or Indicarne, which means no unlimited charge right click invise.<br />
<br />
OTOH, when you do wear the same armor as another race, for example Champions gear quested from Thurgadin, you will have more AC then any other race wearing the same equipment. This can be a slight advantage. Our Planer Armor (Legionerre Scale Armor) from Plane of Hate, for example, has less AC, but better stats and resists then the Softskins have. When you combine that with our AC bonus, you actually end up with a better armor set- same total AC, and more resists/stats. And again, when you move up to Velious Quested Armors or further, Iksar will have a higher AC then any other race with the same armor. Right now, and for the foreseeable furture, Iksar Warriors would have the highest possible AC in game.<br />
<br />
Another factor to not forget is our regen. Much like AC, this isn't a game-breaking factor, but it IS a factor. Pre PoP, I could solo better in Velks and Sebilis the most warriors, for example.<br />
<br />
A third factor, which is FAR more significant then the other two, is that Iksar have tails. In fact, Prior to SoL, we were the ONLY race to have tails. You might not think this is big, but trust me, when trying to score red hot cyber, the tail is VERY important. Pre Vah Shir, I've parsed this out as about a +75% to cyber, especially if you can roleplay using your tail. It's probably been nerfed down to a +50% since we have to share it with Vah Shir now.<br />
<br />
No other race, IMO, has the same amount of advantages as we do. Yes, Trolls have the same regen. Yes, Ogres have the Frontal Stun Immunity, which is arguebly the same or better then our racial bonuses, and yes, Vah Shir have about the same Cyber Bonuses... but no other race has AC, Regen, AND a Tail.<br />

EDIT- Added Indicarne and Cobalt disadvantage</div></div><hr />

The constant song-twisting is really annoying now.  Anyway,  I was considering starting a Dark Elf Warrior on Stromm.  Anyone have any hints on DEs?  The starting stats are pretty poor I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monotonous</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a level 60 DE warrior on Xegony. I originally picked DE because the Ogre model was just so bad (pre-luclin). If your in a big gulid and get raid buffs all the time, then the stat difference won't really matter. But if you just hang out with a couple friends, pick-up groups and solo then you will have an easier time as an Ogre.<br />
<br />
What ever you do, don't go agnostic. I picked agnostic back in the days before character religion had any use. <br />
<br />
Ogre armor cultural armor is better, thier stats are better, and no stun from the front. These all really make a difference if your not in a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteelRain</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The guild I was in disbanded a long time ago.  I was mainly interested in playing pickup groups and some soloing.  Guess I should get Luclin as the shear ugliness of Ogres was what  turned me off on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">don't play an ogre if you don't want to, and don't feel railroaded into picking rallos as a deity if you don't want to.  Between cultural (if you do end up worshipping rallos) and ornate, anyone can get decent stats and hp easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SteelRain</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I'll play a DE at least long enough to do the newbie armor quest then see how I like it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinro</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After selling all my beastlord's gear and using all my farmed cash, I went on a buying spree and completely outfitted myself. Just finished magelo, it's in my sig and under my name to the left. Still looking to get a good deal on some Dragonleg Breeches or something like that, the Ry`gorr is temporary. After that i'll work on a better haste item and better earrings.</div></div><hr />
