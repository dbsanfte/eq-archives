<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I certainly never agreed with the specifics of the changes released thus far, there is no question in my mind that they address needed improvements and make playing a Warrior more interesting and require more skill.<br />
<br />
Yes, unfortunately as with all non-trivial changes there have been some glitches and even server instabilities. But I was quite surprised with how well it all hangs together and solves the problems without being unbalancing.<br />
<br />
In short -<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking time out of your new development efforts and delivering these well-thought out changes very quickly after you committed to doing them.<br />
<br />
I started this thread in hopes that those who agree with it's sentiments will add their messages of appreciation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Many thanks from the non-uber crowd here...it's made the imbalance between knights and warriors much smaller and added some fun things for me to do (like actually use something other than defensive and evasive!  :D )<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing what happens in round 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really appreciate the new changes, it has made playing a warrior fun again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, thank you, although all is not perfect, in general we are much better off than before.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I knew there must be some reason to get drunk today... This must be it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Agree 100 %.  This last week since the change has been a blast.  The system isn't perfect, but it is good.  Thank you SoE for working on making the game better, and for extablishing more communication with us warriors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Boofus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The changes have made playing my warrior again what it should be, fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My sentiments mirror what most have already said.  I just want to add additional thanks for taking ALL warriors into consideration, and not just those who are 65 and in hardcore raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
There is certainly more work to be done, but so far I'm impressed with our new skills &amp; revamped disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes good point Gyzz.  Im very happy they scaled the Provoke line along the levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">arf arf<br />
<br />
Dam* good point ... one of the issues raised here often was that any aggro fix warriors got shouldn't be locked to high level drops, AA farms, or the like.  Either the warriors here are psychic, or the folks at SOE were paying attention.  I find both of these thoughts shocking :p.</div></div><hr />
