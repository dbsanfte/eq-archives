<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noomsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild can easily take down AOW and are starting to move on from velious, problem is Ssra is camped to hell on my server. We have farmed ntov, have tons of primal, and have beaten every thing we have tried so far. Burrower, THO, IV, Shei, and in PoP Grummus, Xanamech, and Aerin Dar. So I am curious if Ssra is overcamped and we go ahead and work on PoP, what would be a good place to start?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zierain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PoP is linear... so.. pretty much what you have access to which will give you access to more.. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, the logical progression would be<br />
<br />
grummus - &gt; High priest ring in CoD - &gt; bertoxx - &gt; saryrn<br />
<br />
AD - &gt; HoH trials - &gt; Mithaniel Marr<br />
<br />
PoN hedge quest - &gt; Terris Thule - &gt; saryrn<br />
<br />
xanamech - &gt; behemoth - &gt; vallon - &gt; tallon - &gt; rallos<br />
<br />
killing all the above gives access to sol ro, killing rallos gives access to sol ros tower.<br />
<br />
PoS minis - &gt; key quest - &gt; agnarr(last priority for sure)<br />
<br />
gives access to pow, poa, poe if you killed all the other junk<br />
<br />
heres 2 guides<br />

<br />

access to plane of tactics is really nice, best tier 3 zone by far, i would make behemoth first priority. 2 hoh trials are easy, 3rd trial is mean tho, if you can beat the dragon trial, MM wont be too bad. cod ring isnt bad, starts to get nasty with the bertoxx ring. the hedge quest is really easy too, 18 flags per trip and quick access to terris thule. if SSRA is crowded, ya there is plenty to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are you gonna be posting alot with that sig?  I don't like to see something like that more than once a day :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nevian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmmm, we have only marginally done Ssra (everything but emp and not much of the others) and no VT, and we are in Sol Ro's tower.  Its doable, but it does take some searious effort getting everyone flagged to progress.  start with terris/grummis till ya got em down, and watch for beheamoth, PoTactics is a great zone and worth the effort.  Alot of PoP fights are more different than hard, they take some figuring out.  Start whackin stuff and keep goin till ya hit a wall hehe.  I personally like PoP better than luclin cus when we stepped into the tower of sol ro it really felt like we had actually accomplished something.</div></div><hr />
