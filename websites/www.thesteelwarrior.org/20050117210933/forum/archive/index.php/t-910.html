<br />
2h less ripposts than DW, better dmg, less dmg from ds.<br />
<br />
The furter you get in pop the less you want to use DW, sure there are great aggro 1h weapons, but that doesnt help if you die cuz of ripposts, so 2h is atm the best way to go by far. But where does this leave 1h weapons then? what is the point with 1h weaps, when even medium and old expansions 2h outdmg som of the best 1hs? This isnt just for warriors, but for the others melee also, a ranger will do quite more dmg with 2h than 1h, so again what is the point with 1h?<br />
<br />
As an example i tested dps with my best 1h dps weaps (some of the best ones around) shown in mag here, vs Darwols cleaver, a medium dmg 2h not specially hard to get from bert script dmg 43 del 35 125 dd. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=405263<br />
<br />
The medium 2h outdmg em with around 1600 atk, and thats a medium 2h weap, only 7 more dmg than delay. <br />
<br />
Atm 1h seem kinda obsolete, atleast in higher tiers and Ep, there are absolutely no point in using them atm vs a medium or better 2h other than nostalgic reasons.<br />
<br />
It would be far more logical if 1h did more dmg than 2h, but you had the risk of taking more ripposts dmg from ds , and 2h you tanked better, but did less dps.</div></div><hr />

Your job is to keep the mob mad at you, which I am sure you know but the damage difference shouldn't matter that much. I have Emp Ssra 2hs which does more damage than DESB/BoC but the agro difference is huge. I can hold agro with the 2hander but I have work more for it and in some cases where you have 5 other warriors around you procing EB you need more than dps to keep it on you.<br />
<br />
So from DPS perspective sure 2hs is better but when I need to hold agro without worry of someone taking it I will continue to use 1h weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess the game's evolution has brought 2Hers into the big picture as more feasible to use...but for much of the progress from 1 to 65 your 1Hers are a more valid choice; and using the disciplines available it makes doing our job a bit easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shiks right. no one would dispute that 2handers have the advantage in dps output - but for me id rather maintain good aggro than put out lot of dps and if that means 1handers then thats what im happy to go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would disagree that 1h weapons are still better for agro. They are better in some cases, but only because the good 2h weapons are out of reach. I see the evolution of a warriors weapons currently as 4 stages:<br />
<br />
Stage 1<br />
Dual Wield Frosty + another inexpensive weapon - for most warriors, Frostbringer is the first real agro weapon they get. This is a great weapon and serves its purpose very well unril you can move up to the next level.<br />
<br />
Stage 2<br />
2hb Greatstaff of Thunder - This is one of 3 weapons that has killed DW. Unless your guild is capable of getting you dual EB weapons then this is THE weapon to have for agro. Not only is it better agro than all but the very high end 1h weapons.<br />
<br />
Stage 3<br />
2x Enraging Blow - Once your guild is capable of getting you dual EB weapons, then you can reliably hold agro better than a GSoT. In most cases, you are sacrificing DPS for better agro because you can do better DPS with a decent 2h over very good 1h combos.<br />
<br />
Stage 4<br />
Blade of War - This is the other weapon that has killed DW. Once a warrior gets a BoW, the have no reason to dual weild again. There may be some arguement for using 1h + shield on some mobs that hit particularly hard, but that becomes a moot point as you gear up in the elemental planes and eventually get to the point where the extra AC is not needed. In the majority of cases though, the BoW is superior to DW for agro and DPS.<br />
<br />
We may see the emergence of a 5th stage with weapons that come out of the Plane of Time, but at this stage in the game, it's pretty hard to beat the BoW for agro or DPS with a DW set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah! I forgot to include the new mini-BoW that the new Inny drops. I have not gotten around to killing Inny so I am not sure of his difficulty. Assuming that a a guild capable of getting EB weapons can also kill Inny then Stage 3 of my little theory is in danger of being replaced. If it takes a little higher level guild to beat Inny, then I would put this weapon in to Stage 3.5 because it is certainly better than 1h EB weapons, but not up as good as a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah; it's all about progression..basically you can even cut that list down to 2 grades...Pre-EB and Post-EB.<br />
<br />
Pre-EB the best bet is taking the most amount of opportunities ( ala DW/DA ) to ensure your chance to proc is at it's highest point  and your DPS is at that number as well...than Post-EB..well; once you get EB you just need to try to apply it to the biggest baddest piece of weaponry you can get.<br />
<br />
Granted; you can still swap EB out for other proc-aggro type spells ( rune, who knows in PoT ) ... but for arguement's sake and availability across all servers and guilds EB pretty much is the standard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at the start dw is one of the thing knights gave up to get spells. back when a 25/50 was the best pre poh/f wepon you could get the choice was easy. in poh/f the 2h hammer forget who off. was just near velious lvl 2hander. but it was to powerfull and removed like many other poh/f wepons. at the top end 2h has always been the way to go. its nothing new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until level 60, Dual Wield remains a viable choice for DPS too.<br />
<br />
Triple attack, and the higher damage bonuses for 2handers helps at 60. Pre-60, though, it's a wash when comparing comprable 1handers to 2handers.<br />
<br />
It's like all the little level 40something monks I see out there running around with and imbued fighter's staff and keeping a goranga spiked club and a stave of shielding in the bag, when the dual wield setup is superior at that level of the game.<br />
<br />
Level 55 is the first time 2handers really start to get good.<br />
<br />
Before then, eh, remember, dual wielding is some good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know warriors are about aggro ofc, but if you die, aggro aint worht a shit. Yard trash in pofire almoust killed me several times with DW, i was forced to use 2h, then it went lots better. The best tank weapons out there are however 2h , but if you compare really good 1hs vs a medium 2h, the medium 2h would get more aggro, and do more dmg. Again the thing is this isnt just for warriors, other melees 2h is the best aggro, then what is the point with 1hs , specially those without aggro procs. Their dps is worse than way  easier to attend 2hs and so is the aggro. <br />
<br />
If 1h is to be a viable choice then it cant be worse than 2h in all cases (other than the heavy aggro procs on some).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aamean</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that my 2hander (Twisted steel bastard sword, like a buffed up windblade) holds aggro MUCH better than my dual wield combo (Ornate sword of the general and long sword of freedom). I had an easier time holding aggro when my 2hs skill was at 60 and using the TSBS than with my 1hs maxed and dual wielding the swords above. Maybe a frosty or some procing weapon would help that, but frankly, the 2hs adds more ac, does more damage, holds aggro more reliably (frosty=procy), and the frosty costs money.</div></div><hr />
