<br />
 So i was thinking as i sat LFG for bout 2 hours over the course of the day , wouldnt it be cool if i could just walk to the nearest town and summon a follower. For balance purposes the follower would be about equivilent to the pet that SK's get at 64 or 65 , i forget, roughly 50dps / 2000hps . The follower would help the warriors ability to solo a little bit if hes careful . Any aggro the follower generated would simply be added to the masters , since he is under his direct guidance. Control of the follower would be the same as other pets, with one difference , the next time the warrior attracts a follower , it will be the same guy. Since it is always the same guy (and somene only you can get) , he would have the same items that you gave him before , this would allow those that work harder , to better equip there follower. Imagine all the no drop stuff that you have sitting in bank going onto your follower ;).<br />
<br />
 Overall i think the follower would help shore up alot of the warriors shortcomeing , without being unbalanceing (if the SK pet @ 65 % haste self buffed is cool then this one should be too).<br />
It would allow the warrior to solo , add some dps and aggro in raid / exp situations , but not overly much.<br />
<br />
Ya i know , its WAAAAY out there , but wth . ;)<br />

I think the &quot;follower&quot; should be in the form of a War Dog or a War Pig.. but a great idea nevertheless, imho.</div></div><hr />

But then Paladins will see our getting it as unfair and demand altar boys of their own</div></div><hr />

If you could pick and choose and either get a rogue, warrior, or priest class follower depending on the situation, and make him low enough level to not make it overpowered.  Definitely a cool idea.</div></div><hr />
