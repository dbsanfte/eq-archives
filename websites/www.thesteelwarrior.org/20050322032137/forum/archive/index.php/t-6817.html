I'll be in CoH. Depending on names; i 'should' be back on Prime. will edit if necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically; if you like older style comic book action heroes and random fun ( it's totally different than EQ; can't really compare except for levels and experience ) it's something to check out. it has potential to be a good niche filler for comic book fans.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll be playing it. I'm having a ball with this game. I'll probably be on pinnacle but haven't decided yet. You can all probably GUESS my character's name! Hahahahahahahahah. Now at least my username HERE makes a bit of sense. :P<br />
<br />
The game's been very fun for me. Don't want to go into a really long complex post, but so far the content has been just good enough to keep me coming back for more. Sometimes it's REALLY good content. Sometimes it's a boring grind (but eh, all MMORPGs are designed to be grinds I guess). The powers are very fun. The costume creation is intense and worth the price of the game alone, heh. The RP aspect is actually playable.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripes are: Communication is difficult. They need something a bit smoother. Maybe I'm just used to EQ, but it's very hard for me to play AND talk at the same time. And that needs to be addressed, as MMORPGs THRIVE on the social aspect. Other biggest gripe is the mobs you're on a MISSION for are never around when you need them. I think it's coded that way. But it is frustrating. I take a Kill-10 mission and then poof the mob type I need 10 of are all gone, replaced with something completely different. Because of this I tend to stick with go to place X and do Y missions.<br />
<br />
Character advancement is actually there. There is a carrot chase, and that I didn't expect. So that's a real bonus. Loot (well what passes for it in CoH) is much more evenly distributed in this game than EQ.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe with the powers/loot/advancement portion of the game is, if you make a mistake you can't go back and undo it. In EQ this was never an issue (a warrior trains Bash and doesn't like it's not really a game breaking thing) ... nor in Star Wars Galaxies (as you could simply get rid of the skill tree and start training a different one). But in CoH, once you choose, you're stuck with it. And sometimes it's hard to choose which would be better (travel powers for instance are difficult ... do you want to superleap? run like the wind? or fly there?)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've already rambled like I said I wouldn't. Sorry. It's a fun game. I like it. I'll be playing it.</div></div><hr />

Fun.<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Do you like combat? (you better in coh)<br />
<br />
Do you dislike any of the issues in EQ relating to fair distributions of loot?<br />
<br />
Do you dislike camping mobs for said loot?<br />
<br />
Do you dislike tradeskilling?<br />
<br />
Do you dislike not being able to play with your good friends due to one of you having a lot of play time over the other and being a large number of levels apart?<br />
<br />
If you answered yes to all - you might like coh quite a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Would you all be open to going to PINNACLE server?<br />

Prime will not be available and I know pinnacle will be up for the headstart.<br />

<br />
<br />
Can I be a midget superhero.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Also what is the naming policy like can I have the name Elcapitan gnomers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Can I be a midget superhero. &quot;<br />
<br />
If 4 feet tall is midget enough for ya, then yes. I was grouped with a 4 foot cybernetic girl today in funky armor with sharp claws. She was pretty cool looking.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Also what is the naming policy like can I have the name Elcapitan gnomers&quot;<br />
<br />
Naming policy SEEMS strict if you're on the outside looking in, but it's so far not been too strict.  El Capitan Gnomers would be fine, most likely.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh oh one more  question.  Can you adjust your weight?    I want to go for the morbid obese midget look I heard that is in for summer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are three &quot;genders&quot; in this game. 1- Female. 2- Male. 3- HUGE. Which is like the closest you'll get to roly poly.<br />
<br />
A 4-ft tall HUGE character would probably be the closest approximation to what you're after.<br />
<br />
Character creation in this game is really quite extensive. It will take you a good 10 minutes of playing around just to see what's available. Let ALONE how to put it all together into what you want. heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You missed out man, was the coolest thing I've done in beta by far. I really hope they have events often once the game goes live it would definitely add to the longevity of the game, as it is I dont see much point in playing after you reach the level cap and see the world unless you roll another toon.<br />
<br />
Definitely a fun game though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it some of the developers ran the bosses on the invasion.<br />
<br />
I wonder how some of the moderators here would feel about running bad guys onto the bigger PITA's here....hmm.   I guess last night was for the developers :D <br />
<br />
The invasion was pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Supposedly, since there is a lot less to focus on (loot, balancing) there will be more stuff like this in the game long term.  We will see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, the Commanders were dev's, we fought one on Justice server for about 20min, lowest we got him was 30% or so, they were apparently flagged as players so all the AE heals were hitting him also heh. He thanked everybody for participating in the beta and shit when the event ended so they were definitely dev's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CoH is a fun game. Like its been said, its a totally different game then I think of any game that has come out in the MMO genre. <br />
<br />
I have been in a lot of beta's, I get into pretty much every beta that comes out at least one stage before final beta, and one thing that they did in the CoH beta that I have yet to see on any other was after you finish a mission you would get a little pop up box that asked you your opinions on the mission. It would ask you if it was to long or to short, if it was to hard or just right and if it was actually fun, then they had a text box where you could enter comments about it. I think this was one way for us to help make the game more fun by letting them know the types of missions that we, the players, thought were fun.<br />
<br />
There is a ton of things that I loved about the game and very little I didnt. I got my preorder, I will be in the head start on sunday and I guess I'll see where it goes from there. I know some of the key places to get exp unless they pulled them out, so I should easily be level 25 by time the head start ends, but we will see.</div></div><hr />

If I can pry the house dr00d's fingers off of her new epic, we may well be playing City of Heroes. I never woulda guessed before that she was such a fantasy geek *heh*.  I've created a monster!  Well, a harfling, but with monstrous levels of doggedness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crour</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to be completely honest I've grown tired of EQ ( so has my dad ) and we will maybe be switching over I know what my name will be can you guess ......( can you pick your last name at the start or do you have to be a certain lvl, I hope not)..... ITS CROUR :)<br />
( latin for bloodshed ) spiffy huh plz dont take it lol :(.  pin server sounds good now I just have to convice the old man :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crour</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">could anybody who started playing yesterday bless me with there time by giving a long detailed post about the game all the cool things about it and the problems with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm. It's hard to stopy playing to post about what it's like. Heh.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have two characters (and just started a third). All of them are fun as hell. The missions are exciting. And get more exciting when grouping/teaming up with fellow heroes. The storylines are actually interesting, for a video game ... and go way beyond what EQ normally gives you. Then again, the storylines have to be in CoH. There's no UBER-sword to speak of (though there is loot, of sorts). The driving force has to be the story.<br />
<br />
The level grind is there, that's for sure. But I think they really hit the mark with this game. You can play casually and still feel like you're winning, and getting somewhere. Like even if you're mired in your teens or whatever, you're still completing missions. You're still thwarting crimes. You're still being a super hero, every step of the way.<br />
<br />
Costume design is fun. It's got its limitations, but the foundation is there, and it's quite a foundation. You'll find yourself wanting to design new toons quite often, heh. I know I do. It's why I've almost filled up all 8 slots, mostly because I wanted to see how cool this or that would look.<br />
<br />
It IS TRUE, TAUNT DOES WORK in this game. It's one of the better powers young tankers (and scrappers) get.<br />
<br />
Tankers can be pretty damn impressive in this game. They don't do impressive damage, mind you. So don't get your hopes up there. But good lord can they take a beating, heh.<br />
<br />
I don't play a tanker though. I play a controller, and in my spare time a scrapper. Still, the room for individuality within each archtype is pretty impressive too. The combos you can come  up with really do give you a lot of breathing room, so not every tanker is alike.<br />
<br />
There is no BEST character design. There is no best strategy for completing a mission, at least not in the first 10 levels. :P<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've rambled enough. The game is fun. It's got me semi-retired from EQ, and if it stays this fun, it'll be more permanent retirement.</div></div><hr />

i played 24 hours before i fell asleep at my computer, i havent done that in EQ for years! there is plenty of mobs to go around, plenty of people to hang with, ANY group is a good group because they made it so any classes can work well togeather.<br />

Same here so far this game blows away EQ anyday.   The gameplay is excellant, the character customization is excellant,  immersion factor is excellant,  graphics are excellant, the missions are a blast to do,  rate of exp compared to time played is very balanced,  this game has killed EQ for me plain in simple.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I am not going to retire from EQ yet I am giving COH a month or so and if COH is as this much fun then all I got to say is bye bye EQ.<br />
<br />

SUPER GNOMERS AWAY!!!!! NOW with LEAPING GOODNESS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no to mention its looks better than EQ, BUT IT RUNS SMOOTHER AS WELL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well considering EQ  graphics for the most part are 5 years old of course it will look better.  But the game runs very smoothly.  I haven't experience any graphic errors or even lag yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it is simple to explain why EQ has graphic errors, the graphic engine programmers are getting lazy and sloppy, the luclin engine was grafted onto tunare 1.0, meaning you basically put 500 pounds onto a shelf only ment for 300 pounds, so it was under alot of stress, their solution was to push it out anyway and let the players have to invest in a bigger better rig to clean up after their faulty programming, now that they added Dx9 its a bigger pile of crap on top of a smaller pile of crap inside a bucket to small for all of it.<br />
<br />
only fix is to scrap everything but the basics and recode it(optimization) from the ground up, there are alot of outdated and unused lines of code floating around unused in the program that are just slowing it down(akin to taking 6 detors to get to your destination) and of course, we will see a monthly rate increase before we see a decent rework of the engine.<br />
<br />
anyhow to expand upon bullshit free, by that i mean there is ALOT less down time, if you can take it at max power you wont be sitting/standing around long to get back up to max, unlike EQ that makes you take 15 min med breaks or buffing partys before you start everything, not to mention there is 4 or 5 power pools of useful powers that ANY class can pick up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True Gerick, even with this new graphic engine I haven't experience any benefit from this new engine except for a new sky.  I had experience longer zone times, constant graphic glitches and lag spikes than I did with the old graphic engine.  <br />

OH also you don't have to worry about not being able to do a mission because your equipment isn't the best.   Countless times I get tells in EQ to tank Hard LDON missions only to reply sorry I am to gimped to do it.  In COH there is no equipment just you powers, enchancements and inspirations which means that as long as you know how to play your class you can do any mission in your level range.</div></div><hr />
