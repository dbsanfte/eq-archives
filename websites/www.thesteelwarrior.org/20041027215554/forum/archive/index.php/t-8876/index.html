<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zentalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have always been a little behind on gear does anyone know of any good updates for me i have 50k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nightfo0l</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">your earrings suck get some new earrings like bloodmetal earrings of engagment or the mosquito leg earring.  You can get 1 ornate mold in the bazaar and do that in PoT, I reccomend the legs since you have eyepatch of plunder for haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No to ornate. You could get more of an upgrade buying as much Fierce Heraldic armor as you can versus buying one or two ornate molds. Ornate is not droppable once its made, so you can never get any plat back from it.  Fierce Heraldic is much more bang for the buck in your case.  Will be great upgrades for arms, legs, boots, bracers, helm, and shoulders. <br />
<br />
Valorium rings if you can find a good deal. Same with Mosquito ears if a good bargain is found.<br />
<br />
Would also trade out the shortblade of lightning for a Copper hammer of the SotBS.  Either is a nice combo with the fabled yak. Not sure if you have a 2 hander, but grab a GSoT if you dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sell your Flesh Eater's Ring to buy the valor rings.<br />
<br />
Update your magelo too, won't show your correct stats without skills updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As above, most Fierce Heraldic armor is from 4-8k apiece and you would be amazed how your HP will jump, as well as AC. It is solid armor and even has some saves. I still wear the pants and a bracer.<br />
<br />
You can probably have a complete set for 50k, and maybe if lucky even buy a couple of Valorium Rings of Gallantry. That will put you around 5k hp I am betting. Your neck is a soild item, if you don't want to fork out the cash for the FH neck.<br />
<br />
If you have friends then PLEASE go HUNT for the Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the BloodSworn. At your level the mobs will almost fall over for you, and you and your friends can walk out of Droga with anywhere from 2-8 weapons in a 4 hour period. If you have success and a steady group of friends then you guys can farm that spot and fund the rest of your armor upgrades. <br />
<br />
Once you and friends are satisfied, go hit up some LDoN's for future upgrades and ok XP/AA.</div></div><hr />
