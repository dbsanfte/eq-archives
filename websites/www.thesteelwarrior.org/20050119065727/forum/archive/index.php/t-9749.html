Below is the magelo profile, I have limited pp resources, but some time on my hands to kill.  My main is a 67 Ranger with access to 65 Cleric, Shaman, Enchanter and Druid for farming.<br />
<br />
Best suggestions for upgrades to maximize expense vrs hps/ac?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the good news is that there's really not all that much wrong with the gear that's on this warrior's Magelo. For level 55 his gear is not bad at all, because cultural armor is a good bang for the buck. And your weapons are good. So, actually, you're better geared &amp; armed than the average 55 warrior already in the plate armor slots, and you could simply level for a bit without frightening same-level clerics too much.<br />
The bad news is that gear on the next level gets more expense/difficult; its stuff like Kizrak's and Magnetic. <br />
What i'd do for a lot of ideas is start poking around here: http://www.eqrankings.com/<br />
Look to see what better geared warriors are wearing 55-60 at various slots. There's a tribunal barb named Snowman, for example, at lvl 55 and in several slots he's got better gear than cultural. If you look at a bunch of these Magelos you'll start to see some patterns emerging concerning how folks jump above cultural.<br />
You may or may not want to start on this now, but unless I've missed something, eventually warriors have to do a bunch of LDoN to get a full complement of hate augs (Anger III and yaks). Your ranger can do some plat farming and perhaps pick up some dropable gear, but the warrior's going to have to get his own hate augs. if you're not having aggro trouble in regular groups now, you can delay working on LDoN points, since at lvl 55 you don't get a lot of points per adventure yet. On the other hand, your warrior is geared well enough to tank lvl 55 hards as long as you have some crowd control and a decent pulling class.</div></div><hr />
