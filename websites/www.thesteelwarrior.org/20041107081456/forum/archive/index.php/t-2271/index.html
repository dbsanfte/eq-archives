<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jensonxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is my 1st post, ive never never felt the need to post in over 2 years of browsing these boards. Every question ive ever had has been answered multiple times in dozens of threads by simply reading back through the older posts and i tip my hat to those of you who are smarter than i and have done some incredible work over the years on these very boards.<br />
<br />
  But as a level 65 warrior with 100+ aa`s i feel qualified to post here and i say simply .. Quit your warrior .. i have over 3500 hours played and im madder than hell .. lock this thread .. move it to rants if you want but im tired of killing group members, im tired of some PoP power leveled 10 day old Pally getting an xp group while i sit LFG at the zone.<br />
<br />
  I could go on for hours about warrior faults and how to fix them but its all been said before. To SOE i have but one thing to say FIX FUCKING WARRIORS RIGHT NOW!!!! and dont your dare bill me for that expansion im currently down loading .. sorry guys .. this isnt really how id hoped my 1st post would turn out but im done with warriors .. ive killed my LAST group member .. im of to play my new Main .. a cleric .. good luck.</div></div><hr />

yet you all diss this guy when he says its best to just quit warrior?<br />
If you hate what soe has done to warriors, why do YOU keep on playing it?<br />
<br />
You do realise that SOE has 0, zero, absolutely NO reason to fix warriors while there's still 7 warriors per guild and only 2 or 3 paladins?<br />
Why should they fix it? you're all still here playing warriors. Sure you're having troubles doing so.. but what do they care?<br />
You're paying 10$ a month to do it.<br />
<br />
Ya, I'm still playing a warrior, and I regret it.<br />
But alas, the other part I like about the game is going further, and seeing PoTime.<br />
And I don't want to give that up to play another class.<br />
<br />
I'm thru with leveling, I don't want to go through all that ever again.<br />
And that's what is stopping me from quitting my warrior.<br />
<br />
But I'd suggest as well to all warrior seedlings, those who are in the first levels of their warrior....<br />
quit now.<br />
<br />
Unless ofcourse, you plan to become your guild's MainTank...<br />
but if you don't, might as well play another class.<br />
Face it... warriors are only fun and usefull when MainTanking raid encounters...<br />
and still...<br />
that has become very limited.<br />
<br />
You want to tank in general?<br />
You want to tank for groups?<br />
You want to offtank?<br />
You want to maintank smaller raid encounters?<br />
<br />
then by all means, make a Paladin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like challenge. I can't instantly lock aggro so I have to work for it, unlike our gifted knight friends. Personally, I feel that my 100 AA points are worth more than a knight's 100 AA points are cause I busted my ass for them. After hours of grueling experience were yes, some group members died, sometimes my fault, sometimes there's, my friends tell me to stand in a corner and take a serious pounding were, most of the time, the entire fate of the encounter rests on me busting my ass to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
So SOE wants to fuck with me and forget about me? Oh well, I'm going to suck it up like a warrior would and take my beatings knowning no one else can do it like I can. /nod<br />

Man your stories aren't even coherent anymore.  So did you delete your warrior or Ebay him?  I'm just wondering, because all you do is bitch about how much your &quot;roommate&quot; paid for his warrior and it seems rather odd you'd sell off yours, not to mention the whole &quot;Deleted&quot; thing in your sig.</div></div><hr />

Well said sir.  And I think it is because we are so stubborn and carry on against all odds, we are some of the best damn players out there.  Think I'll go delete that rogue I started in a fit of pique instead!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If you take that $960 divided by the /played time, it probably worked out to $.04 an hour. Thats a lot worse than Nike pays those sweatshop kids in SE Asia</div></div><hr />

The warrior class is fun to play, because no matter how high the odds are against us, it's always fun to try and figure out a way to claw our way to the top and endure. <br />

yes, that can be fun. Which is the reason why I picked a gnome warrior, not the easiest race to be a warrior.<br />

Give me tons of tools to work on aggro with, and THEN i won't care if I suck at aggro, because I'd know it's MY fault, and I need to practice more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">This is the frist time I have posted here and I prob would not have written this if there were not so many assholes on this board. All you ubers who think warriors are ok you are full of it. I have a level 50 warrior and frankely he sucks. Not because I dont know how to play him but because I can not even out taunt a level 30 pali. Ill give you an example My main is 64 Shaman I was in Storms the other night helping a guildie to get to 62. We had a 63 warrior as our tank, Try as he might he could not hold argo. I was slowing very late so he could grab it and still when I slowed I was attcked. Oh by the way he had the newist toys copper hammer so on. To make a long story short He left and the group started wailing no more warriors ever they suck. Now you can say it was the players in the group but why should they change their play style because warriors cant hold argo. Oh one last thing we then ended up with a 60 pali and had no more probs. Warriors need some help plain and simple and those who dont believe it are to hard headed to really look at the probs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Dandaar, warriors never had problems in the past, when people knew how to play the game.  You forget, most of the people EXPing in tier 2 and 3 planes these days started playing halfway through luclin, or later.  They never had the pleasure of leveling up where you needed skill to do so.  <br />
<br />
Its not the warriors fault for bad aggro, its stupid idiotic morons who cant keep their fingers off the spell hotkeys.<br />
<br />
And were you only malo/slowing.  Ill bet not, i'd put money down that you'd land a malo, slow, and then follow it with Pox/Epic/Bane, and whatever other yummy goodness you deemed necessary.  Not the tanks fault he loses aggro when you stack 7 bazillion DPS in dots on a mob 3 seconds after a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I still wonder about this.  It isn't the Warriors fault that agro was lost because casters had to lay into spell effects like debufs.  I agree with that.  But often its not exactly the caster's fault either.<br />
<br />
But Smakz does touch upon a point I always like to make.  Warriors didn't have this problem in previous expandsions.  This was because the environment changed but Warriors didn't.<br />
<br />
Moster got much more dangerous in melee range.  Casters are rightly afraid of anything that can quickly kill them as fast as many POP monster can kill them.  Casting spells right away is so important for efficiency.  Waiting is dangerous and wasteful.  Expecting Casters to restrict their casting, especially when it means survival is funny.  Its one thing to say a Wizard shouldn't over nuke.  Its something slightly different expecting a Shaman to hold back their debuffing because they are afraid of drawing agro.  Or is it okay that a Cleric wait a few moments to start healing?  How many groups are going to put up with a healer or debuffer who states &quot;I would have casted to save you but I would have gotten agro&quot;? <br />
<br />
So monsters are meaner and casters have to use stronger effects to keep them contained.  Is it any surprised Warriors are having problems since they remained realitively unchanged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Malos + Slow is very low aggro unless you get multiple resists.  There should be no reason why Shamans have to complain about aggro if they're just slowing.  The shamans dots are pretty big on aggro but they're supposed to be that way.  You can always have them nuke instead, and in a good group nukes are usually better anyway (since mobs die too fast, you might as well just nuke rather than risk the aggro and/or dot not lasting the full duration).  <br />
<br />
Tash + Slow is quite a bit harder to manage even with very good weapons.  But then, you don't have to Tash a mob right away.  You certainly do not have to Tash or Slow a mob before it's even in camp, and I have seen people trying to do that.  I think there's used to be a term call Tashicide to describe what happens to Enchanter debuffing mobs, and now every enchanter I run into in a pickup group basically does Tash and Slow back to back, sometimes starting the Tash before I can even hit the mob.  And you wonder why they get hit?<br />
<br />
It's true mobs are harder, but they are not so hard to the point you have to Tash and Slow on incoming, or sometimes before it's even in camp.  If you tash a mob before I can swing at it, it's your problem not mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I basically agree with Aeka.  The problem began as an attempt to create a fix.  Prior to PoP almost anyone could tank.  So SoE decided to try and make the tank classes a little more required by making things a lot more dangerous.   I think the idea was they wanted the core to be more of a focus again, tank, slower, healer.  For the most part this has worked.  But there were unexpected side effects.  The fact that slow and a tank is required means that the DPS of the mobs has to be high enough to warrant both.  This seriously ups the anty in risk for a resisted slow or one that lands later.  This also means that because the slower really needs to slow quickly, perhaps not immediately but very quickly, the likelihood of a Warrior being able to hold aggro over the aggro of slow is fairly low.  Of course most of the time we taunt right after slow lands and the slower is only swatted once or twice.  Annoying, a bit of a mana sink, but something people can deal with.  The problem of course comes when taunt just doesn't take.  And that's often enough that people die as a result.  And they don't have to, if they just use somene with more dependable aggro generation.  Which is typically what they'll do.<br />
<br />
It's like this, I personally usually select a Cleric as a healer over a Druid or a Shaman.   The reason being that the Cleric has the spells necessary to heal my Warrior most effectively.  Druids and Shamans both have other things to offer and can make do when a Cleric isn't available, but for the most part their healing ability, the ability I desire and prize the most, isn't the same as a Cleric.  Now, if healing was all Druids and Shamans did, this would suck big time for them.  But it isn't.  Druids can still solo fairly effectively even in PoP and can serve as reasonable DPS.  Yes, maybe they'd prefer not to solo, but they can.  And Shamans are always desired to fill the slower slot and bring considerable buffing as well.  So the fact that these two other classes are beaten out in pure healing power by the Cleric doesn't have as big an impact.  The Cleric is the class most likely to keep my Warrior alive though.<br />
<br />
Yet who is most likely to keep the other members of the group alive when tanking?  Is it the Warrior?  Certainly not these days.  In fact of the three tank classes, the Warrior is the class most likely to indirectly cause the death of their teammates, through no fault of their own.  Well this sucks for Warriors.  Just as not being the best healer sucks for Druids and Shamans.  Fair enough.  Now, where are the other areas we can perform in well enough to compensate for our current likelihood to cause the death of our teammates?  Can we solo effectively like the Druid?  Certainly not.  Can we serve in some other role within a group that will make us particularly desired, like the Shaman?  Some might say that Warriors can serve as DPS.  Sure they can.  But given that every class in the game except Paladins and Enchanters not using a pet typically have higher DPS than a Warrior, this isn't really a big selling point.<br />
<br />
Uhm, seems like a quandry doesn't it?  Sure, Warriors will still get groups, when Knight tanks are kind of scarce or when grouping with friends and guildmates.  Otherwise, well, hopefully most of us have alts, can double box, or something.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it sounds like perhaps we might see something in August.  I'm not particularly confident of it, just some things I've seen here and there that seem to hint at it.  But I'll be honest, I don't have a lot of faith in SoE at this point.  I'm afraid they'll either drop the ball and make a superficial change that doesn't really do anything (like tossing us /shield at the start of PoP just to shut us up) or end up breaking things in some way that causes Warriors to either be over or under powered.  I guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">People are a little bit too afraid of PoP mobs.  While my view is biased because I can tank anything I xp unslowed anyway, even back when my gear isn't as good as it currently is, slow is not a matter of life and death.  If a mob doesn't get slowed a good cleric can still keep me alive, and CH really doesn't use up that much mana.  In fact I'd wager if you just go ahead and tell your cleric that this mob is not getting slowed at all, you might actually get better mileage on your heals because then the cleric definitely has to CH to keep you alive, as opposed to trying to squeeze more out of CH and end up using the very costly supernal series (especially for a cleric without focus/preservation AAs) when he misjudged.  <br />
<br />
I think a large part of the whole aggro problem actually comes from clerics.  If a cleric just systematically starts CHing a warrior at certain % (I'd guess 60-80% would be appropriate for unslowed mobs given pickup groups), I can guaranteed the warrior will live short of some ridiculously bad luck, and that CH will be more mana efficient than any other of the cleric's heals, given the general mudinflation as well as level 65 buffs.  However, virtually no pickup group I have been to do this.  Clerics invariably wait too long to CH.  I suspect this might be an artifact of pre PoP era where things melee for so weak that you can CH someone at 20% and squeeze some extra HPs out of your CH.  Even if you have to CH a warrior at 80% HP, doing so will not bleed a cleric's mana nearly as fast as having to use multiple Remedies/Lights.  Since cleric do not CH early, it becomes necessary to slow a mob fast so that clerics don't end up wasting too much mana on Remedies/Lights.  <br />
<br />
To put things in another persepctive, even if you cast CH nonstop, you cannot cast more than 5 CHs in 1 minute (10 seconds +2.5 recast).  Even if you failed to make any specialization check, that's 2000 mana at most you can spend in 1 minute by hitting CH nonstop.  There shouldn't be any reason for your warrior to die with a cleric CHing nonstop, even if a mob isn't slowed (otherwise you shouldn't be fighting it in the first place).  So for 2000 mana/minute on a cleric, there should be no reason any debuffer needs to get aggroed because at worst you can just not debuff the mob, and the cleric won't be spending more than 2k mana/minute to keep the group alive.<br />
<br />
Now how many times have you seen a debuffer needing multiple Supernal Remedy (400) to live?  Or a mistimed CH so that cleric needs to cast a Supernal Light (600) on the tank?  That number can easily go over 2000/minute, which means the cleric is actually using more mana to keep the group alive than if the mob was not slowed at all.<br />
<br />
If you can guaranteed that the tank will not die, assuming the slowers are capable of learning, they can always slow a mob and not get aggroed, since there is no pressure to slow the mob immediately.  Like the many Paladin owns us threads have stated, as long as you don't have to waste mana on your nontanks, it's okay if the cleric has to spend a little bit more mana than usual healing you.  The irony is that you can guaranteed a tank will not die by just CHing very early (and if this isn't enough the mob is too tough for you to begin with), but it's not being done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I would like to say first I was not useing malo at all. I do have malo but in exp groups I very rearly need it. Second I was not Doting I was nukeing. I for one do not mind getting argo for  a few seconds I just root and back off so it really is not a prob. The prob is that in exp groups people know that a knight is much better at holding argo and because of this they pick knights over warriors and its seems to be getting worse all the time. <br />
<br />
As to the comment about they have not been playing very long and therefore do not know what they are doing. Please you may think they do not know how to play but the truth is they know what they are doing they are killing faster with a knight in the group. They do not get argo with a knight in the group witch maxamizes there exp gain. So you may think its them but in truth it may be you holding on to the old way when in reality their is now  much less danger if you just get a knight as a tank. Oh and before you flame me about how long I have played I started just before knark came out.<br />
<br />
I do understand that tanks are a very important part of raiding but it now seems that is all we are good for. I for one think that stinks. It needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Needing Knights to maximize XP gain is a myth.  Your average pickup group is nowhere near as powerful to actually need all that aggro.  Unless people are dying every 5 minutes due to stupidity, aggro does nothing to increase your DPS in a pickup group.  The limitiation of number of mobs as well as proximity of pulling mobs is far more limiting than mere aggro assuming the area you XP in has a fair number of people.  For example take a popular camp like caves in Valor (Razorfiends hit extremely weak for their level (62-64)).  Once you run out of Razorfiends that is it.  You can't get more XP even if your casters have unlimited mana.  Or take an area of BoT.  While it's unlikely you ever run out of mobs completely, since the mobs are spaced fairly wide apart, as you start clearing mobs you'll run end to excessively long pulls, and to prevent having to wait 1 minute just to pull something you basically end up your puller not meleeing half of the time.  Not having your puller melee for half of the time (who is most likely going to be a monk) is a far greater loss of DPS than whatever imagined DPS you get out of having a Knight.  <br />
<br />
For xp groups, the best source of DPS is DPS, not a Knight nor a Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Your average pickup group is nowhere near as powerful to actually need all that aggro. <br />
<br />
I disagree, allow me to explain why.  DoTs are one of the most mana efficient forms of damage generation.  However, frequently mobs don't last long enough to allow the caster to get the most from their mana.  So the earlier a caster can cast a DoT, the more cost effective that mana expenditure becomes.<br />
<br />
If on incoming a Druid stands up and casts one of their swarm line of DoTs on a mob with a Warrior tanking, the odds are extremely good they're going to get an ass sandwich handed to them by the mob.  If on the other hand the same Druid does exactly the same thing with a Paladin or a Shadow Knight tank who knows their stuff, they can sit right back down and watch those HP just melt off that mob. <br />
<br />
They can easily keep this up for a long long time.  They use less mana and they do more damage.  This is a good thing, at least in their eyes, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Now as far as there being a shortage of mobs, that's certainly true in many places in PoP you can hunt.  But the potential is still there, if you can find the mobs to allow it.  And all the same, being safer is being safer.  Knights = safer.  Warriors = less safe.  All other things being relatively equal, people go for safe over less safe.<br />
<br />
I completely agree with your statement that the best source of DPS is DPS, not a Knight nor a Warrior.  Yet we repeatedly see the objection to Warriors having decent aggro generation being that they have better DPS.  But DPS in a tank is of secondary importance, if you have half a clue, wouldn't you agree?  If we can't hold aggro well enough to suit the purposes of the other classes, our DPS certainly won't make up the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">There is still no reason to overaggro for the sake of doing damage because in any reasonably crowded area, you'd need to stop doing damage at some point due to running out of mobs and/or excessively long pulls.  Not killing this mob 5 seconds faster isn't going to matter when at the end you need to wait 1 minute for the mob you killed 5 second faster to respawn (and if you didn't kill it that fast, you'd need to wait 55 seconds instead).  <br />
<br />
Dots aren't that much better ratio in damage compare to equivalent nukes to have a drastic effect on the group's DPS.  I see it as a good balance between Knight/Warrior aggro, get a Knight and you can dot earlier and get a bit more mana efficiency/DPS but then the Knight does less damage than the Warrior anyway.  When you talk about Knights giving you more DPS via aggro, people are really saying they get more DPS because people don't die, not because you were able to get a slightly more efficient damage spell via dot versus nukes.  You shouldn't have to die in an XP group, though.  XP is supposed to be easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">None of this matters - so long as groups know they can make a mistake without any fear of suffering for it they'll pick a knight  - NOT because they're unable to play well, but because it's more convenient to not need to do so.<br />

Rubbish. if there is no risk of death in an exp group then there is no enjoyment, it becomes a mindless drudgery which you may have noticed is boring as hell. I play this game to have my attention caught and held, that requires some element of risk if i or other people mess up. The most enjoyable moments in an exp group are when you are scrambling to lock the situation back down after something goes wrong.  Remove random factors such as some element of difficulty in controlling the mob and you dumb down the single grouping side of the game totally.  Many people in raid guilds  have the perception that exp is just marking time between raids - that should not be the case.<br />
<br />
Exp should be 'relatively' easy (i.e. not an utter nightmare but requiring concentration) but it shouldn't be a total cakewalk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Phantron, low level casters generate more aggro per spell than higher level ones, and they also have to cast more spells.

Does it really matter if people prefer Knights for a correct reason or an incorrect reason?  A preference is still a preference after all.  You can explain in OOC all day long how the Knights abilities won't really mean more experience for people, but people aren't liable to give you a group based on it.  Sometimes perceptions, even misperceptions, are stronger than reality.  And I know this, if I have a choice between a groupmate that enables me and allows me to do a vast range of things or a groupmate that restricts me and makes me do less than I want, I'm picking the first guy.  Don't you think most people feel that way?</div></div><hr />

Exping definately needs to stay clear of becoming a mind numbing chore. (although it pretty much has become that already)<br />
Danger needs to be present,<br />
difficulty as well.<br />
<br />
Now here is the ick.<br />
The only form of difficulty available is the unstable aggro.<br />
So,<br />
not only have paladins become overpowered, making the &quot;Risk&quot; in groups completely disappear.<br />
But the Difficulty is Uncontrolable. You can work your ass as much as you want, use allt he tricks in the book....<br />
the difficulty will always be at the same level.<br />
<br />
That sort of difficulty is FAR from making groups fun. It's frusterating at it's best.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's about god damn time that EverQuest evolves some.<br />
Get rid of the ridiculous Aggro Management.<br />
Bring in something new, new difficulties, exciting difficulties... REAL difficulties.<br />
Forcing the Warrior to be skillfull and alert. Any small mistake could destroy any group....<br />
<br />
but this is never going to happen as long as our aggro is the way it is.<br />
<br />
Buff up our aggro, make it the same level as knights.<br />
And introduce something new and exciting to this game, that has become but a chore.<br />
Sure sure... fix a few doors and introduce a couple hundred new spells first... then you can Plan to Look into It.<br />
<br />
(and stop the nonesense about knight aggro haveing to stay Above warrior aggro....<br />
I dont see any reason for such a thing.<br />
We got tankage, they got spells. And yes, tankage INCLUDES the ability to keep the mob on you.)</div></div><hr />

as far as being an agro god, be an SK.  Take agro AND lose it at will.  Why be a paladin when you have better agro and do more damage as an SK (paladins have always been a  laughing stock since the dawn of EQ).

To each of their own.  People claim that making Warrior agro will dumb down the exp game.  I say it will make for less agrivation.  People group and exp to succeed, not to get their ass kicked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I could live with it the way it is now but for one thing.

I-E heals, nukes, Dots, stun, snare, pet, hate spells, hate reduction spells, LOH, root, HP buffs, AC buffs, REZ, FD and the list goes on. Playing a warrior today is a lesson in paitince because no matter how you cut it we do not have the the tools we need to even get us close to the things knights can do.

Though if you dumb the game down in the XP level, Knights, especially Paladins, would have a hard time finding a group since Warriors still outnumber Paladins and if xp is trivial, then there's no reason to get a Paladin over a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

Newsflash, I can tank for a group for hours and not have a character die even with my unstable aggro so long as the group works well together. Few close calls maybe but so long as everyones on the ball things go well.

There's two sides to the aggro problem, average Joe warrior without access to the holy grail weapons has an unacceptable level of difficulty in holding aggro vs. PoP mobs, but even the best warrior doesn't hold a candle in comparison with a knight. In my opinion both sides of this problem need to be addressed - Without destroying the last vestiges of challenge in one portion of the game (exp.grouping).<br />

Knights mob control via spell aggro for no meaningful cost is already doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I hear the cries for challenge.  And I understand the point.  But challenge should come from the group and it's willingness to extend itself to the limits of it's capabilities and not from a roll of the dice as to whether or not taunt will work when you need it to.  I'd feel much much better and far less frustrated about a wipe if I knew that we just bit off more than we could chew than because I happened to get a bad run on the RNG and the slower went down as a result.  That's not challenge, that's gambling, pure and simple.<br />
<br />
If a group wants steady mindless experience, they should be allowed to have that.  If a group wants excitement and living on the edge risk, they should be allowed to have that too.  It shouldn't be forced upon them by class limitations.  Particularly when there are easily available alternatives that don't force that upon them.<br />
<br />
Not everyone enjoys playing the same way.  Therefore a group should be allowed to decide for themselves how they want to play that day.  Some days I'm all for some excitement and a new challenge, lets do some dungeon crawling and exploring.  Other days, I'd prefer to just crank out a few more blues in my AAXP bar and not have to work too hard at it.

As i've said before warrior taunt without the bandaid itemisation is crap (it's not perfect with the itemisation but then should it be? ) and needs fixing, preferably innately. Fixing does not in my mind = knight aggro levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Stop pretending warrior aggro fixes are bandaids.  This bandaid I have called the Blade of War works just about 100% of the time for raids or XP alike unless someone is trying really hard to get themselves killed.  Yes I know most people don't have that but itemization isn't a bandaid fix.  It's a natural part of progression.  You get better aggro as you have better items.  If you think a the Blade of Carnage -&gt; Bloodfrenzy -&gt; Blade of War line of weapon progression is just a bandaid fix then I guess bandaids are meant to fix fatal wounds.  <br />
<br />
Now, it's pretty ridiculous that Force of Akilae and whatever SK use for aggro is about as good as our best aggro weapons, I'll give you that.  But that has nothing to do with our inability to get aggro.  Warrior aggro progression is quite fine.  Like any other class, you're required to get better gear to be better at doing what you're supposed to do.  With just about every class, that class's effectiveness increases as you get better gear.  A better question to ask is why are Knights the only exception seeing they do not need gear to be better at doing one of their primary jobs (taunt).  <br />
<br />
XP groups should be steady and safe, I agree, and your group can achieve that even using a warrior if they want to.  It is not the game's fault that your group refuses to learn these ways.  Any group with a reasonable amount of firepower will end up with pulling/respawn time dictating XP gain, not whether you can kill this mob 5 seconds faster because you have unlimited aggro.  I bring enough aggro to pickup groups I get into and guess what happens after the mighty FT-less DPS machines of doom run out of mana?  That's right, they end up doing damage at the rate their mana comes back which is much less than the aggro any warrior can pull.  Unless your XP groups are extraordinary short, it's not even that hard to drop a FT-less/low FT caster to 0 mana with minimal aggro issues.  It seems like a lot of group operates something like hardcore nuking for some time and then a med break.  The solution is don't give them med breaks and they'd never have the mana to nuke hardcore to begin with.  Your pickup caster can't sustain heavy nuking very long by definition.  You're not exactly working with a decked out FT15 all focus nuker in a pickup group.</div></div><hr />

If you want Risk vs Reward (bleck the vision) try a raid.  There has to be somewhere players can go to grow.  In EQ if that isn't exp groups where is it?<br />

All I know is that many people don't think exp is worth dying for.  People will just leave to do something else or logout if they die too many times.

I'd go so far as to say that missing a taunt check and a lack of procs is very much like having a random death touch go off every once in a while.  So why don't they just set the zone up to randomly death touch someone every 3 or 4 hours and give Warriors some decent aggro?  That way those who think the risk of dying is challenge will be happy and the Warrior class won't be the pariah for it.</div></div><hr />

This is untrue, the reward is exp.  You use that exp for levels, and eventually for aa's, to make your character more powerfull in some way.  To say that there should be no challenge to this is to deny challenge to the large number of people who do not raid, who are in small guilds where it is hard to get interest in dungeon crawls, for whom the exp game is far and away the majority of their experience.<br />

<br />
Then how about we make an npc that will give you exp for turning in drops you can get from farming greens?  3 hours of farming greens should get you an AA point worth of drops.  Ridiculous idea, no?  If you are unwilling to take the chance(the loss of a few minutes getting rezed and rebuffed), then you should not get the reward(aa points to advance your character).<br />

There are ways a group can work around it when you are having that string of bad luck(yes, I do know how streaky and just an all out pain in the ass the EQ RNG is).  A good group is prepared, and deaths are extremely rare.  Note that the group has to be prepared, and react quickly(the challenge that you fail to see).  Yes, I know they do not have to do this for knights, and I know that is why knights are preferred exp tanks.  This does not to my mind make it right tho.<br />
<br />
I'd go so far as to say that missing a taunt check and a lack of procs is very much like having a random death touch go off every once in a while <br />
<br />
No, it is not like that.  nothing can be done about a death touch, things can be done to manage agro, and to recover from from a bad string of taunt fails.  My favorite shaman simply Q's himself if I do not get agro back off him on first taunt(he slows immedietly and almost always grabs agro), if I continue to have problems, he roots and backs away.  I have yet to see him die from grabbing agro from slow.<br />
<br />
So why don't they just set the zone up to randomly death touch someone every 3 or 4 hours and give Warriors some decent aggro? That way those who think the risk of dying is challenge will be happy and the Warrior class won't be the pariah for it. <br />
<br />
You replace the idea of skill covering for random events with simply a random, unaffectable event.  This is one of Frodlin's 'straw man' arguments.  No one is advocating random death, only random events that can result in death, if the group is not prepared and not able to react to the event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Actually what I was saying was tongue in cheek.  However if the solution was as trivial as you imply, then it wouldn't be as prevelant a problem as it is.<br />
<br />
I don't want a situation where everyone else has to be skillful to accommodate the glaring lack in my class.  My job as a tank is to grab and hold the mob's attention.  I should have reasonable tools available that allow me to that effectively in the majority of situations.  People shouldn't have to work harder to allow this.  They shouldn't have to compensate for my lack of tools, because I should have the tools.  Clerics have the tools necessary to heal, while there is some randomness involved with their heals since they can fizzle, normally it's not a major problem.   Shaman have the tools necessary to slow.  There is some randomness involved because they might fizzle or they be resisted.  However even if they fizzle or are resisted, they're perfectly capable of trying again in a very short window.  I can go on with examples of how people have some randomness in their abilities but normally it's not something that impacts play dramatically except once in a very great while and usually they can try again almost immediately if they fail the first time.<br />
<br />
Okay, set Warriors up just like this.  Once in a while we'll fail the first time.  But we're allowed to try again almost immediately with a fairly decent chance of success.  And we're not getting strings of failures three and four in a row often enough to be noticed. <br />
<br />
Why should our tools be worse and less effective than any other class' in the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">There is a middle ground to all of this. I don't believe making the exp part of EQ more dangerous is going to make people play them. Even though I consider exp groups far safer it is still work. I don't shut off my brain and let the exp roll in. If I don't actively do my part to keep the group going I will start to drag on it.<br />
<br />
Now then Aeka, I'm scratching my head a little here, the last time we discussed exp. grouping on these forums you were telling me that group mechanics in Eq were already so trivialised that you spent most of your time relaxing in exp groups with one eye on the TV. So which is the truth? It can be said with a fair amount of certainty that warrior aggro favours the first view whilst knight aggro leans more toward the second. <br />
<br />
Isn't it fairly obvious that everytime you make it easier to control what a mob does you're removing one more situation in which a group that's paying attention and 'making an effort'  would pay off over a bunch of people paying the bare minimum attention, watching TV, or cybering in tells whilst the mob predictably wastes it's strength on the tank?<br />
<br />
What exactly is the point of having aggro on a slow spell if that aggro is utterly negated by the pre-emptive casting of a stun spell by a paladin? If plate tanks can hold aggro through virtually anything the group throws at them what 'effort' is there on the behalf of the rest of the group? <br />
<br />
Whatever middle ground we attempt to reach current knight aggro levels aren't it. <br />
<br />
Glatius, you do love to dramatise don't you :p. <br />
<br />
As I say time and again i think warriors need some innate ability that allows them to function without requiring 'progression' of the sort that requires 40+ hard core players to all go kill an uber mob and hope that the weapon of your dreams drops and that you beat every other bugger to it. I use EB as a benchmark as it is what the developers settled on when they made their 'bandaid' ( /gesture phantron :p ) fix, and in my experience with it, it does appear to help without trivialising control. i don't claim it's perfect but it'll do for comparisons sake. <br />
<br />
I don't really care how they boost warriors so long as the mechanism is innate and has limit's that prevent 'abuse' of the aggro management system. if you can make it less random without garanteeing control then great but that seems to me to be a pretty tall order.<br />
<br />
That way those who think the risk of dying is challenge will be happy and the Warrior class won't be the pariah for it. <br />
<br />
Or perhaps we should return the situation to one whereby each party member has some responsibility to manage his own aggro with the penalty of taking damage (because failed taunt doesn't automatically = death lets not forget, the healer might even welcome some cause to pay attention rather than monotonously hitting the 'heal tank' key over and over). Make the penalty an accepted part of the equation and no tank is a pariah for loosing aggro. Warrior taunt was an accepted part of Kunark era EQ dynamics because you had no alternative that worked well enough. Bah what with work this post got started hours ago heh wonder who's posted since...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Glatius, you do love to dramatise don't you.<br />
<br />
Sure, because sometimes only be emphasizing the dramatic can you get through to some people (not meaning you, or even Red for that matter).  Yes, my personal perspective might be a bit more moderate than what I present, but people don't pay attention to moderation.  People don't listen to people when they're perfectly and completely reasonable.   Sometimes you just have to point out the worst case scenario just to break people out their thought process ruts.<br />
<br />
Now I'll tell you straight up, I don't mind that the Wizard or the Rogue or whoever has to hold back a little to let me keep aggro.  I hate the fact that PoP mobs are designed to be slowed and that slowing them early, which is pretty much required for most of us to tank effectively, can at times be a death sentence for the slower.<br />
<br />
This is where I think we disagree.  IMO I don't think the slower is doing anything that he shouldn't be doing.  He can't manage his aggro better because he's supposed to slow early.  Otherwise the situation is much more mana intense and causes reduced efficiency, enough so that replacing the Warrior makes far better playing sense.   So if the slower does their job, they run the risk of dying unless the cleric can manage to keep them standing while I'm reaquiring the mob's attention.   And this doesn't always happen quickly, as I'm sure you know.<br />
<br />
So if they want to set things up so that everyone else in the group has to manage their aggro, I can live with that.  But I'd just as soon not have it set up that the slower has to be a random sacrafice to the gods for doing what they're supposed to be doing on a regular basis.   And I'd like to have the tools to stop that, rather than pushing a key that sometimes just doesn't do shit.</div></div><hr />

You just described exactly how taunt and aggro works for me in a group, I'm in wholehearted agreement that 'unassisted' warrior aggro is gimped.<br />

<br />
I'm in partial agreement with you here, upgrades are required, however there is a reason that we shouldn't have it quite as easy when controlling aggro as casters do when casting a spell, (and that knightly spellcasting shouldn't be as efficient at aggro production as other casters). That is that having the mob fully under control is THE goal for safe exping. It cannot be too trivialised or the fight becomes too predictable and there is no pay off to having anybody other than the tank being on the ball and making an effort to play well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">A quick aside, then back to the subject at hand.<br />
<br />
I have been helping my father during the days some(he needs an extra pair of hands for some remodeling work he is doing, and I am unemployed atm, and while not a big help, I am an extra pair of hands), and we go and have lunch together most days.  We sit at the local diner with his old farmer buddies, and they talk current events.  They disagree and argue and yell at each other, and have a blast going over the same ground they have gone over time and again.  I see us alot like that.  We have argued this topic before(and will again I am sure), we get loud, yell at each other, and I for one am having a good time doing it.  Ok, aside over, on to the good stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But I'd just as soon not have it set up that the slower has to be a random sacrafice to the gods for doing what they're supposed to be doing on a regular basis <br />
<br />
Generally, one of 3 classes is slower, and each have tools to let them handle slow agro.  Enchanters have runes and boggle and Spell Casting Sublety AA, shaman are tough, can self heal very efficiently, beastlords are tough, and their pet grabs a ton of agro, and can usually just back away out of melee range a bit.  Bards can slow too, but I don't know enough about them to know what tools they have, other than I usually have no problem when they slow.  You are right, most slowers want to slow early, to make the group more efficient, and if it is done right, is with small chance of mishap.  I think that it is acceptable that they die slightly more often than most group members, as at least chanters and shaman(and BL's and bards more often these days) are highly desired in groups.<br />
<br />
And I'd like to have the tools to stop that, rather than pushing a key that sometimes just doesn't do shit. <br />
<br />
I'm in partial agreement with you here, upgrades are required <br />
<br />
Actually, I agree somewhat too.  I favor increasing taunt success rates, and lowering taunt refresh, in conjunction with lowering knight agro, or raising the mana cost of knight agro.  I feel knights should have an edge in agro, but that it should be far smaller, and less sure than it is now.<br />
<br />
That is that having the mob fully under control is THE goal for safe exping. It cannot be too trivialised or the fight becomes too predictable  <br />
<br />
I think that is a very dead on accurate statement Val, well put.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">He can't manage his aggro better because he's supposed to slow early. Otherwise the situation is much more mana intense and causes reduced efficiency, enough so that replacing the Warrior makes far better playing sense.<br />
<br />
This only holds water when there is an alternative to a warrior that is 'better'. The same holds true for the perception that mana is being used 'inefficiently' it's only inefficient when it's not the normal state of play ( i.e. with a knight that hold aggro massively better). Hells bells, mana is way to plentiful now as it is, time to reimpose some level of mana management as a 'skill'.<br />
<br />
In original EQ warriors were gimped because all they were were paladins without any spells, kunark changed that radically because warriors gained 'too much' advantage over their plate class brethren coupled with the fact that knight spells did not add any distinctiveness to their role, anything they could do a pure class could do 10 times as well. <br />
<br />
In such a climate (assuming we don't believe it was more accident than judgement - i agree with Phantron's opinion here) knightly snap aggro was implemented and considered balanced by the fact that despite the fact they could grab aggro they were inferior enough to warrior tanks that it wasn't efficient to replace the warrior in his role with a knight. knights were 'emergency' tanks. Unfortunately as we know that rationale combined with other factors - like the exp penalty - didn't get knights groups. <br />
<br />
Nowadays knights have come into their own, they can tank to within a very close margin with warriors (1000 hp's doesn't go all that far in PoP and given that tank hp levels are reaching 4- 10khp buffed the mobs really NEED to hit hard) and are fully able to act as main tank for a group. They have greater flexibility and a more distinct area of expertise that sets them apart from their parent classes (wether tanking or playing support). They can no longer claim that snap aggro is the only thing that will get them groups - nor is it acceptable to be able to control a mob so thoroughly whilst being able to handle the damage so well. As long as knights can tank as well as they can in comparison there is no justifying an extreme advantage in mob control over a warrior.<br />
<br />
If we accept that trivialised tank aggro is bad for the game then what choice do we have but a partial nerf?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">You do not need to slow early for an efficient group, not when an early slow means your slower is dead which is supposedly why warriors are not welcome in the group.  The cleric is quite capable of keeping the warrior alive by just chain CHing and that actually costs less mana than trying to use his expensive heals on the more fragile slowers.  The stuff I XP on in Earth are pretty magic resistant and it's not unusual to see one slowed at 50% or less with the slower chain slowing.  The group doesn't fall apart because it was slowed that late.  Actually most of the time it isn't even noticed because the clerics more or less just CH at the same time regardless of whether it's slowed or not (and a good deal of higher tier mobs mitigate slow significantly anyway).<br />
<br />
I wish you can just force people to not slow mobs.  Then people will realize that you can still live without slowing the mob, and after people figure out how to live on unslowed mobs, there is no reason you should ever have to do worse than fighting an unslowed mob.  Of course slowing is a very powerful tool, but when your slower dies or eats up more than 2k mana/minute to stay alive, you're actually better off not slowing the mob at all.</div></div><hr />

You do need slow to keep things efficient. Just because you or I can do without it doesn't make it wrong or a good idea to do without. <br />
<br />
True, tho slowing fast is not neccesarily needed for efficiency.  I buff out currently at about 7500 hp's(more very soon, factioning suxxors too tho), which is fine for tanking an unslowed tier 3 mob for a short time as I gain agro.  The slowers who slow early do so because they know they can take the beating until I can regain agro(at least the ones I normally group with).  Healer mana is so rarely an issue tho that slowing later is an acceptable solution.<br />

Actually Red, my impression is in fact that Phantron doesn't really believe Warriors are broken.  He thinks maybe Knights have a little too much power in aggro generation, but otherwise things are fine.  I disagree.  Just my point of view.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Yes, you should still slow your mob, but not if your slower gets aggroed everytime doing so because he'd just be dead if it ever resists the slow.  Then you'd end up with a dead slower and a mob that's not slowed, and that's worse than not slowing the mob at all.  If you can't survive an unslowed mob using just CHs then your group is going to wipe anyway when it resists the slow.<br />
<br />
When I was camping Sacred Water for the Signet of Might I had enchanters whose gear look pretty standard LFG-ish (since it's impossible to find anyone to come to Valor) and on the yellow con knights that drop the Sacred Water, aggro on an enchanter with standard LFG gear means instant death.  It's not even a matter of wasting the cleric mana.  You just flat out die if you overaggro those quad 700 mobs in LFG enchanter gear.  So after the enchanter gets plastered a few times, we sat down and looked at what's wrong.  Instead of trying to gauge my HP I told the cleric to just CH whenever I drop below 60%, and I can assure her that I won't die if she does that, and since I won't die, the Enchanter no longer feels pressured to have to slow the mob as fast as possible to keep the group alive.<br />
<br />
After that it's pretty smooth sailing despite fighting mobs that'd one round the cleric or the enchanter.  Didn't have a single death that didn't involved multiple Knights (which is quite a bit beyond the capabilities of the group I had, so it's not surprising).  Yes mobs get slowed later than usual and the cleric bleeds a bit more mana while the knights are unslowed, but compare that to the alternative of one round death, it's still quite a bargain.  Now if I have unlimited aggro the mobs will definitely get slowed faster, but I do not.  But just because I don't have Knight-like aggro means it's a good idea to let enchanter and clerics die.  You have to make do with what you got and why would anyone chose death over slowing a mob later is beyond me.  Even if the slower doesn't die, using an non CH heal on anyone costs the cleric more mana than using an extra CH on the warrior, and a CH is guaranteed to keep the warrior alive for 10 seconds, which is plenty of time to get aggro (if CH can't keep you alive for 10 seconds you will simply die if the mob ever resist slow).  <br />
<br />
Now I'm pretty sure I don't tank twice as well as the average LFG warrior and those Knights certainly hit more than twice as hard unslowed as the average XP mob, so there's no reason why your average warrior can't stay alive at the cost of some mana expenditure on the cleric.  Yes a Knight would be better than in that situation, but so what?  It seems like a lot of you want to prove you're as good as the Knight and you end up wasting far more mana through slower death and/or cleric needing to heal them with inefficient heals.  I have never needed a mob slowed more than 10-20 seconds later than if slow was cast the moment the mob enters camp.  That amounts to 1 extra CH on me, which is nothing because it costs the cleric more mana to use a non CH heal on anyone which happens all the time if the mob is beating on anyone but me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">If you can't survive an unslowed mob using just CHs then your group is going to wipe anyway when it resists the slow.<br />
<br />
Sometimes.  Sometimes what happens is the slower gets aggro, I taunt, the mob comes back.  The slower slows again and gets aggro, I taunt, the mob comes back.  We can actually do this for some time, with the slower only getting a ding or two, if my timing is good and taunt works.  What sucks is when the slower gets aggro and I taunt, and nothing happens.  And then nothing happens again.  And nothing happens the third time.  By then, yeah, we're in trouble.  Particularly if AE taunt isn't available.  Now why should my shit not work, repeatedly, when no one else's works that way?<br />
<br />
And you still haven't offered up a good reason why anyone else playing another class other than a Warrior would think it's a good idea to increase their risk in this fashion when they don't have to.  They don't have to wait to slow with a Knight, so get the Knight.  They don't have to chain CH every single mob because they're waiting for slow with a Knight, so get a Knight.  Everything you are telling us, even if true, is just an endorsement for not using a Warrior except as a last resort.<br />
<br />
This is not &quot;balance&quot; this is taking a red hot poker in the nether regions.   Dramatic?  Certainly, but it makes my point.  We're screwed and we're continuing to get screwed.  And we have people explaining to us how we can gimp along and make things work, but usually it isn't our decision to make.   The slower and cleric pow wow and decide who they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Why is your slower chaining Forlorn or Turgur and expect not to get aggroed?  Of course you can't get aggro off him if he does that.  It's wrong that any tanking class was able to pull the aggro off at all.  The game obviously isn't meant to be played with people chaining Forlorn/Turgur when they have aggro, and it's not necessary to do things like that in XP groups.<br />
<br />
You don't have to chain CH to keep tanks alive on unslowed mob.  I'm just saying it can never be worse than that.  If your healer isn't CHing at a set % you're already wasting too much mana anyway.  An extra CH is nothing even for low end clerics because CH is just so much better than the other heals.  I have never seen a cleric run out of mana from casting CH unless he's been chain CHing for a long time.  On the other hand I have seen clerics run out of mana in a hurry all the time from casting other heals even on slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
A FT15 cleric does not lose mana healing me with only CH on unslowed XP mobs (while duoing).  Now your average cleric do not have FT15 and I probably have quite a bit more HP than the average tank, but then most groups are supposed to have slowers.  If you can keep a mob slowed 75% of the time (and I don't see why you'd have any aggro problems if a mob is slowed after it lost 25% of its health), let's be conservative and say that having mobs slowed 75% of the time is like taking half the damage as having mobs unslowed 100% of the time.  I do not think I tank twice as well as the average LFG warrior, so at worst your cleric lose 15 mana/tick (no FT) for using CHs to keep up an average warrior.  Even with a fairly modest mana pool, you can go on a long time at losing 15 mana/tick, and in reality the cleric isn't likely to lose any mana at all since a mob slowed 75% of the time is a lot more than just taking half damage versus unslowed 100% of the time.  <br />
<br />
Of course Knights are better than you in aggro, but then it's not that hard to stay alive on XP mobs to warrant people doing the kind of things they're currently doing.  A warrior isn't supposed to be the answer to a bad group.  Things are supposed to stay bad if your group plays bad.  It's a problem that Knights can make bad groups play better than they really are due to nearly unlimited aggro, and that should be nerfed, not increase warrior aggro to the point you can make any bad group good just by being there.</div></div><hr />

This is the problem...<br />

<br />
The only reason SOE isn't boosting up our aggro, is like Phantron said, to keep the game a &quot;challenge&quot;...<br />

<br />
If giving us knight-like aggro would make the current high end encounters too easy... then there is something HORRIBLY wrong with the high end encounters.<br />

LDoN seem to bring a new sort of difficulty to the game,<br />
dynamic content.... Hopefully in such a way that Aggro Management becomes ridiculous.<br />
Everyone has to concentrate on other difficulties to survive,<br />
<br />
in such an enviroment, we can bring Warrior aggro to Knight's level, with no fear of imbalance.<br />

But I see your concerns.  It is easy enough to &quot;cap&quot; any new skill effects.  Or even flag monsters as immune to what ever skill effect it is.  Monsters can be tuned to adapt to any player abilities.  SOE can code monsters to ignore any effect in the game.  Why would any new skill be any different?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Warrior aggro is very reliable on the raid level.  There is nothing wrong that high DPS classes have to have some semblance of skill to do damage without dying.  Dynamic content?  I assume you don't mean mem blur, so you mean adds?  Adds make aggro control way easier.  Guess what the MT is doing when the rest of your raid is running around dealing with the adds?  If there was no aggro issues, then they might as well put your clerics in a CH test and if you can pass it for X amount of time the boss automatically dies and drops loot, and if you fail your entire raid dies and start over, since that'd be the only thing that matters if there is no aggro issue (and adds I suppose, but except RZ adds are rarely a serious issue).  <br />

What does warrior bring to a group over another Knight?  More HP, and more DPS.  A lot of you seems to overlook the nontrivial difference in DPS between Knights (especially Paladins) and Warriors and yet you worry that your group is not as efficient if this mob didn't die 5 seconds faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phantron, I can't believe you even brought this up, since you have just gone through a great deal of effort trying to explain how the fact that a Paladin will allow a group to increase their DPS is meaningless because there typically aren't enough mobs available to allow them to fully utilize this increased DPS.  So how can Warrior DPS, which must by the very nature of the beast, be less than the combined DPS increase of an entire group when using a Paladin, be more meaningful and advantegous?  Logically this just can't be.  Either increased DPS is meaningful and therefore the fact that Knights allow increased DPS is meaningful or increased DPS isn't meaningful and therefore the fact that Warriors individually have more DPS than a Paladin (and not a Shadow Knight btw) isn't meaningful.<br />
<br />
You're arguing both ends towards the middle.  Logically this doesn't hold together.<br />
<br />
With regards to the HP difference, we've already been over the fact that slowing immediately is far more signficant and powerful than a mere 1k more HP.  Particularly when you're arguing that for the Warrior the Cleric should be chain CHing the Warrior until it's safe for the slower to land slow.  1k HP against an unslowed PoP mob is less than a round's damage.  Hardly what I would call &quot;nontrivial&quot;.  <br />
<br />
And the reality of the situation is this, regardless of how you and I may disagree personally on how significant the DPS and HP differences are between the two classes, the facts are people use the Knights and try and avoid the Warrior.  Obviously it is reasonable to conclude that people see more advantages, game wide, with the reduced DPS and HP but better aggro control of the Knight.  So claiming Warriors having them compensate for lack of aggro control is pattenly untrue.<br />
<br />
Frankly, at this point I'd almost believe you were a Paladin mole, since you seem dead set on making all of their points for them and completely trivializing the Warrior situation to the best of your ability.</div></div><hr />

The problem is not what we overlook, but what the others playing EQ overlook(or to be more accurate most likely, what they do not value).  I could argue that warriors are fine, since I love playing mine, and can succeed very well in both exp and raid environments.  Unfortunatly, my opinion does not mean shit when the group looking for a tank disagrees and chooses that 62 pally over me, becuase they overlook that DPS difference, and do not overlook the agro difference.<br />
<br />
In every raid, the guild pushes the Warrior with the best agro generation in front. Guilds are already minimizing the dangerous random nature of Warrior agro generation <br />
<br />
This would be the warrior that thru hard work(on both her part and the guilds part) has the best agro weapon(s).  The guild adapts to any agro limitations that warrior has(and there are always limitations).  The idea behind exp groups and raids is to maximize controll.  Our big difference in agreement is you think it should be effortless to gain that controll(at least in exp groups), while I feel that it should be some what challenging.  To say that because everyone wants to keep the mob on the MA, that it should be effertless is just wrong in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">2 groups that are identical in every respect.<br />
Cleric, Shaman, Rogue, Enchanter, Wizard, and either a War or SK in the group.<br />
<br />
both warrior/SKs follow a diety are trolls, and are wearing a full suit of fulvous and swinging Windblades. (best i could think of to make ONLY the class of the 2 involved matter). the difference in skill caps are made up by the +atk spells of the SK compared to raw skill base of the warrior. in other words these two groups are exactly the same except one is a warr, one is a SK in ALL Stats.<br />
<br />
they're in a special room, where only 1 mob spawns, there is no issue of adds, roamers, pulling.<br />
<br />
the warrior tags it and starts swinging hitting taunt when it pops to build aggro. the rest of the group engages. to ensure the mob never switches targets,  The enchanter wait's for mob to be at 83% to cast Tash,  the shaman has to wait till the mob is at 80% to slow to keep aggro on war. the wizard has to wait for 50% before he starts to nuke. fight last's we'll say 2 minutes. the cleric burns 30% mana keeping the tank alive (1 CH's right off,  one at 1.2  minutes, then one at end of battle)<br />
<br />
the SK in the same situation. SK cast's darkness to tag, uses spears and taps during battle, combined with melee damage the mob never switches targets.  the chanter cast's Tash at 97%, the Shaman Cast's slow at 96%. the wizard starts to nuke at 70%.  the fight from the extra DPS from the wizard nuking sooner, and the SK's own spears/dots make the fight last 1 minute. the cleric spends 15% mana, from 1 Ch at about 50 seconds, and an elixer at the end to top the SK off. <br />
<br />
you have 2 fights, one last's 2 minutes, one last's 1 minute. one the other DPS classes like the wizard have to hold back on DPS to avoid the mob switching, the other. they can open right up.<br />
<br />
all other things being equal, the SK is the better tank in this situation. he generates more hate, a few more DPS from his spear/dot's while swinging the same sword (and a 1/2 second casst time goes off between swings of the windblade, even fully hasted, causing no loss of melee DPS). and this situation is how most grinds happen (mob is isolated from help).<br />
<br />
now do you see why i retired my warrior and joined the darkside? to everyone that loves playing their warrior, more power to ya, we do need warriors for those .1% of all mob fights at the end of the raids. but i spend 99% of my time grinding, or fighting the &quot;trash&quot; mobs to get to the &quot;big dude&quot; at the end of the dungeon.  <br />
<br />
i hope that this is read with an open mind, and people can understand what i'm trying to say.  not trying to trash on warriors. but showing why people who are forming grind groups pass over warriors for the Knight classes.<br />
<br />
so i have to agree with the very first post. i quit my warrior, and went Evil, and haven't looked back with regret.</div></div><hr />

None of this are things that Warriors are responsible for.  The only thing the Warrior actually does is pop /disc defensive at the right moment and  keep the monster in frame.<br />

As a small note most raids wipes aren't usually caused by the MT loosing agro.  Its almost everything else that goes wrong including the first one: MT dies.  Here we have a situation where agro lock is good because its from a Warrior? I am shocked. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I have to admit that more times than not, while you might occassionally lose a few raid members to over aggroing, rarely if ever have I seen a raid wipe because the Warrior lost aggro unless it was Clerics that started getting eaten.   Usually the cause of a wipe is a mistimed CH cycle and the death of the MT or insufficient DPS or something else altogether.  Of course you might argue that improved aggro for the Warrior would make tank changes too trivial, but as it is I don't see it making raids trivial where the MT successfully lives, that already is a non-issue.

<br />
To me the key word is work.  To work around warrior agro, you have to impose certain limits on how you do things.  You have to use agro reducing tools at your disposal.  I think that is how it is supposed to be.  It is not hobbled(well, it is in contrast with knight agro, but as you know, I think knight agro generation is too high), it is design, a limit put in place for the good of the game.<br />
<br />

<br />
True, even with my gimp gear(been a raid MT for all of 3 weeks now, what a learning experience!), on the big mobs, agro is simply not an issue.  People know that if they push too hard, they die.  Note tho that the warrior does not  have agro lock, but that people are using the tools available to them to not get agro.  High end warriors, with BoW or even with dual EB are much closer to agro lock, but even then, it is not near what a knight can generate.  Warriors simply hold agro at raids because it is in everyones best interest to let them do it.<br />
<br />
Personally i think the raid game is pretty boring  <br />
<br />
Actually, I am having a blast with raiding right now.  It is not the challenge(tho learning to MT fulltime is definatly a challenge) so much as it is the rush of taking down that big mob.  I will say that to my mind, one of EQ's strengths is having ways to keep all different types of players interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">The tradeoff between a Knight and a Warrior's aggro for the raid game comes from the fact that dying is a 100% chance to lose all your aggro, and on mobs that do nontrivial DPS on the MT, Knights stand a much higher chance to lose whatever aggro they're able to have via death.  If a mob cannot easily kill a Knight, then the fight itself is already trivial and aggro should not even matter.  I don't know of any mobs where aggro control is significant (usually via AE rampage or very strong targeted AEs) but the mob itself does a trivial amount of damage on the MT.  Maybe Tallon Zek in Tactics, but his AEs pretty much ends up being high DPS on the MT (though of course, discs do not help you reducing the damage from the AEs).   <br />
<br />
Even with BoW or similar weapons, there's always someone (usually wizards) who can find a way to use them up.  Although you can appear to have an aggro lock on most PoP mobs that do not interfere with MTing, you can never have too much aggro.  But then that's why item progression is meaningful.  You can have aggro the whole time starting from using a BoC with good people, but get a better weapon and people can do a bit more damage and still not get aggroed, and that goes all the way up to Raex's Chestplate of Destruction.  Yes you will never be able to do enough aggro so that your wizards can chain cast Strike of Sol Ro but it should be obvious that's not supposed to happen by game design.</div></div><hr />

Here we have an entire guild working to keep the damage on a few.  But Warriors have little skills to contribute to this focusing.  Unless I missed it is no strategy for a Warrior to take.  If there was I would agree with you that the limitations make sense but this isn't the case.<br />

I guess that is my core point.  Warriors because of their lack of skills are nothing more than one skill: /disc defensive.  A disgruntled Warrior friend who quit in disgust knew people did not mean to treat him like a puppet but ended up doing so because there was so much that left out of his hands.  To paraphrase what he said: You don't need a Warrior to tank on a raid, you need a pet with &quot;/disc defensive&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Forgive me for saying this but throughout your posting history on this board I see a lot of this very convenient rationalisation being used to divert attention from the arguements in favour of nerfing knight aggro - despite your telling us it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
What has increasing warrior skills (utility) to do with what level of aggro is acceptable in a plate tank? We're all agreed that warrior taunt need's a bit extra to make it work in a group however we don't agree that plate tanks should have the level of control that knights have currently.  <br />
<br />
Excuse me for pointing this out but why do you think 'Utility' will move warriors back to being a viable alternative to tank over a knight so long as they keep their advantage? Lord knows you guys are always telling us warriors that utility never gets you groups. So whilst i'm not in full agreement with Red and favour more utility I don't believe it'll fix my classes' core concern - the aggro gap.<br />
<br />
Answer me this question as well, what was the most exciting raid you remember? I'm willing to bet you the most excitement was when things didn't go quite according to plan and you pulled through when all seemed lost from quick reactions and maybe a little luck. You want to remove another factor that makes such a situation possible (loosing and then regaining control with some effort ) in both raid and exp? <br />
<br />
By giving players more and more control over the environment, you create less possibilities for stumbling blocks and remove challenge (minor as it is).  <br />

<br />
In an encounter where a mob does not so significant collatoral damage, all a Paladin is good for is LoH on the MT, and spamming his fast but inefficient heals, and there are a ton of such encounters.  Paladins are borderlining overpowered now as a class but you never see guild trying to recruit them in large numbers.  Why?  Although they can do a lot of things very well, they fail in the one aspect that's needed the most in a raid:  DPS.  For a lot of fights none of a Paladin's utilities even matter, and he is just an inferior warrior with a one-shot LoH on the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Phantron, for Clerics CH is just as useful in a group as it is on a raid.  If defensive was just as useful in a group as it is on a raid, we'd probably not be where we are today.  But it isn't.  Can you name me another class who's raid functionality isn't just as useful on a raid as in a group?  I can't think of one.  Slow, mezz, DPS, heals, debuffs, buffs, and so on, are all useful on a raid and pretty much useful for a group.  So trying to compare CH to defensive is a red herring, they're not the same because they can't be used at the same rate and they don't have the same usefulness outside of a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Afternoon Aeka, just getting home, and ready to reply, so let's get at it:) .<br />
<br />
You comment that PoP mobs make warrior skills look outdated, then say 'Here we have an entire guild working to keep the damage on a few'.  How exactly is this different from SoL, or Velious?  Back then, the whole guild worked to keep the mob focused on the MT, same as today.  In fact, if the whole guild did not have to work at keeping the mob focused on the MT, and could cast with impunity, it would make the encounters much easier.  This is why I say that warrior agro is(in a raid encounter) a built in limit.  As a guild progresses, and gets the warrior better agro gear(BoW), it then gets a bit easier.  That is I think by design.<br />
<br />
'Unless I missed it is no strategy for a Warrior to take'.  That is true somewhat, there is a limited amount of things a warrior can due.  I am finding that the hardest part of my job sometimes is actually getting mobs positioned right.  But overall, no class has an indepth strategy to take, each in itself is pretty straitforward.  <br />
<br />
'If there was I would agree with you that the limitations make sense but this isn't the case.'  The limitation is placed on the raid(or exp group) as a whole.<br />
<br />
'I guess that is my core point. Warriors because of their lack of skills are nothing more than one skill: /disc defensive'  That is called being a specialist.  I enjoy that role, doing one thing, but doing it better than anyone else.  Trying to make warriors a utility class would be similar to taking a mage and converting them to a healing class, so they did not have such competition from other DPS classes.  If I wanted to play a utility class, I would have rolled one(actually, I have, several times.  Don't enjoy that role).<br />

<br />
I don't see how a warrior could have any compliants about PoP encounters until Plane of Time.  The number of geared tank often decides whether you can win not how many wizards or clerics and certainly not how many paladins you have.  Unless you're in Plane of Time the warrior tanking ability far exceeds that of Hybrids since our Raex armor is actually itemized pretty well.  If you're in Plane of Time, then you start having some problems with Hybrids sharing all the best loot and therefore blurring the tanking advantage, but the Time stuff hits hard enough that /disc defensive alone is enough reason to have a warrior tank, though this doesn't mean I think it's right Knights can be so close to us in HP/AC and still have their free aggro.</div></div><hr />

Wow, what drama.  If warriors as specialist tanks where significantly better at that role than any other class, and most groups, and most raids need a tank, then warriors will always have a role, and things to do.  Situations where you cannot engage in melee are relativly rare(and I do hope they get rarer), and we all know that only one person MT's at a time.  I also find those acceptable costs, and love playing my class(that you are so desperate to change).</div></div><hr />
