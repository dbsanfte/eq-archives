<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Centi Longsword and Jade Mace right now on my 38 Warrior.  I was in Great Divide the other day and got my arse handed to me by a Frost Giant although the cleric was able to heal me until I took the Nordic Nut down.  Right there I decided I'm not going to play until I upgrade my weps and armor.  I'm building my Fierch Heraldic set so that's going well.  But the weps are a different story.  I have 8k to 12k pp to use.  Anyone think of a 1hs/1hb combo better then Captain's mallet and Frostbringer for around that much?  Plus, what level does Frostbring procs?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since your damage bonus is still kind low at your level you might want to try getting a higher damage / better ratio primary and then a good ratio offand as well.<br />
<br />
Also I think I remember 2hs being better damage especially at the lower levels because your duelweild skill isn't all that great yet. <br />
<br />
Pick up an argent protector or some other old world 2hs weapon without a level requirement on it.<br />
<br />
That's just what I think though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First off, the frosty procs at level 40. <br />
<br />
At level 38, a wurmslayer is still the most damaging weapon you'll be able to buy, and it will stay that way until you are almost level 50. Dual wield isnt the way to go if you're looking for dps. There's tons of 2hs/2hb weapons out there with a dmg/dly ratio of 1 or better nowadays, but most of them are required: 51 or higher. One great weapon for you would be a Reaver. It's 40/40 and has 12 or so to all saves. This will be a great dps improvement from dual wield. My advice to you would be keep the GCM/Frosty for when you need higher aggro, and a good ratio 2hs for dps.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 51, start looking for weapons again. Just keep checking the bazaar for good deals on weapons that look better than yours.<br />
<br />
Also, with 12k you might be able to upgrade your haste item. What are you using for haste now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sure, my opinion isnt worth more than the previous guys, but don't get a wurmslayer :p<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that its about level 45ish that your main hand damage bonus will make a lammy out damage a wurmy and you're already 38 so getting a weapon to use for 7 levels and then needing to go shopping again is a bit of a waste of time.  Also seeing as you are looking at weapons much better than a lammy the wurmslayer would likely be redundant even earlier.<br />
<br />
Frosty + a guard captain's mallet would be a pretty decent DPS weapon combo into your 50s with the frosty's proc adding some nice agro, hell I remember buying my frosty at level 60 and it was a big upgrade to me.  Keep your other weapon skills up though because once you get into the 50's and past a few of the recommended levels of weapons there will be lots more options available to you such as a great staff of thunder, war marshalls bladed staff, wind blade, copper hammer of striking etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both of your opions were great!  It lends me to believe that I need to go back to Split Paw and work on my 2hs/2hb skill until they are maxed (most gnolls are light blue now so easy skill ups).<br />
<br />
Neksnappa, my current haste item is the Silver Chitin Hand Wraps.  What would be the next upgrade for hast as far as affordability?  RGB?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmmm I went from SCHWs to a Sash of the Dragonborn, but only because i got some gloves with real nice hp on them. I wouldn't recomend upgrading to SotDB because it's only 2% more haste, and you lose some nice ac/stats.<br />
<br />
Things you could look at would be a Soulscream Belt, or a RBG as you mentioned. Both of these are going for about the same price on the nameless, and are really nice. Just do a search for haste items in the bazaar every once in a while to get a feel for the price ranges on your server, and grab one for cheap once you get the cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soulscream Belt, RBB, RBG all in the same catagory for your next haste item.</div></div><hr />
