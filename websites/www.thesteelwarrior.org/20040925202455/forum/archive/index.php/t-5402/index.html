<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, anyone else concerned about this?'<br />
<br />
I tried to install DX9 when it came out, EQ refused to run.  3 reformats later, and a copy of DX8.1 (which is no longer supported by Microsoft btw), my main comp was finally able to log into EQ again.  I've been playing EQ on these 2 computers for over 3 years now, I'm getting really goddamned sick and tired of being told that my hardware is no longer capable of running the game just because some assclown dev thinks his new 400 million polygon model looks better than the one that someone else designed.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even fucking mind if they told me that I couldn't play the new expansion, but every goddamned expansion, whether I own it or not, continues to slow the game down for me.  Original EQ ran like a champ.  Kunark things started to bog down.  The Velious release turned my zone times from a few seconds to upwards of 10 fucking minutes in places.  Everyone remembers the SoL release, that was such a flaming pile of shit I don't need to say more, and the worst was when LOY came out, I didn't even BUY the goddamned thing, and it slowed my EQ load times/zone times by a solid 50%.<br />
<br />
Rumor mill says that WoW beta signup starts Wednesday.  If I have to build a new fucking computer just to run EQ, I won't be running EQ.  I've had enough of this crap.  It is not that hard to stick to system specs.  I understand if you want higher system req's for expansion XYZ, but people who don't own those expansions shouldn't have to suffer just so everyone else can see the shit that SoE calls artwork.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its like when Luclin came out and everyone who had been playing EQ for 3 years happily on their win95 boxes got the rude fork out for a new OS or stop playing deal.<br />
<br />
My partner and I are fortunate to be able to afford to keep our EQ boxes fairly upto date and as such havent had any problems for a couple of years now, but I remember a few cases back when we started playing that make me wonder why we kept paying.<br />
<br />
There was a patch where my GF's onboard sounds card spazzed out and every sound played would echo 3 or 4 times.  2 weeks later of bug reporting and trawling techsupport boards solution was a new SB Live card - $140.<br />
<br />
There was a patch where the GF's S3 Savage Video card no longer was supported - solution: new video card for me and she gets my Geforce2 ;) - $400.<br />
<br />
There was a patch where the drivers I was using were no longer supported and neither were the latest release drivers - solution go hunting various mirror websites for a particular driver 3 revisions old now the only one compatible with EQ.<br />
<br />
There was a patch where EQ would load up, you'd select you character and the zone would load and as soon as you appeared in the world your modem would stop transfering data and you got to watch the lag meter trail off till you go LD.  Then the modem didnt work until you power the PC off and back on again - solution new modem drivers.  Had the same problem again when we upgraded our PC's most recently with the onboard LAN cards losing connection as soon as EQ loaded the zone (character select was fine).  First resolved by installing a PCI LAN card, later resolved by upgrading to DX9 - caused by some memory conflict with EQ using NIC memory under DX8 :/<br />
<br />
Given their history it wouldnt suprise me if DX8 users get the shaft again, but you'd hope with the competition on the horizon that they will realise they need to hold onto their customer base rather than telling everyone without a DX9 compatible display card they cant play EQ anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Been running DX9 for a while now with no problem (since SWG beta, I think) on a Geforce2 and Asus A7v x Athlon 1200. Just upgraded to a Raidon 9600 Pro, Aus A7nSomethingsomething, Athlon 3000. Neither version had a problem with DX9. <br />
<br />
I would just suggest hitting the test server.<br />
<br />
And eventually the SOE has to decied when retianing their existing players old PCs is costing them too much in terms of new players and competing against newer games. <br />
<br />
By Moore's law, PCs are about 8x as powerful as when EQ launched...(3 doublings in 4.5 years)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Read an interesting article a while back, might have been an interview with someone like Brad McQuaid so someone else out there might even be able to provide the link...<br />
<br />
The essence of what was said was that most games are designed to run well under the current set of hardware - games like quake / unreal etc are made to look great and run great now and people will buy them and then next year they will by the next version which will look and run great on whatever hardware is out then.<br />
<br />
MMORPG's however are designed and developed to look great when running on hardware that comes out next year because the graphics engine the game isnt being developed to be superceeded next year, its being developed to be played for several years with the same graphics and because of this they want to build a graphics engine that will stand up against the competition they will have next year and the year after.<br />
<br />
Because of this each time a graphic engine upgrade is done on EQ it is designed to run well on systems that arent out yet or are currently too expensive for 90% of the player base, with the expectation that in a years time hardware to run it well will be standard and it wont be until 2 years time that it is starting to look old and out of date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not Rumors. GFraizer announced beta signup start in 2 days.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A few months ago there was an obscure post on allakhazam with a link to some guy's scan of some PC magazine or another. It was a little blurb and a couple screenshots of EQ with the current graphics engine and the &quot;Tunare&quot; (iirc) graphics engine that was supposedly going in with the next expansion. It was kinda funny, the 'before' picture was the aviak town in SK and the 'after' was kelethin but they were both labeled 'kelethin' or something. Either way, the difference in quality was amazing. It looked pretty tight.<br />
<br />
BUT there were dev quotes that the new graphics engine was going to be designed to be LESS memory/cpu/gpu intensive than the old, outdated graphics engine.<br />
<br />
If DX9 itself is giving your system shit, I don't know what to tell you, but from the sounds of it (granted, from this tiny little pc mag article months ago) the new EQ will perform better than before, rather than worse.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Found the post on allakhazam (http://allakhazam.com/news/sdetail2409.html?story=2409), and here's the link to the scan (http://www33.brinkster.com/eqtunare/) from the magazine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It came in the free magazine they were handing out at the chicago fan faire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This link from EQ forums has som einfo on the Tuanre3 engine and some links to the latest drivers and supported cards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Getting an engine upgrade which actually makes EQ run good, even with luclin quality models enabled would make me happy, especially if its going to be available on GoD launch day.<br />
<br />
I don't think it will be though, because it hasnt even been put on test yet (as far as i know) and I'm certain sony themselves would be hyping something as big as a new graphics engine if it were coming out anytime soon.</div></div><hr />
