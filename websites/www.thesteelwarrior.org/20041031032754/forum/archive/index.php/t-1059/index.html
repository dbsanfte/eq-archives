<br />
Where is the POI gnome again to start the Dragon walk?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would be interested to know, and also how 'tough' is the dragon?<br />
<br />
All I remeber reading is that once entering POI you have to take right, and somewhere should be the gnome.. but also the gnome can have a PH..<br />
<br />
Do you have any good links about this, like how tuff it isand what kinda groups you need to do him ?<br />
<br />
I'd love to know cause I saved the quest items to make a event for my guild but dont think we're ready to take him yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You go right from zone in and clear untill you get to a hut. Gnome is inside that hut, no PH. <br />
<br />
Safest way to kill the dragon unless you have a beefy MT / many healers is to have a WS ranger tank him the first 18 seconds and hope that he gets slowed by then. 60 shaman + 60 mage is very very usefull for slow / debuff, and a 60+ MT is definately best. Dont count on a ch chain, he has a stun AE. Clerics being 62+ for the biggest fast heal helps alot too. <br />
<br />
First time we did him, we had about 36 people avrg lvl 60 with a 65 tank. Now we do him with 4 groups of 65's easy, worst part is clearing to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gnome is to the right from zone in just keep clearing you get to a tower hw in there make sure you clear almost 1/3 the way before you trigger him for faster time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Look at his room before the gnome gets in, look to what you can use to your advantage.<br />
<br />
On a personal note, we turn the dragon when we do him so he doesn't repost the poor gnome to death.  A rune on the MT out right helps a bit too.<br />
<br />
If your guild can kill vindicator fairly easily, then you should try this one, he's a fun fight.  Agro control is essential to keeping everyone alive.  Strafing works well when you get snared =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the casters can stay in the corners of the &quot;room&quot; where the dragon is to avoid the aoe. When the gnome walks up to him, he will activate as soon as the gnome gets there. I thought theyd be some script or something so it caught me a little by surprise.<br />
<br />
He hits pretty hard, i cant remember offhand but think it was over 1000 without disc.<br />
<br />
When i fought him we got snared early - this made positioning quite tricky. i Then died as i got out of CH range so make sure you clerics are clued up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The gnome is in the northwest corner of the zone, in the building there.  One useful thing with him is he isn't activated until the gnome gets to him, so you can get everyone in position beforehand while someone keeps the gnome back, and get off to a quick start that way.  Once he's slowed the fight is pretty much just about mitigating the AEs, and 1-2 healers can cover the MT. YMMV, but that's how it's been for us, with 3.5-4 groups, pre-ntov guild.  Xana falls at a bit tougher than Vindi for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Few things,<br />
<br />
Gnome location has already been given. Take the raid force ahead clearing the way to dragon, then have someone do the turn in to the gnome and have your favorite chanter babysit the little fella keeping behind the clearing. Note, do NOT let your people get in his path as he has been known to despawn if his path is too obstructed...just keep him behind the fracas.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the gate, pull the 3 mobs inside, buff up, get raid force positioned and let the little fella do his thing.<br />
<br />
We use an 8.5k tank to MT fight normally, but you really don't need that much. I'd compare dragon to most of NToV mobs. It can be debuffed and slowed so once thats done, simple CH rotation should do just fine. I believe he melees around 1400 and has an AE Oil Spray (snare and 300dd I think?)<br />
<br />
We did last night and although not a big force (think we had 30) it took just over 2 minutes to give him his dirt nap (grats me BTW on the CHSD).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't worry about the gnome your first time at the dragon. If the gnome dies during the dragon fight then no big deal, just work on killing the dragon.<br />
<br />
Also, the gnome spawns every 2 hours after dragons death (approx)... so he can be farmed quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vergil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A couple of questions:<br />
<br />
Does the Dragon's AE hit the gnome?  Ie: do we need to have a healer on the gnome, or is it sufficient to make sure he doesn't get ENRAGED on and kil himself?<br />
<br />
Is there a good map of the path that the gnome takes to get to the dragon?  Starting to clear the path before activating the gnome sounds like a solid plan.<br />
<br />
One more!  What resists are important for the dragon's AE??<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Vergil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When you escort the gnome in, have your MT at his tail so that he turns the mob, as someone said, to prevent the gnome from riposting.<br />
<br />
We never heal the little runt, he always lives, but the turn may be important as you want to hail him when its done to get the factory flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The gnome, don't worry about him. The only times we have had issues with him was when some silly barb used AETaunt to save a caster's life *looks for another warrior to blame*. He aggroed the healers after the fight, so he had to be euthanized. Now I just let silly over nukers take their chance with regular taunt.<br />
<br />
The one caution I have on him is this: pushing him all over makes it nasty b/c of the snare AE. If you push him away, the gnome will summon him back. For the MT its handy, for the other melee its a PITA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The times I have done it, we never worries about resists. I'm not sure if you can really resist any of his aoes anyways.</div></div><hr />
