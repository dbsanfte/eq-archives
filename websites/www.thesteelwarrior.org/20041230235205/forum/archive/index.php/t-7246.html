<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brannwen</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been chosen recently as one of our guilds MTs.   I have been focusing on gear upgrades to get my hp and ac up so that I can tank more effectively for my guild as we're just starting planar progression.<br />
<br />
My thought was to upgrade my gear, get my hp and ac up and then work on aggro augs.  But after reading several posts here I'm beginning to think that I should probably invest in an anger II aug for my primary weapon and then build my adventure points back up to upgrade my gear.  I don't usually have a problem holding aggro but there are times that I do loose aggro (over nuking,  mistimed slows etc) and feel that I'm not doing my job as best as I could.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  This is my magelo profile and any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.  :) <br />

Or if you can tank hard it's only 5 adventures. Points will roll in steady of you just set your lfg tag to 'ldon only' :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">520 points for anger 2 is pretty cheap and well worth it.  I have the same weapon setup you have, except I have anger 2 in the CHSD and it works fine - although I'll still lose agro occasionally with zealous casters.  (not an issue on raids until the burn stage...my guild is pretty organized/disciplined)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, you have 2 rolls as MT - take the beating, and hold agro well enough so the real damage dealers can take it down.  The anger 2 aug will help a lot on the agro department.</div></div><hr />

Aggro is the key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are set on Anger II vs getting Anger III I would highly suggest you get the 100 pt Ykesha aug from the South Ro camp.  I think agro is highly comparable to Anger II and you will get a slight DPS boost out of it as well, plus I love breaking root :)<br />
<br />
And yes, I would work on getting aggro first and foremost by getting ldon augs.  While you do this you can work on AA's for tanking which will help quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go anger 2 on the chsd if thats your best mainhander.Anger 3 if you love grinding ldons hehe.Aggro augs have the highest impact on our job performance out of any upgrades in group  LDON imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend getting Anger 3 and putting it on your CHSD. Let your gear upgrades come through raiding, it would be a shame to spend 1500 points on an armor piece only to see a better item drop on a raid you can use.<br />
<br />
But you know what your guild is capable of killing and how often you raid. Whatever you buy (armor or augment) try and make sure you will use it for a long time.<br />
<br />
Ex. 40hps aug on Ornate BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear has alot of decent upgrade options.  I'd recommend first putting either the anger 2 or 510 pt yak on your CHSD.  Then work on getting a couple ranks of weapon affinity (WA).  Should be plenty of agro.<br />
<br />
If you have some decently geared friends you should see notable upgrades in hard ldon at the finger/ear/hand/wrist/feet spots.  I'd avoid using LDON pts to buy +40hp +10ac augs until you have spots you plan on locking down in terms of upgrades for at least the next 6 months (my personal rule of thumb).  You may also wish to consider the 760 legs from MiR and the 1492 (select pieces) from the the Nro camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, anger2 in the CHSD first.  If you are starting to work on elemental progression now I'd hold off buying the expensive augs on gear you are likely to upgrade - eg, your BP will last you a long time, but I wouldnt spend 1150 for HP augs on any of your other slots at this stage.  As for buying the armour with LDoN points, if you plan on finishing elemental flags then you have your eye on Raex, LDoN just doesnt compare.  In the mean time pick up more Helanic tundra in your weaker slots - grab the legs and one bracer to start, and you'll be in good shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fafnir</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever anyone wants to guage how good of a tank you are, they will ask you your HP and AC - that usually means that vanity makes you want to improve those slots.<br />
<br />
But if you actually want to impress folks with your play, it is agro that you need - it makes you a good tank, not just a pretty Magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Eoden your gear is not worth to aug since I am certain that you will get better upgrade most of it. If aug anything I'd go with bp and bloodmetal earings, but Anger for main hand would serve you best. Also finish ND3 before any other AAs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good info but I would also aug the Copper with anger 2.  I would use anger over yak procs for the lack of push, after doing the grind to EP's I hate push procs.  Very few peeps have any freaking icea about push.   Finish you def AA,s and mix in a few WA's and wait for good drops while raiding.  Think about the Loyalist Shield (50ac 75 hp back) and Horn Spiked shoulders (21 ac 65 hp) both easy to get.  I found that to mnay times I needed aggro now not in 10 sec, back spawn in middle of camp and mobs start killing casters, you cant wait long for a proc, the more you have the better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brannwen</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the great advice and information.  I decided to get the Anger II aug, mostly because I had already accumulated about 534 points and most everyone agreed that the Anger II would be best.  I put that on my chsd and OMG what a HUGE difference!  I was tanking in an LDoN with some friends and once I got aggro I didn't loose it.  Even when a monk friend of mine intentionally tried to pull aggro. (this is assuming of course that the aug actually proc'd)  Even had a mage guildy compliment me while tanking in HOH saying &quot;***damn you're a good tank&quot;.  Now that was music to my big barbie ears.<br />
<br />
I know I have a lot of weak spots in my gear, and I've been LDoNing a lot to earn points specifially for gear.  My thought was to upgrade gear pieces that will last for a while and aug only the new pieces.  The exception would be my BP, my earrings and my one Ornate bracer.  All the rest will be upgraded either through raids or LDoN then augs added later.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for all the advice. You all are awesome!!!  :)</div></div><hr />
