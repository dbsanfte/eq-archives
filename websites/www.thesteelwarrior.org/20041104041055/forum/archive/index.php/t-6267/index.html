<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question about going with emp's 1hand sword or waiting on a Enrageing Blow wepon, my guild killed XTC as often as we can get em, but hes being stingy. <br />
<br />
Cursed's Bloodfrenzy is out of the question seeing as we have Asian raiders killing him. AoW Blade of Carnage allso when ever we have the chance to kill him and he allso have been really bad at giveing us a BoC.. he has only given us 1 so far.<br />
<br />
So anyways Should i get a Acrylia Handled Broadsword and aug it with a Anger 3 for main hand.. i have a Chord Hilted Spike Driver with Anger 2 at the moment that i could put in off hand just wondering if that should give me efficient hate for raids or i should wait on EB wepon? any help is apreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used my emp 2hs for mting for a long long time, even after I got my bloodfrenzy, you might consider getting that and auging it with anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I would save my wins for an enraging blow weapon. I am not sure if your guild is a DKP guild, or what. People often say putting a hate aug on a weapon without hate often ruins it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the sword with Anger 2 was to lazy to save up for Anger 3 it's a decent weapon but I think I made a mistake.  Now thought I don't have a choice as I'm to low on points to get another weapon.  If you are next in line for an EB weapon I would just wait.  Besides the graphic looks dumb :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can't get a BF I'd do some bot tower runs and get a GBoS.  I have one and it is an excellent weapon, with anger III in it it would be equal or very close to a BoC for aggro and better dps.  You take a hit on hps compared to the emp sword, but it should be better aggro.  Also looks very nice :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I outaggro the other warriors in my guild with my GBoS with Anger III, they are using BoC without augment.<br />
<br />
I got myself a CHSD last night and am close to my 2nd Anger III augment. As far as I know CHSD has better aggro (but less dps) then GBoS...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks for the reply guys. guild is working on Vex Thal and Ssra alot.. we are allmost ready to get PoP flaging and VT.. i hate pick up raids couse they are unfair and lose out on GBoS but i was looking at the GBoS.. but yeah the hps and stats are not that great and was thinking about the Acrylia blade from Emperor. I probly will get it becouse of the Dps.. im not next in line for a EB any warrior in my guild can bid there isnt a list.. anyways thanks again :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you want a DPS weapon stay clear of 1 handers.  All the best DPS weapons at your level are 2 handers like BBB, emp sword and GSo4W</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dont wish to get a Emp blade couse my pally friends really need em.. i love DW hehe so ill go with the Acrylia Sword.. killed Cursed tonight but no BF.. figures :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use a BoC and an AHBS both with Anger2 augments and I have np whatsoever holding aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lifetaps in general are crap for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">unless youre looking for a low aggro dps weapon, i'd leave the AHBS for rangers/rogs and that crowd.  burning an anger3 augment on a weapon without an innate aggro proc is a waste.  if you have access to an AHBS, you have access to quite a few good taunting weapons.<br />
<br />
if all else fails ... get 1-2 groups of friends and kill SW tower in BoT for a GBoS .. it puts out less dps, but i'd wager it would be the hell out of an AHBS for aggro.</div></div><hr />
