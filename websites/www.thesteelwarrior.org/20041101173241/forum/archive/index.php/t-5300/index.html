<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm the MT(8200hp/1440ac) of one of those &quot;small family guilds&quot; and we had our first 2 kills in NorthToV this weekend(ikatiar and eashan)<br />
<br />
the kills were rather easy, we just have problems getting into the hatchling room...someone always aggro's on the way there...<br />
<br />
what i'm curious about is what is the difficulty of other mobs in relation to these guys...like, since we were able to kill Ikatiar and eashan w/o any problems, what are some others we could kill along the lines of those 2? typicle raid force is about 24-30 with 5 clerics all lvl 65(maybe a straggler thats 60-64)<br />
<br />
fesh or dagron? kriezan or any of the Lady's?<br />
<br />
most of the guild is equip'd about how i am(random ornate and drops from places like kael, HOT, UP, tactics)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pulling trash mobs will present more problems then the actual named mobs will.<br />
<br />
You and 3 of those clerics could kill 75% of the named dragons in NToV.<br />
<br />
The only mobs I see giving you any trouble, are Aary, Lady Nev, and Lord Vyemm.<br />
<br />
Providing you have the strategy down, those won't even be all that hard.<br />
<br />
My guild went through NToV with no tank over 7500 buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shoulda have no problem killing them all.<br />
<br />
need to keep aaryroynar or however you spell it, out of line of sight of healers so they dont get hit by the dot, other than that the only one that might be hard is splitting up the triplets &amp; that one in the left hand corner as you go into ntov that has the gflux ae cant remember its name been a while :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aary was the first of the tough ones then lord Vymm and in some cases Lady Ny with her stun  when I remember well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You'll most likely have to kill Aaryonar in order to get to any of the others in NToV, which means you'll have to learn to dodge AE's if you haven't already.  Once you've killed Aary, you can do all of the NToV dragons.  The ones likely to give you trouble the first time through are Lord Vyemm (toughest of the lot, knockback and only disease slowable), Zlexak (biggest dd ae, and ae slow), and Lady Nevederia (Lots of hps, spinstun+dot).<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate the flurry drakes, but you should be fully capable of everything in NToV except for the ring of vulak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a non kos mage CoH you to the drakeling corner! Avoid agroing wyverns and crap. Just CoH a warrior, the a cleric and have everyone start fighting the drakes as they get summoned. I think they are 20min respawn? Haven't been there for a while so can't say for sure.<br />
<br />
Lord Vyemm - Actually very easy, first dragon my guild did back in velious, only one death and that was right after defensive wore off and Vyemm got a couple of lucky max hits in on the main tank. 2ndary tank took over and all was good. Just make sure all other melee are not in front of him (to avoid 1100+ dmg ripostes) and that they also do not have their backs towards Vulak's chamber (the big lava pool) or they will get blown over the edge. Since Vyemm is rooted, you can debuff him ahead of time all you want and then mem blur, have tank use incite to agro, then go hog wild. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild did a twink run of NToV on a Saturday a few weeks back.  I dont think they used a chain on any of the dragons, just one cleric on CH and one doing patch heals if needed.<br />
<br />
NToV is all about where to stand, get that right and you'll be seeing loot rot in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aary is the test to see if your guild has the skill to get in and isnt a bunch of zerging noobs. most of the big fights is placing your casters so they are hidden from AEs while keeping your tank positioned to he's in range of the healers. a few of the mobs you'll need to learn push control and wall pinning. also, you want to have some one calling out the AEs for the casters to run in, cast, and hide. usually you have about 10 seconds to do this once an AE is fired. you can have 1 of the tanks or othe melee people call for the casters to go. another little trick is to have the melees back out at 50% health to the spot healers and call for a spot heal, druids usually work for this. you dont want your healers running out there and taking AE damage. then they have to burn mana healing them selves. bards and pallies are probalby the most important classes for dealing with AEs. try to get a bard in the MT group and 1 pally in as many of the melee heavy groups possible. <br />
vyemm is probably the only exception since there is no place to hide, but he's not that bad anymore. just use fast heals instead of CH. <br />
since no one mentioned the flurry drakes, killing them can some times be harder than the named mobs. you'll need a 3 to 5 warrior defensive chain. come to think of it, the flurries should be alot easier now with the disc change, you can now open up with furious disc while the debuff chain gets them slowed. basicly, you tell teh raid, warrior_01 is tanking, monk pulls in a flurry, raid kills it, and then you tell the raid, warrior_02 is the next tank, and so on. <br />
just in case you didnt learn this in HoT, make sure everyone is standing when mobs are inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the advice guys, i really appriciate it..<br />
<br />
One more question: i've browesed Alla's and cant find any info on flurry drakes.  Which mobs are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">in ntov you have several drakes, each drakes starting with a upper case letter is a flurry drake, also each roaming name drake is a flurry drake ( well not sure about names in fact but as far as I remind it's the case ).<br />
For exemple &quot;A glimmer drake&quot; = flurry drake while &quot;a glimmer drake&quot; is not.</div></div><hr />

One more question: i've browesed Alla's and cant find any info on flurry drakes.  Which mobs are they?  <br />
<br />
Flurry drakes are:<br />
<br />
Any NAMED ROAMING drake, such as Cyndor Lightningwing (the black named drakes guarding the Lord/Lady dragons are pets, they are NOT flurry drakes), and ANY drake that has a capitalized defender name such as &quot;An Onyx Defender&quot;  &quot;A Emerald Defender&quot;, etc... if the word defender is there but not capitalized its is not a flurry drake.  Blue ones *will* gate so mana sieve them, I don't recally if any new stuns work on them, but I don't believe they do.   <br />
<br />
Flurry drakes hit for 750, with low delay and flurry a lot (which is why they have the name flurry drakes).. They are slowable and have a lot of HP compared to the other drakes.   Have your debuffers land every attack debuff they can on them, will make them nearly trivial at your level. However, even slowed  they pump out quite a bit of DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yiktin Voxbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And if ya decide to camp out on the bridge @ Vulak area, DO NOT Move too far out onto bridge. Nothing says Love like an unexpected run @ RoV :p .<br />
<br />
Traditionally, we use a non KoS CoH mage to call to the corner above the hatchlings and in sight of Roy (Aary) and his guards.<br />
Pull the hatchlings carefully once have 1-2 grps there, call rest of raid , then do Eashen, then Ikky, Roy and the 1st perma-rooted one, Feshlak(Thanks fer the BP)<br />
<br />
Although ..... A while back we gathered only to find NO CoH guys on, we killed our way to Feshlaks lair from the ent, some mobs along way drop quest armor pieces now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you can kill Aary you can do just about any other named in NToV. I know when we first broke into NToV we had trouble with Aayr but once he went down we pretty much cleared the rest of it without many problems. Flurry Drakes can be a raid wiper though especially if more than 2 or 3 get pulled since they can go through tanks like butter if they team up. btw if Im tanking flurry drakes I use evasive to cut down on their dps and tell my fellow tanks to do the same.<br />
<br />
GL NToV is one of my favorite zones, it would be better if Lady N dropped her damn cloak</div></div><hr />
