<br />
300 hate(unresistable) vs. 125dd amd 0sec stun.<br />
<br />
 Which will be more hate? Anger is more expensive(1150pt vs 760). But unresistable. Just curious mostly, have a good way to go before getting either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Force of Ykesha is definately not unresistable )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well from what i understand... people prefer GBoS over CHSD.<br />
I know this aint about subject but look at it this way:<br />
CHSD is 450 hate and people prefer the stun over 450 hate so i'd say go with Ykesha one....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some people prefer it, though that's as much from the better damage due to proc/ratio as it is from the proc itself. So not a very good answer. I'm curious which effect, on the same weapon, will add more total hate. I suspect it's Ykesha, but not sure.<br />
<br />
 Oh and Yak effects have 1 foot push to help also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to take into account the Anger effects are 1h only also while the ykesha ones are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye thats the sole reason im looking straight at ykesha is cause you cant even put anger on a BoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SSharlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ykesha on a BoW would be nice, but so would some augs for Plane of Time weapons like Ethereal destroyer and Edge of Eternity,  anyone come across any yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anger3 is 1H only ?<br />
<br />
Fuck just wasted 600 points in MM while i could had been in GUK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, I didn't know anger wash 1h only.  I had chosen to go for the stun proc for a couple reasons: 1) I think the stun will be more aggro than 300 hate, even resisted, 2) You get to proc a DD (which I rarely have had dd procs before!), 3) The text message for anger is the same as enraging blow, so I'd never knew whether I procced 700 hate or 200/300.  That's an issue for me.<br />
<br />
The 1 pushback on ykesha is actually the worst thing, imho.  Hopefully the added aggro will make mobs stick to you like glue so you can move them back into position if nessessary *grin*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I bought the Force of Ykesha proc last night and put it into my BoW. I'm really happy with it. Every second or third round I proc either EB or Ykesha, and the added agro is pretty noticeable in exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ya did the same here as Raaj and its a nice additional bit of agro and some dps. It does get resisted some - but hey resisted stun spells still get some agro :)<br />
<br />
Oh and fully debuffed Fennin wasn't resisting Ykesha procs much if at all yesterday :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll be adding Force of Ykesha to my BoW as well tonight, looks to be the best choice.  Still have the uber floating skull graphic or something new?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll go with ykesha too.<br />
<br />
Even if you could put anger on any weapon, it's still 2 1/3 less hate then enraging blow (700).<br />
<br />
What would you prefer? 2 1/3 stun + around 300 dmg or enraging blow?  Assuming you choose the stun portion then choosing ykesha over anger is the logical choice.<br />
<br />
It's also more versatile being more dps and a stun then straight up hate.<br />
<br />
I guess no news of wrath of ykesha yet? I saw the 1492 guk items somewhere and it wasn't in there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KhalimBloodhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I been wondering about Wrath of Ykesha also.  I'm thinking that it must be a raid dropped augment.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't care that much.  25 dd is not worth all the extra trouble, the 125 dd/100 dd is plenty for me, since the dd is not the real aggro creator anyways.  <br />
<br />
Gonna put Ykesha procs on both my 1hs weapons (BoC and GBoS) and will put it on BoW when I get one, eventually =\<br />
<br />
I'm actually gonna try getting that Lifetap proc and putting it on my BBB.  I use BBB for when I'm not tanking or for groups where I don't need to worry much about losing aggro and need more DPS, so I'm thinking that the Rune3 + Lifetap proc will make for a pretty nice weapon when not tanking (i.e. healing or avoiding major damage from AE's or stray ripostes. ) Makes me more self sufficient =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Still have the uber floating skull graphic or something new?<br />

Same graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sweet, and the higher up Wrath of Ykesha is said to be a raid drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just in case somebody gets the wrong idea: the stun component of ykesha won't land on mobs over lvl 55.  The agro is just the same though, would be nice if the more expansive versions had a higher lvl cap.<br />
<br />
Best part is hearing the uninformed wizard on a raid say: WTF, somebody using a SSOY?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">All the yak augs proc at the same rate or the cheapest ones proc a little less often than the one dropped in raid or the 760 something point expensive one ?<br />
Coz if they all proc at the same rate, i'll get the cheapest one... not really interrested in the dd part of it anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Curious, what do you guys think of Guard? I already have like 500 points at MM because I didn't really know better, and there's a Guard II mod available in MM for 510. From what I understand, it's actually a very decent proc. I've seen more than a few people put a Guard proc on BoW. So, what do you guys think; Ykesha or Guard II?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am pondering the exact same question, Wilhelmm.  To me the question is answered if the Guard proc aggros.<br />
<br />
To anyone with Guard: does it aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well I keep asking the question but it seem to me that guard suck more and more.<br />
<br />
Apparently you can't even get a proc with guard IV (limited to spell) which leave the best guard at a 150 pts rune.<br />
<br />
It should aggro like a rune but still, warrior need all the dps they can get and with a stun, ykesha look like a very interesting package to me.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone will convince me of something else eventually, but I doubt it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">hmm, after re-reading the FoH  board remarks about Guard, it really does suck. Guess I'll have to buy the 10ac upgrade for my points in MM and go for Ykesha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the anger from MM is 2her and the other anger is 1her only.  Someone came up with a link of a BoW augmented with anger 3 so I can only assume that the one from MM is for 2hers.  I still don't know if I want to put anger 3 (if this is true) or yak on my BoW, will see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Stuck Force of Ykesha in my BoW last night, works nicely so far, although the stun is resisted by damn near everything it does seem to add more aggro then I had before.

I think the anger from MM is 2her and the other anger is 1her only.  You can't buy anger at MM, just Mir.  The list everyone uses was wrong and it has since been removed.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I find stun generates almost no hate in LDoN dungeons I am not sure if yo just had bad luck or lame people in your group. My warrior has been taking LDoN for groups of VT+ people and on occassion Time equipped people and I haven't had any agro problems weilding Copper Hammer+Bloodsworn. Procs still keep the mob off the healer and slower and in the cases I don't get a proc the DPS has been enough to get the mob off people in 1 or 2 taunts. Even against people with far superior DPS.<br />
<br />
Personally, I will be adding Ykesha procs to my weapons.</div></div><hr />

How did you &quot;find&quot; this?  Stun is the same aggro everywhere.  <br />
<br />
In a few adventures I tried using my typical dual wield setup of EoE primary, bloodfrenzy offhand and found I could not hold aggro until the bloodfrenzy procced. After watching a few early timesnap procs being unable to hold aggro against a cleric with a time hammer that procs a small group heal + DD or a paladin with hopebringer which also procs a small group heal I swapped the bloodfrenzy into primary and had less problems holding aggro since the EB procs were more frequent.<br />
<br />
I asked a couple of other guild warriors with EoE and they found it wasnt holding aggro as well or felt it varied wildly. Finally I talked to a couple of pallies and they felt their stuns didnt have the same effect either and so they were resorting to group heals when they really needed the aggro. (Maybe the stun aggro cant keep up with the hate generated by a group firing all cylinders?) EoE's proc was far better in PoP against the sub-65 mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, for the last 15-20 adventures I've been using BoW almost exclusively and the aggro has definitely been far better than EoE primary, bloodfrenzy offhand. Hard to compare with bloodfrenzy primary since I only used that for a couple of adventures.</div></div><hr />

Actually I've had to pull out BBB if I want to do dps on time gods lately since I'll end up dead with bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yeah but BoW would probably give you zero problems getting aggro even without the augment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if what everyone thinks is true woudn't add the aug to the troll wepon give you 4 yak procs and that much more agro?  Procs are only part of the agro equation. You have to be able to keep that agro between procs and that is done with some combination of DPS and speed of weapons. Smithed Yaks weigh in at 12/21 with pitiful stats and SSoYs are a dismal 8/24. Why on earth would you want to weild either of these weapons when you can just get a Copper Hammer and a Sword of the Bloodsworn?<br />
<br />
It's not that the agro from the procs is less than expected, its that the weapons suck ass and are easily replaced with better and easy to obtain weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>dian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I just got the 100dd ykesha and i am debating which weapon i should aug. Currently i have BoC, Agnarr 1hs, Obsidian Greatblade (procs taunting blow) and CHSD. Usually when i tank i will engage with 2 1handers first then switch to 2hander. Eventually I will get the 125dd ykesha and most likely Anger3, but for the time being, i just wanna put the aug into the most effective use. <br />
<br />
thank you in advance for the advice. just some background information, i have 6800+ hp unbuffed and 230aa, patiently waiting for a BoWar but my guild has been really unlucky in getting BoWar like 1 in 15 kills or something like that. i am not the next in line, but i might be close to that (unknown due to dictation).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>marcin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">As for DD vs. stun, firsthand exp when I (wizard) am MAing for LDON groups and I need to hold aggro, I most certainly use a cycle of Telekin(works on 65), Tishan's clash (stun effect doesn't land) and Tishan's discord (stun effect doesn't land), over and over and over instead of using the plenty of raw DD available to me.  Stuns generate a -much- larger amount of aggro even when resisted component in comparison to DD.<br />
<br />
Chain casting draughts doesn't keep a mob hating me when I've got a hasted rogue with just an mm poker, let alone dod/ifir combos.  Stuns work just fine.<br />
<br />
Why do you think it is the whole paladin aggro debate exists in the first place? Its not because of their uber dd taunting.<br />
<br />
Ykesha all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The point is, they're NOT the same spell, so the way they are coded for stuns is not the same as the old one is, simply because of the age.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Fulorian, as I've already stated, the new Ykesha was grandfathered from the old Ykesha, the evidence being that the raw spell data, resist check, resist modifier, spell graphic, text message on proc, duration of stun, and even the spell line name (IE Ykesha) and level restriction on the stun are all the same.<br />
<br />
As all available evidence points to the fact that the new Ykesha's stun is exactly the same as the old 9with the sole exception of the DD component variable, which is not at issue here), what evidence do you have that we do not, that proves that the Ykesha is in fact, coded differently?<br />

The obsidian greatblade is a great weapon before BoW, i'd strongly recommend putting a stun proc on that to the previous poster.  :)</div></div><hr />

Anyhow, after the next major patch, this whole DB/BoW debate will probably become moot. 125 Ykesha auged Darkblade + 100 ykesha/anger3 auged EoE + GoCS/SoPMwill  pwn everything agrowise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">My observations with the Darkblade agree with Demorgoth's.  After using a darkblade for a week after using an augmented Blade of War, there is NO QUESTION in my mind that the augmented blade of war is the king of warrior weapons as of this post.<br />
<br />
After killing a dozen people in my guild by tanking Terris Thule with a darkblade tonight, I backpacked it.  The fight before Terris, I had an opportunity to tank one of the phase 3 bosses, while an augmented BoW warrior tanked the other.  The result?  1 wizard dead on my mob, another aggroed.  An SK and even a beastlord aggroed on my mob.  The augmented BoW warrior had zero mob turns, even with me procing several times on his mob.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine anyone using the darkblade with a shield.  Wish they'd just make it a 2h like Furor posted earlier.  And for the love of god, make Anger at least 750 hate instead of 650, so its better than EB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Cardinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Having both a VDD and a Yk aug'd BoW,  its very clear that the Aug'd BoW owns VDD aggro wise.  While the VDD does win out in overall DPS, the difference in the DPS is not adequate to overcome the &quot;snap&quot; aggro of the combined EB and Yk proc.  Playing aggro wars with another VDD wielding warrior on trash mobs, it was ping pong aggro whilst both used VDD, but once I swapped in aug'd BoW, solid aggro.  While its only anecdotal,  it certainly goes to the overall &quot;feel&quot; that the Aug'd BoW is a very hot weapon right now.<br />
<br />
... and as an aside, can often easily pull aggro off a DBotW wielding war with VDD, cannot say the same once that war swaps in an aug'd BoW.   If the augment rules change at patch allowing more augs to fit into type 8 slots...  will be very interesting to see a yk aug'd VDD vs. aug'd BoW or and Aug'd DBotW.  My guess is the BoW is going to still reign supreme, VDD still holding over the DBotW....   time will tell...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">After not loosing agro in a 24 minute fight against the revamped Innoruk in PoH i am in love with my Ykesha augmented BoW.<br />
<br />
Didnt loose agro at all even against a time enabled rogue we have in guild which happened regularly before.<br />
<br />
On a side note: one of the younger warriors grabbed the Anathema that dropped (aside from bracer and the ft3 caster headpiece) and when we downed pyronius in fire afterwards and i went down to enrage (disc dropped the second before and 2 3.5k hits suck when you are around 40percent life) it was him grabbing instant agro over a warrior using bloodfrenzy/BoC.<br />
<br />
Used to be similar before our MA retired that i grabbed instant agro (he was using BoW, augmented right before he quit with ykesha and aten gloves) if he died, so it might be a nice choice although i have to say the encounter is pretty hard with adds and ae rampage and i cannot say how drop rate is after a single kill (not to mention i think it was the first one on Terris after revamp of PoH).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Yeah, Lucy showed some good changes to Angers today.... still nothing on if they are being changed to 2hander usable though.<br />
<br />
I don't have experience with Anger procs, but from what I understand, they proc as much as the Ykesha ones? Would turn any 1hander with 100+hp and a decent ratio into a ghetto Bloodfrenzy. I think I am putting Anger III on my Vallon sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">From the proc rates I've seen, anger 3 would turn a BoC into ~ BF aggro, and a BF into a proccing machine. I really hope they do make this 2h augmentable. That would really increase their worth. Ykesha is still more DPS, but 600 hate is likely better straight aggro per proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">From some other tests it should be that the procrate of identical augements are identical and not in line with the proc rate of the weapon. That means they normally have 2 proc minute on a Boc a bow or a BF ( with 255 dex ).</div></div><hr />

Nice, they are finally worth it now. To bad everyone has ykesha procs =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Infact, if they make anger3 go on 2hers, im sure alot of people will delete their FoY augments and put anger on it instead :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
750dd + 150dd +75dd + 600hate +600hate = Lock to make paladin cry &quot;Warriors are overpowered!&quot;  Hell it might actually give augmented VDD or BoW a run for its money... Thats just a sick amount of aggro heh.</div></div><hr />

Can this aug be added to an Edge of Eternity? EoE's slot is type 8 or something so this has me confused... I'm a Ldon newb someone help me out here! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Moze Emdoyne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Most (if not all) of the available type4 proc's have type8 duplicates now... buahahahaha :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I think them having a type 8 duplicate is very very nice.  To make sure that uber guys stay way ahead indeed that was a good decision IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I have augmented my Blade of War with the Ykesha proc, and I also have Aten gloves (call of fire proc.)<br />
<br />
So basically, my weapon taunts with:<br />
<br />
Enraging blow (+700 hate)<br />
Call of Fire (65dd 0.0 sec stun)<br />
Force of Ykesha (125dd 0.0 sec stun)<br />
High DPS for consistant agro, while not proccing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imo, it's overkill. I think I'd be better off putting a Guard type augment on it, instead of Ykesha.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>grogi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Now that the Anger values have doubled, is Anger 2 &gt; Strike of Ykesha and Anger3 &gt; Force of Ykesha???<br />
<br />
Last month I aug'd my BoC with Strike of Ykesha the second I had the points, seemed most bang for the buck at the time.   I've notice after using the aug for about a month now, that the Ykesha proc works decent, but not nearly as well as the EB proc.  I realize the EB proc is 700 hate, so I'm trying to figure out where in the hate values the Ykesha's are.<br />
<br />
My question is....  Should I go ahead and re-aug the BoC with Anger2, or better yet Anger3?  Or is the trade-off between Ykesha vs Anger not that noticable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Anger 3 will be better aggro.  Even anger 2 will be better aggro then a stun but why waste points? Just wait for anger 3.<br />
<br />
Also at this point, after seeing 2 logs for 30 minutes normal adventures where force of ykesha did a wooping 600-800 dmg, I'm not convinced since it's basically always resisted that going with pure anger 3 is the way to go.  Even thought since I already have the force on my Bow Ill keep it that way for a while.<br />

Confirmed by a guildmate who has 1150 points in sro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Magumas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Well, I have the Anger II from Mir and stuck it into my SBOD and it's so far doing a great job. I haven't had to much problem with agro.  However, I got it before the upgrade and was wondering if it too does the 400 hate like the upgrade one does?  I know I should of waited for Anger III (1150 points), but at the time when I got it there was only a difference of 100 hate.. Didnt think it was worth the extra points for 100 hate.. <br />
<br />
BTW, havent tried this with any augs as of yet, but does it go poof when you take it out?  Just wondering incase I upgrade.. <br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Yes it is 400 haye now on your weapon..<br />
Yes it will poof when you remove it..<br />
And imo yes it was worth those extra points even for 100 more hate coz you can never have enough aggro, btw now you missing 200 hate :(</div></div><hr />
