<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW was fun for a while but I didn't expect to play that long. I'm not sad about leaving. it'll suck to not cut up with the friends I've made, but the game is just so monotonous now.<br />
<br />
I've arrived at an unsatisfactory crossroads. I've two pieces from full Valor, I use a Fist of Omokk and Argent Avenger/Wall of the Dead, and I stick with a 31-5-15 spec that works for me in all situations. for me to even finish my goals - a Doomsaw, full Valor, Drac shield, and better jewellery - I really have two choices. one, I can attempt to join the top guild on the server that is full of awesome people but has a strong emphasis on raiding. I don't want to feel compelled by guild guidelines to raid when I don't feel like raiding. plus, they don't even really raid strat/ubrs/scholo as a guild anymore, it's mostly Molten Core which would destroy me, not only due to my gear but due to the time investment. two, I can continue to raid in pickups that are so hit or miss it's not funny. half the people are good but half are just awful goobs that are the curse of Blizz's flexible leveling structure.<br />
<br />
I see warriors who lack skill and manners and humor that have gear equivalent to mine. it's like higher end gear should be a mark of some skill, not merely putting in the hours and getting lucky on rolls. they still get on raids even though they're horrid - and let's be frank, pulling and holding aggro is usually not a challenge. I've made a decent name for myself, but having to be the main assist and/or tank for most raids I join, in addition to making sure the adds are tanked as well because a lot of warriors let adds bounce around a lot, is tiring. I hear a guildie talk about raids he's on where these suckass warriors are the main tanks and mobs are ping ponging everywhere and somehow these guys squeak out of the raid with one of the few items I'd like. I am relieved when one or two other warriors that know what the fuck they're doing join a raid I am on, and this is kinda sad because spamming sunder and shield block then taunting when necessary is beyond easy. if you can't mix in bash/revenge/shouts, whatever, but ffs if you can't use three abilities to do your damn job I marvel at your ability to dress yourself in the morning.<br />
<br />
I'm annoyed at the clearly screwed up loot tables, the really weird random number generator. most of the time Rend drops bonespike shoulderpads and warmaster legguards. those exact two items most of the time. there's something really weird and bad about that.<br />
<br />
don't get me wrong, it's a brilliant game in which I enjoyed myself. but, the amount of retards at the high end really amazes me. some people like to crack on raiding guilds in EQ, saying that anyone who can /assist and not screw up too much can get in. I think that's definitely present in WoW, where any dork with too much time can get a full suit of class armor to impress the noobs and still be a bad player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I felt the same way about EQ.  <br />
<br />
I kinda expected it from WoW though with it being so casual friendly.  I hope that in future expansions they up the difficulty level to be more inline with what we grew accustomed to in the pre-PoP EQ days.<br />
<br />
Do you like to PvP much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes but again it gets old. right now it's just for fun so after a while you feel like it's just pointless. also the competition is so varied in skill. I hear a lot of people crack on alliance for being generally poor at pvp, but man at least half the hordies I have pvped have been absolute jokes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully the battlegrounds will address some the PvP monotony.  I think there's a lot they could do to make the PvP game more interesting and rewarding.  Things like player controlled dungons and zones and siege warfare.<br />
<br />
I believe in the upcoming patch they are going to put in some measures to help cut down on the kind of open raiding thats going on in the high end instances.  They're not going to up the loot tables in those zones till afterwards.  Maybe that'll help a lil bit in making it tougher for skilless idiots to get the best gear in the game.<br />
<br />
They're also adding 2 outside raid mobs so we can get some of the competition for spawns like there was in EQ.  I'm hoping they'll add an equal amount of camped spawns like that (ala EQ) along with harder instances that actually require the use of all your toons abilities and not just 1 or 2 tricks.<br />
<br />
I hated the way EQ ended up being either a popularity contest or a test of who could spend the most time behind their computer.  Neither is much of a measure of worth imo.  WoW, in its current state, is the exact opposite.  Everyone can get the same top end loot for minimal effort.  There's gotta be some sort of middle ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a problem I forsaw with WOW from day 1.    A game that has a &quot;raid&quot; game and &quot;solo&quot; game, always has a perpetual conflict.<br />
<br />
The conflict being at a certain point, it becomes near impossible to advance via solo work.   This enforces raiding.   Which may or may not be what you liked to do.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think they need to make Class Epic Gear Quests.   For people to work on either solo or for raiders to work on outside thier raid slots.<br />
<br />
Class Epic Gear quests should be roughly equal in quality to Molten Core Epic Gear and Battle Ground Epic Gear.   <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, because you are doing them solo, the effort should be extreme.   Look at it in a man-hour comparison.   I'm making up numbers since I currently dont feel like joining those top raid guilds....  If a MC raid takes 40 people 4 hours.   And those 40 people average 1 item per 5 raids.   Your looking at 800 Man Hours to get a piece of gear.   <br />
<br />
So making it take obniox amounts of time is acceptable.   Say heavy player, 4 hours a night, might take a a month and half to EARN one item.   So 150-200 hours.<br />
<br />
You can make these collect rare drops from all over.  You can make these kill quests of obnoxious amounts.   The tibermaw clan will reward you with new legs if you extermite the infected enemy.    Slay 2,000 of the enemy and you will shift the balance of power and be rewarded.<br />
<br />
Or the Wildhammer clan faces a dire threat of war with the nearby trolls.   We need to equip our forces.  Bring me 500 Thorium Bars to supply our army, and I will use some of it to craft you a pair of gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Or the Merchants of Gadgetstan realize that engineering is an expensive trade.<br />
Bring them 5,000 pieces of gold to fund thier research and you can buy thier latest prototype gun.<br />
<br />
Sure a single quest might take a month to complete.   But it all stuff you can work on at your own pace.   Dedicate to an item....   Work on outside raid hours...   Work on when you need a PVP break....   No pick up raids...  okay put a couple hours in...<br />
<br />
Basically, making it very time consuming will mean only a few will likely do it.<br />
But at least its an option rather than dead-ending char advancement or forcing to join a raid guild or forcing mass PVPing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know how you feel Isk.  As much as I love the fact that WoW is very solo-friendly and so casual, I do understand there is a benefit to harder progression.  Unfortunately, it's not very easy for a computer game to reward people based on skill while also giving a raid-game reward.  <br />
<br />
Raids, due to the amount of people present, usually boil down each class to their place in the holy trio of MMOGs (Tank, Healer, DPS).  And with that large amount of people, there is either going to be plenty of room for error where skill isn't needed as much, or every person is going to have to be at their best 100% of the time for you to succeed.  This is one main reason I fail to be impressed by the idea of a raiding-only end-game.  I don't believe raids can ever be balanced where it isn't either a cake walk due to the room for error or require a &quot;hardcore only need apply&quot; club to succeed because of no room for error.  As you take away from one side, you start giving to the other, and I personally don't think a middle-ground actually exists.  <br />
<br />
One area of frustration I've noticed many people having is in the aspect of skill.  You've said so yourself, it is completely frustrating to have a situation where a low-skilled player is being rewarded the same as a highly-skilled player because the raids are so easy that it's really more time-spent-based instead of skill-based.  Reminds me somewhat of the arguments between raiders and non-raiders in EQ, where non-raiders wanted to be rewarded for their time...just like raiders were.  I knew many raiders who were less skilled as clerics than I was, but they had high end gear because they were willing to tag along on raids and be reduced to a CH-bot.<br />
<br />
Certainly a &quot;hardcore only need apply&quot; will weed out the lesser skilled and reward the higher skilled for their efforts, but this setup almost always requires a large amount of time spent as well.  Any raid leader will know that being able to gather 24+ high skilled people is very hard.  Heck, being able to keep track of a large number of people is difficult by itself, although skilled players make things easier in this regard.  It seems that large raids and long periods of gaming go hand-in-hand.  What guild wants to gather 40-60 people for a raid, for it to simply be over in an hour or 2 (other than individual players who need a hand in a step of a quest)?  They'll take that large group of people and do several targets, making it a long raid.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those people who believe that, overall, single-group encounters are just as difficult as raid-group encounters (sometimes more) due to a lack of numbers/resources to draw from.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have a system where skill is the major factor in being rewarded instead of merely time spent playing?<br />
<br />
The tibermaw clan will reward you with new legs if you exterminate the infected enemy. Slay 2,000 of the enemy and you will shift the balance of power and be rewarded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now THAT I like!   :D  Going after single targets with a group of 40 people just seems cheap, and lacking skill.  I prefer odds closer to 1 to 1 than 40 to 1...unless that's 40 enemies to 1 player.  :D <br />
<br />
I think it is possible to reward skill of the players instead of time spent, but developers just can't seem to come up with ways to achieve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and yes I know my response wasn't technically what Isk was talking about, but I'd been thinking about that issue for a while and it just came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varatho</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know Isk, it's a game, an activity engaged in for diversion or amusement as it were. People who play games can have talent or skill or just be plain lucky to get by at it. Such is the nature of games.<br />
<br />
I hated raiding in EQ, it was long, headache causing, stressful, and all in all it was just way too much like working. Working, that thing that you do so that you can get food and pay bills and all that annoying necessary stuff. <br />
<br />
People seriously remember; a game is not work; you do it so that you may be entertained and distracted from things such as work. If you are playing a game and all you can think about is advancement, it's no longer a game, and it&#8217;s your new job. Of course you are going to be unhappy with a job that eats up huge amounts of your spare time and pays nothing ( hell it pays less than nothing, you have to pay for it! )  <br />
<br />
The only recommendations I can make are quit your &quot;job&quot; and do other things every once in a while. Then if you feel like it come back every once in a while to do it again. But then again you already quit ( or so it seems ). Just make sure you don't fall back into what made you do that again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey now, save your lectures :p advancement is part of the fun for me. I like to feel like I'm improving both in regards to my character's stats and my own skill and knowledge. as soon as it starts feeling like a job, I either take a break or stop playing entirely (like now). <br />
<br />
another part of the fun is playing with funny, dependable players. I mean, if I didn't like doing this, I'd just play D2 all the time. yes, it's the nature of the beast for suck players to get lucky, but I don't have to like it and I'm still tired of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">03-19-2005, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reward system of WoW is too lenient, the method used in EQ to progress is even more fucked up. You need to manipulate people while keeping your eyes on your own interest. Need epic? Assemble raids, take favors/spend DKP. Need quest done, call in favors/DKP/raids. Need flags? same shit. Want something from guild? Manipulate/DKP/raids/favors. All this means spend a lot more time doing other things than just sit back and enjoy the game. Jump guilds when the time is right, make diplomatic statements when something screws up. Filth. Even if you are honest you'll see so much of these things makes one hate the system. For example, a new cheerful cleric guy joins your guild, gets flagged, gets his epic and jumps while having the nerve to write up a 'goodbye sorry kthx' post on your guild forums. I bet everyone has experienced this. While you yourself don't want to/can't jump to a higher level guild like that cleric. Then you need huge colossal amounts of time to get all the levels and AA's and DKP's in order to get what you want. Your gaming skill or did you deserve all that is not included in the package obviously. This is, sadly, EQ's progression system. While I agree with Isk, I sure as hell hope EQ's reward system does not find its way into WoW with future content. There has to be another way.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, tbh, I am also feeling burnt out. It's been a few weeks that I've done anything significant or advanced in level past 58 which I was last month. The rested exp bar divider has probably hit 60. I only login to duel / pvp a while or say hello to friends. Maybe it's just a burn out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I didn't have resist gear sets to work on for resists I don't need at all right now but figured i'd get a head start... I'd have almost nothing to do ;)<br />
<br />
It's all the time without a content patch thats doing it. The update to scholo/strath should make those more fun, and adding dire maul gives me more to do with friends. That'll keep people busy temporarily, but the honor system and battlegrounds are pretty sorely needed, then patches on minimal 3 month intervals for more content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I have the exact same problem.  All of my &quot;regular&quot; group got burnt after a bit at 60, so now my choices are either group with dimwits or mine for thorium endlessly =/<br />
<br />
Kotor II is pretty good though :)</div></div><hr />

Ugh!) is that I keep a list of things I would like to do. Places I haven't been. Quests I haven't done. Farming cash for an epic mount, etc. So far it has staved off the total burnout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty die hard set on PvP being the more interesting rules, but like many of you, I lack the groups to do the things I want to.   That doesn't stop me from trying tho.  Right now it's just me and a shaman 99% of the time, so more firepower = more stuff we can do.<br />
<br />
Something to consider.</div></div><hr />
