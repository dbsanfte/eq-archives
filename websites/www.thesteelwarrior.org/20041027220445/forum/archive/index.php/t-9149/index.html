<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any info on this guy that people are willing to share?  Hps, how hard he hits, etc?    My guild is recently EP flagged and haven't farmed it much, so trying to figure out how many to bring for our warriors when we reach this step.  I know he hit me for 1500ish when I was exploring the other day, he or another by him see invis and with that many mobs, I didnt last long enough to get a good feel for him.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
<br />
Fried</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Has 250-300 HP, hits for 1600ish, has a -150 poison AE (1500), another -150 Chromo ae (800?), 600 proc not sure resist.<br />
<br />
Resistant to spells unless fully debuffed.<br />
2 groups recommended, 1 time+ can do him np though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">funny you say time equip, tank in my guild about 1.5k less hp then me, and quite a bit lower ac did it with one exp group...</div></div><hr />

<br />
DC must have had the ebola that day or something, I can't imagine him being one groupable with less than Time gear for at least the tank if not the entire group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Braddox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes he's one groupable without being time geared.  Accidentally agroed him on the way through the zone and killed him with one solid group of level 70's.  All of us have pretty close to full elemental armor.  It wasn't overly difficult it just took a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the more people I talk with the more I think he was just over hyped, I'm waiting on my girplan before I tank him, but I don't for see any problems.<br />
<br />
And to be frank on most fights it all hingest on the mana pool of cleric and the tank, you got enough of both and you can have bazaar gear nubs hitting it =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can't do champion right after devourer, i found out the hard way (You are not allowed to loot this item). Not sure how far down the quest you have to be but it's further than devourer kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Probably need to be at the point he's asking for the eyes...<br />
<br />
You know, the point where you're supposed to kill him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hes not terribly hard, he just has a lot of HP, if you get him slowed you can pretty much DI CH him...<br />
<br />
granted my groups are at an equipment level that most people dont have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Been looking for this mob recently, and going on 2 days now with not seeing him up<br />
<br />
Seen him alot before I was ready to loot the eye<br />
<br />
Someone in Channel mentioned today that they made him respawn and spawn again randomly<br />
<br />
Anybody know anything else about this, or am I just have extreme bad luck and getting there after someone has killed him every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tanok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I doubt anyone in pre-time gear is going to 1 group this, but feel free to try... He's not blowable unless you actually kill him and can't loot the eye yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>leviathn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Spent more of the fight casting then actually hitting me. We killed with one group sk war clr dru shm brd took awhile mind you but no one was in danger at any point. Too bad I didnt read you needed to be at this point to loot the item.  <br />
I think people started leaving him alone now cause he was up for quite awhile before our group went to go kill him.<br />
Following the right wall in wos through the first opening in the wall hes to the right on the hill. Clear small radius and then charge him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wrathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I 1-grouped him... Me and the cleric both are elemental/VT geared. Im only lvl 66 as well. Everyone else was just bazaar geared pretty much save for some BoT stuff. Just make sure DI keeps up on the tank, and you have a patch healer with you.<br />
<br />
My group was me 66 Warrior, 67 cleric, 67 druid, 69 enchanter, 70 mage, 68 rogue. It was a lil tough yeah, but we still did it.<br />
<br />
Highest he hit me for was about 1400, average hit was in the 600s-700s. Like was said above, he spent most of his time casting.</div></div><hr />
