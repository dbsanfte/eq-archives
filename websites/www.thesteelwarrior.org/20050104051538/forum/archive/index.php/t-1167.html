I know my weapons have no procs but I can sell the Curved Claws and maybe buy a frosty and somethin else.  In all the posts I've read I never see any recommendations to get a snowchipper or spiked velium mallet; they both have good procs and dmg ratios is there somethin else bad about them I'm not seeing? As for my gear goes what should I get to replace my crusty that gives good hp and isn't too pricy (I have hardly any money in the bank and not guilded atm)?  I'll take any suggestions for any slot or any weapon.  I might have messed up my magelo but not sure first time posting it.</div></div><hr />

Was curious myself, as pricing on my server puts them both around 7k, does the Snowchipper dd proc stack up with the Frostbringer dd/debuff proc?  Does the lower delay on the Snowchipper help mitigate the fact that the proc likely has less hate associated with it?  Thanks in advance.<br />
