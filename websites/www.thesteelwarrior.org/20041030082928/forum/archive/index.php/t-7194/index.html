<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have both the Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn.   The SotBS is a faster weapon but less damage then the CHoS (more dmg).  Each have an aggro proc.<br />
<br />
Which is better to put in your primary slot?   Faster weapon (SotBS) in Primary?<br />
<br />
Also, if I have enough points to get an Anger II augment - which one is the better one to put that in?<br />
<br />
(No money to upgrade at moment so still using these at level 65.  Casual gamer that does lots of LDoNs.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am in the same boat you are Barli I use both the same weapons and have CHoS in Primary and have anger 2 it and it rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From personal experience with both weapons...SotBS in Primary hand.  SotBS proc was generally stunning the mob more often than the CHoS.  Whereas the CHoS was getting resisted.  Granted if the mob resists or not it still generates agro.  Its just nice to be able to stun the mob, especially for those casters who love to heal and gate.<br />
<br />
As for the Anger II augment I would put that in the SotBS as well.  At least until you manage to get a GBoS from BoT or a CHSD from PoI.  Far as 1 handed weapons go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>johnyjohnson76</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well the SotBS proc works on mobs up to level 65 where as the proc on CHoS only works on mobs up to level 55<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: The stun part of the proc i meant...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea, I'd mainhand the sword just cause you might get some interrupts on the proc.  I doubt there is a significant difference in dps or aggro whichever way you put them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am still saying return the anger2 and get the ykesha proc for the same amount. But I like the sotbs. I still carry one around. I offhand my bf and use the sotbs when i want to interupt casters when I am unsure of the group ability to make sure the mob doesn't gate/ch. So sotbs has a long term use. You could end up carrying it around for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the advice all.  I've debated on this for a while.   I didn't realize that the CHoS's proc didn't affect mobs over 55 - no wonder it gets resisted a lot.<br />
<br />
I've gone ahead and put the anger II augment on the SotBS and tried it out in some LDoN's and BoT tanking.  I did notice better aggro control, not perfect, but it definitely helps.   I'll hang on to the SotBS for a while until I get an upgrade. <br />
<br />
I was just in need of a quick aggro upgrade as I was having some difficulty keeping aggro off my group's slowers and DoT'ers.   Area Taunt helps but was not available as often as I would like.  The Anger II aug definiitely helps.<br />
<br />
I also considered getting another proc like the Ykesha proc.  It was a toss up but decided to use anger II instead.<br />
<br />
Now to get an upgrade sometime soon.... :D</div></div><hr />

If you don't have them yet, start working on your WA aa's...at least get the first few...it's a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used the Copper main hand because it does more damage over all then the Blood if the dd is landing and next I love the graphic on the proc.  I would not worry about the resist it realy makes no difference.  You have clerics. chanters and pals to take care of casters gating. <br />
<br />
 I would NOT put a yak proc on a Copper or Blood the knock back would be over powering with both hands procing 2 procs and WA5.  There are way toooooooo many peeps that have no freaking idea about how they push the mob and never think about where they are pushing it.<br />

I recently asked my regular group what they thought about me adding the yak aug versus anger 2...let's just say they were less than enthusiastic about the yak aug idea... :p   (particularly the mage with the backstabbing pet since he'd have to reposition the pet every time the mob was pushed)</div></div><hr />

I have a necro normally in my group who thought the same thing. :p</div></div><hr />
