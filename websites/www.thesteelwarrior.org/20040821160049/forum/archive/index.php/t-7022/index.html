You might want to make it a little bit more intensive than just sex though.  There's at least one other variable that matters here, and that's age.  I had my one and only accident when I was 16.  Sorry I'm an epidemiologist, I couldn't resist  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, I dont know if this counts, it didn't involve another vehicle. I just dropped off a friend and left on a dirt road. It was also a little snowy at the time. I burned em out and went into a fishtail, couldn't straighten it out. It was either go into the swamp on the right or the hill on the left, little did I know there was a sort of dirt curb about a foot high on the left as well and when I hit it the car went up on it's right side. I had my seatbelt on and was just chilling there listening to STP pondering my situation, hoping another car wouldn't come along and see what a moron I was. I figured if I turned the wheel to the right I'd come down on the wheels, so I did that and it worked but I came down hard. I don't know if it happened when I hit the curb or when I came down but the left front wheel poped and I ended up driving it home about 5 miles, it was a beater so I wasn't worried.<br />
<br />
So anyways, if that counts as an accident then I have 2 if not I have 1 where a male hit me. It was a forgin taxi driver that backed up into me. I'm male.</div></div><hr />

Anyway I've been in 2 accidents (as the driver), at fault in one of them, both while I was in high school.Meh, it's for a high school class, I don't care and the teacher doesn't really either. Sure, to make it a pure random sample, I'd need to pick a bunch of people, assign them all numbers, then use a random number gen to pick who I would use, but.. screw that.<br />

Sorry I'm an epidemiologist, I couldn't resist Yea.. I know, it does make a difference. Older people have more times to wreck than younger people. But, I'm a lazy high school student, consider the use of this board which has a higher population of adults than I actually know a generous gift on my part towards you epidem-whatevers. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help everyone!<br />
<br />
Fyi, here are the final results:<br />

There ya have it folks, conclusive evidence that we ARE better drivers than men! (special thanks to Shikarii's sister and Kelli F for being such horrible drivers, having 4 accidents each)</div></div><hr />

motorcycle accident. hit a large rock left by skateboarding kids in the middle of the road. not at fault.<br />
motorcylce accident. hit a car. fault was split. no report written.<br />
dropped my motorcyle twice more both times riding on muddy sidewalks. it was the sidewalk's fault honest :)<br />
had motorcycle knocked over by cars twice while it was parked. not my fault.<br />
had motorcycle knocked over by electric garage door opener when it was opened from the inside. i guess ill accept blame for this one :)<br />
hit a car with my car once moving very slowly but caused significant damage.<br />
<br />
the good news is ... my last accident was 20 years ago when i was 20 years old. so maybe im getting more responsible :)</div></div><hr />
