<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah we killed him the other day.<br />
<br />
Basically just be on your toes and watch the emotes he gives off. It's an...interesting fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">how many people would you take to kill him? could a &quot;pick up&quot; raid or large gruop of friends do it? with ranging from ssra to time gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is this another Inny?  Elemental Tier fight for Tier 2 drops?</div></div><hr />

Because he banishes people, he's not zergable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, how so? Banishing mobs encourage higher numbers to compensate, in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xiliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Zerg has always ment that when someone dies they are battle rezed, ussually in high numbers, until the mob dies...<br />
<br />
Banishing someone to Misty Thicket would prevent a quick return to the battle seen...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">While the 2 are often seen together, one does not require the other.<br />
<br />
Zerg Definition (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zerg)<br />
<br />
You can throw 500 people at something without battle rezzing, and it's still zerging. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can just put a bunch of people at the back of the room and run in as people die/banished.  Swarm pets apparently count toward the # of people you can bring so I'd recommend not using them because having your banish limit eaten up by 20 pets tends to lead to bad things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ah, so does he not banish if you keep under a particular number of players+pets there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Like I said, this entire fight is reading the emotes ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I'm pretty sure pet counts because he was banishing people even when the # of players we had was clearly below the limit.  The banish itself doesn't seem to depend on the order of engagement though.  I have had chain clerics ported out and those people should have been on the aggro list earlier than most people.  At any rate, it's easier just to not use pets so you don't have to worry about someone important getting ported out unless you're going in with 20 people or something.</div></div><hr />
