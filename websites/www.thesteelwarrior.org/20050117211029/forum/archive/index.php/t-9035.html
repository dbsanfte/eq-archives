<br />
I currently wield a BoC with A3 and an unaug'd Horror Shard Blade.  Is the Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance more aggro than the Horror Shard Blade?  Also, I hear about how good the aggro is on on a CHoS, is that better than the Horror Shard Blade?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Does it matter?<br />
<br />
It's got a better ratio, better stats, and a comparable proc.  AC debuffs are in the same category as stuns, and lets face it, taunting blow ain't that great.<br />
<br />
Just because something has a raw hate proc doesn't make it better than everything else, despite what some people will claim.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are days i'm tempted to put an anger augment on my Cracked Claw of Zlandicar. Wouldn't that be a nice weapon to see reworked with OoW stats?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it matter?<br />
<br />
Though overall i agree with your post i'd day it matters in a rather crucial way.  Stats/ratio are nice and all, but unless the sucker is gonna hold aggro better than a lesser weapon, i'd not swing it.  You never can have enough aggro.  I happen to think i have damn fine aggro atm, but i still get my legs chopped out from under me by a talented beastlord or necromancer every now and then.<br />
<br />
I understand what you're saying but the question of how it's aggro compares to &quot;x&quot; weapon matters everything in the world if said poster is thinking about buying it.  If the aggro isnt as good than it's not worth swinging  ;)</div></div><hr />

The frostbringer was the shit back in the day.  It was the 1h staple for the non raiders for a LONG time.  It wasn't because of it's stats, it wasn't because of it's ratio, it was because of the proc.<br />
<br />
Now we have that proc on a weapon with better stats and a better ratio on a mediocre +hate weapon.  In my mind, it's a no brainer.  I understand that a lot of people think that raw hate &gt; all, but it's simply not true, and it's definitely not true when the weapon that raw hate is attached to is inferior to the weapon with a non hate, but definitely aggro producing proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally i have no respect for taunting blow .. i'd take a stun or debuff over it any day.  any &quot;pure hate&quot; under the value of anger3 isnt worth jack imo.  You might as well get a DD aug and go for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of people give weapon ratio too little weight when deciding on aggro weapons.  A good aggro proc is nice but if it's attached to a shitty ratio weapon your aggro with it is still going to be crap.  I only used Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance for 1 day before I deleted it (got an EoE the next night) but IMO it's a damned good weapon if you have a sub-BoC caliber weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to me Agro is everything so that is why I asked. The more agro I have the more DPS the rest of my group can do. I accepted a long time ago that a Warrior is not a DPS class, so ratio only matters to me if it makes it the highest agro weapon of the weapons compared. Stats are nice and all but I would take some negative stats if it was a weapon that allowed me to never loss agro. I look at stats on a weapon as bonus so if it is great agro and no stats then I am still happy. Being in a family type guild Agro weapons come on a limited basis to me so I have a BoC (which I bought with some friends help on money) and a CHSD (the only raid item I have). I do not think raw hate is always better but for the weapons I have now I think it is best (the only others I have are Flameforge Hammer and the CHoS). So this might be another weapon I can get my hands on so I was just wondering if it was better. That is why I asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you're right, aggro is everything.<br />
<br />
However, your damage contributes to your aggro as well, pretty significantly.<br />
<br />
As far as pure hate goes, taunting blow is pretty craptacular.  Most people around here rate stuns at 450 or so aggro (I personally give them more weight than that, but whatever), and the AC debuff is going to be similar aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd bank the CHSD and wouldn't look back if I were you.  In fact, I'll be picking up one of these eventually too..i'm just not sure how to work it into my weapon scheme at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just picked one of these up. Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I'll keep ya posted on how it holds up coupled with a BoC, both with anger 3, after I get some action with it.<br />
<br />
Side note: For people who aren't in hardcore guilds, I would say there is such thing as too much aggro. With dual anger 3 augs + some decent hate procing weapons + WA5 I don't think you are going to lose aggro after the first few seconds of the fight. Imo, at some point it is smarter to look for some extra DPS and stats instead of aggro. It all depends on who you play with, but I haven't had aggro problems in ages and I use a weapon in my offhand with no intrinsic proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as far as stun/debuff/whatever vs pure hate, the fact of the matter is that mobs can resist stuns, debuffs, dd, etc. <br />
they cannot resist pure hate.<br />
<br />
Its more a matter of personal preference imho.</div></div><hr />

I am playing a 67 warrior with about 8500 buffed and 1550 AC........ think I would be able to handle the mobs in MPG?  I'm still using a GBoS and a SotB offhanded and I would also love to ditch this piece.  Unfortunately the Midnight Sword is selling for 150k in the bazaar on Drinal now, a bit too much for a pissed off frosty.  I have friends that I go there with that would give it to me if it dropped because we do NBG, but I don't want to get any of them killed because they're a bit tough to tank.  <br />

So yeah, trash hit about how hard?  HP?  Proc at all?  Thanks, any info would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

I am in almost exactly the same position as you.  I went to MPG over the weekend and was lucky enough to have a Cleric from our main uber-guild healing me.<br />
<br />
It was a good thing she has a 9k mana pool, i'll tell you that.    The mobs near the entrance hit pretty quickly, and frequently for about 1k.  I don't know if I ever got quadded for 1k each, but I know I got trippled for 1k a bunch of times.  I was basically burning Defensive every time it popped trying to give the cleric more time to land the heal.<br />
<br />
I can see how this zone would be good exp for better geared groups, but at my level it's just too much to expect to spend a good couple of hours here grinding out another level.<br />
<br />
Maybe in 6 months I'll come back and give it another shot.<br />
<br />
BTW, it's embarassing when a Cleric has more HP and AC than I do.   :(</div></div><hr />

Did you have a slower in the group? <br />
<br />
I've noticed that the mobs can be rough pre slow, but after slow most of the mobs don't put out much damage at all. If you aren't as well gear, if you can bring along a shaman, I'd think it would make it doable.</div></div><hr />

Whats the best way to break the 3 spawn?  I thought I heard there was a way to single out the named without agroing the other 2 mobs... Not using FD or Mez, just by tagging the named...

This is a great camp to grind. 2 named there and all the trash mobs seemed to be lvl 70.<br />

Bring along a bard to preslow the mobs before the War engages. It helps alot for it to be 50 % slow when you engage, then let the shaman slow it down even more.

We literally just beat RZTW for EP access and have killed nothign in EP's yet but most of us are Vex Thal geared.  I buff to 9600hp and 1600 ac but have tanked MPG with as few as 8400 hit points and while its a little slower and you have to be a bit more careful, the mobs aren't THAT bad once you get them slowed.  Bring along a bard to pull and pre-slow and a shaman or Chanter to land a big slow and as long as your cleric is awake you'll be fine.  Mobs can quad me for 900 per hit but they rarely hit that hard.  More often then not its 3-4 hits for 400-600 each which isn't that hard to stand up to.<br />
<br />
Agro control is however a must.  I dual wield a Bloodfrenzy and Blade of Carnage and rarely have agro problems unless someone is just trying to be a jerk but my shaman has died to a landed slow many many times because Quad 900+ hits hurt...  lol</div></div><hr />
