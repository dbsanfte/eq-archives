<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering I am in a small guild, just starting on HoT, I've been sitting on 60 doing AA for a while (up to ND 3, debating AE Taunt vs CA atm) and for the most part we're unflagged for higher tier zones (irrelevant soon I guess), is it worth me levelling up to 61?<br />
<br />
What benefits (other than less of an exp hit on death and access to planar AA) is there to it?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 - easier to taunt higher level mobs<br />
2 - better midigation against some mobs<br />
<br />
(these due to change in mob level relative to your level.  I didn't parse these things, but I noticed a large change in my tanking prowess between 60 - 65 with little change in gear, and against the same mobs).<br />
<br />
3 - some extra HPs<br />
<br />
other then that some stuff like &quot;if you are LFG in valor a group will take 61 warrior over a 60 warrior&quot; sort of thing.<br />
<br />
If you main tank on raids you want to be the highest level you can reasonably attain.  In my opinion at least, and some warriors who gave me that advice.  Mainly because of 1 and 2 above... a mob will melee a lot easier on you if it's even or blue rather then yellow or red (from what i have noticed, not parsed, but it seems like common sense to me, correct me if i'm wrong? ;p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id go 61 or even higher. less exp penalty on death - also in hot theres a lot of 60 mobs. if u hit 61 - they will be dblue instead of white and that means better resists and mitigation. if you go higher all the better.<br />
<br />
i went to 62, picked up ND3 and AE taunt then now levelling to 65. Think our guild is about the same bik, about 25 peeps and we jst about done with hot.<br />
<br />
also with the forthcoming level changes if ur 61/62 ull still have access to a lot of content.<br />
<br />
like the other poster said, it will also help in getting groups in tier 2. from what ive seen of tier 2, its gonna be v hard getting a group at lvl 60, as most groups wont perceive that as being able to cut the proverbial mustard, so to speak, especially with the disadvantage warriors have re aggro control. a lot of the tier 2 mobs are also level 61-62, so they will be yellow/red to you at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gardack</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I'd stay 60 unless you hunt in PoP exclusively for exp. I left my shaman 60 and my fiance left her monk at 60 so we can duo for easy exp outside PoP since we raid with our warrior / cleric combo.<br />
<br />
At least get some AA before leveling above 60 I'd say. CA 3 / CS 3, AE taunt, maybe CF 3 and Flurry too. The only reason I leveled to 65 instead of getting AA is I'm in a decent size raid guild working our way towards Elemental planes / VT, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I leveled to 65 as soon as I got flagged for PoV/PoS.  Took me a long while to get 65, but I feel it's worth it for me.  If you're not in a raiding guild, then I wouldn't go over 62 or so, until you get PoV flagged.  There are still a lot of good places to xp even in tier 1 at 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The old world mob exp problem and the no tier 2+ access problems are about to be solved. With level 50 mobs giving exp to 65 and most PoP zones being opened up for exp in an upcoming patch, there is absolutely no reason not to level to 65. You already have the basic AAs and your Veteran title, your best bet is going straight to 65 so you are ready when the patch to open the PoP zones goes live.<br />
<br />
The best exp zones in the game (unless you are elem flagged) are the tier 2/3 zones and you are never going to get a group if you are 60-64 when level 65 tanks commonplace. Not only that, but at 65 you are a better tank than at any previous level, there is no disputing that. HoT will be a breeze to tank at 65 with your better taunt, better DPS, better resists, and better HP from leveling to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks folks :)<br />
Think I'll level up to 62 and reassess then.  Advice much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hold the phone there.<br />
<br />
Do you XP in PoP or places like chardok/HOT?<br />
<br />
If you XP in PoP, then by all means, listen to the folk above.  If you don't, then don't go to 61, it slows your XP rate down 40%.<br />
<br />
If you're not flagged for valor/storms, I'd stay 60.  Trust me, your AA rate is A LOT higher in old world zones at 60 than at 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I would stay at 60 too. While the added levels may help you tank for oyur raids a tiny bit better, the aa you can get does the same. I leveled to 61 without aa and got to 90% in before I realized that I should have stayed at 60 so I could get some aa (wasn't really fit enough to tank in pov/pos at that point). Get AE taunt at least, will help you out a lot :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The only way I would level to 61 is if you had a few friends that you could group with constantly in PoV/PoS... it's hard to get groups there at level 60/61</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elvenphox01</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to the benefits described above, warriors are also moved to a higher damage table at 61. I noticed about between a 20 and 30 dps increase after dinging 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard that the damage bonus ups at 61, and once more somewhere before 65.<br />
<br />
The other advantage, if you are using 2HS, is that punishing blade is available at 61.  OK, that's a small advantage, but for those of us who don't MT all the time, it's nice to be able to use AA to increase the DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can ding 61, train punishing blade and then delevel and it should work. Stalwart endurance and Ingenuity do, so that's not a reason to be 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DinadassDegladi</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thye are also redoing the blue out rate on mobs soon, changing it from at 65 mobs anything &lt;55 is LB to any mob &lt;50 will be LB. Making old world zones slightly more feasible for exping post 60. <br />
<br />
I lvled to 65 and don't regret it one bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after thining about it, what decided me was getting my new bow (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29596) <br />
<br />
ding 61 :D <br />
<br />
thanks very much for the advice :)</div></div><hr />
