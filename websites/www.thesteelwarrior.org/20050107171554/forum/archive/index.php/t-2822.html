<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grev</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last 3 weeks ive had the pleasure of getting 2 new weps.  BBB from Seru, and yesterday i was rewarded a Blackout from HP. I havent had the chance of using any of these on any raids as MT, exept BBB on a Cursed encounter (Where we use just 3 melees, so no big test). So, can any of you give me some feedback on how YOU feel they work when it comes to keeping agro plz. <br />
<br />
I use a BoC in mainhand for DW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aguktawarrior</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have BBB and I love it. I easily hold agro above everything except BF/boc or BoW. Plus rune proc is so sweet for eatting stray ripostes durring clearings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grev</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, i love the BBB aswell, in XP grps i can hold agro, even when unspeeded, and thats kinda special with a 2hander (BoW exluded:cool: )<br />
<br />
XP grps and MAing raids are 2 diffrent things though. I havent really dared to use BBB when tanking for my guild, and i expect BoC+Blackout will be the choice unless someone who have tried both combos says otherwise.</div></div><hr />

I can't compare the Blackout/BoC combo to BBB though, as I don't have a BBB.  (I don't have a BoC either, but I could borrow one :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use BoC and Blackout and never have issues with agro as long as I give myself a few secs headstart from the rest of the raid.  Also, unless you see yourself getting a BoW sometime soon, invest AA's in Ambidexterity.  It will help a ton.<br />
<br />
[edit - btw, Im just commenting on Blackout since I have no firsthand knowledge about BBB agro]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our only 2 BBB went to SK's so hard to say how it works for agro but one to the SK's tends to 'AE taunt' (running joke in guild warrior channel) quite often with it on raids.<br />
Second one only dropped recently after our first RZ kill so no warrior wanted to spend big dkp for it understandably.<br />
<br />
Blackout is very nice agro due to the 0.0 sec stun part.<br />
The last one that dropped for us (we dont do HP anymore) went to a monk that had quite a few problems when using it main hand at first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that 55+ mobs are immune to the stun portion doesn't hurt its ability to generate aggro at all.  You still get the aggro even when the mob is immune to the stun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBB is NOT &gt; BoC/Blackout for aggro .... go back to your delusions.<br />
<br />
BBB is NOT even &gt; just BoC .... <br />
<br />
EB &gt; Gimp ass Rune shield, else, it wouldnt be the most coveted of all weapon procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diminious</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have BBB and CHSD/BOC combo at my disposal. During exp groups I've started to only use the BBB and hold aggro just fine. Gaining is a little tough at first but once I have it I have it unless someone is just dumb with overnukes etc.<br />
<br />
I get comments from the healing classes telling me I'm a better tank with it than w/o. I'm going to assume this is because of ripostes and perhaps My dps is higher(haven't tested it).<br />
<br />
Would I use BBB on raids? STill to be determined. When I MT, I will switch except on boss mobs where I get the 10 second cushion(or whatever I call).<br />
<br />
So in Exp groups I'd say BBB &gt; EB/TB. In raiding the jury is still out. If I need fast aggro lock. EB/TB &gt;BBB. If I am given the cushion, BBB&gt; Eb/TB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodheart</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, I always wanted a BBB untill I caved and got a SoS.<br />
<br />
I've seen others with it pull aggro off me using BBoTE and BoC. Albeit rare, it's happend. <br />
<br />
Seems to be nice aggro. EB is more reliable though, always will be...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have BoC/Blackout as well and it does a great job of holding aggro most of the time.  Unfortunately the proc rate on BoC sorta sucks so you can sometimes go a whole fight without a proc.  Doesn't happen that often but when it does it sucks.  Blackout seems to proc more often so it's pretty reliable as your backup aggro generator.  Can't comment on BBB, don't have one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">XP groups I used BBB over BoC + Saryrn sword, just got a Stone Etched Mallet though so have been using DW again recently.  I found that DW didnt compare on DPS and BoC doesnt proc reliably enough during mob after mob grinds.  Using the BBB I often get compliments from monks and rogues that they dont need to evade/FD as often, with the BoC I seem to be taunting off other melee alot more.<br />
<br />
On raids I found that the BBB wasnt too reliable at the start of the fight, its great agro over time but not so great snap agro while defensive so I usually start with DW and then once defensive drops switch to BBB.<br />
<br />
I never use it when not tanking because between great DPS and a good proc rate I usually end up pulling agro when I shouldn't and getting splattered.</div></div><hr />

I have PB3 ( ya it helps a lot dps wise ) and i can hold aggro MUCH better with my BBB than i can with BoC. BBBs dps makes up for the lack of aggro on Rune3 proc ... i also have an Orb of the Sky from VT which is insane aggro and helps a lot.<br />

You think that BoC agro sucks, and that Blackout agro sucks, but you are using prismatic in your offhand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danadur</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use BBB as my main weap not BoC...and Ya i think both of their aggro sucks compared to BBB..lack of procs and dps to hold it imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BB is very nice, and for the last poster, BBB = Bloody Berzerkers Blade, look in my magelo, in inventory.<br />
<br />
While it is not &gt; BoC and my GBoS for aggro, I use it almost all the time when I am not MAing (which is often).  If MAing, I use BoC and GBoS.  In exp groups, which I have few . . . it depends.  If I'm in a group of guildies, especially with a rogue or beastlord, I have to use BoC and GBoS to maintain aggro.  Elemental rogue/bst dps is just too friggin much =\<br />
<br />
But in a group of non elemental, I can use BBB just fine.  Altho I don't group outside elemental much anymore, so its a moot point.  It is my favorite non-MA DPS weapon, tho.  Very nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
well, not very surprising, since you have PB3 but you don't have ambidexterity.</div></div><hr />
