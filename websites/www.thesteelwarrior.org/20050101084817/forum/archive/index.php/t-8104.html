<br />
Before I get started let me say I'm new here and this is my first post. I have a 65 DE warrior, with pretty decent gear, no time or ep gear though and he has 116 aa's. Now let me say that I haven't played him for about a year or more. I know most of my friends have moved on to the elementals and some to even time. The only expansion that I'm missing is the latest one, GoD. My question is, do you think my gear is ok to start doing Ldon groups? You can take a look at it on my magelo link. Also would like to know what aa's I should work on next? I have most of my defensive ones. Thanks in advance for your advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for LoDN normal, yeah with little upgrade. for LoDN hard, no way.<br />
<br />
For Equipement : <br />
0. before anything else you need better haste to reach 100%  with a sham/beast/Ench. You can go for tribute haste, it increadibly powerfull.<br />
1. augment both weapons as soon as possible.<br />
2. champion and FH are outdated for your lvl. work toward ornate/LoDN (EF :   ~ maleavonent something) <br />
<br />
For the AA : <br />
1. finish Planar Power when needed (equipement/buff progression)<br />
2. max ferocity<br />
3. tactical mastery and stalwart endurance<br />
4. flurry then pni blade then raging flurry<br />
5. and the crits AA<br />
note : too bad you don't have GoD otherwise I would say to go first for WA and Sturdiness but ...<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : forgot the double ripost AA to put somewhere in between...<br />
<br />
second EDIT : blackout is better aggro than SotB so put it mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takata</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice, whats tribute haste btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can seel some items in your hometown to a 'tribute master' that credits you for tribute points (it's diferrent than PP). with these points you can by enhencement for a given time (but there is a lvl requierement if I remember well). theese bonus works like the one you get from gears thus you can stak a HP bonus but not a Haste bonus.<br />
from the last patch you can turn on/off them in order to not consume your bonus while you don't care (what haste could do while smithing?).<br />
if you don't know you tribite NPC, ask a player in game from the same race.<br />
<br />
ex : your bow has a 3000 tribute points, while your cloak is 10375.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/disagree yoda...I don't agree that FH is &quot;outdated&quot; for level 65 toons. FH is very very similar to Ornate/EF LDoN armor AC/HP wise at a fraction of the cost. Short term i would look at switching Helm, Arms, and bracers to Fierce Heraldic. Spend early LDoN points on an agro aug for mainhand. <br />
<br />
/agree Yoda with selling RBG and using tribute haste, and replacing belt with FH or Heavy Rubi Girdle if you have the cash.<br />
<br />
With these changes I think you could pull-off hard LDoN's in the right group. &quot;Right group&quot; in my mind being a very good puller, and a patch healer to go with your cleric. Anyways, you are not that far from being able to do hard LDoN. Good hunting to you.<br />
<br />
1st edit: A lot of this depends on your cash situation. You can buy much nicer upgrades than the FH, such as the droppable loot from Hard LDon's and certain pieces of Ornate, but generally those items are pricey. Would only do Ornate where you get em as drops for free.</div></div><hr />
