<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dagos</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never really was able to figure this out, was hoping that a few of you that seem to be better with the math behind the mechanics of the game could help. <br />
Really a 2 part question.<br />
<br />
1) What is the minimum delay a weapon can have with max spell + item haste?<br />
<br />
2) Now with that in mind, what is the delay a weapon has to have to reach the minimum delay, and not &quot;waste&quot; any delay on reaching that minimum?<br />
<br />
If question 2 confuses people, I will try to clarify. <br />
<br />
Lets say that, arbitrarily, the minimum delay any weapon can drop to is 10 with spell and item haste combined. Now, if there was a weapon that was 10 / 13, it could only drop to 10 / 10 obviously not getting the full benefit of the item+spell haste. <br />
<br />
Now take a weapon like a dathor greathammer (72 / 93 if I remember correctly), even with the best haste item and spell currently in the game it would not reach 72 / 10. So what is the delay that will reach the minimum allowed, and still be taking full benefit from item + spell haste?<br />
<br />
Hope I didn't confuse and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think i could agree somewhat with the no min delay. As i have always been told you could not go below 10 on delay also.<br />
Delay is viewed as sec.1/10th of a sec.<br />
That is why casters can use /pause 25 for it to pause for 2.5 sec. Bards the same way for hot keying their songs.<br />
It is hard to view 1/10th of a sec as a human. But the machine is a different as it can take if WAY lower than 1/1000th of a sec.<br />
<br />
Many have argued how delay VS haste is calculated.<br />
<br />
No matter how you do it it is still hard to get a noticeable difference with a weapon under 20 delay as your removing 1/10th of a sec off the delay of the weapon. Now if you had a longer delay it is easier to see the delay as you are moving seconds not just tenths.<br />
<br />
Here  is the formula i use for calculating it.<br />
delay - haste% = new delay.<br />
<br />
I am going to use a couple old world junk weapons. for this and the haste you will have is the Shamans and Enchanters have Spell: Alacrity and we will say it is maxed at 40%.<br />
Minotaur Battle Axe (Dmg 8, Dly 37) drops in Gorge off EK<br />
Mystical Claws of Jo Jo  (Dmg 4, Dly 19) Drops in Kerra Island  off Tox Forest.<br />
<br />
37 - 40% = 22.2<br />
19 - 40% = 11.4<br />
<br />
Now for the game you would take the &quot;.&quot; and move it over one position to make the delays <br />
37 - 40% = 2.22<br />
19 - 40% = 1.14<br />
<br />
and since we do not know what form of rounding they use or if they even round it the delays will be 22 or 23 and 11 or 12. Either way it is only 1/10th difference and hard to notice a difference in most fights.<br />
<br />
**********EDIT***********<br />
So the question is what buffs are you using for max as if you add a bard with the right song into the mix you can break the spell/item cap. <br />
What buffs and items are you looking to use or have at your disposal??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A weapon used to drop that was knight only or sk only that had a 6 delay so the 10 delay theory is pretty much shot.  As far as I know, it was believed to be 10 because of the logs and parsing rounding to whole seconds as someone mentioned.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a min delay so therefore there is no waste on a low delay weapon with max haste.<br />

This is incorrect. If Spell + Item haste is capped at 100% (May not be true), and bard overhaste exists at 10%, then a 40 delay weapon would have an effective max hasted delay of -4. As this represents attacking 0.4 seconds [B]BEFORE[\B] your last attack, and our EQ characters do not travel back in time in order to pre-attack, we have a contradiction, and the equation must be discarded.<br />
<br />
The proper way to view haste is as that % addtional attacks per time unit. If you have a 40 delay weapon, you get 2.5 attack rounds per 10 seconds. If you have 40% haste in addition, then you get 2.5 * 1.4 = 3.5 attacks per 10 seconds, or an attack every 2.85 seconds, making your hasted delay 28.5. At 80 % haste, you get 4.5 attacks per 10 seconds, an attack every 2.22 seconds, making your delay 22.2. At 100% haste, you get 5 attacks every 10 seconds, making your delay 20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I just do: Delay/(1+0.%haste)<br />
<br />
If 0%haste, delay is normal, if haste is 100%, délay is divide by two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol...<br />
humm  my formula is old???<br />
lets say pre kunark lol<br />
<br />
I have read and seen people post saying the Haste cap is in the 80's and others saying higher?? But then again last time i looked for it it was pre PoP or there abouts.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an up to date solid proof of the haste cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple test<br />
<br />
Get mosscovered twig<br />
<br />
Equip it, with non weapon in primary hand.<br />
<br />
Parse damage.<br />
<br />
Get haste spell (which would have to drop it below 10 delay if it works).<br />
<br />
Parse damage<br />
<br />
Notice that there is no minimum delay.</div></div><hr />
