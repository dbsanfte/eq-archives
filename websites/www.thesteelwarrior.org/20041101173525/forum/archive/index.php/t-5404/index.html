<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melstan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently fighting XP mobs in PoJ, and will be working towards helping my guild become tiered. That means taking down Venril Sathir, Trakanon, Velktor, Kael, Banord, etc then moving on to the tougher PoP tiers. My next step is to level quite a bit, but I am curious how long my current equipment will take me and what I should eventually swap out. I could work on getting Velious armor, but I'm not sure if there is much point in that these days.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since your have fierce heraldic I don't see any point in wasting time getting velious armor unless your guild is fairly small and you have lots of time to waste farming ToV.<br />
<br />
Save up cash and buy some ornate plate molds, the combines are no-fail and the armor you get would be a better upgrade until you get to the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Of course nothing beats ToV on learning how to raid properly. :) So you could go either way. I also wouldn't waste time on kunark mobs unless your guildies have dire need for kunark armor, although gore, sev, and whatever his name is in skyfire drop nice haste items so you might keep an eye out for them.<br />
<br />
I'm sure others will have good advice as well, this is just what I would do.<br />
<br />
I also noticed your 2hb and 2hs skills are at 1, so max those out! Once you get level 55 grab yourself a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Melstan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ornate is quite a bit out of my league in terms of plat. Only way I'll ever get it is to actually loot the molds myself, eventually.... The other option is to do a ton of Northern Ro LDoN's and get the Royal Attendant armor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23471), but to be frank I am not a big fan of LDoN. The dungeons, to me, feel uninspired and my interest in getting over 1,000 APs is not too high.<br />
<br />
My guild is fantasic and very supportive of equipping its members. So, if there is anything I can go after in Kunark, Velious, Luclin (some of it, hehe) or the lower tier Planes, I can do that as well. Just not sure what the best upgrade path is. By the time I am in my 60's, I am pretty sure we will be raiding Kael, so I should be able to get a Zek helm and a BoC if one should drop.<br />
<br />
I will of course be working heavily on my 2H skills very soon.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any advice this excellent community can offer me.<br />
<br />
My thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think your interest in LDoN will change once you get level 65. At that level you get 51 points for every win on normal, or 102 pts for high rist adventures. IMO it's not worth doing adventures before level 60 because the amount of points you get isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />

I have a friend who is a master smith, and others who are master brewers and potters. It took me a long time to gather the required materials, but it was well worth it I think, lol.<br />

<br />
I sure hope so.... My biggest issue with LDoN is the lack of feeling like I am in an RPG. To me, it feels more like an arcade hack and slash. The points, the leaderboard, the dumbing down of the whole dungeon experience... I guess I prefer the old ways of EQ better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is really nothing for you personally in Velious or Kunark, except perhaps some of the no-drop gear that nameds in NToV drop and some of the gear that AoW and Tormax drop, and you're quite a few levels away from taking those on right now. You won't be replacing your Fierce Heraldic until you hit PoP and start looting ornate molds (and even then, just a few slots will be upgrades).<br />
<br />
Right now, I'd really only consider replacing your rings with valorium rings of gallantry, and replacing your bow with an elemental bow. Perhaps someone in your guild is enough of a craftsperson to make these for you, otherwise I'd save some plat and buy them in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
For a reasonable upgrade in haste (at the cost of some HP's and AC), you might consider getting a Soulscream Belt (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=65570) from Veksar. It's a good camp for a mid-50's group. If you have the faction, replace your Silver Chitin Handwraps with Gauntlets of the Myrmidon (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31186) from ToV/HoT (these can be found for MQ quite often). If you hunt in Kael Arena, you'll have dragon faction in no time. With both items replaced out, you'll come out ahead in both HP's and AC as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thorny's right on.  My magelo is almost identical to what he's suggested, and it's still working fine for me at 65 for xp'ing as I work on my defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />

those things right there can yield the following<br />
rang slot, 100hp 33ac 41% haste (scalecracker)<br />
earring ac 10 str 5 100hp (iron cog earring)<br />

I strongly AGREE, get a ring of thunderous spirit, only 1k on FV and is some what comparable with ring of gallantry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just realized that my suggestion for a Stonewood Compound Bow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29597) won't work for you because it's required level 61, and your Magelo says you're 47, so scratch that one. I'd still get a bow with good stats and HP's that can double as a viable range slot item, so you're not continually swapping the range item and bow out.<br />
<br />
Maybe a Glimmering Recurve Longbow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27642), or a Nightmarewood Compound Bow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29627)?</div></div><hr />

There is a bow in Mistmoore LDON camp that is not too expensive to get that gives 60+ life, it is not bad.</div></div><hr />

Aye, I believe you're talking about the Shadow Agent Death Bow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45060), which is very nice. It has a recommended level of 65 and costs 1150 AP's to get. I think at level 47 it's like a 27/36 bow with 43 HP's, but that's pretty respectable, and it will only improve. :)</div></div><hr />
