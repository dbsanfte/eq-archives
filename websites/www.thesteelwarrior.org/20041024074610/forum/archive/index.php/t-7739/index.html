<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One of the quests I am going to start soon myself is Vampyre Troubles (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1582) in Katta Castellum.<br />
<br />
The result of the quest is Loyalist Shield of Honor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15971) which is a very good back/secondary armor.</div></div><hr />

You sir, have the right idea, but the wrong way to go about it.  Most quests in EQ are utter shit, and not worth your time.  You are however correct in assuming that if you're low on cash, you've gotta go get some stuff yourself.  So lets see here, Face slot, a couple of very good options are Crystal Spider eyes (8ac, 35hp) that drop in Velketors, and the Enshrouded Veil (7ac 30hp 10 fire) that drops in Howling Stones.  If you have a regular group, turn your attention there.<br />
<br />
Boots can be replaced with Cobalt (long camp in KC I think), or Champions (Velious quested out of Kael).  Either way, you'll be sitting around in one spot for awhile, but like I said, as long as you have a regular group, you'll do fine, and gain XP while you're at it.  Alternatively, Kingly Boots of Splendor drop at the table room in droga and are passable.<br />
<br />
Legs are gonna be a pain in the ass, not much you can do but deal with it.  Champions is an option, but they're rare as hell.  Kylong Darkmail is a possibility, but you should probably steer clear of Veksar for a couple more levels.<br />
<br />
As for wrists, there is a 15ac 40hp bracer in Velketors..silver chitin.  Go get some of those.  The options for gauntlets are the aforementioned Champions, or Cobalt out of KC again.<br />
<br />
Now, bear in mind that all of this hinges on the fact that you KEEP LEVELING.  I'm serious, you need to keep working towards 60, because all of this stuff becomes drastically easier the higher level you get.  Also, the one thing that seperates the successful from the unsuccessful in EQ is the quality of their friends.  I had a regular group I played EQ with for almost 4 years, and my gear was often times better than people who were in much larger guilds than I was.  If you have RL friends that play, get them together, get coordinated and start working on goals.  If you don't, then it's time to start making some friends in game.  Find people who know what they're doing and develop relationships with them.  The difference between being a 3500/1100ac warrior and being a 5500/1300ac warrior is oftentimes all about the people you associate with.  You CAN accomplish things in EQ, but you need to realize that you can't do it alone, and you can't do it at 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haass's suggestions are right on.<br />
also you should look at your shoulder item as something to replace.<br />
Check the PoK merchants near the forges. Some smiths will make LDoN armor there and vendor the products, which the vendors will sell for eh, 100 pp or so, depending on the piece. Several items might be small upgrades for you &amp; they'd help you fight in the places Haass suggests.<br />
Cobalt boots drop off Caller of Sathir in Karnors; the Drolvarg Captain in Karnor's drops the gauntlets. Both mobs are fairly close to zone-in, but drops are depressingly rare.<br />
You might start doing some LDoNs as well. <br />
check prices on Halas 10-pound meat pies and Grobb Liquidised meat in the bazaar, if you are not using stat food.<br />
If you haven't already leveled to 53 and you get a chance to go on a Vox and/or Naggy raid, do it. Expect no loot, but a really cool fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dibdab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thx for the suggestions o and the good quest. I would go on a vox or naggy raid but there have only been 2 that i know of that have been on my server since i started playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You won't get many points for doing LDoNs at 52 (unfortunately), but there's good armor for you at 150 pts each if you want to work for them.  The Death Embracer armor at BB camp is very good, and about the level of Kael equipment.  The AC is lower on the 150pt armor, but it actually has hp on most of the gear, and there's 3 slots for you to toss in some augments you may get.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Haas is right.  Armor &quot;Quests&quot; in EverQuest for the most part are gone to shit.  Ornate/Elemental &quot;quested&quot; armor is more like Do-It-Yourself armor, as it's not from a turn in but from a tradeskill-like combine.  Velious armor is more quest-like, since you have to hunt around for the gems, but the drops are almost too dang rare unless you're in HoT for the SS armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a nice quested shoulder piece out of skyshrine called Draconic Pauldrons. <br />
Easy quest doable in 20 minutes or so . I had a druid help me on mine. Basically, you go around western wastes and kill 4 mercenaries that drop heads. You then return to skyshrine and turn them in for the shoulders. The shoulders are AC  + 15<br />
 STR + 15 STA +15 Fire resist and cold resist +6. I would attempt this at around level 55 with a higher level druid friend for harmony to split the mercenaries and heals. Here is link to the quest. http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17617<br />
The only catch to this quest is you need good Claws of Veeshan faction which is easy to get. Just hunt in kael and kill giants, maybe if your lucky you can get a group down there and get some thurg stuff. Good luck. :cool:</div></div><hr />
