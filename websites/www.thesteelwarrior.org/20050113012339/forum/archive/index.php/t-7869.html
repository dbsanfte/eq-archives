<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalanu</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Tanks!!!<br />
<br />
Kalanu here. I was selected as the Warrior Class Correspondent.<br />
<br />
I'm going to tell you a few things about who I am, why I applied, and what I hope we can do for the Warrior Class. <br />
<br />
My main character is Tsaotsao. I've been a member here on The Steel Warrior for a long time. I've been in EQ around 3 years. I still need to look in game and check exactly when I started. But I've been playing MMORPG's since 12/97, where I started in Ultima Online.  I don't post here a lot, but I read here a lot. <br />
<br />
After a year or so in UO, I joined their counselor program, where I served the player community for 3 years until the program closed. I was a senior counselor there for about 2 years.  I was known as SRC Kalanu on the Chesapeake server.  Counselors hda a few more powers than I think Guides do, but the job was essentially the same. I was passionate in my role of serving players and being an advocate for players. <br />
<br />
A lot of you don't know me. And, I have already received a lot of criticism for being selected, believe me, this is going to be a lot of work. I didn't apply to get recognized, I did it to serve you the Warrior Community.<br />
<br />
I've been playing Tsaotsao since about my 3rd month in EQ. I was in a family guild to start, one that I had been with in UO, that moved to EQ, Dalridian Knights. In the past year, I applied to a raiding guild on Terris Thule, Dwarec Mercs. I was a guest/app with them for about 6 months before I became a member. I had to wait for apps to open, but I raided very chance i got and learned the elemental planes and I was involved in DM making it into Time.<br />
<br />
Why am I posting under the name &quot;Kalanu&quot;? Because of two things. One is that I served a player community with that name before, and I was well accepted and I feel like I did a good job. The second is that I want to still be able to post my personal opinions unser Tsaotsao. When I post as Kalanu, I post as your correspondent.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, a lot of you don't know me. I've been open in my posts here as Tsaotsao. A lot of folks would not admit that there gear isn't the best, or whatever, I will continue to post honestly and do my best to be complete. There are what? around 400,000 players in EQ. If only 10 percent are warriors, then that makes... 40,000 players.  No one is going to know everyone. <br />
<br />
So, what is my role as Warrior Class correspondent? My task is to record what *YOU* think is important. What are the most pressing concerns of the Warrior Community.  It doesn't matter what I think, it matters what you think.<br />
<br />
I am not paid by SoE. I get no reward from having this task, except that I get to help you get your desires, goals, frustrations, complaints communicated to SoE. The goal is to give them some focus to what the Warrior Class needs. <br />
<br />
With that task set before me, I will do my best to do the following:<br />
<br />
I will post the lists of what I am sending to SoE before I send them.<br />
I will post the responses they give me on the concerns I send to them.<br />
I will ask you what your opinions are on the issues.<br />
I will scour the Warrior Community message boards to find what Warriors are concerned about.<br />
<br />
I'm not perfect, I'm going to make mistakes, but I promise to do the best job I can for you.<br />
<br />
I've already been flamed for not getting out here faster to post. I found out SoE selected me after some of you did.  So I haven't had a lot of time to prepare what to say.  As far as flames and criticisms go, if it makes you feel good, then FLAME ON!!!  But I'm here to listen to your concerns about EQ and the Warrior Class. I care deeply about the Warrior Class. I play it every day. I'm not a paladin, or monk, or anything but a Warrior as far as EQ goes for me. <br />
<br />
If you are really upset about me taking this role, I'm sorry. I would ask if you applied? Do you want to spend you time reading everyone's opinions in an objective and non-judgemental way? Are you willing to share them with SoE in a logical and clear manner without over-writing them with your own judgements?<br />
<br />
Now, with that said, let's get on with posting what your concerns are for the Warrior Class. I'll be collecting concerns from the Warrior Class boards at EQLive, and from here. And I'll be checking around for other boards. <br />
<br />
Most Warriors play on a team. It's fundamental to our class. Let this be a team effort to tell SoE exactly what WARRIORS WANT for our class.  I can't do this without you. And understand that I serve this community.</div></div><hr />

Do you read daily or weekly or what? What other boards do you read? Do you have a full time job/family? (not asking for details, just a yes/yes or no/no or whatever) These are actually my biggest concerns... basically, whether or not you actually read the majority of posts here. <br />
<br />
 Welcome regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am concerned about keeping paladins away from defensive and a clear distinct advantage and reason for taking a tank over a non tank.<br />
<br />
I'm happy about everything else =p;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your best bet is too look over the boards and see what we are talking about. <br />
<br />
Frankly I think the number one concert is how equally geared warriors, knights and light tanks take damage. Warriors say is around 5%, knights as high as 15%. And to add to the complications, the differances in tanking ability change at what level of the 65 game you are at. <br />
<br />
I gues I would like to see from SOE what they think the tanking differances are at different levels of the game. The impression I have gotten from the boards is the recient changes to GoD (the hit distribution) has allowed far more classes than just knights to tank. <br />
<br />
So what does SOE think the differances are-at least from there we can argue  balance.<br />
<br />
And nice introduction to the board--I hope you become a bit more active here so we get to know your voice and thoughts better.<br />
<br />
And get a magelo :-p.</div></div><hr />

Of course, that would require you to CHECK the EQLive site once in a while.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whenever someone tries to help you out in some way, it's better than no help at all, so please dont judge without even see his work, after you have seen him work, you can judge all you want and flame him all you want, but at least give him a chance.<br />
<br />
As far as me goes, welcome Kalanu and I hope we can come up with some good shit between everyone here :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheHuzMan</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations on being selected, and good luck trying to get Sony to listen!<br />
<br />
Like 99% of other warriors, I'm not in favor of giving knights defensive.  Of course, if you read this board for longer than 0.2 seconds, you'll know that's an &quot;important issue&quot; for us, so I'll move on... :)<br />
<br />
I group with some RL friends and we're in a casual guild. I would like to get a hold of some  gear that's &quot;elemental&quot; level, but currently would have to leave my friends behind to do it.  Please tell Sony I need an upgrade path that doesn't involve joining a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
This &quot;gear&quot; thing is more important for us than it is for most other classes. Bad gear = Bad warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- He's posted on the SoE forums several times since learning <br />
- He created a new account here for consistency<br />
- He showed up last night in TSW serverwide chat<br />

He's eager to fulfill his responsibilities.  He's OUR correspondent and undermining that is retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is what I expect from you in term of game balance :<br />
<br />
Warriors, SK and Pals are tanks.<br />
<br />
For an hard an rewarding adventure you NEED a warrior. Group setting or me should be as follow for tanks : <br />
<br />
WAR : 1st tank (and that's all)<br />
PAL : 2nd tank + fast heals + rez + group heal (after a dva) + Stuns + Root + high dps vs undeads.<br />
SK : 2nd tank + decent puller + snares + higher dps.<br />
<br />
Please, make sure this remains always the case for Hard and Rewarding adventures. (for easier and less rewarding adventures, group composition should be less restricitve)<br />
<br />
If Warriors aren't main tanks then they are nothing. A warrior not tanking is like a rogue not backstabbing. <br />
<br />
Please, Make sure the warrior will always be considered the best choice for a tank, or find some innovative + to add to our role in a group.<br />

Normally I side with warriors on many balance issues. This statement however... is weak. NEEDING a warrior for hard xp spots? ROFLMA. I could see needing a warrior if your healer is a druid, and if you have a cleric you can get by with a knight. But insisting that there is a warrior for every single hard xp group is assinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you Ianolar.  IMO warriors should always be the better choice from a pure tanking perspective, but no class should be required.  (I'm ok with a few special/non-required encounters that require specific classes...but these should be few and far between and not considered when discussing general game balance)</div></div><hr />

We want to remain unique. <br />

shielding was our unique ability= copied and given to every class.<br />
shielding was our unique ability= copied<br />
<br />
Certain other classes did not seem to comlpain when POP 1st came out that they<br />
were broken as a whole.  Although as soon as we got better taunt skills it placed us back on the level, as a viable tanks in xp groups, the voice got a tad louder.<br />
<br />
Hell up until that point it was actually quite difficult to keep propper agro on raids,<br />
many fights warriors had to sit it out and let a pally or sk tank for us because it was an agro intensive do or die battle with say maybe an ae proc.<br />
<br />
Now we have alot of knights that want our defensive matched offesnive dps like ours and matched migitation as well.<br />
<br />
If others classes get these skills WHAT WILL THE WARRIOR HAVE LEFT THAT<br />
EVERY OTHER CLASS CANT DO?<br />
<br />
Please, please, please for the love of god dont take the only unique thing we can<br />
do thats left, tank better than everyone else.... thats our reward for no utility, dam were tanks... were SUPPOSED to tank better than everyone else or why play a warrior?  I shouldnt have to water down mobs or dumb down my skills and or give them away to everyone else or apologize for them.<br />
<br />
Other classes are not broken, were in time and deep into god and our pallies and sk's tank about everything but gods already so, I dont see anything broken about these classes. Our tank rotation list consists of 50 % or better knights thats no bs.<br />
<br />
If they want to tank like a warrior its time to RE-ROLL, its been said 100 diff. ways<br />
knights cant have a spellbook and tank as well as a warrior= its just not fair to have both.<br />
<br />
Save whats left of the warriors and keep reading these boards, thanks for being our rep, we do need a voice.<br />
<br />
Final note:  you wont hear warriors asking for nerf's to other classes, or saying were underpowered, but read other boards what do you hear?<br />
<br />
Let that sink in a bit.  Ponder on that a while.  Our requests are few and simple:<br />
1. Dont water us down<br />
2. Dont take what little unqique abilities we have left away and give them to others.</div></div><hr />

Also are you guys sure this Kanalu is a guy? Sure sounds like a chick to me.<br />

I'm probably totally in-the-dark here, just wondering if you'd confirm that you are the community rep Kanalu -- and whether we should refer to you as he or she.</div></div><hr />
