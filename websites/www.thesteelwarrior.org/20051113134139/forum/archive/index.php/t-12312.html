<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Polo</div><div class="date">07-23-2005, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty sure, why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasco</div><div class="date">07-23-2005, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're missing the 3/3 points in Improved revenge to get concusion blow, which also means you can't have shield slam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klopo</div><div class="date">07-23-2005, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The imp revenge requirement for concussion blow was lifted in the 1.6 patch.  You no longer need to put 3 points (or any) into improved to revenge to be able to buy concussion blow.<br />
<br />
Deflection, tactical mastery, and imp charge are arms talents, not fury.<br />
<br />
Your build seems fine, yet i do disagree with some of your choices.  The 2nd and 3rd points of imp shield block are not worth the points imo.  imp sunder is ok i guess if you like to spam sunder armor, but i would have put points in other things.  if you took the extra 2 points out of imp shield block and got rid of imp sunder, you could then get 5/5 cruelty, which would net you 5% crit.  This extra crit is useful in both pvp and pve (more rage and more aggro).  <br />
<br />
I tried 13/5/33 for a week.  It was ok for pvp, great for pve.  I like ms and big reaper crits more though, so i respec'd.  I am now playing with 31/5/15 and have no problems at all tanking MC so far, yet i can still hold my own in pvp.<br />
<br />
As for gear, here are some suggestions:<br />
<br />
Head:  Helm of Valor, Backwood helm, Crown of Tyranny<br />
Necklace:  Woven Ivy Necklace, Emberfury Talisman<br />
Shoulders:  Spaulders of Valor<br />
Cloak:  Sergeant's Cloak, Cape of the Black Baron (if you are willing to lose the sta and piss off a few rogues/hunters)<br />
Chest:  Breastplate of Valor<br />
Wrist:  Vambraces of the Sadist, Battleborn Armbraces<br />
Hands:  Gordok's Handguards, Reiver Claws<br />
Waist:  Omokk's Girth Restrainer<br />
Legs:  Eldritch Reinforced Legplates<br />
Feet:  Ribsteel Footguards<br />
Finger:  Painweaver Band, Band of Flesh, Band of the Ogre King<br />
Trinkets:  Blackhand's Breadth, Counterattack Lodestone, Rune of the Guard Captain, PvP Insignia<br />
Weapon:  Arcanite Reaper, Ice Barbed Spear (that is if you decide to try ms)<br />
Range:  Gorewood Bow<br />
<br />
All of these items are drops from mobs or quest rewards.  No boe items were listed, although there are several that could be on this list.  I also did not list any pvp rewards from either honor or from wsg/av.  Get the links from allakhazam or thottbot.  i hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
