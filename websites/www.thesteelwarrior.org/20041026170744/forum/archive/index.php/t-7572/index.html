<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have petition (under the new system) a small, easy to fix bug involving barbarians and the Sand helms from NRo--they are visible. All others who have the Sands plate helm have no graphics for it. <br />
<br />
For months I had /bugged and /feedbacked.<br />
<br />
So I decided to try the new petition system. The first round of answers, which I think came out of India--was turn off any custom UIs and do a complete file scan. I didn't particularly think it would work, but I did it anyway. <br />
<br />
It did not work and I responded as such on the petition.<br />
<br />
I then get Comment ID 3497657 from CS Agent: Greetings Kailyn, please /bug the issue so it can be fixed if this is the case.<br />
<br />
Except that the petion was closed and no doubt considered &quot;solved.&quot; I could respond and was locked out from getting further feedback.<br />
<br />
Locking me out from responding that I have tried /bugging this damned thing many times JUST PISSES ME OFF and is the way to treat a customer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">...<br />
<br />
A GM cannot solve this issue.  There is nothing they can do for you, and you already know this (well, the india guy was an idiot, but what do you expect?)<br />
<br />
The petition *was* solved, because they told you to do the only thing that can solve it in game: to /bug it.  Complain on the SOE boards, which you have, and it's going to be fixed.  Its just not going to be fixed while they have more important things to do.<br />
<br />
I can just see it now: In the patch message, &quot;Sand helms are now invisible for barbarians!&quot; being responded with &quot;we have broken content, and THIS is what they're doing with their time?  Eff SOE, I'm playing COH.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and this definately doesn't belong in the War Room</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To which you smack the idiot posting, its fixing one entry in the item database and the time the devs spent reading your complaint took longer than the fix.<br />
<br />
And yes I would want to be able to feed back that I have bugged the problem and that their bug tracking system has not been able to resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
And in CS you never close the ticket without the customers ok. I am paying them to play the game. I spent  20ish hours getting the damned hat, partially on the beleive that it was not visible. <br />
<br />
Perhaps not normally but considering the other threads that are hear that deal with game wide issues, and it hooks back in with the CS improvements that Raaj posted here from the summit, it seemed darned reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not saying it isnt reasonable, but its not something the CS agent could do.  What more were you going to say to him, or what did you expect the GM to do?  &quot;Oh yes, I'll go to the dev right now and make him change it!&quot;  I understand you being upset at not being able to send the GM hate-tells afterwards (exagerating, i know you wouldnt have)...but there really was nothing he could do, and you knew that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think you should turn off new models, get an illusion, get a different helm, or all of the above and shut the fuck up.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Haass the threads bother you so much, stay the fuck out.<br />
<br />
That said, this was a complaint about their procedure not the bug it self. And to quote you, why can't I play the game the way I want. I have a god damned illusion--I don't particularly want to be a DE or use the old modles. <br />
<br />
And I am dealing with it. So far I have pissed off you. Hopefully next will be the item guy at SOE and then we can all be happy.</div></div><hr />

I'll never weild a JoS, other than that I give a rat's ass about how I look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kailyn, FYI I did mention this to some developers and next time I talk to someone who can fix it I'll do so again. It can't get fixed immediately and it would be naive of you to think it could be.<br />
<br />
Haass - Settle down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll never weild a JoS, other than that I give a rat's ass about how I look.<br />
<br />
Same here for about 99% of the game. I chose to have a visible crown of the myrmidon because it was better than the old model heads. But the new heads are worth seeing. <br />
<br />
The AC increase between the Sands BP and the Sands Helm were almost exactally the same--and as I recall the head is a beter choice for a haste aug (as that let me bump up from a RBB to Tundra Helenic), but the gravy was that in fact, I would have a bear headed look.<br />
<br />
Now what do I get? Garrish fucking Headdress--that is the look of the undyed sands armor. And if I could get something that would replace my 3.5k point hat (39 AC and 36% haste) but a quick and easy helm and haste upgrade is not in the cards.<br />
<br />
Raaj: I was not expecting an fix--but an acknologement of the problem...and being unable to give feedback on my problem with the bug system (and the fact that they assumed I have not in fact bugged it before).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It might be an easy fix but a CS rep does NOT have access to the item database, not even the GMs. Its a dev issue and getting pissy with a CS rep (no matter where they are from) isnt gonna solve anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*ehem* I think what our friend here is trying to say, but being totally misunderstood, is that perhaps the CS rep could/should have used their position to escolate and /bug the issue themselves instead of just blowing the customer off and telling them to do more work (/bug the issue). Which is kinda back asswards IMO. Even a cursory glance at the /bug cue by the CS rep could have turned up at least a few entries to confirm that perhaps the issue was in need a little love and perhaps due to it's simple nature it could be resolved easily. Relaying that little bit of information to the customer in reply to her ticket in the process.<br />
<br />
I guess it's too much work to spend a grand total 5 fucking minutes researching the issue on the customers behalf becuase thats what CS is suposed to do. Not give lip service or telling the customer what they should be doing and just assuming the customer that knows how to /petition doesn't know how to /bug an issue.<br />
<br />
Way to miss the whole point guys...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd prefer the in-game Gms, whatever small numbers of them there actually still are, to deal with time imperative ingame issues. There's NOTHING about helm graphics that is time imperative. Use the boards, fire off a few emails, sure if it bothers you, but don't waste GM's time ingame on petty rubbish like this.<br />
<br />
If you want to bitch about it not getting fixed, bitch at their handling /bug and /feedback logs and/or seek a more direct route to the devs. Like it or not, whether you can see your helm or not *IS* a trivial issue. If that's what annoys you most about the game, consider yourself very fortunate. Don't waste what limited ingame GM time there is on it though.<br />
<br />
Next time your corpse vanishes for no reason, or you log on 20 levels lower than you should be, or you get stuck in a wall in the duck position and no amount of /rewind or logging can fix it, I hope you're understanding if the GM is 2 hours late getting to you because the wode on a female barbrian's face isn't historically accurate and someone complained.<br />
<br />
The GM did EXACTLY the right thing.</div></div><hr />

if you really want to look helmetless don't wear one.  as it stands it's pretty un logical that all these plate helms DON:T have a graphic.</div></div><hr />

Ya know, when reading a message board you get to the point where you feel the need to threaten someone in real life, that's usually an indication that you're taking things way too seriously.  Yeah, I agree, Haass' response was a bit biting and harsh.  I might even go so far as to agree that in saying it he was being, for the moment, an asshole.  But really, to feel the need to kick his ass over it?  Can't you find some other way to deal with your frustrations?  Like maybe not reading anything he posts, as an example?  Besides, beating the crap out of him, if you could and I have no idea whether or not you could and really couldn't care less, wouldn't make him less of an asshole and it almost undoubtedly would land you in jail.  Hardly something you should look forward to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There are about 3 of you who need to go back and read my comments. What makes you think that I was dealing with an in game GM? The extensive logs that I posted and started with the line &quot;Hi, I am GM Belxabub, how can I help you?&quot; Or the fact that I can't even tell you who I was working with other than some generic &quot;CS Staff&quot; person--which would make me suspect that SOE does not want me to think that I was talking with someone in India. <br />
<br />
That SOE has shitty customer service does not mean that I should lower my expectations so much that I don't report problems. If I really was dealing with an on server GM, then SOE really needs to look at their procedures. <br />
<br />
That CS assumed I was an asshole and had not bugged the issue before, or (for good CS) check to see, yes there are X number of reports on this issue out there, let me see if I can give it a CS bump, or even /bug it for me. <br />
<br />
No they tell me to fuck off and do the work myself. <br />
<br />
Now what makes you think I had a real GM work on this? It certantly was not what would be a tier 3 issues (to use the tech support model--tier 1 india, tier 2 states, tier 3 in game Gm--and I would assume that the petitions flow from the lower tiers to the higher--so my petition should have had negligible effect on your petition).<br />
<br />
And you know what, I would rather that in game GMs deal with in game issues myself. My problems is just about perfectly suited to be deal with off line on the lower tiers of the system.</div></div><hr />

Hell I /feedbacked a loot all corpse buttong two months ago and look what's in the summitt notes. I'm sure I'm not the only one that suggested it but I bet it was read.</div></div><hr />

I have not been that lucky. I /bugged this the first time I equipped the Helmet. I bugged probably once a week after that. I /feedbacked. Probably more than 3 months worth of bugs and petitions. Then I stopped loggin in for 2 months. Came back and still not fixed. <br />
<br />
There a possiblity that this bug may be fixed soon. But not because any in game system actaully worked to get it fixed. How do I know--because someone with sekret board access posted it and confirmed a dev at least said they would look into it.</div></div><hr />

So you or someone you know has some backdoor access to the devs /snicker and you have been bugging this for 3months and you also know this is a dev/system issue that petitions won't help and you create a post here bitching about <br />
<br />
&quot;Locking me out from responding that I have tried /bugging this damned thing many times JUST PISSES ME OFF and is the way to treat a customer.&quot;<br />

when there is nothing more to be done about it?</div></div><hr />

A) No, but one can bet there's a lot.<br />
B) No, but one could surmise that if not, then perhaps it should.<br />
C) No, but again, if not then perhaps that needs to change.<br />
<br />
Locate a problem, the resolve the issue. If the CS doesn't have these tools available to them, maybe by dicussing it to bring it to light will highlight the fact that maybe, just maybe, these are useful tools for a CS rep to have onhand.<br />
<br />
If any of those issues present a problem in a CS rep doing their job, then maybe that needs correcting.<br />
<br />
Let us not flame people for their attention to detail and/or perseverence in trying to get a personally significant issue resolved, and try to see through the facade of a trival issue to the more subtle and profound problem at its root. Maybe by treating everyone's issue as important at as everyone else's we couold begin to see the real problems at hand and work to resolve them.<br />

60 hour work week over.  Allow me to attempt this again, since you still don't get it.<br />
<br />
YOU KNOW THAT A GUIDE OR GM CAN NOT FIX YOUR PROBLEM, and yet YOU CLOG THE QUEUE AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND YOU WASTE OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME WITH YOUR INNANE PROBLEMS.<br />
<br />
Do you disagree with that statement, yes or no?  It's real simple.  You either agree with that statement, or you honestly had no idea that a GM wasn't going to fix your problem.  Look, the vast majority of the time, a GM can't fix a LEGITIMATE in game issue, let alone a graphics bug.  I want, and I think that the vast majority of people want the GM's and guides working on things they can fix, and that can actually improve the gaming experience of other people.  I have petitioned only a few times in the 4 years I played EQ, and most of them went something like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cazic crashed, the server showed as down on the select screen, my party and I died balls deep in dungeon XXXXX, if we could get a rez, that'd be great.<br />
<br />
Now, understand that I, and many other people have made petitions like this AND ENDED UP GETTING OUR FUCKING BODIES AND REZZES OURSELVES because of the limited amount of time that Guides and GM's have to work on actual problems in tha game.  They can't do anything about your helm, you know they can't do anything about your helm, and I for one (and it looks like many other people here) don't want you bothering people who could actually be helping us with legitimate urgent issues with this game.<br />

<br />
No, I don't expect a GM to be able to solve the problem. But as a paying customer who has used the other resources avaible, and still not gotten satisfaction I went to customer service--twice actaully. I have already called CS and he suggested that I get people to spam bug the problem--which is neither a good useage of anyone's time going though the bug queue, or very likely given the level of appathy/hostility that is shown here. <br />
<br />
And yes I do expect that CS could go into the bug DB and comment that the customer followed up on this problem, please escalate. <br />
<br />
If, in fact, SOE has it ass backward and CS can't interact with the bug DB, then you are right--I should not (and wouldn't) both them with it. But on the other hand you seem to be stuck on this idea of GMness to my problem--when I in fact talked with customer service (both in game and out).</div></div><hr />

I don't give a flying rats ass if you spend 10 hours a day on the phone with some telemonkey about your &quot;Problem,&quot; but I do care about you bothering people who are in the game for one reason, and one reason only -- to assist customers with actual gameplay problems within the game.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to agree to disagree with you, if you're bothering guides/gm's with this (Even if you've also called the company and whatever else you claim you've done), then you're wrong.  Period.  You know that they can't fix your problem, and you're doing it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">But as a paying customer<br />
<br />
I'm a paying customer. I wanted the GMs to do exactly what they did - brush you off which such a pointless waste of their time. Seems like Haass agrees with me, so there's TWO paying customers to your one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">This thread needs to die quietly in its sleep, but I think there are really four issues coming up here.<br />
<br />
1. The actual helmet graphic bug. Not important to me, but clearly significant to K, and K is not alone in wanting her character to look a certain way. This is probably an easy fix for whoever can fix it, as it involves no balancing issues or significant changes to the way combat or anything else works. And it is an actual bug.<br />
<br />
2. Because this particular issue is not critical on a practical game-play level, it cannot possibly be highly prioritized by guides/GMs. In fact, they ought not be bothered with it, because 1) they can't fix it and 2) it's not as time-sensitive as a thousand other things they might be doing that actually do have to do with game-play issues.<br />
<br />
3. Customer service at SOE ought to be set up not just to handle critical issues, but to deal with trivial-but-easy-to-fix stuff. <br />
<br />
This is a common business situation: Customer has a problem with the product.<br />
<br />
This is how excellent customer service would work: This customer should easily be able to determine which customer service person to talk to about the problem and have easy access to that company representative; the company representative should be well enough trained to assess and understand the nature and severity of the problem; the company representative should either be able to address the problem or quickly access the person who can make a decision about addressing the problem. The decision should be made quickly on an issue like this and the course of action decided upon should follow soon after that according to a determined schedule; this decision and a timetable for fixing the problem (or an explanation of why the problem cannot be addressed) should be quickly communicated to customer; once the problem has been &quot;fixed,&quot; a customer service person should check back with the customer to see if the fix worked.<br />
<br />
In my experience, SOE, at least in the past, has been unable to provide excellent customer service -- indeed, they frequently are unable to complete any single step in the solution workflow outlined above -- and this inability occurs whether or not the issue is critical, time-sensitive, simple or complex. I believe that SOE customer service is so profoundly broken that I simply don't deal with it no matter what the issue. If something happened -- say, my main character was, because of some bug, killed in a spot that made the corpse unrecoverable -- I might attempt to find a GM. But I would seriously consider simply re-rolling and starting over, since it would be faster to build a new warrior than get SOE to take action on the problem, and I could avoid the entire irritating, ineffective, Kafka-like interactions with SOE that are the usual course of customer service. I'm only partly kidding here.<br />
<br />
I suspect that this thread has rhetorically pushed K. into looking like she (he?) views #1 as the critical issue here. I'll bet that even more irritating than the graphic bug to her, though, is that on such a simple issue there are such profound breakdowns in #3.<br />
<br />
4. I still think that if my butt looks big in my kilt, I should be unstunnable from behind. Frankly, I'm shocked that I didn't get a groundswell of support when I brought this up. When oh when will the masses wake up?</div></div><hr />

This isn't some sort of joke on your part, is it, K.?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I think the general concensus of opinion in here is:<br />
<br />
a) Noone gives a shit about helm graphics in the grand scheme of things<br />
b) Noone gives a shit if you do <br />
<br />
No you are not correct.<br />
<br />
Having been a half elf for 5 years and saddled with the MOST FUCKING RETARDED HELM GRAPHICS IN EXISTENCE I can see K's point.  And btw its the pervue of the Outhouse to bitch about whatever you want so this thread has lived up to my expectations and entertainment value of the day (including the requisite death threat).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Total lies.  I actually made a Half Elf paladin as soon as I got my bronze helm back in the day just because it kicked ass.<br />
<br />
Of course, that was before new models (I'm sorry that anyone uses those anywhere), and Custom Veilous helms (which I'll admit that you got screwed on)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Ya ol' &quot;the flash&quot; head wasn't bad...but &quot;penix head&quot; is just disgraceful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I can't tell you how horrified I was the first time I equipped the Emerald Warrior newbie quest helm and saw that stupid graphic (not to mention the puke-inducing neon green -- gag!). All that work killing arboreans for this??<br />
<br />
Since I was a newbie, I assumed every helm had its own graphic and devoted myself to working on something less hideous. The next step up for me was that uber head item, the lumberjack's cap, which was a minor improvement in looks, too. This made me think that I was right; i.e., every hat DID have its own graphic! Yay! <br />
<br />
Imagine my surprise and dismay when I equipped a crafted helm and saw the old graphic back, only this time with a different color....  And then that happened again with gothic steel... and then with indicolite .... When I equipped my death embracer's, I expected to see the same stupid look. And... there was no graphic! Yay! Finally, I look like a half-elf again.<br />
<br />
So, I feel for you, K.</div></div><hr />
