<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alacor</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I would first like to apologize...  I TRIED using the search feature but I kept getting told that my search words of 1HS and 2HS were too short an invalid...<br />
<br />
<br />
I am a brand new Warrior.  I am wondering what is the BEST way to go 1HS or 2HS?   I know that the 2HS gets some awesome damage bonus at higher levels, dependant on the weapon delay, I assume.   Will Dual Wield with Double attack out damage a single 2HS weapon?<br />
<br />
I know this has been debated over and over again, maybe one of you veterans can post me a link or point me in the right direction...<br />
<br />
I play on raising all my skills and I think (from my limited experience) that when fighting mobs with a DS on I'd want to use a slow but hard hitting 2HS weapon...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info.  I LOVE the boards, but it seems all you veterans buried the newbie posts pretty far back!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, welcome!  :) <br />
<br />
As far as weapons go, I highly recommend not letting any skills lag too far behind.  Its a pain to raise them later on.<br />
<br />
Even at lower levels 2hs/2hb should outdamage dual wielding, but not by much.  I wouldnt worry too much about it until your 40'ish.<br />
<br />
What level are you and how much dough to you have to spend on weapons?  Maybe we can give you a more specific answer if we knew that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alacor</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Oron,<br />
<br />
     I am still only a lowly LVL 14 Ogre Warrior.  I do have a few pp to spend but wasn't really looking into any major twinkage.  Just more interested in the theory of 1 hand vs 2 hand.<br />
<br />
I had ASSUMED that until the damage bonus kicks in that dual wielding would outdamage a single two hander.  I also thought (again, I am a noob at melee classes) that since Pallys and SKs didn't get dual wield, that they were the prime candidates dor the big slow 2 handers, where Warriors and Rangers would be more likely to dual wield one handers...<br />
<br />
Currently my skills are still low.  I have Dual Yield now and next level I get Double attack....  I just want to do the most damage possible and keep the group happy!   It's kind of hard for a noob these days when it seems everyone has at least a FEW LVL 60 - 65 alts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally my feeling on this are......... Level up all your weapon skills. Your an ogre so you have the STR to carry around all kinds of weapons. Warriors should be masters in every art of combat IMO it not only helps once you get to the higher levels but it makes for good RP :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best thing to do is to use them all. <br />
<br />
It mostly comes down to you will use a weapon because it happens to be the best thing you have at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To make the skillups go faster, try and find a shammy to group with...the dex and agi buffs really help.  I found myself levelling so fast that by the time I hit 40 I only had 1hs and 2hs maxed...everything else was near 0.  By the time it took to get to about 56 I had everything maxed for my level.  So, don't slow yourself down worrying about all your wpn skills...level now...the rest comes easy.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and do 2hb last...the GSoT can hold agro even if your wpn skill is about 20 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At your level, you will probably have an easier time keeping aggro with two fairly fast one-handers, than with a two-hander.   It all depends on what equipment you have available to you.  <br />
<br />
Get shaman buffs, and practice all your weapon skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you should try and keep up your skills, but dont worry if you cant. i know my 2hb sucked and when i got a decent 2hb at 65 it didnt take me long at all to max out theskill.<br />
<br />
at the lower levels ur probably easier off with the good cheap 1 handers, but you may also want to consider the Greatstaff of thunder for dps/aggro - cant remember if its level restricted though.<br />
<br />
its really only as you start to progress that you will begin to pick up a variety of weapons, for utility and for the situation - e.g. pure aggro/ semi aggro/dps and out and out dps. also, you cant look at how much dps is done purely from a damage bonus. theres a few 1hander combos which can outdamage what you would think is a good 2 hander.<br />
<br />
if your interested in experimenting, the best way is to download a parser and try out your weapons.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Thunder stick is level restricted.  The Sarnak Battlehammer (30/40 2hb) is not and is absurdly cheap, at least on Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
Like everyone else said, use all your skills.  Even if you can't keep them all maxed, at least keep working at them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bustinn Amove</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oops wrong thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kind of an old post, but just thought I would add some things to it.<br />
<br />
Definetly as others have said, keep your weapon skills maxed or at very least reasonable. You never know when the next hot new weapon that every other warrior on the server will be using will come out. You also don't know what type it will be - maybe it will be piercing.<br />
<br />
Also, you need to understand warrior aggro, DPS, and utility (a big part of warrior utility is through weapon procs and clicky items). <br />
<br />
I know some warriors who raid who don't understand the DPS and utility aspect of the class at all, and to be honest I find this very sad. The DPS part on raids can be especially annoying when you main tank a mob and your other warriors don't have a good non-aggro DPS two hander to use. Some use their aggro weapons and die, or end up turning off attack a lot, or rarely even attacking at all. IMO unless you tank 100% of the time part of your duty as a warrior is to have at least a decent non-aggro DPS weapon setup.<br />
<br />
Regarding warrior DPS too, at least one warrior I've talked to had the following attitude &quot;I don't do as much damage a rogue, so why do I care about DPS?&quot; Well, if things are relatively even, rogue DPS is higher of course but it's not so high as to make warrior DPS insignificant. You also can't make a guild's melee setup consist of 1 warrior and 19 rogues. If the warrior is busy with work/school, you're screwed :P. So you need multiple warriors. This means there will be times where you have one warrior tanking and the others not tanking - they might as well do the best damage they can. If they can't get at least a decent DPS setup they're dead weight IMO.<br />
<br />
Learn to use as many (all would impossible) of the tools and strategy available to the warrior class as possible.<br />
<br />
Warriors, we aren't just turn auto attack on and mash the kick or slam key and taunt key when we lose aggro anymore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">try 2*weaon damage + bonsus for a 2hander and<br />
<br />
2*weaon damage + bonsus + 2*weaon damage(offhand) for duel weilding.<br />
<br />
This won't consider doub and trip attack in primary but unless you parse, you won't know the &quot;best&quot; weapon type and each weapon varies on how good it actually is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Alacor <br />
... I know that the 2HS gets some awesome damage bonus at higher levels, dependant on the weapon delay, I assume.   Will Dual Wield with Double attack out damage a single 2HS weapon?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, damage isn't the only thing to consider.  How much aggro you generate is another factor.  And at really high level areas, how much riposte damage you take can be a factor too.<br />
<br />
In general, from what I've seen on my own parses and here, good two handers outdamage good one-handed combos.  With augments, a quad-proc might come close, but two-handers still seem to have the edge. <br />
<br />
For instance, during some of my LDoN missions I recently parsed out some things I own to compare damage.  I got something like:  <br />
1) Narandi's Lance - 63dps + 6dps dot proc<br />
2) Greatstaff of Thunder - 61dps + no damage stun proc<br />
3) Augmented Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic + Augmented Copper Hammer of Striking -<br />
Combined 57dps + about 12dps from procs = 69 dps<br />
<br />
<br />
So as you can see, both of my two handers outdamage my one-hander combo, not counting the procs.  But when the procs are included the one-handers are doing more.  Still, note that I could, if I wanted to spend the money, get a Windlance and probably do about 75dps, plus more if I added a weapon augment to it.  My one-handers would have a tough time beating that.  And the twohanders further get an edge once I max out things like punishing blade, double riposte, and flurry.<br />
<br />
Two handers also have an advantage in that you take reduced riposte damage.  This really isn't much of an issue until you hit the higher planes, though.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Aggro is another matter.  Because stun and anger 3 procs generate so much aggro compared to weapon damage, quad-procing stun/hate combos are probably the way to go to get the most aggro.  The damage you lose by using these weapons is probably outweighed by the massive aggro the procs generate.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Just some stuff to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lakashu</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't have much to say on the 1h/2h that hasn't been said.  However many have advised to keep all your skills up.<br />
<br />
For me, at least, I ran into a problem keeping some skills.  I won't practice a skill unless Im in a position where I feel I dont have to bring my A game.  For me that basically means there is another tank in the group that outclasses me, or Im on a raid where my damage output isnt that necessary.<br />
<br />
However I recently found a solution for this.  Find yourself a higher level necro or sk friend and a healer.  Head over to the arena off lake rathe.  Equip whatever weapon you need to skill up on, and have your friend call up a pet that is dk blue to you.  Whack away at the pet.  Your friend probably will keep the pet healed so you have no chance of winning, when you are low on health your healer can heal you up.  If your healer happens to be a shammy all the better for obvious reasons<br />
<br />
This probably isnt anything new, but being a relatively new warrior myself, and as you say finding posts that talk about general strategys is sometimes hard I thought I'd post it.  Hopefully anything I've said that is wrong will be quickly corrected by the veterans here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mashin</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">made lev 38 last night and my weapon skills all avarage about 110-125 skill when i go up 10 points i just switch them, i am not rich, so i been looking in bazaar for fast weapons, figure without shaman buffs it would help some, just get alot of odd comments from peeps on my aggro keeping abilities, go figure, anyways i think its just a good idea to keep all my skills going up and even. cause you never know what you can find, perusing bazaar deal for me was 10pp sarnak battlehammer 30/40 great buy i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Upem</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think both have a purpose.  I use my 1hs when I am MA just because of the weapon delay and procs.  (using SotB and CHoS) When  I am not the MA i will switch to 2hs just for the damage output.  No taunting etc.  I have seen warriors including myself hold good aggro with 2hs no problems.  So its a matter of choice i guess.  But i do agree with the other posts that it is vital to keep all of you weapon skills up to snuff.  Might sound silly but buy a rallic pack and put one of each weapon type in the bag.  (i.e 1hs, 2hs, 1hb, 2hb and piercing)  when that weapons skill is maxed for the level switch to the next one and so on.  That way when ya do get a chance on a nice drop or upgrade from the bazaar no time is wasted in leveling up that skill so you can use it effectively.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always carry my bag of weapons, 2 1hs, 2 2hs, (one agro one not) 1 2hb, 2 1hp, 1 2hp.<br />
Then I switch weapons depending on sitiation, it really is best to keep them all as high as possible as it makes up for it when you get that nice weapon and have to wait to get the skill up before it becomes useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also...try to make sure you get some kind of weight reducing pack :D up until now i would carry like 7 or 8 weapons daily and the ol backpack just wasn't cutting it :D<br />
<br />
but try to keep them all up. sure; when you can break out the ol' 2H blunts and piercers+stuff; but the meat and potatoes up until the heavy hitters of PoP will be with the 1H slashers or 1H blunts.<br />
<br />
it's really not hard to keep them all top-notch. once into the 40's you'll have time to work on them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heretik</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a cleric but my advice for an easy way to raise weapon skills is to just run up to an xp group in pop, dreadlands, etc that is fighting mobs that con blue to you and ask them if it is okay for you to hang out and beat on mobs they're killing.  As a warrior it's guaranteed you won't killsteal the group and you'll be helping them out while you are raising your skills.</div></div><hr />
