<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) Assuming that we are still going to have aviodance/mitigation based system, I want to see both parts of the AC number so that we can compair between classes. <br />
<br />
2) Assuming that we are still going to have a to hit /to damage system, I wnat to see both parts of the number so that we can compair across classes. (And so we can stop explaining to newbies why the +atk mod with extra str is a lie.)<br />
<br />
3) I want to see something that is modular and expandable, like spells, so that as new expantions are added on, new abilites can be added melees (and hybrids) to keep pase with pure casters.<br />
<br />
4) I want to see something that benefits melees as much as clerity helps pure casters. Be it 3 different regen lines (pure caster, hybrid, melee) so that warriors can regen 200+/tick without blowing up necro mana regen, and be able to solol for some XP.<br />
<br />
5) A definition of balance that does not have warriors unable to solo, casters kiting/quad kiting the elementals and bards swarm kiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I understand your frustration, this spell line does in fact exist already.  You're talking about haste.<br />
<br />
Haste has been in the game as long as clarity has, and has the same dramatic impact on melee performance that clarity does.<br />
<br />
It would be reasonable to ask for enchanters to be able to cast a 2.5 hour base duration haste spell like the 2.5 hour base duration clarity so you can go get it before you start your adventure and not worry about having to have a haster in the group.  That would put melee and casters on an even keel.<br />
<br />
It might even be reasonable to ask for better haste buffs and an increased haste cap for pure melee.  50% more haste would go quite a way towards solving pure melee problems. <br />
<br />
200/tick regen, though, strikes me as pretty unlikely unless it's something massively short term like the clerical Heal Over Time spells.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure soloing is a key aspect of melee balance, personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Upem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would like to see better Hp and AC difference between pure classes and hybrid classes.  Also some sort of bonus for being able to duel wield would be a huge plus for me,  more hits= more aggro for us via ATK rating.  A larger success rate for taunt would be another huge help for me.  Who knows what they have planned for sure, Im willing to bet there will be at least one thing we ALL will be scratching our heads and saying WTF?  Who's brain child idea was that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll join in on the fun.<br />
<br />
Things I want to see WITH a new combat system (most of my stuff doesn't address a new combat system, per se, but that's only because I question SOE's ability to actually mess with the combat engine at this stage in the game):<br />
<br />
1- If monks are to be &quot;avoidance&quot; based melee combatants, I want to see it, and feel it, and be able to notice it. I want to avoid STUNS when running away from mobs. That shit's been getting on my nerves for over a year now. If I'm a get totally wrecked each time I get hit, fine. No problems there. Just make me AVOID THAT CRAP when pulling as I would avoid it normally. I'm a kung-fu master, I have EYES IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD ABSOR-SAN! (hey, I sense your mocking ... don't make me take some chopsticks to your fly!)<br />
<br />
2- Melee Archtype AAs need to fixed. Plain and simple. There's no reason for Hybrids to share ALL melee archtype AAs and casters to share all the GOOD melee archtype AAs. Either have melees get MORE out of their &quot;defensive&quot; AAs or cut back on the benefits casters and hybrids get from them. A wizard's &quot;lightning reflexes&quot; should be nowhere near as good as a rogue's. And an enchanter's &quot;innate defense&quot; should be nowhere near as good as a warrior's.<br />
<br />
3- Purify Body AA for monks. Fix it to match the cleric AA. This is my crusade. <br />
<br />
4- SOME TOYS. It's been a long time since melees have gotten ANY new skills, any new INNATE toys. Some call this utility, others call it viability, I don't care. Point is ... if you're revamping combat, keep in mind that one thing to keep it fresh will be to give melees something ELSE to do besides auto-attack and make sure they're in melee range. This is one of the things I want most. How many new expansions with how many new spells have come out? And still, the last thing I got was triple attack. Before that, DISARM. Sheesh.<br />
<br />
4a- Don't make the new toys like DISCIPLINES. Crap I can use once every hour and a half, and only lasts for 8 seconds. It will be a complete waste of everyone's time.<br />
<br />
4b- While we're on the topic of disciplines ... Ashenhand is pointless in light of finishing blow AA. Silent Fist is pointless in light of Dragon Punch AA. Warriors have discs they find pointless. Do something about that. Give us NEW buttons to push (new toys) and make the OLD buttons worth pushing again.<br />
<br />
5- Ranged Combat. It's seriously out of balance. Rangers and casters are effective at range. Melees are a joke at range. I'm a KUNG-FU MASTER! My ninja stars should be able to do more damage than 7 points! Warriors are MASTERS of combat. They should be able to sustain better BOW damage than they do. Atilla the Hun was NOT a ranger.<br />
<br />
6-  Adjust the worn regen cap for MELEES ONLY. It's nowhere close to being balanced against the worn FT cap.  Something like 60 to 70 hp per tick would be far more like max FT considering how melees don't have focus effects.<br />
<br />
7- Give melees a benefit to having a MOUNT, comprable to casters. Wizards on a steed? What the hell? KNIGHTS and WARRIORS on a horse, with a big ass polearm, charging into the FRAY. That's the image from good movies and books. Not pansy ass Raistlin on a horse. Howbout an ATK modifier (200 raw ATK beyond the atk cap) and sitting REGEN modifier while on a mount? That way a knight with a lance or polearm and a warrior with a battle axe &quot;CHARGING&quot; into battle makes sense.<br />
<br />
8- Skill caps. Raise them for melees, and melees ONLY. 305 in offensive skills. It should make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I really want is a quested magic boomerang that always comes back and procs enraging blow 100 percent of the time.  It would have a range of 50 to 150 and be throwable every 30 to 45 seconds.  It would help solve initial agro problems and it would be a nice way to pull since you wouldn't have to carry 200 arrows around all the time.  Alternately, just give me endless quiver and an innate 250 agro proc on bow shots that has a 100 percent proc rate, perhaps in the form of a quested magic arrow.<br />
<br />
Also, 200 innate standing regen sounds good too.  Casters can completely regen all of their mana in like 5 minutes, I have to sit there for 25 minutes to get back my 5600 unbuffed hit points.  It would be far better to solo low blues for 3 hours than it would be to be LFG and a significant increase in regen rate would allow this.  I think this game will never be balanced until all classes have at least some situations where they can effectively solo when they can't find a group.  Making some classes good at soloing and some not ever able to is moronic.  Why should a warrior be absolutely required to always group when a necro is not?  Grouping should add to the play options, not restrict them completely.  I would be interested in seeing a breakdown of AA points aquired by the various classes vs time played and level.  I have a feeling that soloing classes would have at least twice the number of AA points as non-soloable classes for a similar time played at the same level.  The difference would be from all the time wasted LFG.  1 to 3 hours a day is a huge amount of time over the course of 1 to 3 years of playing--completely unacceptable.<br />
<br />
AAs to increase proc rate and proc agro would be nice as well.  None of these 2, 5, and 10 percent joke increases either, that is a waste of time.  Just make them 33, 67, and 100 percent increases like ingenuity.  Make it warrior or pure melee only and this would go a long ways to balancing pure melee vs. knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The numbers you need for warrior HP regen are scary. I blink at them when I propose them, but figuring that any realistic soloing fight will take at least 1/2 your HP, and I have 4500 unbuffed (adn thanks if I am soloing I WILL find extended brells, V and focus) 6000 lightly buffed, it is a realistic number for keeping down time sane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What I would like to see in the new system is something like what they have in DAoC and a slew of other games out there. <br />
<br />
EQ's warrior class is the most boring warrior class I have played in any game. It's almost mindless to play a warrior until you get closer to the end game and end up tanking larger mobs, but then still, you just have to know to use defensive, and call things out to the raid. Still not much. <br />
<br />
In other games, ill use DAoC as an example, there are many styles available for each of the &quot;warrior&quot; type classes. Take a look here http://daoc.crgaming.com/combat/default.asp?id=5 <br />
<br />
This is a list of styles available for one of the tank classes in DAoC. Their &quot;taunt&quot; is actually a fighting skill, unlike our taunt button, but I think the diversity in the styles make it a much more fun tanking experience. It leaves a lot of room for expansion, it makes the class more fun to play and gives a viable way to make us be able to hold agro better while in turn keeping balance.<br />
<br />
Now, if something like this were implimented, we all know other classes would be screaming for the same thing, but in my opinion, they get their spells, we should get styles, but I would hope the styles wouldnt have /disc type refreshes, that would just make them as worthless as most of the other stuff they have given us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">bah, call me jaded, but they're just gonna screw us over.<br />
<br />
<br />
i bet'cha they're just going to add the melee system that is going to be in EQ2, they're gonna add it to EQ1 like they did instance zones, augments and the new particle spell-effects so we can beta-test it for them...  should be a nice distraction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think we are the EQ2 test server.... new graphic engine, new spell effects, revamped combat system<br />
<br />
<br />
not that there is anything wrong with that hehe, should be fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What I could like to see :<br />
<br />
The ability to grab aggro fast enough that the Shaman (and the rest of the group) isn't killed by a failed slow.<br />
<br />
The ability to survive long enough for a second slow without popping /disc Defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">shadowfrost youre wrong.<br />
<br />
The haste cap never changed.<br />
<br />
You are able as a caster to have a mana regen multible times higher than in Kunark.<br />
<br />
As a melee youll have the same old hast cap.<br />
<br />
Thats a real big difference.</div></div><hr />
