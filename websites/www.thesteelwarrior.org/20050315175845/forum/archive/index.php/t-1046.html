<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">is all over the place. I would like to do the shield quest but am KoS from pre-nerf Lycea kills. Any suggestions on how to recoup faction would be appreciated. I have considered fighting in Seru and/or tenebrous mountains. Wondering which is better or are there other options.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathas</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that there are several factions inside Katta:<br />
<br />
- Validus Custodus<br />
- Concilium Universus<br />
- Magnus Colnegium<br />
- Katta Castellum Citizens.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure precisely which factions Lcea gives hits to, but I'd assume all of them... and if you're kos to all 4, the fastest way you'll be able to do the shield quest is by hunting in Seru.<br />
<br />
The first NPC you deal with in the shield quest is Phenic  Dionicas... and in the same room as him, is a blue-at-65 enchanter NPC on Citizens faction.  She doesn't see invis, but she WILL aggro you when you try and do a turn-in with Phenic if you're kos to Citizens.<br />
<br />
The only way I found of easily raising Citizen faction was by hunting in the Shoulder building in Seru(NW building, or first on the right as you enter the inner area from the north).  I guess it might be possible to become non-KOS by killing the vampyres for a week and saving all the teeth/ashses if those quests give +Citizens, but I don't know if that's the case.  Hunting in Seru definately works.<br />
<br />
If you're kos to Magnus Colnegium, the Heart building in Seru is the fastest(SE, or back left).  By the time I farmed all my reports for the third Seru earring, I was non-kos to every faction except Citizens(Innoruuk SK).  Killing the Shoulder Praesertum for my 4th earring got me up to indifferent.</div></div><hr />

Doesnt take long to go from dubious to amiable, so that might be a good additional means of getting your faction fixed.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathas</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been a while for me as well, but I think vampyres in TM raise Validus Custodus(guards), Concilium Universus(casters), and Nathyn Illuminious.<br />
<br />
If I'm right, you'll still need to repair your Citizens faction somehow(either in Seru, or possibly via quests).  I'm also not sure what faction the other NPC in Phenic's room(the dwarf) is on.  There is a chance he's on Magnus Colnegium faction, which would require more Seru hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you kill Lcea is there way to repair it?<br />
and what faction is she on? Cause I heared its not reperable but Alakhazam has her on Concilium Universus faction which is reparable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mathas</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lcea is on Magnus Colnegium, and it is repairable.  As an Innorruuk-worshipping SK, I was fairly well into scowling just by being me... I am now kindly or higher with every faction in Katta(some factions cap at kindly for the evils), despite a bit of Katta hunting pre-PoP.<br />
<br />
To raise Magnus Colnegium, hunt in the Heart building in Seru.  If you head into the inner area of Sanctus Seru from the north, it's one of the rear two buildings... don't remember which off the top of my head(I think SE), but one has a heart above the door and the other has a hand.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you're wanting to do the earring quests and are worried about faction, just do them(start by farming drops for #3).  Unless you have phenominal luck with the reports and they all drop very quickly for you, farming all four of those and killing the Praesertums for your 4th earring will get you non-kos.  If by some odd chance it doesn't, help a guildmate do theirs.</div></div><hr />
