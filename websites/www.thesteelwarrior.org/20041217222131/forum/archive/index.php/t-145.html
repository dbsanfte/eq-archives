<br />
1694 AC (Unbuffed) = 329.4 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1815 AC (Unbuffed) = 311.7 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1917 AC (Unbuffed) = 295.0 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
2112 AC (   Buffed ) = 288.6 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Just for reference:<br />
1694 AC = 666 hits, 219374 total damage from hits<br />
1815 AC = 813 hits, 253380 total damage from hits<br />
1917 AC = 507 hits, 149544 total damage from hits<br />
2112 AC = 752 hits, 217004 total damage from hits<br />
<br />
Would have liked to have run the 1917 AC test a little longer, but I ran oom due to lack of clarity.<br />
<br />
http://bellsouthpwp.net/e/h/ehf/ac%20test%20graph.gif<br />
<br />
Also an interesting note. I still dont think its enough data points heh.  It would appear that AC starts tailing off in effectiveness, when a 200AC jump nets you 2% more mitigation.  But if I take my log of 2112 AC and split it into 2 halves, I get 275 average hit for the first half, and 301 average hit for the 2nd half.  That tells me that one of those 2 halfs was likely either unlucky large hits, or lucky small hits.<br />
<br />
If I only used the first half of the log which was a 275 average hit, then the graph makes basically a perfectly straight line. continuing through 2100 AC.<br />
<br />
It could be that AC effectiveness tails off. It could be that AC effectiveness stays the same and my tests are off. The disparity in the 2 halves of my log of 752 data points says alot to me.</div></div><hr />

It would make a better representation if you subtracted the base damage from each of the data points to represent true mitigation since you can't mitigate BD, ever.</div></div><hr />

There must be a 'soft cap' at ~1900 since that is obviously the point of diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
Seriously, thanks for the hard work.  Nobody else is doing any meaningful AC  tests, this really helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not a &quot;Soft Cap&quot; per se.. I  mean you cant say.. ok.. I got 1900 AC and I am done forever.. since the ac softcap seems to be tied directly to the mob you are fighting.. Pre POP (and perhaps new CT) this &quot;Softcap&quot; was right around 1300. For the mobs Solinar is fighting for his tests.. it does seem to be right around 1900... Although I bet you will continue to see ac improvements with say 2200 AC fighting Sol Ro.... <br />
<br />
So alot of it just depends on the mobs you are tanking at the given moment and their abilities...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My numbers are not statistically adequate to test AC.  I dont have enough data points.<br />
<br />
Splitting my 2100 AC log in half the first half is 275 average hit, and the 2nd half 301, thats a huge disparity.<br />
<br />
That tells me that I dont have nearly enough data points to make any conclusive statement about a soft cap or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
If you just take the first 140k damage of my 2112 AC log, the line in the graph continues on perfectly straight through 2100 ATK and there is no reduction in mitigation per AC whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Do I believe there is no soft cap? I dont really know. What I do know is that my numbers did not include enough data points to definatively say yes or no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol, <br />
<br />
Can you please apply your superior analytical power and show what, if any, correlation there is between your various AC points and Damage spikes?<br />
<br />
In the previous discussion, it was shown that the likelihood of a damage spike went down exponentially as you increased AC even though damage mitigation went down linearly.  <br />
<br />
(fyi, damage spikes refers to a mob getting a series of max or high hits in a row, like getting 8 max/high hits out of 10 as opposed to getting 2 max/high hits out of 10).<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your work,<br />
Wyndaria, <br />
Virtuoso, Firiona Vie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The chance of a spike is just (% of max hit)^(number of consecutive hits).  Usually this number is 4 so the chance goes down like n^4, which is really fast but not quite exponential.  But it's kind of misleading to just calculate the max hit.  Would 4 max hits minus 1 DI kill you?  2 DI?  How about 3 max hits and one max minus 4 DI?  If you just look at consecutive max hits, the only conclusion is that damage spikes are impossible.  I can't even remember the last time I've been hit for max 3 times in a row.  But obviously damage spikes happen, because you don't need 4 consecutive max hits to instant kill a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way too many factors involved.<br />
<br />
If you ask a specific instance, the probability could be solved Im sure.<br />
<br />
For instance, right now at 2k AC, most PoP mobs hit me for min about 40-45% of the time.  The remaining 55-60% of hits are pretty evenly spread over the remaining 19 Damage Intervals.<br />
<br />
The odds of any single hit on me being for max damage is 60/19 or 3% of all hits are for max damage.  Considering that there is also a 50% hit rate (50% of swings are misses/dodges/ripos/parrys) that means the actual chance per swing of a max hit landing is around 1.5%<br />
<br />
Chance of being 1 rounded is 1.5%^4 or 0.015^4 X chance at the mob making dual weild and double attack checks.<br />
<br />
Lets guess and say most quadding bosses, quad 50% of rounds.  That means the chances of a round of 4 max hits is 0.0000025% or 1 in 39 million rounds.<br />
<br />
Thats good stuff, but unfortunately not the whole picture, because often a quad of DI = 18-20 will kill you just the same as a quad of DI = 20.  Hitting for near max is enough to kill you.  Also there is the chance of getting a riposte at the same time, and also the chance of Flurry, chance of catching 2 rounds of melee between CHs.<br />
<br />
Its all a game of chance, and lowering the size of hits via AC, or lowering the rate of landed hits via evasive, both are very effective at reducing the chance at bad rounds to a level where they will likely never occur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let us not forget, basing the entire AC softcap on one SolRo yard trash mob is not game defining. Even if you were to find a &quot;soft cap&quot;of 2000ac on that trash mob, I am betting you wont find that the same as someone like Fennin Ro or whats to come out of Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
Kazzuk hit the nail on the head. Its all dependant on the mob you are fighting, its abilities, debuffs in, etc. I would not buy into an AC softcap again, especially based on a mid-Teir trash mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to throw in a thanks though Solinar.

<br />
Other tests have been done with statisticlly significant amounts of data.  They are found on old forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your results don't need more hits to generate acurate average hits. You need more tests at various ac levels  to determine the slope of your curve. <br />
<br />
As posted before, the last, and highest ac test didn't yeild the results that would be expected from the linear trend could be due to getting close to the minimum hit damage of the mob. I hope it is that, because it is the only data point where you are buffed and it has been surmised that ac from buffs works a little differently from raw and gear ac.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the same, or a more thorough test done on a diferent type of mob. I think that you will should get the same curve, and that curve is what will shed light on the math behind the AC number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I would like to point out to the people that say there is no more softcap. By the nature of the way the combat engine works, there is necessarily a soft cap. Due to a mob always having a minimum hit, the slope of the line when you graph AC/average hit is always going to flatten out as your AC becomes high enough that the majority of hits are for minimum.<br />
<br />
The trick is finding the point at which the gains for more AC are not as great as the gains for more HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wandor : biggest problem is there is no definite answer to that trick : the point you are looking for is not the same for different mobs.. i would say it has to do with the ATK of the mob.. so the 'softcap' for xp is not the softcap for raid tanking ( as bosses prolly have more ATK ) ... so the real softcap would be the one versus the hardest mofos in game... and i think noone is willing to run parses versus them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Sylvaiania.  The soft cap for xp mobs and the soft cap for Fenin Ro are probably different and both are probably based on that mobs attack rating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so the 'softcap' for xp is not the softcap for raid tanking ( as bosses prolly have more ATK ) <br />
<br />
This has always been the case. 1200ac was way more than you needed for most exp mobs in Velious, that just happened to be the point that bosses ATK overcame the additional benefits of any more AC.<br />
<br />
The difference now is that the PoP uber mobs have considerably higher ATK ratings. There have been a few FR and RZ parses, but nothing conclusive yet. The good news is, if you are tanking these mobs, you don't have to choose between AC or HP, the gear you have access to has both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actaully I tend to disagree :p<br />
<br />
I will have to take a look at it, but lets dispell an untrue hypothesis right now, hitting harder does not mean a mob has more ATK.<br />
<br />
As we know for a fact from players, more atk does not increse a players max hit, it just means you hit near max more often.<br />
<br />
Im guessing that how hard a mob hits is a completely separate entry in the database than a mobs innate atk value.<br />
<br />
Lets use some real world examples.<br />
<br />
Xegony the queen of Air = 2440 max hit.<br />
Rallos Zek the Warlord = 1072 max hit (iirc)<br />
<br />
From pure hit size alone, one might deduce that Xegony has far more ATK than RZTW.<br />
<br />
Xegony = 40% min hits(DI=1), 60% of the rest spread equally over DI=2 to DI=20.<br />
RZTW = like 60% max hits (DI=20) and the other 40% spread between DI=1 amd DI=19<br />
<br />
I have parsed RZTW with chain cure and bard song so that most of the fight I was at 2k AC. he still hits for max a ton.<br />
<br />
My point is, RZTW atk is oviously cranked up. More AC doesnt seem to help very much.  WHile Xegonys ATK isnt that bad, you can mitigate a large number of her hits to min and more AC helps alot.<br />
<br />
So which has higher ATK, obviously, to me at least, RZTW's ATK &gt;&gt;&gt; Xegony's ATK.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you parse your average exp mobs in PoP, it seems that the % of min hits and distribution of all hits are about the same on exp mobs as they are for uber mobs. This tells me that their ATK levels are very similar, even though exp mobs hit for double 500, and ubers hit for quad 1-4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Solinar.  Using a &quot;slightly&quot; less uber example, take the boss in the hedge quest in PoN.  He hits for around 1100 or so max, but most of his hits are for around 300 or so.  So he has a pretty high max damage, but I'd say he has a pretty low ATK.  I think this is true of a lot of the PoP mobs.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion that's why AC seems to matter again.  We can actually get our AC between the minimum needed to be effective (AC floor?) and the softcap.  With Velious and Luclin bosses, presumably the mobs had such high ATK that it wasn't possible to even reach the AC floor so your AC didn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well you may true sol ... i though it was clear for everyone here that atk and damage was not related ... <br />
to clear it :  we know dmg = DB+X*DI for a mob , with X random between 1 and 20 , and DB and DI dependant on mob...  atk allow to hit closer to max , so increase X . AC ( well , mitigation one, the one from stuff and buffs ) allow hit to land for lower damage, lowering X. that is why Ac and atk are directly opposed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I reread the uber mob tanking thread that is stickied.  Anway, the notions that wars on this board have about ac/attack and mobs are really stated in that thread and my post alluded to that thread really.<br />
<br />
I would guess that any damage table has min possible values and max possible value where ac can mitigate OR attack can increase damage values and then you approach one extreme and the value of increasing/decreasing starts to show fewer results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hidaguard</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I'm glad I read back through before posting, or I would have sounded like a complete idiot, lol, but I do have a question.<br />
<br />
Did you parse for the same amount of mobs per ac lvl?  (have to have some sort of &quot;control a&quot; you know, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was 1 mob. I didnt kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zewlaga</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just been tossing this around today after reading this post. But basically it looks to me to be something like this:<br />
<br />
DMG = DB + (x+(y*(av-ac) / 20) * DI<br />
<br />
Where x = random number 1-20 (damage intervals)<br />
            y = random number 0-20 (can still hit for min so 0 included)<br />
            x = max(20) anything over 20 will return 20 or max dam.<br />
           av = an attack value assigned to each mob<br />
           ac = armor class value based on your ac<br />
<br />
This will push the damage curve to the right given a higher attack value for a mob (they hit for closer to max damage more often).  And push the damage curve back to the left with more AC ( they hit for less more often).<br />
<br />
This would mean that each mob would have a different AC softcap, but that number could be determined given enough sample data.<br />
<br />
I can explain the formula if needed, but I think it is somewhat self explanatory.  Let me know what you think.<br />

Most have 700-3000 hit.  With a decent average and deadly spikes.<br />
But the average hit, is closer to the &quot;average of min/max dmg&quot;<br />

Rather than give mobs uber ATK ratings like they did in Velious, their ATK is rather low - such that it can be overcome by AC. The compensated by giving them a much larger max/min hit.<br />
<br />
The net result is the same though, there is still a &quot;soft cap&quot;, but in the case of PoP mobs this cap is determined why the level of AC required to get avg hit down to a reasonable level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. As always, terrific work Han!<br />
<br />
2. You definitely have enough swings to generate a level of statistical confidence. It might not be the &quot;truth&quot;, but you have enough data to estimate the level of certainty with which you can say what you are saying.<br />
<br />
3. I'm a little concerned about the use of average hit, rather than dps. As Solinar points out elsewhere (and for another issue), the frequency of hits has a bigger impact on damage absorbed than size of hits. If there's any way to recover dps absorbed data for the time spent with the different AC levels, I think that would be much more significant. <br />
<br />
Unless we know for certain that high AC can not mitigate hits into misses. Is a hit always a hit, no matter what your AC -- does AC only impact the range of x? If AC only impacts the range of x, then the average hit measure seems okay. What frequency are the mobs hitting you at those AC levels? My hazy recollection is that gear only gets you mitigation AC, which does not include avoidance, which means hits are not converted into misses by getting better gear, which means, in this instance, higher AC does not mean more misses, which means everything I'm saying can be ignored?<br />
<br />
Or maybe I've been out of EQ long enough I've lost track of all of this stuff. It's been 2-3 months since I logged in, so sorry if this is old news or doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hit % appears to be based soley on level ratio.  Every 65 mob appears to hit every 63 warrior about the same % of hits/swings with maxxed defensive skills and AA (CA/LR) non-wistanding.  At least thats been my experience.<br />
<br />

*bump again*<br />

Let's sticky this, or I'll just copy and paste it into the ubermob tanking thread. Hate to lose this stuff.</div></div><hr />

pop currently 1280 unbuffed but giving away 150hp or should i drop back to 1250 to get those hp back?<br />
have a few equipment changes comming up and just wanted to know if i should still concentrate on ac?<br />
just ball park fine without getting to deep thanks.</div></div><hr />

It really depends on what you are tanking. The new AC theory only applies to PoP era mobs so if you are still tanking Velious or SoL bosses, then stick with the 1200ac softcap and go for HP.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you are going to be tanking tier 3+ bosses then you should be aiming for 2k+ AC. The nice part about the gear that will get you that much AC is that it also has a ton of HP on it.</div></div><hr />

It was proven on the old boards.<br />
<br />
How to prove it:<br />
<br />
<br />
Find a static level mob, duck to avoid parry/riposte, and let it beat on you fully clothed.  Record the number of misses.<br />
<br />
Get your AGI to whatever it is while you're fully geared (you're gonna need a shaman) then on that same static level mob, duck to avoid parry/riposte, and let it beat on you naked.  Record the number of misses.<br />
<br />
They should be ~ identical if your sample is large enough.<br />
<br />
edit: forgot to add you have to take out all the successful dodges from both sample sets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maths</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1694 AC (Unbuffed) = 329.4 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1815 AC (Unbuffed) = 311.7 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1917 AC (Unbuffed) = 295.0 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
2112 AC ( Buffed ) = 288.6 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
<br />
Just for reference:<br />
1694 AC = 666 hits, 219374 total damage from hits<br />
1815 AC = 813 hits, 253380 total damage from hits<br />
1917 AC = 507 hits, 149544 total damage from hits<br />
2112 AC = 752 hits, 217004 total damage from hits <br />
<br />
Usually when you do this kind of study you want to estimate the errors. As an example it would be nice to know; if I were to repeat the 1815 AC test with 813 hits, can I expect the average hit to be 311.7 again? As you probably already know, the answer to this question is no. What I would like to be able to say is; with 1815 AC the average hit for this particular mob is 312 +- some number, with some degree of confidence.<br />
<br />
Since you didn't post the standard deviation for your samples I can't give you exact confidence intervals for the real average hits but I can still make a rough estimation. <br />
<br />
The error is porportional to the standard deviation and inversly proportional to the square root of number of observations. So we have:<br />
REAL AVG HIT = MEASURED AVG HIT +/- k*STD_DEV/sqrt(n)<br />
 <br />
where k is a constant from the students distribution with some degree of confidence (k=2 corresponds to ~95% confidence) and n is the number of observations.  <br />
<br />
We already have the number of observations and the measured avg hit so we only need to make a rough estimation of the standard deviation. I don't have any logs from sol ro but I found some 1200 hits from a soldier of fire in my logs. The standard deviation for that set was 194 which I will round to 200. Now assuming the sentry in sol ro have the same Max and Min hit (733, 173) as a soldier of fire in PoF we can use 200 as an aproximation of the standard deviation to get an idea of the statistical uncertainty in your test.<br />
<br />
For the 1815 AC test:<br />
REAL AVG DMG = 312 +/- 2*(200)/sqrt(813) = 312 +/- 14<br />
<br />
and this I can say with 95% confidence if I neglect the fact that the standard deviation might be somewhat off. <br />
<br />
Note: a good estimation of the standard deviation is (Max-Min)/2.. this will always be an overestimation of the error and in our case it would lead us to the conclusion: real avg dmg = 312 +- 20 with more than 95% confidence.<br />
<br />
Note II: As you can see the only way to lower the error is to increase the number of observations since the error is inversly porportional to the sqrt of number of observations. With 3,000 observations our error would decrease to +-7 and with 10,000 observations the error would be down to +-4.</div></div><hr />
