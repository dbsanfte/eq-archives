<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took a 6-mth hiatus away from EQ, and now I find myself sorely lacking in terms of equipment.<br />
<br />
My guild is basically only 1-2 grps max and so can't do most big stuff. The only recourse is to probably buy them from the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Btw, I also do not have Ykesha or LDoN expansion (so my choices are fairly limited).<br />
<br />
Current Equipment:<br />
Ear1: Vah Shir Claw Earring<br />
Ear2: Earring of the Solstice<br />
Neck: Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
Face: Ancient Pirate's Eyepatch<br />
Head: Custom Champion's Crown<br />
Ring1: Velium Fire Wedding Ring<br />
Ring2: Velium Fire Wedding Ring<br />
Wrist1: Full Mithril Bracer<br />
Wrist2: Teir'Dal Regent Bracer<br />
Arms: Vambraces of Discontent<br />
Hand: Velium Encrusted Gauntlets<br />
Shoulder: Imbued Granite Spaulders<br />
Chest: Clawed Coat of Tyro<br />
Back: Cloak of Destruction<br />
Waist: Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide<br />
Legs: Champion's Leggings<br />
Boots: Champion's Boots<br />
Weapon1: Shortblade of Lightning<br />
Weapon2: Primal Velium Battlehammer<br />
Range: Idol of the Thorned<br />
<br />
I was thinking in the range of upgrading them to:<br />
<br />
Ear1: Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
Ear2: Lizard Tooth Earring<br />
Neck: Mithril Spiked Collar<br />
Face: Ancient Pirate's Eyepatch<br />
Head: Kizrak's Helmet of Battle<br />
Ring1: Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
Ring2: Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
Wrist1: Kizrak's Bracer of Battle<br />
Wrist2: Kizrak's Bracer of Battle<br />
Arms: Vambraces of Discontent<br />
Hand: Kizrak's Gauntlets of Battle<br />
Shoulder: Barbed Rubicite Pauldrons<br />
Chest: Clawed Coat of Tyro<br />
Back: Cloak of Destruction<br />
Waist: Heavy Rubicite Belt<br />
Legs: Champion's Leggings<br />
Boots: Champion's Boots<br />
Weapon1: Shortblade of Lightning<br />
Weapon2: Primal Velium Battlehammer<br />
Range: Stonewood Compound Bow (or Featherlight)<br />
<br />
Got a few questions:<br />
1. Is it worth changing the Velium Encrusted Gauntlets for Kizrak's? Or should I stick to the Velium Encrusted?<br />
2. What weapons should I switch to? (1H preferably that can be reasonably obtained or bought)<br />
3. I probably can't afford anymore $$ to buy Kizrak's Greaves or Boots. What other upgrades can be recommended?<br />
4. How does the list look?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The hands are almost a downgrade if I remember correctly get them only if you need the extra haste and dont have chanters around much.<br />
<br />
The best item is the Ornate BP - that 300HP and some AC shield just adds to much to pass up - I would look for that first, unless yours is super super, I have not heard of it.<br />
<br />
Check my Magelo for &quot;good items for the price&quot; value - get the Long Sword of Yek before the Short of Light...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just bought a Kizrak's Bracer to replace my Full Mithril Bracer.<br />
<br />
Do you think Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn is considered an upgrade to my current 1HS?<br />
<br />
Longsword of Ykesha is kindda outta my reach atm (server selling for 45 - 60k). I'll already be terribly broke after I upgrade my armor/jewellery pieces :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldget CHOS and keep both of your weapons just switch out the primal when it procs with the swiftblade of lighting.  But put the CHOS in mainhand for the procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really suggest you try and buy a copy of LDoN. The options it could potentially open up for you equipment wise are hard to pass up.<br />
<br />
Definately pick up one of the droga weapons, you could prolly find both for a decent price. Offhand the primal to swap with the bloodsworn sword I believe wouldn't be that bad. The copper hammer in main isn't too shabby either.<br />
<br />
2 groups can do quite a bit in the game today, but not knowing just how much of a class makeup you have access to is very limiting.</div></div><hr />
