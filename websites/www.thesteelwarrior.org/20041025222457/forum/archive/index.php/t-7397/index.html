<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We did Uqua tonight for some people still needing the flag, and one of these dropped. One warrior in attendance is an applicant and uses Blade of War, we had to force the Fleshbiter on him since it was rotting. The fact that it's PRIMARY only makes Fleshbiter basically useless, IMO. I could see it going in offhand paired up with DBotW, but primary only makes no sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not everyone has DBoWs.  I still don't have one and probably never will.  DBoW is the only weapon I can think of that obviously puts out more aggro than a Fleshbiter based on damage/delay and procs.<br />
<br />
Though it wouldn't hurt if they remembered to put an increased proc rate mod on Fleshbiter like DBoW, and make the stun stun up to level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looks like a good alternative to Darkblade to me.  Sure it's not as good and needs to be tuned a bit.  But for guilds that have absolutely shitty luck getting Darkblades, this isn't a bad item.  If I already had a Darkblade I wouldn't loot it of course, but if I didn't I prolly would.</div></div><hr />

What is the level limit on Static?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is the level limit on Static?<br />
<br />
&quot;The stun portion of this effect works on creatures up to level 55.&quot;<br />
<br />
Needs to be raised.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gakmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How can it be a good alternative to the DBoW? if the proc is just a dd? because if the stun doesnt work on mobs 55 +, this proc = no aggro ?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A resisted/immune stun is the same aggro as a successful one. This weapon would own a BoC, hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not everyone has DBoWs<br />
<br />
Sorry :|  I kind of assumed most warriors beating Uqua would have one. All mains and all alt warriors (except for 1 twink) in my guild have Darkblades.<br />
<br />
A resisted/immune stun is the same aggro as a successful one. This weapon would own a BoC, hands down.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it would own a BoC, I just can't imagine any warrior progressing this far in the game who's going to be using a BoC or anything close to BoC. Seems like a meaningless comparison, like saying BoC would own a fine steel shortsword, because of how far apart obtaining the two are.</div></div><hr />

  I was just answering the above post, which did bring up a BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">actually im not so sure it would own a BoC in aggro. its definately a superior weapon to the BoC through the stats but i cant imagine the aggro being more than just marginally better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The ratio is a whopping .42 better, 1.17 compared to .75. The aggro via proc is about 300 less per proc, or 600 - 900 aggro less per minute (dependent on WA). I guess it depends on whether or not the hugely different ratios, and therefore DPS, make up for that loss in proc aggro. My guess, seeing as I don't have a Fleshbiter, is that the BoC would lose rather significantly.</div></div><hr />

Just a reminder, 95% of VT+ raid-level items are in the eqitem database.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">2 DBoW in 25-30 RZ kills .... And still rising</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the proc difference comes out with the BoC 900 ahead id say the dps difference would come out with the fleshbither about 1200 ahead. if you had a yak auged gstaff of 4 winds and a BoC, the gstaff would win out by a little bit most likely, and thats basically what a fleshbiter is, with a little less dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">JOS is better aggro than BoC, and has pretty much the same proc aggro wise (if not a bit less) than Fleshbiter.  <br />
<br />
Fleshbiter does really need to be tuned though.  It makes no sense to have the warrior weapon of GoD be significantly worse than the one from the expansion before.  And considering how much harder Uqua is than Time...Grats SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just leave it like that, its a decent weapon.<br />
Better than EoE or JoS mainhanded.<br />
<br />
Change the fucking graphic.<br />
<br />
I'm a warrior, not some gay green treehugging elf shoe lovin ranger !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It doesn't need to be DBoW+ because then it'd be kind of dumb to have DBoW and Fleshbiter and you can only use 1 of the 2.<br />
<br />
Make it proc a bit more or make it stun 65 though.<br />
<br />
And people grossly overestimates the aggro attributed to procs, unless it's Anger.</div></div><hr />

So... useful for LDoN as a DPS weapon than.. since no raid mobs are level 65 now adays.<br />
<br />
Btw this is not the end game warrior weapon of GoD, I assure you, Uqua is far from End game in GoD.  So technically it can be on par with time weapons and still be usable for some that dont get time equipment.  GoD has alot of loot thats time quality so far with a few extra's that are slightly better than Quarm loots, but also alot of it just isnt much of an upgrade, so it goes to those members who did not get time upgrades in each slot in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The SK weapon from Ikkiniz3 isnt as nice as the time one from TT. And has the ranger curly shoe graphic.<br />

*hugs* warriors youre not alone</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow. 3 second level 65 stun is AWESOME. Neg 100 resist adjustment even. 3 seconds of less damage is amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes amazing for time trash clearings and LDoN's, this is a GoD item, you'd think it'd be designed for that type of content ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Stun 3/68 is a bit overpowered really... I'm not even sure why they give it to Knights on the Uqua weapon but at least being a weapon from Uqua there won't be too many of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Did RZ yesterday and that damn bastard didnt drop us DBotW! ..... again. What's new huh? Over 30 RZ kills... think we have only 4DBotWs. Still need 4 DBotWs dont think we will ever get them. Maybe we just settle with this one for now. Although it's being only for primary not too shabby.   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The stun is nice , but only for exp situations really.<br />
Make it offhand useable and maybe i would use it , if not it will just head off into novelty bank.<br />
RZ have been nice to us so far , 8 dbotw in 20 kills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tygur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The above is correct about aggro on the proc that does not affect the mob.  I use the BBoE and the stun doesn't affect any PoP mob but all de damed if that proc won't pull aggro of a cripple of slow cast instantly.  I somehow doubt that the 95 damage is does to the mob is that overwhelming and make it hate me more then a slow or a cripple.  So a resisted stun proc is pretty good aggro, heck just aska pally and they will tell you.</div></div><hr />
