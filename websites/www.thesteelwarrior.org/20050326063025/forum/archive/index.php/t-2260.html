<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here it is.<br />
<br />
I tanked Diabo Xi Xin in Vex Thall for the first time last night and I worked this out:<br />
<br />
DB=200<br />
DI=50<br />
<br />
These are the only figures that fit the damage curve. Min Hit 250, max hit 1200.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well they would be except for this...<br />
<br />
I had some hits for 225,175,125,75,25.<br />
<br />
Ok 225 is min hit under defensive. But WHERE the HELL did the other hits come from? These are HITS, not bashes, nukes, kicks or anything else.<br />
<br />
I think I have the answer.<br />
<br />
DXX Quads. Not often but he can. If when he does some hits are considered the offhand, there's no DB! Ergo min hit 50, max 1000. So under defensive I would see hits of 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200. <br />
<br />
But I didn't see those hits. I saw 25/75/125/175/225. I put this down to the small sample size. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have some parses from other mobs that quad that could confirm my suspicions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I should add this...<br />
<br />
The very very strange thing is that even under a sample this small you see that all the hits under the apparent minimum have a delta of 50? There SHOULD be some hits at 50, 100, 150, 200. <br />
<br />
Above 225 damage I have hits at every possible combo. 250, 275, 300, 325, 350,  375, 500, 425, 450, 475, 500, 525, 550, 600, 625, 650, 675, 700, 725, 750, 775, 800, 825, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200.<br />
<br />
Actually when I consider that my previous assumption of 200/50 seems wrong. Max hit under defensive would be 700. Where's 725, 775, 825 coming from? <br />
<br />
I'm too drunk atm to work this out...<br />
<br />
It's bugging me.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can now explain the hits at 125 and 175. I was shielded for a short time.<br />
<br />
I will have to go find out if anyone runed me - I don't believe so but I wasn't paying that much attention to my buff bar. This might explain the remaining anomalies at 25, 75, 725, 775 and 825.<br />
<br />
Looks like it can all be explained anyway... <br />
<br />
DI=50<br />
DB=200<br />
<br />
Defensive tanking mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn was I drunk last night!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mob bash/kick/etc also use a different dmg calculation, which might fit the other values you saw-<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />
