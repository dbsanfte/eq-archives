<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My magelo is off to the side, i recently invested a good chunk of change into ornate arms and gauntlets as both came highly reccomended and those slots sucked pretty badly for me.  anyways, i've found myself with around 20k left to spend and these are my options:<br />
<br />
a) buy thurg bp multiquest (sell bp i have now after the fact for 20kish)<br />
b) sell current earing and buy a bloodmetal earing<br />
c) ??suggestions??<br />
d) save my money for after GoD comes out because there isnt much of an upgrade i can purchase atm and just need to level my lazy ass.<br />
<br />
what would you guys suggest?  anything with more ac would be good i imagine (my ac seems low to me /shrug).  also i'm thinking of starting my coldain ring quests.  i know you can multiquest it around the 8th ring or so (which i'll prob do using my ranger).<br />
(wishes he had made his warrior rallos zek).  my rings arent the best atm ... but hey, they were free (monetarily speaking).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can get the Thurg BP MQed then do it.  I still keep mine in a bag for when I need the heal.<br />
<br />
If 20k is all you tend to ever accumulate, I'd suggest skipping the earring since it's not a huge upgrade from what you have.  At least not to be spending all your money on.<br />
<br />
I suggest a Copper Hammer of Striking since you have 1-handers in your magelos.  If you use the GSoT most of the time, then maybe not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well i recently sold my CHoS because i got it for cheap and found a really nice buyer.  That, combined with the fact that in most cases my GSoT is better aggro and dps, the CHoS wasnt worth keeping around for now.  I can see myself with a Great Blade of storms in the relative near future and maybe a xana hammer, so i'm done toying with them other than saving up ldon points for ykesha and maybe anger 2 augs.<br />
<br />
i'll look for the bp methinks.</div></div><hr />
