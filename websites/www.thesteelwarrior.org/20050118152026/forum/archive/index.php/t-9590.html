Aside from that your gear is great for your level.  You may want to look into FH boots to go with the rest of your set. They might have slightly less hps, but have more ac.  Also sell your Silver Chitin wristband and buy another FH bracer.  Those are the only offhand upgrade suggestions i can offer that isnt going to cost more than 50k per slot.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah ... I almost for got to mention: get rid of the SBoD  :p .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The boots and bracer idea above are good ones in the armor category; there are better items out there for both slots, of course, but cultural tends to be pretty strong in those slots, and very very good for the cost. <br />
But I'd also point out that your gear is extremely good for the level of that warrior. If a mob thumps you, it's not your gear that will be the cause. You could level to 65 with what you've got on and be okay. And even if you have a lot of plat right now, that might not be a bad idea, depending on your server's economy. On mine, some items are dropping in price, and I would think that this is an effect of OoW and some pretty nice gear turning up.<br />
I'd sell the splitblade. If my shaman were in a pick up group with a warrior I didn't know, and the warrior equipt a splitblade for tanking, I'd be really really nice to him. That's because a warrior using a splitblade is obviously the alt of a caster or is being twinked by a caster, and the caster might be a cleric, and you never know when my warrior main might need a rez. I would also, however, assume that my shaman is about to die.<br />
Your magelo is showing you also have a GSoT and a WMBS, so I'm not sure you do really need help in the 2HS and 1HB categories. If you are in a dps role, the WMBS is pretty decent. Of course, if you sell the splitblade you can get a better 2HS, but the price climbs fast beyond the WMBS.</div></div><hr />

You have an awesome belt for tanking but it wouldn't make up for 31% haste.  Your DPS and aggro will notice a nice boost.<br />
