<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the conventional wisdom on the Red Scale is that it drops off Nagafen and Talendor, but not Ragefire anymore cause he is triggerable.  But when I look on eq.castersrealm.com under the walkthrough, it also lists Nortlav the Scalekeeper in the Hole as having it.  Castersrealm still lists Ragrfire as having it, but it seems to be out of date.  <br />
<br />
Is this info on Nortlav the Scalekeeper out of date like Ragefire now?  Does he still drop it or does that a mystery?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure Nortlav still drops them, he's just a right pain in the a$$ to get to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just clear down to him.<br />
<br />
It's EASY.<br />
<br />
Just takes about 20 minutes time to hack your way down to Nort.<br />
<br />
He's like VS. No great shakes.<br />
<br />
Take him out, get red scales, be happy.<br />
<br />
Maybe drop Yael while you're there too, make a monk happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for us it took like 1.5 hours. that way then took like 25 min with 2 clickies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strikingone</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, takes no more than 30 mins for me to get a group down..probably only 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With 8 people I got to High Scale Kirn in about 20 to 25 minutes.<br />
<br />
With 18 people I got to Kindle in about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
With 12 people we got to Jaeliel in 20 minutes because someone went LD. Then we got to graveyard in undead city for the paladin guy in another 10 minutes because someone went LD. Then we made it to Yael in another 5 because someone went LD.<br />
<br />
Moving about in the Hole is very easy for a group with at least 2 level 60s in it.<br />
<br />
All that stuff can be mezzed. We just pull it in bunches, and hack it up and move on.<br />
<br />
Jumping into the Hole, you run the risk of a lag bubble or burp 20k-ing you, no matter how good your connection.<br />
<br />
Why run that risk, just to find Yael's up too, and he starts DTing the people who SURVIVE the fall?<br />
