<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mightie Gnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what some people have paid for the following epic MQ's<br />
<br />
Ball of everliving golem<br />
Hand of Mestro<br />
Spiroc windblade<br />
<br />
How hard is getting the hand now with the new hate?  I remeber VI saying that the hand would be on a mob with a level equivalent to the reward.  Of course I'm not holding my breath on that either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fear ball cost me 6k, Wingblade cost me 5k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only 5k for wingblade?  Damn, I may get my epic this century then.  Only missing red scale and wingblade =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I heard Ranger stone was much MUCH easier from someone who posts on MB that plays on Stormhammer.<br />
<br />
Haven't heard anything about Hand, but if Ranger stone got easier, odds are Hand got easier.<br />
<br />
Then again, hand's pretty damn easy in old hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I paid 30K for my Wingblade and 30K for my Greenscale and I'm pretty sure I'm going to bag the red epic off hand soon as well :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looking to pay/trade extremely well on Povar for MQ of spiroc wingblade.<br />
<br />
PST in game<br />
<br />
Braeorn Battlekrye<br />
61st Warrior<br />
Povar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>chongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I paid:<br />
<br />
Ball of everliving golem :: 6k<br />
Hand of Mestro :: Free from guildie<br />
Spiroc windblade :: 20k<br />
<br />
All prices on Luclin server. All prices subject to change</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maestro Hand I just gave away this weekend after the best offer was 1500pp. Lol... its fairly easy to get and drops every time, so. *shrug* :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mightie Gnome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow I hope I can get my hands on these MQ's!  Did anyone have trouble finding someone to MQ them?  Or were they guildies and friends?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't tell Braeorn, but I snagged mine on Povar for 40k.<br />
<br />
Let that be our little secret.<br />
<br />
Damn Plane of Sky and its non-popular-ness.<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Damn you Snog!!! I've been spamming buy msgs for that for two months...UGH!<br />
<br />
But grats to you...please let me know if you find anyone Mq'ing it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks man. Actually the GOOD news for you is, it took me about 2 months to find a seller as well.<br />
<br />
I know there was more than one out there to be had, too, as more than JUST Knob replied to me in the 2 months I was trying for it.<br />
<br />
If my guild actually gets up there (and we may be going there soon), and kicks butt, I'm hoping we can snag a couple. There's been more than a few warriors looking for the wingblade in auction.<br />
<br />
And, personally, I think more lightsabers on Povar would just be a good thing. Especially around Christmas time with the pretty particle effects. Red Epic + Green Armor Dye ... oh yeah, now I've got something to do when the holidays roll around!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, I'd love to have DW the red offhand with the Cord Hilted Spike Driver (?) from xan...nice agg combo.<br />
<br />
Hey, send me a tell in game if you can remember anyone that had one...maybe I can make them an offer they can't refuse ;)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Elroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Explain, i dont see it.<br />
<br />
Why would you want to buy your epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Whats not to see? Red blade procs 500 to hate, plus dd and has reasonable stats to boot. Ratio is about the only issue most ppl have with it.<br />
<br />
Warrior epic is likely the biggest PITA of all epics, so buying parts of it can make sense.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Didn't buy any of mine *grins*<br />
