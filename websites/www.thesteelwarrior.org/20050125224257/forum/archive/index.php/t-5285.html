Listen i havent played eq in about a year so im a little rusty on whats good as far as  weapons and id like your help to get the best i can. I have about 150k pp in the bank and about another  150k or more in items to sell.  I would really like a helmet of rallos zek or watever unless you guys can convince me otherwise. Oh and i still need rings, leggings, a mask, necklace, and helm, any suggestions here would help too. Im lvl 54 and i do have a cloak of flames. (transfered servers if your wondering)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For weapons, get a Copper hammer and a sword of the bloodsworn. Also pick up a Greatstaff of Thunder, you'll be able to use it next level anway.<br />
<br />
As for everything else, I would get some cultural for now and start leveling up. With the amount of plats you have, you can get some pretty good gear if you watch the bazaar. There are a few slots that are hard to fill with good items. Try to get those first, the rest you can fill in with ornate drops or cultural gear.<br />
<br />
As for the slots you need now -<br />
Rings - Valorium rings will last a while<br />
Legs - go with cultural for now, then upgrade to ornate of Tak legs later<br />
Mask - grimling contraption is pretty good<br />
Neck - either a necklace of flame marked links or an amulet of mummy wrappings will do for now<br />
Helm - Helm of RZ is as good as it gets pre-Elem. On my server it will set you back 150k or so. You might consider making an LDoN haste helm if you can find some other rare tradeables like crystalized acid bracers.</div></div><hr />
