<br />
Is it at all possible to stick a tracking bot in Plane of Fear to see if the golems are up or not? I had heard that there is a safe spot a ranger/druid can camp out at, North Wall?? but running around just earlier (fear had been cleared cept for CT who we cannot kill) we couldnt see any likely place. Any strats on this or is it just a case of luck?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll have to double check but I remember a person in my guild had a druid parked in Fear to check for golems, and I think it was right at the zone in. Of course, knowing druid track, the golems probably wouldnt show up from the entrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gobbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The slope on the northern wall (not in the trees), where the fire wall and the northern wall are closest together, is pretty safe.  The only thing that can kill you is the one wandering glare lord, if its even still there.   My druid has been bound there for about 3 years, and have only gotten into a few deathloops :)  You can see Terror, Draco, CT, and Wraith o Shissar from that spot - you can not see Dread, Fright, or Broken Golem.  I usually can assume correctly that all 3 golems are up if Terror is... since people usually won't bother clearing to the other 2 and not killing Terror.</div></div><hr />

As I understand it theres a spot north of the temple that is relatively safe, but that you have to careful as there is a see invis spider that paths there occasionally.  <br />

I reckon your best bet is to post this question on the wizard boards as I know many of them have put in a considerable amount of effort on working out how to track for the broken golem.  (I know this from the number of times I've had to CR them).</div></div><hr />
