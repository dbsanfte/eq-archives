I usually last the entire duration of evasive disc.</div></div><hr />

unless they are wielding a weapon that has a proc.</div></div><hr />

Namely Qezzin Adan in the Bertox ring, who procs 5k DD.  With defensive our wars dropped FAST (we wiped twice), though I did live through 9x 5k DDs... with Evasive on... we get MANY less DDs and so far we have not lost a tank vs him.<br />
<br />
I'll do evasive on Reparm when I get to tank him, thanks for the info ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong, and unequivicably proven so earlier on the boards.<br />
<br />
NPCs can only proc weapons with procs on a miss.  Innate procs will never happen on a miss.<br />
<br />
You might have to dig pretty deep to find it, and it might even be on the old EZ boards but it was proven without any doubt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Them not proccing on physical contact is the reason why WS works so well for debuffing him before a war gets on him...<br />
<br />
Our wars usuually use defensive and our higher HP'd ones can now take a few procs and still live on a good CH chain, some use evasive and it seems they live a good amount of time, a double 3K + 2k + proc is as probably as bad as double 1600 + 1200 + double proc... (i'm going by generall numbers not physiically calculating what exact numbers would be under defensive)...<br />
<br />
However thats just what i've observerd, would be interesting to have a bigger study on it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm we've always used Defensive and it's worked fairly well. We don't have the cleric army some guilds do, lucky to get 5-6 for Reparm or anything else. With 500FR you partial resist a good number of his procs, with some full resists. And I've always been a  fan of avoiding guaranteed damage(melee) before random(proc).<br />
<br />
 Course, our tanks aren't 10khp and 1900ac yet. And if you have more clerics I'm sure Evasive is better too.</div></div><hr />

I do notice with a bard in group I partially resist a good amount of his procs, the last time we did him I lasted about until 80% =D heh….. His stun is crazy at first cause if he procs when you attack and stuns you then hes going to go nuts on the healers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have lasted the whole fight with 7 clerics and using defensive.  I have also died with Reparm at 96% with 10 clerics using defensive.<br />
<br />
Reparm is a luck fight with defensive or evasive I would think.  I will try Evasive next time for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/smak Beefy<br />
<br />
Makin them think the 7th warriors never fought Sont omg~<br />
<br />
I believe we do actually use /defensive on Reparm, dun ask me why I never get to tank his ass - always 3 or 4 other cats ahead of me /shrug.<br />
<br />
Next trip to PoF I'll mention it and see what they think.  Sounds valid to me considering how nasty the little bitch is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so...<br />
<br />
<br />
whats the most warriors you've gone through on reparm? (and won?)<br />
<br />
50 People... 7 warriors..... each one tanked around 10% with one standing for about 25%...<br />
<br />
zerged last 10%...<br />
<br />
14 people left standing?<br />
<br />
Hah not one of the more pretty attempts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I'd say since most of our raids are 5 warriors, 3-4 pallies and mebbe 2 SK's that our scrappiest pull out victory was first 3 warriors down during the first 50%, Valanse (Pally) tanked him for the last 50% til deaded.  Mebbe 15-20 peeps left alive (no I wasn't one of em, fooker spun on me and bipped me twice with 2 procs and I was squished).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the time(s) I used evasive on him, I still died because of spikes because you trade fewer procs, for harder hits, and since he hits and procs for 3k+.<br />
<br />
Double procs with defensive kill you sure, but a single proc, and then 2 hits for 3k+ with evasive, are just as deadly in my experience.<br />
<br />
Basically I felt like either way there were problems and ended up sticking with defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless your AC is extraordinary good defensive works well on Reparm just to deal with his very high max hit.  It's not like they're missing that much more with evasive.  His melee is quite considerable too.<br />
<br />
But in the end he can still kill you no matter what disc you use if you're unlucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like evasive on Reparm coz no matter if you use defensive or evasive a bad spike either in form of a couple of 3k procs and large hits defensive, or a triple 3k hit etc... evasive is gonna drop most tanks pretty fast. Main reason I like evasive is the fact that less he hits = less chance for him to procs on me = less time I am stunned for = more agro I generate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm staying with defensive.<br />
<br />
Procs are totally random and killers.<br />
Might as well try and smooth his melee DPS.<br />
<br />
(BTW 2 CH lines do wonders for him)<br />
6 clerics + 6 others , almost cuts down his melee dps to nothing.<br />
<br />
Has helped me survive quite often Proc+2-3hits and 3 double procs.<br />
<br />
Still this is a DI lottery , unless we see 15K tanks soon, he's DA MAN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if we are on the ball, 2 or 3 tanks is normally all it takes. need spellshields, runes, spam healing and if possible 8 cleric insta ch chain. hehe botted 2 clerics on him last time.<br />
<br />
i just dont see how ppl use evasive though on such a hard hitter. the chances hes gonna get in a solid round + plus a proc seem pretty high.<br />
<br />
weve single tanked to finish or really close a few times though, maybe it was 2 minutes out of disc, ultimately just a matter of luck and blast healing i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the chances hes gonna get in a solid round + plus a proc seem pretty high.<br />
<br />
Well, the chances of him getting a solid round + a proc are lower than when you use defensive.<br />
<br />
You all seem to think that with evasive, you see<br />
<br />
miss<br />

miss<br />

hit<br />

hit<br />
hit<br />
hit<br />
hit<br />
<br />
It almost never works out that way.  The misses and hits are well balanced such that DPS stays pretty even, just like defensive.<br />
<br />
Both take 30%ish off melee DPS, but one of the two takes 30% off proc DPS as well.<br />
<br />
Seems pretty clear to me, I have single tanked him countless times, always with evasive.<br />
<br />
to each his own.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It isn't DPS that kills you against him or most things, so it pretty much does not matter if evasive and defensive might reduce DPS by the same percentage.<br />
<br />
What kills you are the spikes in damage, and fact of the matter is, even comparing evasive vs defensive, he HITS you far more often than he procs on you, so which would you rather prepare to defend against spikes in damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanked him with both many times, and now I stick with evasive as I almost never get 1rounded before it falls. I personally find that its the double procs which generally are where I die and they are pretty rare with evasive.</div></div><hr />

I died after disc faded though only because he did 10K+ damage in one round and I have less HPs than that.</div></div><hr />

 Actually that's what it usually looks like when I die evasive tanking, or anything else. Fuck the &quot;random&quot; number generator right in it's stupid ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gain An'Sydnor</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm dont know if its me or that they seriously nerfed Raparm but he seemed like a very easy kill for us.  Think we went through 1 tank.  Was also our first kill.  And no I am not confusing him with Druav.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats what im saying. i assume most the time evasive lets you evade a hit or two per round, but within those 3 min im also guessing evasive is going fail and you take full quad hit + possible proc dmg. i much rather get the guaranteed mitigation. soundsl like most of us have single tanked past disc anyways though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We normally go defensive and single tank him all the time, but I tried evasive last night. Everything went well until about 20ish where he connected twice (max damage) on a quad with 2 procs on the hits. My luck just ran out.<br />
<br />
While I cannot say which discipline is better, evasive did make life easier not being stunned so much, which in turns doesn't get others killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I logged on with my guild in PoFire and they were on their way to Reparm.  I am often the first tank on Reparm as I was tonight.  However, I had forgotten I had used some lame offensive disc late the night before while doing exp. <br />
<br />
So I start to fight Reparm, and I think wow -- I am still up and he is at 95%, then 90%, then 85%... soon he is at 50% and I think I have to drop soon with no disc... I cannot stay this lucky!  I think about 3 DIs had gone off successfully and I was still up when he enraged.  A few seconds later, my guild had one tanked Reparm with no disc!  Pretty slick!<br />
<br />
(10 clerics for those who were going to ask, and about 54 total)</div></div><hr />
