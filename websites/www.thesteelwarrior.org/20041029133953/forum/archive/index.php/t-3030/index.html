<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So after doing 1 successful adventure for EC and one for N Ro, it seems like the stuff you have access to on the merchants is determined by how many points you've earned adventuring for that particular camp, not how many total points you've got.  I have a similar selection of stuff to choose from at both EC and N Ro, but at the others I have the same selection I had when I hadn't done any adventures at all.<br />
<br />
Aside from progressing through the story line and seeing a greater variety of zones, it seems like if you want access to the best items the fastest you're best off picking 1 adventure camp and doing nothing but those adventures.  Am I wrong?  It's going to take a lot of missions for me to start seeing stuff I want anyway so I'm not concerned about it but it just seems like an odd way for the merchants to be set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The items available vary from camp to camp. Realistically, to see the best stuff you'll have to get 'point faction' with all of them.<br />
<br />
Also, that Adventure Stone you got is a charm augmentation that gains power as you hear stories from ALL of the camps (one is not enough). You need about 100 points or so it seems (this may scale I'm not sure) to get the NPC in each camp to 'flag' you. Once you've been flagged by all camps your adventure stone gets a bit better. I'm not sure of the stats since I still only have the appropriate faction with two of the camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">New things and quest boggle me =\<br />
But I am an ogre :)<br />
<br />
Do you get these &quot;Flags&quot; by doing the adventure at each camp or by talking to them? I talked to guy in EC tunnel to get my stone, which is not even equiptable yet, but I have done no adventures so this doesnt worry me. Does its power go up per adventure or per say 20 adventures? I have not done any as I have said but my curiiousity runs further than my actual experiances do :) any info :) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 adventures per flag, 5 flags per adv. stone increase I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At each camp is a &quot;lore dude&quot; that I'll call &quot;Lore Dude&quot;.     Every time you complete two adventures in that theme... &quot;Lore Dude&quot; will tell you more of the story of that theme and you'll get the little &quot;flag', but it's not a flag it's 'You have received more valuable information' (quoted loosely).   Once you've done 10 adventures in a &quot;camp&quot; you will receive an upgrade to your adventurer's stone.  Rumors are that each 'camp' has 100 possible 'wins' x5 camps.   At 2hp/mana per 10 adventures, that would make it 100hp/mana after completing all 500 adventures.<br />
<br />
Your mission:  Find &quot;Lore Dude&quot; in the camp and talk to him on every other success in the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Let me see if I can clear this up a bit...<br />
<br />
1. The Adventure Stone<br />
This is an Augmentation for a charm, not a charm itself. Combine it with your Intricate wooden charm or some other charm.<br />
<br />
2. Wayfarer Flags<br />
After you successfully complete 2 missions (102 adventure points on normal level) in a given camp you can talk to an NPC there and get a flag similar to the one you got when you got the Adventure Stone.<br />
<br />
It is still somewhat unclear how this works<br />
A. Is it the 2 succesful adventures that earned you the flag or is it the &lt;= 102 adventure points that earned you the flag? [I would lay money on points]<br />
B. Do the number of successful adventures / points required to get the next flag scale or do they remain at a constant 2 / &lt;102?<br />
<br />
3. Improving Stats on Adventurer's Stone<br />
The stone improves as you get flags with *all* camps.<br />
<br />
The statement that you need 2 succesful missions per flag and 5 flags to improve the stone is accurate in that the first flag per camp comes at 2 succesful mission (or &lt;102 adventure points, see above) and you need flags from all five camps to improve the stone.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Has anyone found their stone improved by getting 5 flags from ONE camp only? I have heard that it only improves as you gain lore with all five. Is anyone able to confirm/deny either scenario by firsthand knowledge?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have 2+ wins in all camps(15 total). My adventurers stone have not improved. On the other hand a guildy have been doing MM exclusively, and he got the 2hp/mana after doing 10 succesfull MM missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got 21 wins atm, 14 in mm, got +2 hp/mana on charm so far YAY!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The way I understand it is you can only spend points you've earned in the camps you've earned them in, which sucks horribly if it's true because I sure as hell don't want to spend the next several months farming Guk to get the Ykesha procs, then have to do it all over again when I upgrade to a new weapon.  <br />
<br />
If that's how it's gonna be then I'm done with EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kaledan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">which sucks horribly if it's true <br />
<br />
<br />
It isn't. The first post explains how it works.<br />
<br />
soru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Found this post:<br />

LDoN Multi themed point adventures (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2997&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=2) <br />

<br />
Not quite true (or ambiguous at least)<br />
<br />
You need to get a certain amount of points in a theme to unlock the items in that theme's teirs. Once unlocked, you can use points from anywhere to buy them.<br />
<br />
eg:<br />
<br />
You have:<br />
300 points from Guk<br />
400 points from Everfrost<br />
600 points from Butcherblock<br />
Total = 1300 points<br />
<br />
You cannot buy items from the 500 tier in Guk or Everfrost, but you can buy from the 500 teir in Butcherblock. You can buy 2 items from the 500 point tier from Butcherblock if you wish, leaving yourself with 300 points left.<br />
<br />
If you then went out and gained 700 points in Mistmoore (total points now =1000), you could buy a 500 tier item or two from Mistmoore, or another one or two 500 point items from Butcherblock <br />
<br />
If that made sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's a catch 22 though; you can't unlock the high end stuff at a camp's adventure merchant unless you have done adventures and earned points from THAT camp.  <br />
<br />
If you want to buy a 1150 point augmentation from the Butcherblock adventures, you'll have had to do adventures from Butcherblock totalling close to the 1150 points just to unlock the items to see them.  If you take those 1150 points you have saved to buy something from deepest guk you won't even be able to see those augmentations until you have done close to 1150 points worth of adventures from Deepest Guk... <br />
<br />
Maybe I&quot;m missing something, but how can you use points earned at one camp to buy something from another when you can't even see the item on the merchant at the camp you didnt adventure at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes you can use points from one camp to buy previously unlocked gear from another camp.  So if you have 500 points from MM and 500 points from Guk you can buy two 500 points augs from Guk or MM, but you can't buy a 1,000 point aug from either camp</div></div><hr />

<br />
Say you want the High End armor from Takis...the Royal Attendant stuff that costs 1492 points per piece.  You have to earn 1492 points in the Takis camp to unlock the items, no way around that.  However, once you have the items unlocked you can earn all of the remaing points (17904 give or take) for a complete set in Deepest Guk if you want to.  Once the item is available it doesn't matter where the points to buy it come from.  <br />
<br />
Needless to say, the most practical thing to do is to fully unlock all 5 themes.  Then you can pick and choose what you want from any of the camps at your leisure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I asked in my guild's forums about this and it appears from first evidence to be false. <br />
<br />
A beastlord friend of mine got enough points to buy Pack Shrew spell. Purchased it and still had enough points from other camps to afford another copy but it became unavailable.<br />
<br />
Its strictly points per camp only afaiac until I see evidence to the contrary.</div></div><hr />
