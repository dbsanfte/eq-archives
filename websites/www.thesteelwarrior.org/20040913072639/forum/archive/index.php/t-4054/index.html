<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DragonHerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You know, it's really nice to hear your comments on how you enjoy/dislike the change. But your opinions are about as useful as the crap that's spewed on Allakhazam's and Everlore. This is a quest forum, please keep the threads and responses on how to solve the quests and not how *you* think the world should be, okay?<br />
<br />
<br />
So anyone with real information on Cogswin? Nayr Cogswin wanders PoK and is for a magician spell quest, Pellillo Cogswin is in The Hole and talks of his lost brothers, Tani Cogswin (Chardok) and Stiggle Cogswin (Dragon Necropolis).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You're allowed to post your opinion as you see fit.  The rest of us will do the same.  In the end, mods decide where topics fit, and if you REALLY feel that you need to do the epic, then you deserve to read exactly how much time you're wasting by fuckin around with it, if not for your sake, then for the sake of the people who are doing the fights for you.<br />
<br />
If the epic was able to be completed with my 2 toons, I'd probably have one, just for the sake of having one.  Since it's not, I refuse to waste my friends' time for a piece of shit that for all intents and purposes SHOULD be bagged these days, for anyone capable of questing it.  You can spew whatever crap you want about aggro or prestige or whatever, but the fact of the matter is that this quest is a WASTE OF FUCKING TIME, and making the green scale more common doesn't change that fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DragonHerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">-sigh- Thank you for preaching your opinion to us.<br />
<br />
1) Not everyone is in a guild that can hit NToV, AoW, VT, Elementals for a weapon that procs better than the epic. I fortunately am, but like many high tiered guilds, most will not waste time with an epic. Personal upgrading with the friends you have is always an exercisable option. Difficulty is a personal thing, for me.. I have 4 epics, and my wife has 2 epics. I've helped with at least over 50 epic raids for others. I can do things that you probably can't duo. I've duo'd/trio'd 3 of the previously listed epics from start to finish.<br />
<br />
2) Most of the epic involves 1 group, some encounters require at the most, 2 groups. The rarity of the drop in question has always been a contention point, just like Ragefire was to clerics.<br />
<br />
3) This is the quest forum, not the Rants forum and thread subject about the usefulness of the epic.<br />
<br />
4) Now that you've received your attention, can we please get back to the subject of how the quest is accomplished? Any progress on location Cogswin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You need not be in ANY raiding guild to obtain weapons that are better than the epic, (in case you're clueless, 3 such better weapons can be purchased in your bazaar for 20k combined or less), and because of that fact, i really fuckin doubt there are a whole lot of people scrambling to find an NPC walking around with green spray paint.  <br />
<br />
Taking a walk is probably your best bet, I wouldn't expect the majority of the people here to actively waste time searching out an NPC for a quest that yields no significant reward, hence why our epic bashing is important to this thread.   If you're interested in knowing, you're one of the few, might as well start looking in game for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well I'm happy with this change, camping Sev was a pain, considering the reward...<br />
<br />
But I think if they really want to help us with the epic they just have to change the ratios /effect on the useless ones.<br />
<br />
Upgrade the delay on melee epics and make the procs irresistable (for ALL melées)<br />
<br />
Make the clicky dots unresistable too.<br />
Make the chanty one cast a group haste.<br />
Make the mage one cast a spell with a level scaled to the caster's level.<br />
<br />
If the epics were 14/20 instead of 14/24, it would be great, and it would have justified sev camping. but right now you can :<br />
- Kill Xanamech (easier than going to spiroc island iimo)<br />
- Camp the CHoS &amp; SotB (yeay more hp better dps)<br />
- Get a GSoT (very good aggro for 500pp)<br />
<br />
So the epic is cool, but it will be just like the paladin one : most of us will do it just for the pleasure to have the lightsabers on while afk.</div></div><hr />

There was enough asking tonight in serverwide, also a number of people on here asking about it. Also, prices fluctuate from server to server on everything. What is cheap on CT, might be expensive elsewhere. CHoS, SotBS, BoC, Red Epic, Xenamech Hammer, Great Blade of Storms, SoD.. all debatable about what one would prefer for agro.<br />
<br />
Just because you're jaded because you either couldn't complete your epic or you're jaded that it's not what you want it to be, does not mean that everyone else would be as disillusioned as yourself. P.S. - I duo'd the Droga camp, boring! Achievement for epics / shawls / rings feels better and is pretty much the whole point of EQ. To accomplish things and feel good about doing it, for yourself. If you want to go buy something from bazaar and think you're a big man, feel free.<br />

I wasn't asking your advice as to whether we should do the epic or not. Thank you for your kind offer for mentorship, it's not needed. I have 3 red scales burning my pockets and I'd rather do the quest for a friend and/or any other guild tanks that the epic would be an upgrade for. When someone finishes their epic, it's a bigger WAHOO than buying something from bazaar, farming Droga, or receiving hand-me-downs. I guess you just don't get it, pity.<br />
<br />
And have been looking in game, as my post prior has listed, as well as have others. Now please, move along. I could care less about your opinions about whether it's worth it or not. You haven't said anything I haven't known.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, the only people disillusioned around here are people who still think that the epic is worth doing.  Anyone who looks at the weapons logically knows better.  Doing quests /= satisfying due to the way EQ is set up.  Go here, kill that, turn it in there, who gives a fuck, it's not a quest, it's a retarded mail mission.  Jaded isn't the word for realizing that something is a fucking waste of time.<br />
<br />
Now, here's where you should pay attention.  WARRIORS HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING THINGS IN THE WORLD.  Wanna find him?  Check the druids grove.  Some druid was walking around with track open last nite and saw him, I guarantee.  He may not have known or cared who he was, but he saw him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zethallon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Searched last night for you but the only Cogswin guy I found was a separate NPC in PoK named Nayr (sp?).  I'll keep an eye out and post the zone/loc for when found.</div></div><hr />

Grats being the first person to ever describe people who want to do something as &quot;disillusioned&quot;. But wait, your BP is from a quest! More than half your gear is from turnins or tradeskills, gee how did those happen when EQ quests are a waste of time! The only thing that's a waste of time are your posts/opinions, jaded boy.<br />

<br />
Hrm.. I already alluded to the fact that I have multiple characters with epics, I guess I only use a warrior to scout/track NPC's. OH NO'S, no warrior here would EVER think of using alts to find an NPC.<br />
<br />
Please, you are only making yourself look more the fool. My opinion/advice to you is just to move on, take it to rants, or wherever. Obviously, we will all have differing perspectives on the matter, but you're just sticking your foot in your mouth now and I'd hate to keep slapping you down.<br />

I never said quests weren't worth doing, I said they weren't satisfying, and they're not.  Run around, do some glorified message boy service, bring it back get an item.  Whoop de do.  That's pretty much the same as go sit in a dungeon, wait for a mob to spawn and kill him, and get an item.  This quest is a piece of shit. It results in a reward that is inferior to loot you can obtain in a fraction of a time in another zone.  If you want to waste your time with it, by all means, go ahead.<br />
<br />
And if you'd like to make this board a better source of information than fuckin everlore and allakazams, then by all means, stop bitching about what other people have to say and step up to the plate.  Find the fucker and post it or stop whining about why no one else spoon fed you the information.  Practice what you preach right?</div></div><hr />

Thank you for determining that for everyone who wants to complete epics. Like I said, this thread was about converting red scales to green scales, not your opinion on whether the epic is worth it. Hell, the epic just got a whole lot easier too. Like I said, if you don't enjoy quests, I guess I feel sorry for ya. Pretty laughable about your gear though, especially since you do tradeskills, you can get Ornate in a fraction of the time, yet the majority of your armor is self-made cultural. &quot;Warriors can't track very well&quot;. Please keep up the idiocies.<br />
<br />
Did I come piss on you while you were making inferior armor saying it was a waste of time? No. So go jump off a bridge or something, you jaded angsty twit.<br />

We're the ones discussing where to complete the quest. Try as you might to turn this into some rant where you're trying to feel vindicated about not doing the epic, that's YOUR OPINION. I can see why you're unguilded, no on can put up with your arrogant, stubborn, stupid aass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting back to the QUEST FORUM, let's talk about Cogwin's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thank you for determining that for everyone who wants to complete epics. Like I said, this thread was about converting red scales to green scales, not your opinion on whether the epic is worth it <br />
<br />
Actually, this thread started off being a discussion of our opinions about this epic, and it wasn't until you decided to post here and inform us what you thought the thread was about that it changed.  Here's a clue for ya, this section is about quests.  That is not limited to spoilers for people, you can also use this section to discuss the validity of certain quests, which is exactly what we were doing before you decided that wasn't what we were doing. <br />
<br />
We're the ones discussing where to complete the quest <br />
<br />
Uhh, you're the only one trying to have that discussion here.  The voices in your head acting up again?<br />
<br />
Oh, and the cheap shots on my gear and my social status in this game are cute, especially since you provide neither in your posts.  You also seem to  be spending an inordinate amount of time trying to convince everyone that I'm pissing on your personal crusade to put an epic in every warrior's hands.  I don't give a flying crap what you do to be honest, but don't walk into a thread which up until you posted in it has nothing to do with the actual solving of the quest and tell me what the thread is about.  I know what the thread is about.  It's about the usual standard of SoE business -- too little, too late.  Well, at least until you convinced yourself that you were holding a discussion here with some ficticious people.  <br />
<br />
So, to recap...you're bitching because this board offers no information, and then continually post demanding people ONLY offer you information in this thread, while offering none yourself.  Interesting behavior indeed.  If you're looking for an area where people only say things that you want to hear, I don't think the internet is the place for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">DragonHerald != Moderator.  So why are you trying people where to post their opinions?  This is the quest forum, the epic is a quest.  Haass hates it.  Haass hates pretty much everything, but he's entitled to his opinion.  <br />
<br />
That said, this thread is really lame and I hope we can just let it drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>DragonHerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm not saying his opinion is valid or not, or trying to suppress it. The reason raid level and others scoff at Allakhazams, Everlore, etc as information sources is that commonly people will post their opinions, rants, flames, etc with very little meat/substance to the actual quest info (and subsequently find useful information on serverwide chats and other guild forums). So far, Haass has not supplied any information on this quest and is using it as a means to vent his frustration, albeit I can understand the frustration.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong but the description of this particular forum is:<br />

If it was meant to be a place for someone to continually rant about how the epic is worthless, maybe I misjudged the reason why this forum exists.  And it will be just another site/forum that serves very little purpose except to add useless trash.</div></div><hr />

You have no position to tell people who are commenting that this is 3 years too late to STFU.  It is too late to make much of a difference.  Agro weapons better than epic are plentiful, DPS weapons better than epic are even more plentiful, the Droga combo is in fact better, and you can very easily (as well as freely) get them if you can get people together for the other fights in the epic.

Agro weapons better than epic are plentiful, DPS weapons better than epic are even more plentiful, the Droga combo is in fact better, and you can very easily (as well as freely) get them if you can get people together for the other fights in the epic. My beastlord can even tank the mobs...hell a shaman and a warrior can duo the bloodsworn guy.-<br />

Kaesorn, when I made that post, it was the only thread that existed on these forums for red -&gt; green conversion, now there's a billion threads. Thankfully, there's people in other threads talking about the quest instead of aass' whiney &quot;our epic sucks&quot; crap.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I didn't say people can't comment on it, I love that there's forums here that are specifically set up for rants/whines/etc. I asked if people could please keep the thread free from a rant so useful information could be discussed about the quest. Whether the quest sucks to some people, there are others who will want to do it for a variety of reasons : looks, the good feeling of &quot;completing an epic&quot;, they love quests, they secretly wanted to be a Jedi, and a thousand other reasons that you can come up with.<br />
<br />

The difference is that i'm not telling you that I don't care and to get out of the thread that we're bitching about it in.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />

<br />
Incorrect. I said please keep the thread to quest information, you can post here as much as you want, regardless of my simple request of you know.. maybe sticking to the forum's main purpose. You, however, have told me to hit the door, hypocrite.<br />

You don't run the show around here, and no one gives a flying fuck what you think. <br />

Checked a mirror lately? God forbid anyone wanting to do their epic without your approval first.</div></div><hr />

Get a life dude, if you dont care about the warrior epic, dont go searching for warrior epic threads to flame in.  You are truely on my shit list.  I registered just to let everyone know that this game is for fun.  One of the greatest things in the game is aquiring the rare and inspiring epic.   I don't play this game to chase that carrot; i allready have the best weapons i will ever have forever probally, why would i want to grind out 1000's of hours just to get a few extra hp's or dmg output?  I would rather walk around with my friends in glory holding my light sabers having fun.  No weapon beats the lightsabers for graphics and drinking beer with.</div></div><hr />

Don't like what he says? Don't reply. Shit gets old.<br />

But I'll tell you Haass has and prob will be one of the most vocal and truthful people to come here to TSW. He ain't blowing no smoke at you with his responses.<br />

Knock. It. Off. If you wanna toss out &quot;personal notes,&quot; use PMs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm an asshole. I always will be.  I don't give a fuck what you think of me, so being on your &quot;Shit list&quot; means about as much to me as a warm can of Fresca.<br />
<br />
Personally I think some of you people take this message board shit too seriously.  I have an opinion.  Generally that opinion pisses off people.  I don't lose any sleep over it, nor will I in the future.  However, should you try to tell me where to put my opinion, you're gonna get a big ol' can of &quot;Up yours&quot; unless your name is listed in red.  The mods didn't have any problem with this thread being a joke fest about what a useless change this was, and they don't now.  They have a problem with the little pissing contest that the self proclaimed DragonHerald caused by trying to exert some authority over me.  If you registered AFTER a mod warning to shut the fuck up, just to post to tell me that i'm on your &quot;shit list,&quot; then you have bigger issues than me.  I don't mind discussing things with people, but when they fail to make a point and can only sling shit at me in lieu of an actual argument, then I'm not gonna take kindly to it, and I'm not gonna stand idly by while people insult me or tell me where I'm allowed to post my opinions.<br />
<br />
Now, Isk, I already know what you're gonna say, and ya, I'm sorry, but wtf dude....these people are just asking for it, and I tried to be as civil as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Are the epics useless now? Yes and no.<br />
<br />
As compared to other weapons that are avail for the time and risk, yes.<br />
<br />
But, for the people that think doing the epic quest is an important feat in the aspect of game play, it is worth it.<br />
<br />
I have my epic, I also have a host of other weapons that I use. Most of them are from VP. I like the feeling I get when someone sends me a tell asking where I got the glowing swords. It is an accomplishment that each expansion gets easier and easier to do. I remember the first Sev raid I went to. 5 groups, noe Sev is doable by 1 group. <br />
<br />
If someone wants to complete the quest for the lightsabers - &quot;good on 'em,&quot; if they don't, its ok too, they just wanted to spend their time in doing something else.<br />
<br />
Personally I have had no real probem holding agro using the Red epic and a SotBS. Are there better weapons out there? As I said earlier, sure. I wouldn't let anyone tell you what you should go after or do in the game. On the flip side - don't tell anyone what they should or should not do. This is afterall a game.<br />
<br />
Haass, I do read your posts and you do come across as arrogant, but you do give sound advice and I will continue to read and learn from that advice.<br />
<br />
Remember, doing the epics nowadays is for the feeling of accomplishment and not to get a great weapon. If you want a great weapon, level up and hit the tier 3 and above planes.</div></div><hr />
