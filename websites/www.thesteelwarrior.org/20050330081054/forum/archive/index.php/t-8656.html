<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always liked Overthere, and at least on my server, there are still groups fighting there.<br />
OT is not the fastest experience per kill, but there are lots and lots of mobs, and conditions favor a warrior pulling if the warrior has a good bow. I always thought that a puller who can run the mobs at the optimal rate for the group simultaneously maximizes exp and minimizes the risk of group wipe/stand around waiting for rezes. Reducing deaths/group wipes in pick-up groups generally gives you better exp in a normal zone than repeated dying will get you in a high-zem zone. Of course, if you get in a zone with a good exp modifier and you have a good puller, you're set.<br />
However, you should check out LDoN adventures and also read the patch messages to find out where the &quot;hot&quot; zones are--they've got an experience modifier boost.<br />
don't forget to hotkey /shield, heh.<br />
And, if you go to OT, make sure everyone knows what a 'goon is, so when you see one coming and say &quot;Run!&quot; half the people in your group don't stand there saying, &quot;Why? There's just one of them.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You could also check out the Gulf of Gunthak and Frontier Mountains. In Gunthak, you can just hunt on the shore, should be able to get/start a group. Great xp there for sure. In FM, fight at the giant keep. They drop decent money, great sellable items (Leg-Chopper = 50p, Giant Vest = 60pp), but not a very popular zone... Finally, you could also head over to Dawnshroud Peaks, should be able to pick up a group fairly easy there, gl  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
For grouping, go to DSP. Else, try do a who all on other players your level to see where they hang out.</div></div><hr />
