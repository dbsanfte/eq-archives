<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>beeafraid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have used SARS4 as my UI for a while now and I like it.  However, it has not been updated with recent patches and from the website it appears that the creator isn't playing any more and has no interest in updating it again.<br />
<br />
For the most part, it hasn't affected me much, but the leadership aa experience bar only shows me the blue xp bar.  It does not show me the yellow.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, it looks like I need to start looking for a replacement, but I'm having problems finding good warrior UIs.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Ah.  I saw the post about an update coming soon on the forums but didn't see where people were posting their own patches elsewhere in the forum.<br />
<br />
I got the patches I needed (specifically, fix to make health of target's target indicator show the actual health, fix to make augment combines work, and fix to make leadership aa meter work correctly).<br />
<br />
Glad to be able to keep using this UI.  IMO, it is so much better suited to melee classes than others.  Thanks for the tip!  :)</div></div><hr />
