<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mynz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">65 warrior here trying to decide on best agro combo for 1hs that I have available to me.  I own the follwing 1 handers.   I used to use the CHOS and SotBS and had a little difficulty with agro.  Now I use the first two weapons and it seems better.  I use the Obsidian in primary hand.  I realize neither has a good proc, but the damage and delay seem to hold the taunt better than the other weapons.  Should I throw on an anger 3 aug to them .. especially now that they can be safely removed?  should the whip be in primary since it has 16 damage?  or go with the faster weapon?  Or am I barking  up a wrong tree.....  I continue to raid water tower for that sword... how do you think It stacks up vs. these?   I dont have the cash to dump into a BoC ... but I did just gain elemental access ... are there other easily gettable 1 handers in the elemental planes or sol ro ?  Thanks<br />

Not really.  There's the pet sword in Doomfire, but it's not an aggro weapon.  Jiva has a nice 1 hander too, but again, it's not an aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
If you search these forums, you should find a thread about OSOW aggro.  I believe the conclusion was that the OSOW proc produces less aggro than the GBOS proc, but the OSOW procs more frequently, so you get the same amount of proc hate per minute.</div></div><hr />

Per other treads on this board and others, it looks like they announced that the July 8 patch they will implement it.  The details are not yet known, it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Elemental Access will enable you to gain some fairly nice weapons (water 2hs, the one from Earth 2hs, and GoD has a great little wailing staff that's fairly common.)<br />
<br />
In terms of 1handers there are not that many options that are worth while.  If you are going duel weild and are looking at aggro, I'd go with the Obsidian Scimitar and the Whip and anger 2 or Yak em for cheap.<br />
<br />
The CHoS is dang good and has great aggro, but the last thing ya wanna do is roll into an elemental group slingin one just don't inspire the greatest of confidence even though it's a super weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Yeah, but that whip is going to be less aggro. I think most groups in the EPs would rather be beat upon less than worry about the tank's looks. I personally recommended a warrior recruit that was DWing droga weapons to my EP guild BECAUSE of the fact that he knew what weapons generated aggro. It's recruits that don't have aggro weapons that are likely to get turned down, regardless of looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use a Flameforge Hammer in my off hand--see my magelo or the address below for stats.  it is a very overlooked weapon and usually you don't see many warriors using one but  I use it with a GBoS in main hand and I have zero agro problems (keep in mind both weapons are augmented).   The hammer drops in Sol Ro Tower.  It has the same stun proc as SotB but has better stats and a pretty decent off hand ratio and DPS.  It isn't that hard to get either.<br />

With WA2 atm, both weapons proc like crazy and I mean they proc both procs on each weapon like crazy.<br />
<br />
I only loose agro to a crazy nuker and rarely to a enc/shaman that slows to soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have the OSoW in main and BoC in off both with Anger III augument and have an incredible 9.75 procs per minute of hate.<br />
<br />
The OSoW has a proc rate of 2.25 ppm a bit more then the normal 2ppm, an often overlooked point.<br />
<br />
Just save up the Plat for the BoC (or get a similar 1H for yur offhand) and you will rack up the hate with some Anger III auguments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 are you trying to practice your begging skill ! i thought its use for aggro had been abandonned far ago :P<br />
baaa, just joking.<br />
<br />
Neverthelees, I am surprised you fell better with the whip and the scimetar, because they are less aggro generator (on a long sample) than the droga combo. If you really want aggro augment the drogga combo (you didn't say they were, so I suppose they aren't), because the only adventage the the whip/scimetar combo you should get is Stat and DPS (but very few on this one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since you have access to EP's now, I assume that means you're able to kill RZ and most elemental mobs.  And since your in EP's now, just hold out for a 2hander.  If you're not the MT, which, by your post it doesn't sound like you are then I really wouldn't worry about aggro weapons for the time being. Your scimitar and whip are fine, screw the getto droga weapons. Your absolute best bets are to get a SEWS, BoW, or even the 2hs that drops in sol ro.  I can't see the sol ro one being too likely because no one really likes to do sol ro mobs.  When you are ready to MT, you'll be set with a 2hander.  Until then you'll make a perfect ST/TT.  I can't speak from experience on the SEWS, but with a BoW I can lock aggro for tanking OR position myself number 2 on the hate list for when I'm not MT'ing.... something I've found very hard to do with 1handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Once you get Ele access you can try and pick up a Stone Etched War Sword. Also there is a nice 20/27 1hb with planar strike on it from a one groupable mob in SolRo. I think it's called a Flameforge hammer.</div></div><hr />
