<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At New York Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher, was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule and a calculator. <br />
<br />
Attorney General John Ashcroft believes the man is a member of the notorious al-gebra movement. He is being charged with carrying weapons of math instruction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Al-gebra is a very fearsome cult, indeed&quot;, Ashcroft said. &quot;They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on a tangent in a search of absolute value. They consist of quite shadowy figures, with names like &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, and, although they are frequently referred to as &quot;unknowns&quot;, we know they really belong to a common denominator and are part of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. <br />
<br />
As the great Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, &quot;There are 3 sides to every triangle.&quot; <br />
<br />
When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, &quot;If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes.</div></div><hr />
