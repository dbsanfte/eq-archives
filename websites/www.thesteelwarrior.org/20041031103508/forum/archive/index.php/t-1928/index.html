As i near 40+ I realize my crafted armor is becoming very poor :( <br />
<br />
I have talked with a few high level warriors on my server and they have suggested I MQ for Thurg armor. Now i would LOVE to get a set of this stuff but i have pretty much no cash flow i have little under 6k in the bank but could get it near 7k if i can sell an extra lammy i have on me(a big if)<br />
<br />
I just returned to EQ and dont know my guild well, i just joined it because i thought it would be a good way to get groups(ya... right heh) Ive looked around and i like the looks of indicolite its old, and its from hate im not sure how difficult it would be for a 45ish troll warrior to obtain, the guild seems to have quiet a few 40-55 members but im not sure how well asking them to raid hate for a few weeks would go over. Im sorta have a hardon for matching sets and I was gonna go for cobalt but i realize i wont own a cobalt BP or greaves in the near future. I have all expansion sets except LoY. If any of my fellow brothers in arms could suggest a way of making good plat or if any nameless buddies are around that would want to take a vassal under his wing to teach and maybe guild him id appretiate it. I dont see my crafted holding me past 44 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry man, In all honesty, Unless you are super rich, or a twink, there's not much out there better than Crafted/Crusty until mid-high 40's.  The only othe option would be trying to get some Soldier's armor from the TS quests, but those quests tend to take a LONG time.<br />
<br />
Second of all, if you can get a Cobalt Helm, Gaunts definatly go for it, the loss of Stats is definatly worth the AC gain at your level, or if you can get a MQ Thurg anything is also a big gain.  The only other thing I can think of that's fairly cheap that would be an upgrade would be Barbed Ringmail, both BP and legs, and a Tattered Mantle.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I can't think of anything else right now, I'll post more later if I come up with some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>HaZZy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm still wearing crusty at lvl 46... works great :)<br />
<br />
This is what I would do:<br />
Sell FBSS, get SCHW, get Spider Fur Belt, sell Cobalt Gauntlets<br />
<br />
Lots of stat gains, plus 1% extra haste :)<br />
<br />
You also might want to consider getting Glimmering Mithril Torque for neck slot. Nice AC gain.<br />
<br />
Edit: For the BP and some other slots you might wanna try the Acrylia armor. It has decent AC plus some stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thoggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The post was meant for when i got to 45+ I know my crafted will hold up untill then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Morgred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My question is the guild you are in hunting in Kael or PoG (depending on race and diety for Bezerker armor).  You will be able to begin attending these raids at or around 45.<br />
<br />
Also watch for pick up raids in Kael or PoG.<br />
<br />
Another option is start saving your CP for cultural armors.  Or find a guildie that is working on skill ups and gather the stuff for them to do combines.<br />
<br />
Another option is begin hunting in Umbral Plains for Moktor/Raldukan Armors or listen for those armors rotting while in zone.  At 62 I am still using my Moktor Boots and Greaves because of the Sta they have.<br />
