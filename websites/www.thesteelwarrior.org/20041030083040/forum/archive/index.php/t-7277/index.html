If you could make some suggestions on new gera what is crap and has to go that would be great thanks all and look forward to reading your posts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most importantly - level up. Once you get 55+ you can start trying to get your hands on some ornate. I would also start looking for some nondeity barb cultural. I think there are a couple types you can wear. Get another valorium ring and start looking for either CT earrings or a pair of bloodmetal. Try to get a sword of the bloodsworn to go with your CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ur face, neck are ok. <br />
pick up another valorium ring. ditch the 2 earrings for some hp ones. lupine frenzy earring is good, maybe a solstice earring for other.<br />
<br />
head also needs hps, get a radulkan helm. for bracers, if u have a few friends, do the bracer of benevolence quest, will give u decent bracers till u can get some ornate or ldons.<br />
<br />
haste has to go. thats takign up a nice slot - u can get the 90 hp SS gaunts in there, see if u can buy a chain of em. for haste get a belt slot item if u can, theres qutie a few combos out there will give u better than  the glove haste.<br />
<br />
again, if ur faction is good, do draconic pauldrons quest. takes half hour in an out with less than a group and mobs are always up. cant laugt at 12 sta shoulders.<br />
<br />
primary 1hs has to go. get a copper hammer. or hold out ad get a GSoT. best 50 pp ull ever spend. steelbladeded ldon boots are good upgrade not too expensive.</div></div><hr />
