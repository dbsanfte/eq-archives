<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashem</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the dumbing down of Everquest continuing, and making it always easier to level without the time put into their characters, it constantly amazes, and eternally annoys me that I'm often grouped with lvl 60+ people that wouldn't know how to get to a zone or dungeon in the game without a porter. These are the same people that are clueless about most aspects of other people's classes, and to a large degree their own. I could talk about the mage that I saw pull 4 wurms in skyfire and died, then asked me (after I ressed with my bot cleric) how he'd been trying to &quot;quad&quot; for 3 days now but couldn't get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
To this end I've been swinging my guild around to the less used zones where you actually have to expend some effort to get into them.<br />
<br />
Currently we did the quest to get everyone into Tactics where we pretty much have the run of the zone unless one of the god mobs is up. It's fun, we get some nice drops, and the best part is that THERE ARE NO FREAKING NOOBS!!!<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about offending them, they don't know how to open a browser.  :D <br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that the same situation exists in Torment and can key my guild for Torment with some effort on our part. But after kind of browsing 'khazam's mob and loot list for the zone, I don't think it will offer the same reward for time put in.<br />
<br />
However, I've held the following belief for ALL mobs and zones in this game:<br />
<br />
1. Good Loot<br />
2. Good XPS<br />
3. Easy Kill<br />
<br />
<br />
now pick 2 of those. They apply to most mobs in game. I'm willing to bet that the xps to be gained in Torment outstrip what is found in Tactics or BoT. (I stay out of BoT because of the huge amounts of ppl camping anything that moves and the xps crawl unless you're in an upper camp.<br />
<br />
So....is it worth my time and effort to get my guild keyed for Torment?<br />
<br />
We're about 2 groups of 65's that REALLY play, with another 2 groups of support that are more or less on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That zone is totally empty except when some guild is keying up for or killing Saryrn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incidently, you don't need to key up for Torment just to exp. It was opened up with BoT was. All you need is level 62 to zone in.<br />
Maybe even 55, but 62 for sure you can zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sshaithis</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 55 is the requirement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to torment to kill saryrn, or work on the key to her tower.  Otherwise, avoid the zone at all costs!  The models are cool, but the exp for the difficutly of the mobs sucks ass.  Last time I was there helping to farm parts for the Saryrn Key, I got a headache from the sheer stupidness of the entire place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Torment is aptly named. <br />
<br />
xp sucks, loot sucks, mobs suck. only reason to even step in there is for saryrn key or to kill the bitch. other than that, stay away. Just stay in tactics. loot and xp is great and it's fun because it's pretty spread out and lots of places to xp.<br />
<br />
you were warned!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I liked Torment, sure the loot and xp sucks... but somehow the music and the ambient... those spider traps and the mobs models... those Avatars that have like 6 lil faces... I really liked that, and the feeling of progression while we were heading up the ramps... *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've enjoyed my few times in torment but the rewards other than fun are very poor, yeah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its sad because Torment is a hell of a cool lookin zone too.<br />
<br />
As for the chain &quot;n00bs&quot; comments: group with your friends....tune out the rest.  It makes it hard doin LDoN because the mean competency level is so darn LOW in EQ these days (i.e. the 65 ench I had in MM that died to a single mummy add).  /shrug what can you do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are exactly 4 reasons to go to Torment.<br />
<br />
1. Killing Saryrn as part to get elementals flagged<br />
2. Getting key parts to open Saryrn tower<br />
3. Farming baking components (Tormentor's Stir Fry)<br />
4. Farming Gate neck pieces</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tormentor Stir Fry and flags are the only reason you would see this troll there.<br />
