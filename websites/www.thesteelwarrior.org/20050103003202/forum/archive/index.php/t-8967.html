<br />
Parse is very short, the duration of the disc and i was too tired to parse it more than once.<br />
<br />
Was using dbotw mainhand rathe 1h offhand both anger 3 auged.<br />
<br />
1 mob dps given 12 nonmelee 11.55 kick 294.25 slash 64.9% hit rate.  Mob was a discordling taskfiend which did 133.48 dps and had a hit rate of 42.3% with oow avoid 3 mitigation 2.<br />
<br />
I realize its not all that reliable but it gives you an idea of what the disc does.<br />
<br />
FYI:  The disc shows up in timer 2 with furious and fortitude but you can use it independent of these discs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though still a waste of endurance, higher upkeep than Fellstrike too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the lucy description it looked like it would raise critical chance by 100% (so double it) and then make them all crippling blows instead of just crits, unless I'm reading it wrong.<br />
<br />
I had same results as Aspit tho, I used it twice then took it outta my hotkey bank and combat abilities screen so I never even accidentally click it again, its a total waste of endurance in its current form imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't it actually stun the mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tachyr</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It can stun the Mob , however it can't stun above a specific level (can't remember which) or if the mob is flagged unstunnable</div></div><hr />
