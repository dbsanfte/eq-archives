looking for a very good parser where i can also monitor my guilds DPS with listed in person with mlee and spell? i cant find one or cannot really setup yaulp, with yaulp i get anyhow &quot;lag&quot; on how it calcs down the dps, it works for maybe 1 min solid then it starts to lag out.<br />
<br />
<br />
any ideas ?</div></div><hr />

it's an online  parser, you just paste in your log, and it will parse all things including spell damage.  give it a try :)</div></div><hr />

I have the same problem with Yalp 2.4.  Version 2.3 beta worked fine but 2.4 added more detailed proc info and any non melee damage out of the group doesn't seem to be picked up consistently.  Yalp use to be as accurate as EQC but since verson 2.4, I've been using EQC a little more even though I hate the amount of memory it hogs.  I tried the eqdamage one but it takes too long to load a 10 meg file, plus it still needs some tweaking.  It's showing 55 dps on a mob the other parsers are showing 300.</div></div><hr />

The amount of DPS increase since I started using it and reporting who did the most and who was afk the most was staggering. I dont report DPS done, as it is kinda messed with all the different start times and such, but instead report total dmg done. It works really good in seeing who is afk by nukes done, heals done, and special skills (backstab, flying kick ect).</div></div><hr />

I did the same thing in my previous guild.  I'd periodically post parses of clearings to show who is ninja afking (hello wizards) and who is paying attention.  After a few times of showing the logs on the forums or stating them in guild chat, guild dps increased as a whole and total damage output went up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aimras</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok,<br />
i have tryied eqcompanion and yalp so far, they bit far off in dps output on the same fight length but i cannot seem to be able to see any proc dps of other's and any caster dps at all? i'm to dumb to set it up or soemthing? <br />
<br />
i found myself proccing included at eqcompanion without a problem, but all i can see is the meele dps...<br />
<br />
ya about the afk's i found it out very handy on meele's and after giving out their dmg done and dps they had it went up totaly, lol.<br />
<br />
my highest dps was 142 on DXVT, lol. monk had 180, something compared to rogues at 90 because of not beeing able to BS.<br />
<br />
haven't tryied eqdamage yet, gotta do it later.<br />
<br />
<br />
any clue what i do wrong to not see caster dps ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aimras</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in eq, yes. but is there a seperate option in the parsers i might have missed out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can download yaulp 2 at my server website<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use EQC to parse guild total damage done on boss mobs and it works fairly well.  Just create a new chat box and make it really small.  Divert all non-melee damage and others hits to this box so it can be captured in your logs but wont spam you out in your main chat boxes.<br />
<br />
Doing this a melee can get a very good idea of total damages of other melees and of nuke casters.  You won't be able to parse the dps from dots or from pet procs though but it is better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You only pick up other hits and non melee hits when you are closer to the mob's hitbox, not to the person doing the damage.  The best parser would be the MT.  On mobs that AE rampage or where you stay far back for prox aggro, you cannot accurately parse others even if they are standing next to you.  You can parse rangers and casters even if they are 200-300 range away from you as long as you are right at the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">macarser</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an interesting thread and I'm glad it came up.  I am toying with the idea of writing my own parser for EQ.  Do you that use them find that the current ones out there suit your needs enough to make it work, or are there still things you would like changed but no one is addressing?<br />
<br />
Just trying to get some input before I even start it, to see if it's a worthwhile project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was happy with Yalp v2.3 beta - it was fast, it kept the info simple, and it was fairly accurate (99% accuracy when I compared parses with EQC v0.794).  I can't seem to parse non-melee accurately with v2.4 and I can't find any copies of v2.3beta zip files :\<br />
<br />
EQC is nice but it's such a memory hog on my computer so I use it sparingly or when I'm not playing EQ.  I don't use the majority of the EQC features since all I really want is the parse info.<br />
<br />
I'll probably stick with Yalp once it 2.4 can accurately parse my non-melee hits, but if you can make another parser I'll give it a shot.  I've tried a few others and they never seem to work out - Jalp, eqwatcher, eqloganalyzer, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aguktawarrior</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah if you stand right under a mob's hit box you can get very accurate numbers. Being a tank that is where I am the majority of the time unless I die. Then I get to complain that the clerics suck, which is a high point in my day.</div></div><hr />

haha!  Isn't it though!</div></div><hr />

It probably has Copy HTML to clipboard currently and this is causing it to lock up/time out/crash.  I had this problem on larger log files and it hasn't happened since.  When I want to create an HTML report, I just right click, view source and copy.</div></div><hr />
