I have 2 bracers, 1 legs, and 1 boots already. Its human made and trivials at 250. I am willing to track down the items if needed but I would like to get some cost info. I am looking to max my AC at every level and Fine Heraldic is all I might be able to afford.</div></div><hr />

but it is doable at least.</div></div><hr />

Go to the message boards, select marketplace, smithing &amp; your server, and then post what you want. Or, since I believe that there are in various places on those boards some lists of grandmaster smiths by server, you can note who is on your server and then search for them in game.<br />
<br />
Pumilio's point about the trivial is something to keep in mind. A smith whose skill is maxxed will fail perhaps 60 percent of the time on these combines. We're talking a random number generator here, so a string of 6 or 7 failures, while not highest probability outcome, could very easily happen. It's a good sign that you are willing to gather the subcomponents that you can--it will help you find a smith, for sure. But, be prepared for a significant failure rate even if the smith has maxxed skill.</div></div><hr />

 I will check that sight. I had no idea you could fail that often but I will look into it futher, and as my plat supply permits I will try to gather the componets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's unlikely that you'd get that many failures in a row.<br />
But a coin has about as much chance coming up heads as tails and if you actually flip a coin 100 times you'd be surprised how many sequences of 5+ heads (or tails) you get. In fact, if you are presented with two lists of coin flips, and one is a record of 100 actual coin flips and the other is made up by a person trying to replicate randomness, the list with the longest series of same-side results is likely the &quot;real&quot; coin flip list. Few people trying to replicate a two-result random list will insert a series of 7 or more straight &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails.&quot; But if you flip a coin 100 times, it's likely to happen.<br />
Anyway, my main point is that you can expect some failures (maybe not that many, but some), so be prepared for them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also, if you go the finding a smithy route (ayonae ro seek me out)<br />
make damn sure you get all the sub combines done and I mean them all except the human forge only ones.  <br />
<br />
a check list is royal temper, and the other temper (can't remember off hand without notes) velium rings, velium temper, LEATHER PADDING.  and then of course the high quality ore.  there's a vendor in pok, bazaar, and in qeynos that are all easy to get to there are ones in other places but generally if bazaar and pok are sold out (often) I find it in qeynos.</div></div><hr />
