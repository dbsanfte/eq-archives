<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering how I'm going to get the next 800 hp's by level 65 to not be the peverbial paper tank.<br />
<br />
Last week I finally replaced my Moktor BP with a Thurg one and gained about 50 hp's, but I'm at a loss on what to do next.  I don't play nearly as much as I used to, so ultra rare drops in flagged/keyed zones are out of the question at this time. I am flagged for PoS/PoV though.<br />
<br />
Will the levelling itself provide a decent amount of hp's? I recall reading that the jumps aren't that high. Maybe AA's? I do plan to put my next 3 points in STA.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, money is an object since I've spent the last couple of months either raiding or in PoP. I've nested around 100pp now, but I can probably get a couple of K if there was an item that would help me out in that price range. All my upgrades have been to no-drop stuff so no money there. Shissar Fang is the next thing on my list since it free, and drops pretty regularly from what I was told.<br />
<br />
My guild has done Vindi and recently we did Velk. That's about as tough as we get with raid type content. We would like to try out the names in ToV soon though.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slashurr</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in your boat also, trying to reach 4k hp unbuffed by 61.  I'm getting damn close!  My advice is as follows:<br />
<br />
Nature durability 3<br />
Cloak of maelstrom<br />
bracer of benovolence<br />
earring of solsctice<br />
Ranged item with more hit points<br />
clattering bone neck<br />
Get myrmidons gaunts, sell SCHW and buy a RBG</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some good advice. I would also try to get some Fine Heraldic in every visible slot other than gloves. Buying it outright would be expensive, but you can usually make a deal with the smith to do combines in exchange for extra ingredients. Usually if you bring enough to do a 2nd one they will do the first for free. With some farming you can get most of a set of armor for nothing more that your time spent. Champ BP + myrmidon gaunts + fine heraldic will get you 4k pretty easy. With ND3 and PE you should be comfortably in around 4400hp.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't waste any AA on STA. You can buff STA and your gear will have a lot more STA on it as you upgrade. Those AA would be better spent on something that doesn't become useless when you can hit the STA cap with gear+buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">basically what they said.<br />
<br />
Since you raid kael, look at getting Cloak of Maelstrom, i dont remember who it drops from, one of the guys in Tormax wing i think (easy kill for a raid force, i did it trioing with a pally and shammy at lvl 56), this will add 35raw HP, and 6stam.<br />
<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace, you loose a lil ac but gain 6stam, 30raw<br />
<br />
Draconic Pauldrons Quest, or Strength of the Elements Quest, accept no other.<br />
<br />
Your not in HoT yet, so i wont suggest Myrm, but i will suggest Silver Steel Gauntlets, warrior only 80hp gloves that drop off one of the named frost giants in the arena, name starts with a V. ... not Vindi, some other dude in the actual PvP arena thingy, in the stands.<br />
<br />
Bracers of Benevolence, accept no other.<br />
<br />
Gaunts haste is bad.  Get something for your belt, or your back.  If your doint Velk/Vindi stuff, you can prolly gank a few kunark dragons, get yourself a RBB or a CoF.<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice, get rid of that gobby earring, its not doing you any good as a permanent equiptment item.  Keep it though, youll need the instaclick later.<br />
<br />
And thats about all i can suggest as easy upgrades atm.  though, most important, get rid of those SCHW, get some HP gaunts, and belt or back haste.  thats your biggest prob<br />
<br />
Dont focus on pure AC if it doesnt have any HP on it.  If you can hit 1200 buffed, for the stuff your fighting atm, your more than adaquate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cleave</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best advice I can give is watch the bazaar and watch it often.  Get so you can notice the real deals.  Frequently there will be a warrior/melee in a high level guild that will replace a nice piece of equipment with an amazing piece, and want to liquidate it for cash asap.  There's where you'll find your deals.  Get your friends to watch for pieces of armor too.  <br />
<br />
In regards to equipment advice, I like Roughbeard's appraisal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">halas 10lbs meat pie and grob liquidized meat. cheepest hp you will ever find. other then getting drops.<br />
<br />
other hp on a budget<br />
<br />
if you got curved claws as a drop, ribbon chocker should be np from terror matriarch also snag a iron scream ear, or clockwork talisman quest, draconic pauldrens maby 15 min in ww, bracer of benevolence (waiting on the scout takes a while),Umbral plains the dalkner chnce of bracelet of fortiudde if not can trade one of the other bracelets that drop for one. he bandit ring goes for a feww pp on my server might be able to sell and buy ss gaunts mq and vellium fire. then sell schw for belt haste with a few pp left over. cloak of the malestorm sell shehorse more pp, if you do the clockwork talisman quest you should be close to haveing all the pieces for mightmarewood combound bow. find a nice fletcher to make it for ya. might have also picke up a few peices of the torment key, and cod key. find someone in guild who has the rest and flag a guild group. now your a hero and have a few extra hp and pp<br />
<br />
mileage may vary, and by no means is this advice that should be taken seriously, each must do wha they want and rebell against the cookie cutter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">steenky i just got to 4kunbuffed with a fairly limited budget, so take a loook at my magelo for ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the helpfull advice:) <br />
<br />
I'm going to be working on the Draconic Pauldrons and moving my haste around. Getting the Thurg gauntlets is very doable at this time, and the bracers mentioned should be aswell.<br />
<br />
I've moved the gobby earring to my swap-out bag and placed my Sarnak earring of Station in it's place which helped my AC and Atk a little. I need something better there also, but only time will tell.<br />
<br />
I'll post back as upgrades happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten the heads for the Draconic Pauldrons quest and I'm now working on my faction to complete them and the SS bracer I have in the bank.<br />
<br />
Question about the back piece. I have access to a Herophant Cloak from my cleric. Wouldn't this be a little better than the Maelstrom?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiero cloak is better than the cloak of the maelstrom HP wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have another thread going about my 2 gear sets and such but I was wondering .. and again going to refer back to the hp vs AC debacle.. if I have an Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak... 20AC +25 hp's.. would a hierophant cloak be an upgrade?  I am loosing 10 AC to get 50 HP's... in my opinion (based on the latest advice) it would not be as 1AC = 10hps.. that would mean that 10AC = 100hp's and since I'm gonly getting 50 more for loosing 10 AC is not a good deal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50 hp is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than 10 ac.  I wouldn't think about getting into the really high AC range until you are doing PoP bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fekkonu</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want 4k unbuffed at 61? Just copy my gear and aa's. :)<br />
I'm at 4k easy and I still have some easy upgrades I can do to gain more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have SS armor in mind, but its hard to get folks out there enough to get the decent pieces awarded to me right now. <br />
<br />
Plus, I'm going off of the assumption that levels&gt;all which was posted on this board numerous times. I stopped at run3 and dinged 61 the other day. AA's are on a temporary back burner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the chokadai hide pauldrons I have in both my magelos.<br />
<br />
They drop off Deathfang in chardok, go camp him now while you'll still get half decent XP in the kennels.<br />
<br />
You won't find another single piece that's campable where you're gonna gain over 145hp in a single slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never thought of that one. Thanks for the idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In many cases levels &gt;&gt; all but I would still get ND3 first. At your level you should get AA's pretty fast in PoV so I would grind it out and get ND3 finished.  Once you have ND3 I would level to 63 then work on AT and PE. Once you have those grind the rest of the way to 65. That's just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />
