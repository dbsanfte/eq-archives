Once you zone in, the first small area is underwater, but about 5 seconds of swimming gets you on dry land.<br />
<br />
Mob's dont hit very hard, have good cash loot (6pp+), look like King Koopa, and drop FS-type weapons. Aggro range is pretty small.<br />
<br />
The zone itself is humongous, the first thing you will do is get lost. The zone looks amazing, even the water looks good. There are tall, skinny waterfalls from farther than you can see... leaks from the lake (nice bit of design imo). Someplaces you go through water, most you walk.<br />
<br />
Highest /con I found was even (58) and the hardest I got hit was 325. There are named mobs supposedly pretty tough somewhere in there but my group didn't get that far back.</div></div><hr />

Went there for a few hours last night and was quite pleased, though honestly, the xp and loot seemed too good for the level of difficulty. We only had a 52 druid for healing toward the end of the night and it was cake for a full group. Did a few nameds, but all DB to a 57. One dropped a helm very comparable to the Helm of Raldukan. Got a decent bow, dagger, and some pants best suited to monks. Someone else in zone looted some very nice legs- 35ac, 50hp or so.<br />
<br />
New OS is probably a good way to look at it. Sadly I fear it will be completely overcrowded :( Population last night fluctuated from about 40-80 late last night/early this morning and we had no problems keeping busy in our fairly large camp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazthet</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After travelling a bit in the zone for 4 hours with 2 groups of guildmate, here are my thoughts.<br />
Pretty good layout, nice graphs and modelling :p<br />
You can find mobs that are 63 almost right by entrance (Ok you have to travel through the water tunnels anyway before but its easy) that hit for 450, with a very fast respawn (We estimated 15minutes).<br />
<br />
My only complaint is that its too easy for the part we have seen. Mobs are so spaced one from each other that its too easy to pull. At 60 the aggro range of mobs is ridiculous, you can stand next to them and wait a solid 10 seconds before they finally notice you, and the pathing is quite horrible in most of the cases.<br />
<br />
We got an ok mask for int/wis casters, and a bracer for int casters from 2 blue named, and the xp was quite good, as I got almost two yellow bubble of AA while we were raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait a month or even two weeks SOE will nerf the hell out the zone and it will be empty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menia</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deeper in, the Highborns and Nobles are level 60 to 63, hit in the mid 400s, and start to have good HP. Got between 1 and 2% AA per kill there, easily doable with a normal group of 60s. If you really want to run through the place and don't sit to med, take a Necro with you. There are many caster mobs :)<br />
<br />
Coin money way ok, highest pp amount we got was 14pp from an Animated Hand. No tradeskill items discovered, but got 2 nice robes (Kunzar Ceremonial Deathshroud), and earring and Chain Gauntlets (Kylong something) with AC in the mid 20s, Str 5, Dex 5, Sta 10 and 40 HP and Mana, approx. Those were warrior usable.<br />
<br />
The design of the zone is great, the pink mist is a bit strange at first, but you get used to it. It really looks like a ruined city, with all the ramps and cracks and rubble. I'll definitely spend more time there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went exploring with some friends tonight and had a ball in the zone. It looks great and has a great feel to it. Everything about it screams catastrophe. The coin loot was very nice and the items were also nice. We found some Kylong Greaves that were similar to Bone Golem Greaves from Ssra for instance and a 32/34 40hp 2hb if I recall correctly. The aa actually flowed pretty decently deep in. Now we're trying to figure out how to wake the dragon up :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i finally took a brief peek tonight.  didnt go very far in as we didnt have a healer but it seems a fun zone.<br />
it was quite funny when we dropped one of the entrance warriors and he had 6 yes, 6 weapons on him. lol reminded me of me.<br />
<br />
anyway definitely want to do more exploring. a guildy got some nice drops further in, including a 15ac 40hp +other stats mask.<br />
<br />
i better sell my darkmetal visor before prices drop through the floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dragon's name is Garudon. He has probably 100k hp as a guess and quad hits for right around 1000 non defensive. His ae does 650 damage and dots for 100 per tick. It's cold based and has a negative 80 adjustmant so get your cold resistance high. I'm not positive if he's slowable, but I'm pretty sure he is. I don't know how to spawn him because he was already up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just spent a good chunk of today there.  Awesome zone, had a wonderfull time there.  Does not take long to get to blue con to a 65 mobs, they die fairly fast and don't hit ungodly hard, which is nice.  They drop nice cash, weapon's that vender like FS, named a fairly common(we noticed that it averaged about every third spawn on average was a named(2 PH spawns, then named), drops where not awesome that we got, but not bad either.  Everything we got was good enough to go to some one in groups twink.<br />
<br />
Zone has an awesome layout, very vertical in nature, and a great look.  Mobs also had a great look, the iksar missing link.  Exp was certainly not nearly PoP standard, but after a good day of exploring, I had gained 1 1/2 aa's, and got 300 plat for a cash split.  I was very happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">went in for a deeper exploration with a 65 pally 63 ench and a 62 cleric. <br />
<br />
there seemed to be a lot of side tunnels and turnings so after going through the underwater tunnel  we probably didnt explore as much as we could and i was unable to find those lvl 63 mobs. <br />
<br />
its definitely a place thats suited to crawling though, as opposed to staying in one camp, because of its size.<br />
<br />
most of the mobs we fought were around mid 50s, dblue to me at 65. considering they didnt hit very hard, not many hps, the experience return was imo pretty ok.  in about a couple of hours of goofing around and exploring i picked up about 4 pct of regular exp and about  4 pct of aaxp.<br />
<br />
<br />
it is a fantastic looking zone though, cash loots of most mobs, although havent sold to see how much the weps get u.<br />
<br />
we didnt see any nameds, as we probably didnt stay in one place long enough to catch a spawn, but it was just pretty fun wandering around.<br />
<br />
a word of caution though, if your crawling, take a druid/wiz with you, because if the group has to split up or whatever, it may be a pita to get all the way back without  one. this isnt like OS where you can run (with some risk) back to the zone out from most of the upper camps. <br />
<br />
also, a CR here would probably be a fairly painful exercise, as no one has much familiarty with the zone atm and there dont seem to be any established camps.<br />
<br />
however, mobs have a tiny aggro radius, you really have to be right on top of them to aggro you, so if your careful you should be able to get single pulls all the way through.<br />
<br />
one other thing - because of the plentiful spawns and low hps,i wouldnt be surprised if this turned into a killer aoe zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont know if he mitigate slow though, felt a bit that way.<br />
<br />
Bard-song helps alot on AE, not that hard to resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nailed Garudon last night, 100k hp estimate is probably good.  He is one of the most annoying mobs of all time.  Undead dragon, looks like an Ashenbone, about the same size as Trak with a melee hit box that literally is slightly larger than a moss snake.  I spent huge portions of the first fight with either the You Can Not See Your Target (despite the fact that the bastard filled my screen) or You are Too Far Away (despite being right next to it).<br />
<br />
Second try we had 2 necros doing a chain skellie-form nuke on it, was a lot easier.  Hit box expanded noticably in skellie-form and even the rangers didn't bitch because most of their arrows got eaten when it was normal sized anyway.<br />
<br />
At 65 with 300+ cold (including bard song) was almost untouched by the ae.<br />
<br />
Drops were an ac15 65hp Veng2 arm slot and an earring marginally better than Bloodmetal.  Both were no drop.</div></div><hr />

I believe this has something to do with spawning the Dragon, though I am not completely sure.<br />

Mobs deeper in range from 55-61ish max hiter war around 500. I didnt need much healin at all and usually could tank up to 3 of those np. My group of 65lcr/61sham/56ench/56pal/59dru didnt whipe once and we explored all of this dungeon got 1-2 alright drops belt and shoulders of about 40/40 hp/mana. Was a lot of fun to dungeon crawl. By the way one of the stair cases is bugged we started fighting there and got about 10+ adds so watch out bring an evacer. xp is about twice as slow as pop for me but then again we didnt do many 60+ mobs while there.</div></div><hr />

After geting almost no adds all night, we got like 10 mobs at once. We didn't have a rogue or bard, maybe it's a trap? Anyway, cash split ended up going for coffins. :(</div></div><hr />

Lucky for me I have a few necro friends...wish there was a gy in the zone.  Pop has spoiled me for sure.</div></div><hr />
