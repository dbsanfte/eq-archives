<br />
Last attempt before the 6/16 patch, we actually got to Barxt, and got a taste of how much beatdown he and his golem friend could dish out.<br />
<br />
Attempt after that, following the patch, we didn't get anywhere near that far.  Trap mobs kept warping on incoming, leading to missed targeting by tanks, dead casters and ultimately wipeout.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else having this experience?</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately I don't think this is gonna get fixed till July 8th.  :(</div></div><hr />

Yeah, not exactly on topic, but F8 and cycle nearest NPC keys aren't working worth a damn since the patch.  It's a pain in the ass in most zones, but in a few places it's basically useless (primal caves in yxxta is really bad). I MA this is making my job much harder. Last night I had to target with my mouse a few times, because I could not acquire a target otherwise, even when standing 2 inches from mobs.<br />
<br />
Needing mouse click to target is not acceptable. This needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />
