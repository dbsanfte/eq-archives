<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to see some opinions about the OOW expansion from everyone. I am not talking about the bug or whatever that knocked some back to 65. I am refering to the content itself.<br />
<br />
I personally really like OOW so far. Being a non raider this content gives alot of variety. We are mainly doing the instanced zones in draniks right now but have explored NC and WOS a little. Waiting for these zones to settle out some from all the trains etc. We have had some decent drops off the named so far for upgrades to some and a few rune drops for spells. Some of the zones are a bit laggy but not too bad. A new video card would help me out there. Overall I would have to say good job sony on this expansion atleast from my point of view.<br />
<br />
Rating from 1 to 10<br />
I vote 8</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Content is nice, laggy ass zones aren't. That about sums up my opinion thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty good expansion from what I saw.<br />
<br />
Lots of exp zones with raid sprinkeled on the top. Sucks to have raid + exp zones condensed because it's harder to deal with ninjalooters and shit (you get knocked off a corpse after a while).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't know, got sent on deployment August 1st and will be back some time in Febuary. Will give you my input then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Waiting on Levels...but from opinions here I bought OoW ( skipped GoD )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like it, though I am still level grinding. People need to learn there are more zones than WoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The expansion is fantastic...if a bit video/memory intensive. The only problem I haev found is all the morons from KC to BoT are popping up in Wall of Slaughter, which in the first few days of the expansion was a great place. Proving Grounds is an ok zone, but it's damn confusing since it's a HUGE maze. <br />
<br />
Riftseeker's Sanctum is THE BEST ZONE EVER. Great looking zone, very FF like with the shaders set properly, sweet mobs that are fairly difficult to kill, great loot if you can figure out what to kill and how to kill it(1 group stuff).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">how do you guys deal with CRs in riftseekers? ive been toying with the idea of going to check it out, but the thought of doing a CR there gives me the heeby jeebies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love it.<br />

It emptied out every other zone in EQ.  It's fucking great being the only guy in BoT.<br />
<br />
Of course, I hate everyone, so my perception is a bit skewed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What's that you say?  Only one locked zone, great droppable loot, new places to explore, awesome raid mobs?  <br />

<br />
<br />
Invis, fast horses and luck...MOST of the stuff in Proving Grounds doesn't see invis so it's pretty easy to get there. As for getting your bodies to Riftseekers zone in for rez(zone in is very very safe..ie HUGE area with nothing in it), I haven't encountered a single trash mob that sees invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ROFL just have to love Haass's opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">OOW is good, much better than GoD expansion.  <br />
<br />
Upside:<br />
<br />
1.  Zones look great<br />
2.  Zones are actualy fun, I like the mixing of high end raid mobs, and lower mobs, makes  WoS exciting.  Instead of just grinding in one spot, have to shift to avoid Shadowhunter or Warfeind (please, I do not want the uber warriors telling me they solo warfeind naked, with adds while watching TV, talking to their cat, and did not get below 95% health)<br />
3.  Some great upgrades take a look at my magelo, my neck item, one earing, and and one ring are from WoS.  I have also managed to make a pile of plat off of zone<br />
4.  Lessened the whole &quot;uber vs casual warrior&quot; rift.  Do not need to be a super tank like in GoD.  You have people from small guilds, super guilds, and unguilded side by side in pick up groups.  (I am confident that we will end up finding that the one locked zone will be impossible to get too, and have stuff so good that it widens gap)<br />
5.  Complex.  Though I have camped WoS quite a bit, and still are seeing drops for first time, and learning.  Looking forward to rest of it.<br />
<br />
Downside:<br />
1.  WoS is too crowded.  I am willing to go elsewhere, but hard to find others who want to.<br />
2.  Frenzy over named is bringing out worst in players.  <br />
3.  Lag<br />
4.  Trains, trains, trains.  (is it me, or does invis drop at the worse times? )<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not done anything towards epic 1.5 yet, nor do I engage much in tradeskills at moment so can't coment on those aspects.  In regards to AAs, do not care, only have 95 of them at moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">its good, however i refuse to xp in WoS no matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pros:<br />
<br />
1. Not too much sees invis, runs to zones are easier.<br />
2. 'Attuneable' items are nice to twink with yet don't clog the market .<br />
3. Nice spread of zones to fight in, with actual loot and cash drops &lt;gasp&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
1. Laggier, even in non-OoW zones.<br />
2. People seem to congregate in 1-2 zones, especially WoS.<br />
3. Mudflation blew up bigtime.  I hit 12k+ today with the new shaman buffs, that's an obscene amount to me.  I remember being happy earlier this year to hit 10k, now it seems like everything is rising really fast and a bit suddenly.  I didn't even smile when I saw my hp today, few months ago I was really pleased at every hp gain.  Now it just seems kinda blah.  Also concerned with the effect this will have on older zones.  <br />
<br />
On a slightly related topic:<br />
<br />
Why don't they revamp some of the older zones?  I picked up Warcraft 3 the other week and read some of the history -- they really got into it.  Whereas with GoD, and even, in part, PoP, the underlying story wasn't really there.  With OoW it's seemingly gotten worse.  &quot;Let's put these cool looking mobs here on a different faction than those yahoos over there!&quot;  I understand I'm being fairly quick to judge, and perhaps the bigger picture will come out as it did with PoP and GoD, but I just dont get the sense that the game is &quot;healthy.&quot;  It seems it's reaching out and overextending.  Don't get me wrong, I really like OoW, but the RPG part of the game has peeled off, leaving it mainly an MMO.  <br />
<br />
Would be nice if they went back and tweaked a few zones in a way that doesn't interfere with smaller, casual/family guilds moving up through an actual progression, but gives different challenges maybe with a bit of storyline.  Like revamping part of Kael (adding a 'b' section) or Skyshrine, or adding onto Sebilis and Crushbone.<br />
<br />
Welp, back to lurking.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OoW is like the best thing since sliced bread.<br />

Hope a couple more expansions like it follow suit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The good thing about WoS being overcrowded is that the see invis named are too busy killing other ppl while I run through it to MPG~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If it weren't a very fine expansion, you wouldn't have to have started this thread. You could have contributed to the 500 whine threads that would be talking about how much it sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Invis, fast horses and luck...MOST of the stuff in Proving Grounds doesn't see invis so it's pretty easy to get there.

<br />
Just a heads up, Riftseekers is not like this at all any more.  The zone in is still safe, but there's mobs surrounding it, lots of trash sees invis, 3 times the wanderers, and shit gates now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spaztic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I played a beastlord last year to 65 with 175 AA and around 13,000 ldon points.  I play with a  set group.  We were limited to what the beastlord could tank so I made the decision to roll a Warrior.<br />
<br />
He is 64 with 0 AA with about 7.2k buffed.  OoW has been a great expansion.  I timed it perfectly.  The gear that is now available I don't have to look at grinding LDoNs.  I do plan on getting the  ac augs and some anger procs from ldon though.<br />
<br />
Are set group has farmed the dranik caves and made some unreal plat.  I also hit WoS and tanked there just fine.  Not sure if I could handle a named there, but the zone was such a zoo we only stayed for an hour or so.<br />
<br />
There is  a progression path available that looks real good for us.  WoS, PG, then on to GoD for some more loot.<br />
<br />
I would rank OoW the best expansion and LDoN a close second for the non-raider.<br />
<br />
Our set group consists of:  Bard / Cleric / Chanter / Shaman / Druid / Warrior<br />
<br />
The healing power of this setup allows us to take on mobs much higher.  Our dps suffers a bit, but it hasn't been a big problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In terms of player perception, it's a fabulous expansion.  New candylands to see, new candymen to kill,  new candy to suck off on.  It closes the gap between the raiders and the nonraiders and basically gives everyone everything they wanted. <br />
<br />
See, it's actually that last part that I think makes it a bad expansion in terms of actual game mechanics.  No one is anywhere except in fucking OoW because the developers (1) made it so fucking easy (2) made everything drop as quickly as a virgin on prom night and (3) made it impossible to accomplish anything in old zones.  The world is emptied out and everyone lives in WoS, Earth, or Fire.  That is a sad fucking statement on the exploration aspect of a quest game. <br />
<br />
But, hey, see ya in Ruined City of Dranik tonight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>DurpDiggler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I like some of newer mob models in OoW, was getting sick and tired of seeing goats and malnourished little kid mobs in GoD.  MPG xp seems almost unreal and the named spawn rates still seem to be high.  I think most people in general seem to be happy with this expansion.  I need a new computer though, I get crazy lag in RS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What do you think of OOW so far ?<br />
<br />
S'ok, but I keep asking myself &quot;is this all there is?&quot; (I havent been to riftseekers yet though).  Sure there are plenty of zones, but I'm not a 'dreadlands camper'.  Outdoor zones with 80 people and the trainfest chaos that comes with, you can keep em, so no WoS zones for me.<br />
<br />
Another thing that is disturbing is the low AC on non-raider stuff.  It's not hard to find gear for non-raiders that probably has more hit points than your current gear, but you nearly always take an AC hit, sometimes a bad one.  That's a trade off I cant afford, my AC lacks as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ruined City is a great XP zone, excellent alternative to Wall!<br />
<br />
The expo may be boring as watching paint dry, but the trash mobs are nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One thing we do not yet know: how finished/well done is Citadel of Anguish, the locked raiding zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I posted already that I like OOW and still do, but..  The last few evenings I have wanted to do something other than WoS.  I just want a break from the craziness of the zone.  Well, I did not have much luck.  Unlike many people, I like doing ldons, and before OOW, I could always count on a pick up LDoN.  Not now, the wayfarer camps are empty.  Even all of the OOW zones are empty except WoS.  It seems everyone in the game that is 64+ is in WoS, MPG, Bazaar, PoK, or enroute.  I can't speak for higher planes since I am not flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>beeafraid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've only played in WoS, one of the instanced zones off WoS, and Muramite proving grounds.<br />
<br />
XP is painfully slow in WoS.  But the drops are nice enough.<br />
<br />
XP is good in MPG.  Kinda chintzy of them to not let you summon a mount in there.  Especially when most fighting in there is crawls rather than camps.  Would be nice if the casters could regen while otm.  The drops are real nice in MPG.  Nice that some non-raiding people can finally get some decent equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm gonna venture a guess and say that there probably aren't too many non-raiding tanks that can handle MPG.  WoS is a peaceful walk in the park compared to MPG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err... sorry, I'm okay now.  The very idea of the final zone being finished around release time of an EQ expansion just really got me.  :P  Face it, it's broken as hell.  I don't know how you get into the zone and no one seems to be talking about it, but maybe that doesn't even work either. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Was rather skeptical in getting this expansion.  Didn't want to get it at first, full well believing it was going to be a GoD Part II.  So of course peer pressure from guildies came, and I finally caved.   Only been to the instanced zone Dranik's Hollow's, Bloodfields, and Ruined City of Dranik.  The graphics of the new mobs/zones are much better than some of the other expansions.  An almost (they took their time) feel to it in the construction phase.<br />
<br />
Became a bit paranoid when I found out about other warriors were getting chewed up and spit out by mobs here.  The stories of Karnor's Castle Part 3 - The Trains Strike Back.<br />
<br />
Yet I was happy I could hold my own with a decent group and competent healer.  Only thing I can think of being annoying is the voice macro.  Granted it was pretty funny to hear the wood-elf ranger sound like a munchkin.  So where's the yellow-brick road to Oz Fier-Dal?  Female Ogre's sound like they rode the short bus to school when they laugh.  I don't want to even fathom the thought of it being used in a raid setting.<br />
