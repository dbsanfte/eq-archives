<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now I'm using a Shortblade of Lightning (13/19) and a Frosty, and I was wondering whether I could get better aggro out of a Fleshgrinder.  The fleshies ratio may not be quite as good as the SboL's (one less damage), but I figure since the SboL has a rec level of 56 I won't get anything out of its better ratio for a while anyway.  So, would it be wise to sell my Sbol and buy a Fleshgrinder?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a DD proc,  so the only added aggro you'll gain from FG is from the boost in DPS the proc rate gives you (which is hard to measure).<br />
<br />
Your call man. Either that or the shortblade are fine to team up with Frosty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the two i imagine would be roughly equivalent, go with the better looking one imo !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm ok thanks for the info guys, I'll probably just stick with the sbol for now.  And I know I've asked this question before but I've always gotten conflicting opinions.  Which weapon should I wield in my primary hand, the sbol, (which is a 11/19 for me atm) or the frosty?  I usually see now difference but I just want to make sure I'm going with the best aggro possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Lucy, the frostbringer procs at level 40 (I didn't get mine till 53, so never knew that ;)). If you're getting a reasonable proc rate, I'd put frosty in main and offhand the SBoL. If your proc rate is spotty, try it the other way around. Sub-20 delay weapons seem to have their own aggro magnets built in, and the ratio of an 11/19 weapon (.579) is better than that of a 12/22 (.545) anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't equip a fleshgrinder until 51, so you're stuck with what you've got for a few more levels anyway.<br />
<br />
At 51, i'd definitely get a grinder.  The proc adds up to a fair bit of damage over time, and unless it's going to cost you a large amount of plat (doesn't on CT, last time I checked), you might as well go with damage.</div></div><hr />
