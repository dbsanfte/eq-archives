we could probably have around 4-7 clerics. we have a 65 cleric that can mgb HoV. got a 65 sham 65 tank 65 ench and then the rest will be anyone 55+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say he's about Sontalak range in difficulty, maybe a little less. Your guild may not win the first time out but if you try a bit, you'll work out how to drop him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cozlo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We do Xanamech at least once a week.  From the looks of your kill sheet, you should be able to take him.  In fact, the only time this fight was really a challenge for us (about the same strength as you guys), was the first go ... losing three tanks, and having him ping pong while we nuked him down.  Still got him that first time though =)<br />
<br />
It's total cake now.<br />
<br />
A little advice w/o ruining the fun for you.  Let MT build SOLID aggro before force engages, use fast cast and group heals, and FFS get him slowed ASAP.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
Edit: Rereading your post ... I missed 55+.  If you have a good amount of folks between 55-60, take a lot of them.  When we first did him, we had about 32, avg 60.  Have done him successfully with as few as 23, avg 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you get yer resist debuffs and slow off rigth from the getgo, then it should be cake for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Judlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just  did it last night for the first time on Dro.  Our kill list looks almost same as yours.  We had tried one other time and wiped at 10% :(   We used a WS ranger to tank till slowed.  At 15 sec I stepped in and took agro and held thruout.  had 41 on raid with average lvl of 60ish.   All totaled took us about  1 hr 45 min to walk the gnome and kill.<br />
<br />
No hammer yet :(  But a haste neck and one of our robes got a new staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like you can do it.  I'm assuming since you're talking about 4 - 7 clerics, you'll have at least 4 groups of misc. other players there in addition.  I've not killed Xanamech yet personally (13% without a death with 18 people, four clerics; when we pushed him over the wall and he despawned a few minutes later :/ ) but it's close enough to understand what it takes.  In all honesty, the only challenging parts are the CH chain prior to slow, then balancing damage with healing mana.<br />
<br />
This last attempt, when he poofed, was our second try with a much better strategy.  I'll try my best to explain it, as it worked for us, but of course everyone is different and I imagine your force is a bit different.  We start with everyone in position; the main tank (Warrior, not a ranger) right in front of sleeping Xana, Clerics at max CH range plus two steps forward, debuffers (shm/enc/brd if you have one, we didn't unfortunately) right behind main tank - everyone else behind clerics.  Once gnome is just about to reach dragon, tank throws up the disc and CH chain starts (I have approx. 8400 HP buffed as our main tank, 140 AAs, so adjust accordingly), which we used a 3 sec rot with four clerics until slowed.  Slow landed very easily within about 8 - 10 seconds.  Then let warrior build some agro, and all melees/casters/backup healers hug either the left or right wall and move around to the back of Xana and get in positions.  On our guild message board, we had a diagram, but try to imagine Xana is a clock.  Melees engage from 10 and 2 at MAX melee range, and their *same group* healers/casters stand at 10 and 2 behind said melees, just within CH/Celest range and two steps forward.  <br />
<br />
I won't go into all the details, but his 3 AEs (AE unresistable snare, AE stun/300 DD in waves, and AE 800 DD) are different ranges and center around different targets.  The stun/DD, and the reason most people say don't use a CH chain, is shorter than CH (especially with extended range) and is centered on the main tank.  Just remember that, and you can spend the ENTIRE fight with only the main tank taking the AE stun/DD.  The AE snare is the same range as the stun, but centers around the dragon, so expect all melees to be snared.  Not a big deal, but the main tank will have to keep moving and pay attention to keep in position in front of Xana or he'll turn around and screw up the positioning/AEs.  It's 60 or 65% snare as I recall, so it's extremely difficult to backup very well.  I found it better to turn left or right and slide back and to the side to keep in front of him, but sometimes had to turn around and simply walk forward.  Lastly, the 800 DD is larger range than the entire room, so expect everyone to take it, but it's only once every minute so very easy to heal with backup healers and clerics not CHing main tank.  This would also be lowered greatly by having a bard of decent level/equipment, but you may want the bard with CH clerics if you're low on clerics rather than backup healers.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my last point.  Our tactic was, using four clerics, once slowed we broke off two clerics and left two out front of Xana out of AE stun/DD range, to CH chain the MT.  We used an 8 sec rot (he hits for 1390 max, but not very often just remember he can, like any mob, spike for a high round or two), alternating, but many times one CH could be cancelled as the heal would not be needed until the next CH landed.  You'll have to communicate between clerics, but it can be done fairly easily, even with lowered damage from 3 groups of non-primaled people.<br />
<br />
That's it.  The only other thing to remember, which we failed, is to have EVERYONE switch sides (exact same positions) at one time during fight, so dragon doesn't get pushed out of the room and up the wall.  With that tactic, we got him to 13% in approx. 7 minutes, and would've finished the fight with two CH clerics around 20 - 25% mana (level 65, FT 6, SCM 3) and all other healers extremely high on mana (most nuked near the end when it was looking good).<br />
<br />
This fight, in my opinion, is all about positioning and maintaining it for the duration of the fight.  If you can find a way to explain that to everyone, it will GREATLY reduce your mana spent on healing and greatly increase your chance of success.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Forgot to mention, and might be useful information to you, that our raid of 20 was average level of 62 or 63 (lowest 57), with key classes being 65 (namely tank and shaman).</div></div><hr />
