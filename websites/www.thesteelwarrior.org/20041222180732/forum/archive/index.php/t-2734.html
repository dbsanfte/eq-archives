<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The more i think about it , the more im convinced that the current suggested AA path for warriors has a lot to do with our problems.<br />
<br />
 Warriors are &quot;expected&quot; to take a full defensive path through the AA's , and only when thats done should they be takeing offensive AA's. Meanwhile other damage dealing class's are takeing AA that improve thier output. If things were equal at 0aa , there certianly not at 100aa.<br />
<br />
 Ive seen a lot of posts about how this AA doesnt really do that much , or this one sux cuz it only adds 3% dps. Maybe what people dont realize is that warrior's have tons of diff AA many that help offence , many that help defence , and some misc ones. Sure 3% dps increase isnt a ton , but how bout 3% from 6 or 7 different AA , its starts to add up.<br />
<br />
 I strongly feel that if warriors balanced out their AA , some offence some defence , then there would be far far less posts about aggro problems. I personally did it this way (being kind of a rebel i guess , wasnt gonna listen to others tell me how to take my aa heh) and i have really never had the aggro problems that i read about. I rarely rarely have a problem holding aggro when exping , even when shaman slows early,useing taunt and /sheild .<br />
<br />
 Another part of the problem is that a large percentage of the good warriors out there (gear/aa/weapons/skill) are in plane of time or the elemental planes . The left overs are whats left to tank for the exp groups in PoV , tactics which is where many of the problems posted speak about.  Now you may say it goes the same for any class  , but there is a difference. A stun spell works the same for a poorly geared lowertier paladin as i does for a high end paladin , the same cant be said for a similar comparison of warriors. <br />
<br />
 So maybe we are digging our own grave without realizeing it . Anyways , something to think about... out.<br />

I did the offensive aa's first and never regretted it.  Whats the point of being able to take the hits if you have no ability to make it so that you are the one doing it?  Then again these days, does it really matter?  AA's come so fast if you go to the right places, you can get the essentials very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't see it in the Black or White form.<br />
<br />
When you're - like me - one of the MTs in a raiding guild ( now Eles ) your first choice is to survive. So you go the way of defense.<br />
<br />
When you're in a non 7 days a week raiding guild, then you can make you're own choice. <br />
<br />
You have enough hp for tanking in your favorite exp zones ? ok. You can skip the HP AAs.<br />
<br />
You're cleric is good enough to heal you all time? ok. You can skip the defensive AAs.<br />
You have problems with your Equippment ( no real good aggro weapons )? ok. You can train some offensive AAs for more damage.<br />
<br />
My tip for that. Look at the AAs an pick the things you think you need.<br />
<br />
In the end you will have all you need.<br />
<br />
Its you're way and you're choice. Don't blame others for their tips or ideas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Offensive AAs only help with holding aggro they don't do anything to get you initial aggro.  Initial aggro is the problem and all you have to rely on for that is taunt.  I can't even remember the last time I lost aggro after I got initial aggro in an xp group but I frequently have problems with healers having to dump tons of mana on teh slower at the beginning of a fight because taunt fails 3 or 4 times in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With ALL offensive AAs and using Basalt Greatsword of the Protector (45dam/35delay) I could not hold agro off of a palading with 6 AAs, not casting anything just swinging his Norge'Tal (53dam/45del, stun proc). <br />
So, one stun proc &gt; all warrior offensive AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Norge tal has stun + knockback.  Both upset the critters, so it is a particularly effective aggro proc - much more so than just a normal stun.  I love mine and use it to MT all the time.<br />
<br />
Of course you're point is still valid.  If our only job is to make the mobs hit us... we should be able to do that with some reliability, and not depend on procs (stun, eb, etc...) to do our job.  And it is sad that we don't have ANY aa ability that will help us do our one damn job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have all offensive AAs except Finishing Blow, Double Riposte and point #3 of Raging Flurry (1.5 points left to get it!) and I have really good agro overall using a BoW, high ATK for a warrior, etc.<br />
<br />
If group members work with me ( and they don't have to work that hard) I keep agro pretty well.  If group members pretend like I am a paladin, they can and do die.  I replaced a paladin in an exp group in Bothunder and the enchanter died 3 times in 30 minutes because I wasn't a paladin.<br />
<br />
Offensive AAs help, but they don't give agro lock (nor should they).  Lots of lazy groups prefer the paladin with agro lock to the warrior without it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">friss</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A simple solution to increase a war agro for experience grps but not for raids would be some type of buff.  Have an easy to get item with a right click buff, but this buff when cast will take up 5 buff slots.<br />
<br />
As for the buff itself make it some type of shield that procs a hate and atk debuff every time a mob swings at the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i still think nd3 over offensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the time you max your offensive AA's (without doing ANY defensive aa's) your gonna be soaking so much damage that people would laugh at you everytime you tank (ie. riposte damage alone)  CS CA LR ND PE ID SE TM....  Dont have these but you've maxed your offensive skills?... Great you have decent dps for the short period of time that your cleric can keep you up :)<br />
<br />
Macro this beside your taunt key plz:<br />
<br />
/shout WTB A rez <br />
