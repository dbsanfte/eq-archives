<br />
What are the &quot;best looking&quot; 2 handed swords?<br />
<br />
As a tanks *still* with ages to go before 65 it will be a while befoe I see all of them. I love what the Ornate Greatblade looks like,-anything droppable that has the same look? <br />
<br />
Also a more important question.. whats the difference in haste items? Ive aqquired a 31 % belt (30kish) A 34% belt (spiked seahorse or something?) costs 20k more. I also see people here keep recomending haste cloaks for the upgrade questions. Is claoka better spot to have a haste item? I'me using a Cloak of Greater Pernacity right now which seems, well fantastic, and better than any belts I can use (at my level anyway). Does this change later on?</div></div><hr />

<br />
cloak haste usely stems from cloak of flames the orignal best haste and it had decent melee stats 50 hp and such while the fbss was just ac2.<br />
<br />
the % is how much of a improvement it is 34&gt; 31. so usely much higher cost.<br />
<br />
generaly the hast belts tend to be multi class usable and either have no stats or kinda sucky stats compared to cloaks. only the newer betls come equal to cloaks.</div></div><hr />

It also is that rare combination of looks and functionality, so if I ever get my hands on one, everything else can just get bagged. <br />
<br />
offtopic a bit: <br />
<br />
I call my windblade (2h axe) the &quot;razor on a toothpick&quot; (I'm normally shrunk down to pixie size so it looks small enough.   Interesting look, overall. <br />
<br />
But my favorite 2h axe graphic is the &quot;weighted axe&quot; from Frontier Mts.<br />
<br />
<br />
And of course, being a dark elf warrioress, style is kinda what I'm about. . . <br />

<br />
JBoW is so flashy; it's hard to not like it's look ( esp with full particle effects on ) ... but Gaudralek as a base model is just astounding. Beautiful weapon.<br />
<br />
I added Exe Axe because nothing ( nothing! ) beats a big honkin' axe graphic :D</div></div><hr />

The Exe axe is cool looking.<br />
I always liked the looks of the Langseax of the Wolves, too: sturdy, solid, actually looks like a sword. Like the epic, it's one of those items that would benefit from a progressive quest for upgrades.</div></div><hr />

It has no aggro proc or anything, though the raw damage based potential aggro was enough for me to tank with it for a long time in xp groups.  There are much better weapons around now, but you can't touch the look.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorites:<br />
<br />
1)  The Sword of Ssraeshza<br />
<br />
This is, hands down, the best looking sword in the game.  Everyone knows the look of this weapon, and if I could really describe it to you in case you haven't, you would probably recognize it in the back of your head 'cause chances are, you've seen it once before while roaming around PoK.<br />
<br />
2)  Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky<br />
<br />
This is also the same graphic for the Tunare knight only sword.  Its looks are very similiar to the Sword of the Bloodsworn, but it's longer and in a two-handed treat.  It has a gem embedded in the pommel of the blade.  Easily recognizable and doesn't share graphics with too many other weapons.  It's rather rare too since it's Warrior only and drops uncommonly off one of the hardest dragons in NTOV (Lord Vyemm).  I always wanted one.  =(<br />
<br />
3)  Ornate Greatblade<br />
<br />
Just as the name describes, it's ornate!  It's a beautifully rendered sword, and I'm sure everyone here has seen it at least once since the damn thing drops so commonly.  It's also a damn fine weapon with good stats and a solid ratio.  You'll probably find this sword on a Paladin or Shadowknight more commonly, but don't be suprised to see Rangers and Warriors wielding it too.<br />
<br />
Other runners up:<br />
-Bloodfrenzy / Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled / Tae Ew Longsword<br />
-Obsidian Scimitar of War<br />
-Edge of Eternity / Gold Rune Mithril Knife<br />
-Vanizier's<br />
<br />
Worst Graphics:<br />
-Greater Stormwatcher's Horn<br />
-Split Blade of Destruction<br />
-Anything from fucking GoD<br />
<br />
I never liked the Blade of War when I first saw it.  I thought it looked freaking awful.  I had to get the graphic to grow on me and now I think it looks pretty good.  Still, there is room for improvement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My favourite sword graphic is probly still the LSoEE - the simplicity of it combined with the translucence really apeal to me.  But at the other end of the spectrum, I also like the over-indulgence of the Bladecatcher of the Marshall.  I think it's the vicousness of the thing.</div></div><hr />

I was lucky enough to wield it with a weapon of the same graphic, Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, for a while. I highly reccoment that setup even today, if for no other reason, the wonderful appearance of them together. If you can't do that, get a Vyzh'Dra's Render of Souls. Any combination of the three, all have the same graphic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Number 2 : The sword of ssraezha (the tunare pally quest sword looks like this aswell)<br />
<br />
Number 3 : split blade of destruction/ivory hilted cleaver etc (i know there some two handers with this graphic aswell<br />
<br />
I think the bow look is cool as a one hander, but just seems funky as a 2 hander. i think both needed to be alittle smaller<br />

I don;t care for sews, cause all the weapons with the tiny handle are just annoying</div></div><hr />

I wasn't all that hot for the BoW when I 1st saw it, but it certainly grows on you, get little warm fuzzys when I see 4 or 5 guild warriors all in a line with BoW's.  Its like the epic, not just a sword but a status symbol aswell, dyes having made it possible for warriors who havent even made it through a PoJ trial to run around in full raex blue kinda took the fun outta having pimp looking armour.<br />
<br />
SEWS is too refined looking, ok if you're a paladin or a woodelf, I could probably get away with it as a half elf, but it looks ridiculous in the hands of a troll or ogre.<br />
<br />
Our casters had a bunch of the one handed staff from air with the vanazir graphic and the first few vanazirs that dropped for us were won by knights who would then put on dresses and try to sell KEI or TLs so it looks to me like a caster toy, certainly nothing I'd be caught dead with.<br />
<br />
Gaudralek looks awesome, wish I had one.<br />
<br />
One handers BF is the win for sure, I like the Double Edged storm blade as a one hander but not as a 2 hander, that sword you see in Mistmoore on trash mobs looks cool too, there needs to be a few weapons with that graphic out there.</div></div><hr />

It's a big bone, but when equipped it looks like an axe.  Plus, it procs Yaulp II (with lots of sparklies) on the wielder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Sword of Ssra on the other hand looks sweet and is a two-hander<br />

I'll have to post a screenshot of the nifty-lookin shield I got in GoD the other night.</div></div><hr />
