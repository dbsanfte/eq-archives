<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a question to you all.<br />
<br />
Is the quest to get the new augmentable weapons, and still having a copy of the old weps in inventory (BoT and BoS) an exploit, and if it is, to what extent is it an exploit? I mean is it a bannable offense ? Or will they just take them away if they see you with 2 x BoS and 2 x BoT etc ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I HIGHLY doubt anyone cares.<br />
<br />
Given that a GSoT for 100pp now out agroes AND outdamages two red epics, I really don't think anyone will care.<br />
<br />
Just go for it man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think they'll take the weapons if someone complains loudly enough.  But no one will.  And what's the good of having them if you can't flaunt them :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I was thinking that putting an Anger II Proc on the Augmentable one would give me some very good Agro, as well as holding the other BoS in offhand. That would give me 3 Hate procs on 2 Weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why not just put some hate procs on a couple of SSoYs? Then you would have 2 hate procs AND 2 stun procs! Uber! No matter how hard you try, you can't polish a turd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hahaha but it took me 2 years to get the damn Epic quest done, I want to play with them LOL. Yeah I know they suck ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Has your server been around for 2 years?<br />
<br />
If so, damn, time flies.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I wouldn't worry about the dual red blades thing. SOE should be well aware of that little burp in their quest since it's been publicized widely. And I'm pretty sure they knew it would happen since they designed the quest to get around the SUMMONED versions of the items anyways.<br />
<br />
As far as augmenting them ... yes, augmenting the one red blade would indeed give you 3 hate procs.<br />
<br />
Would that be a better than putting a hate proc on a far superior weapon? Who knows. That's up to you. It's your weapon, and they're your LDoN points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamiccolo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">maelin wasn't a fresh start server, he probably moved there when it opened up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At this point in the discussion, I'd like to mention that the epics are only bank fodder if you're fairly uber.  If you aren't, they still have some value.<br />
<br />
Specifically, the blue epic.  It does WONDERS for ATK and DEX.  I use it to touch off my Primal.  Last night I did nice DPS with it in the on-hand(!) and a LDoN dagger in the off-hand.<br />
<br />
I have heard that the blue epic's ATK counts as &quot;worn&quot; ATK, so it eventually is negated by Vengeance items.  But you have to be fairly far into the game for this to happen.  Do I have this right?<br />
<br />
I have been underwhelmed by the effectiveness of the red and 2h epic's aggro procs ever since I got them over a year ago.  Everything resisted the procs.  I didn't seem to get the amazing aggro I thought I would get. /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I run around with dual blue blades a lot when messing around.<br />
<br />
It's the equivalent of Vengance 12, and one big ass dex buff.<br />
<br />
It's quite fun.<br />
<br />
Can't be super serious all the time. (Oh and remember, my warrior's still a pup, only level 52, and doesn't raid, so epic ... still a pretty damn effective weapon for him).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I levelled from 60-65 wielding the 2hs epic and it held agro well enough and did serviceable DPS.<br />
<br />
Since then droga has been revamped and &gt; epic weapons are farmable there with a group of 60's easily, the named spawns arent that rare and they are the common drops.<br />
<br />
The Greatstaff of thunder which at the time was pretty rare to see for sale and sold for over 20k (windblades were still 50k) has dropped to around 500pp.<br />
<br />
Weapons like Flesh grinders, Shortblades of Lightning, Horns of Hsagra can be bought for less than it would cost you to pick up your dragon scales in the bazaar and are far superior in DPS.<br />
<br />
Its a relic.  A very cool looking relic that should give you warm fuzzys and make woodelf druid chicks want to give you cyb0rz, but if you actually use it you are selling yourself short.<br />
<br />
And Wu, bet that +110 dex is doing wonders for your proc rate... =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;And Wu, bet that +110 dex is doing wonders for your proc rate... =/&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Good one. Ya got me there.<br />
<br />
It does help to be maxxed dex for fletching when I fletch though. And Snoggy is still my primary tradeskiller (fletching is about the only one I can stand, though maybe the new UI will help with that some).<br />
<br />
If I started to play my warrior more seriously, the GSoT I've got in his bank would get the first aggro augment I ground out. And I'd probably snag a DPS weapon like a war marshall's bladed staff.<br />
<br />
But as is, he's my fun, downtime toon. No rush to improve his weapons just yet. It's not gonna have THAT big an effect on killing that Drolvarg Ravager.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
And yeah, I still have some pride that I got him his epic. And do like the look of it.</div></div><hr />
