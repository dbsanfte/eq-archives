<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya all, <br />
<br />
Trying to figure out which slot I need to upgrade next.  I will have about 15 to 25k in a day or two.  I can save a bit longer if need be, but will have to get it from bazaar as I do not have a full group of friends available this month and am unguilded trying to level up to meet requirements.<br />
<br />
I was trying to find HP upgrades without losing AC and the shoulder slot is a real pain in the wallet from latest bazaar check.<br />
<br />
Here is the Magelo link,<br />

<br />
Any input appreciated,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll shoot a few ideas from off the top of my head, take them as you wish.<br />
<br />
Legs: Greaves of the Orcish Master (lvl 65 normal LDoN EC drop)<br />
Full Mithril Greaves (unimbued high elf cultural)<br />
<br />
Feet: Steelslave Bladed Boots (lvl 65 normal LDoN EC drop)<br />
Full mithril boots<br />
<br />
Arms: Full Mithril vambraces<br />
<br />
Ears: Earring of the Solstice or another Bloodmetal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grabbing the LDoN dros for legs and feet.  anyone think of another arm item? The Full Mithril stuff is rarely in Bazaar only the imbued stuff.  <br />
<br />
Are the Imbued Granite Spaulders good enough until I can save pp or loot better?  The lack of stats/HP bothers me, but the AC/resists beat anything I see in bazaar for under 65k.</div></div><hr />

Ornate Helm would be nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looked at the legs effect on my Magelo, I actually lose 1hp and gain 4ac, checked Kylong Shinguards, gain 28hp and 3 ac, but lose the str and no resists.  Would the Orc legs still be best bet?<br />
<br />
Ornate Helm, sadly the last one I saw for 40k and was gone before I got there.  The rest have all been 65-75k.<br />
<br />
Horn Spiked shoulders seem to be coming down though /crosses fingers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well settled the legs question, the Kylong were chain graphic /vomit.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,</div></div><hr />
