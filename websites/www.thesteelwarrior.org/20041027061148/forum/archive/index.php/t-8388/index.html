<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">way back when we had a nice graph of Ac test that I am sure is in the library somewhere. it was the impetus for me to focus on ac. at some point additional AC offers diminishing results. the question I pose is what is the inflection point? i am trying to devise a gear strategy that will indicate when its time to pull those 10ac augs out (or replace my 61ac elemental bracers etc) and just go hp or slap in an effect of some kind.<br />

Since pop, eq has been going for fast mean fights, which means mobs always have really high attack.  Until this trend changes, you will never be able to have enough ac against mobs  of your level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3.5k AC buffed is probably a pretty good number to shoot for. Until you can get that, I would keep on piling it on.</div></div><hr />

doesn't seem to have very diminishing returns though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's virtually impossible to lose HP by gaining AC anyway given the way itemization works.  Whatever has the most AC tends to be the best gear in that slot anyway.  Though keep an eye out for other effects, such as spellshield, combat effects, improved dodge/parry, and of course shielding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
have i hit the &quot; SOFT CAP&quot; ?According to what the devs have told us, the soft cap is significantly lower than 2600. I would imagine it is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 1400ac unbuffed.<br />
<br />
The misconception about the softcap is that once you hit it, you shouldn't focus on AC any longer. The reason this is a misconception is that AC has a SOFT cap, not a HARD cap. You still get additional benefit from more AC, it is just not as much as before the cap. For example, 1300 -&gt; 1400 might result in a 4% mitigation increase, 2300 -&gt; 2400 results in a 1.5% mitigation icrease. Still a 100ac increase, but not nearly as much of a mitigation increase, but it is still worth getting.<br />
<br />
In theory, there will eventually come a time when the increased mitigation from AC has reached a point that the returns are no longer worth it. We haven't reached that point yet, and at this time I don't think anyone can reach a high enough AC value to test it accurately.</div></div><hr />

ya, the ac cap is 1400 on kunark mobs or whatever other mob you feel safe parsing on for 4 hours. Like when that sk did a few hours in the fort in fire with 2600 ac. But I dare you to try tanking kodtaz with 1400 ac, you'll get beat down like a little girl.  For the ac  cap to never raise, mobs ac would have to stay static (And we know mobs attack ratings have gone up)</div></div><hr />

Read his full post.. then read it again..<br />
<br />
He said it's a soft cap, thusly a point of diminishing return. At around 1400 ac you don't get the same dramatic damage reduction. What has not been proven is wether or not there's subsequent cliffs that cause the ac to give less and less returns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love how people see a number and instantly skip through the post and start flaming them, it makes me laugh a lot.<br />
<br />
I buff to 2500ac and still notice a lot of improvement as I gain ac. And I'm only fighting Time stuff still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, about this AC thing, I prefer to speak about breakpoint or inflexion point not cap (either soft or hard).<br />
For me, a cap is a limit that can be achieve but not gotten through. and thus a hardcap is linked to the mumber of bits that are used to store the value (an exemple would be the code I work with : it can't compute fluctuation below 1E-13 because of the rounding error of the calculator). on the other hand I see softcap as a limitation given by the programer, not the machine (an example would be the haste in EQ which is certainly calculated like this : Haste = Min (haste_v1 + haste_v2 , 100% ) + haste_v3 , thus without haste_v3 buff nobody can get above the softcap of 100% haste). <br />
But for AC we still stack up AC with a mitigation benefit, but the progression is different as breal parses sugest something like Effective_AC = Min ( AC_without_shield , AC_Breakpoint ) + Max( AC_without_shield - AC_Breakpoint , 0 ) / 2 + Shield_AC  .<br />
but it's not easy to get the exact formula since the AC_Breakpoint is dependent on AA (and maybe lvl ?), and that there is two kind os AC (avoiding and mitigating AC), and that a given Effective_AC don't give the same dps reduction depending on mob (lvl, atk, ...). ie you may as well get anougth AC to see no dps reduction at all from a mob (an orc pawn :) ) but still been under the breackpoint.<br />
<br />
EDIT : as I said, and I repaet it again, don't see my formula as truth. this is an multi-linear aproximation made by a three point evaluation... so it's not consistant with anything untill heavily parsed.</div></div><hr />

For the ac  cap to never raise, mobs ac would have to stay static (And we know mobs attack ratings have gone up)/sigh. Do you have any idea what a soft cap is? From your post it's apparently you have no clue. While the 1400ac number was pulled right out of my ass, the fact that we know there is a soft cap that is easily attainable by anyone with decent gear comes straight from the developer. You know, the guy who wrote the code? Maybe you've heard of them? You should comprehend what you are reading before flaming, makes you look dumber than you really are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Diminishing returns is commonly believed to be 10 AC = 1 AC at least back in Luclin days.  I can assure you if softcap is at 1400 AC and the diminishing returns is what people believed it to be (I've never seen anyone manage to show a different diminishing returns) AC would be utterly useless.<br />
<br />
If you can't show the level of diminishing returns you do not know if a soft cap exists either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can't show the level of diminishing returns you do not know if a soft cap exists either.Are you kidding me? Because 10ac=1ac is not the case you think that there is no softcap? Maybe the benefit is 75% over the cap, who knows.<br />
<br />
How about this for proof:<br />
The cap on AC in the Velious era wasn't a soft cap; it was a hard cap that had been there from day 1.  After a certain point, which differed for each class, the benefit of more AC didn't just diminish - it dropped to nothing.<br />
<br />
The change I referred to, just before PoP, changed that from a hard cap to a soft cap.  You get a percentage of the amount over that soft cap.  Shields increase both your total and your soft cap, making them more effective than any other item with equal AC.  Your mitigation AAs, level, and class also affect the cap and the percentage return for AC over it.<br />
<br />
Separate from this, there are diminishing returns if your AC is much greater than the NPC's attack.  This is due to the nature of the formulas that produce the probability distributions that have been well documented on this board.<br />
<br />
Does that help?<br />

<br />
And this is where I pulled 1400ac from. I would guess that a median warrior would be in the 1200-1600 range since getting more than 1600ac basically takes higher end gear to achieve.<br />
<br />
You folks do a great job of parsing and figuring out the mechanics of the game.  I don't want to leave you with no mysteries at all =)  I will say this:<br />
<br />
3) Yes, the mitigation AAs will not do anything for you if your AC isn't high enough.  However, the median level 65 warrior is over the cap even with both Luclin and PoP mitigation AAs maxed, so you can safely assume you're getting the full benefit out of them.<br />
<br />

<br />
I would tend to believe the guy that wrote the code a little more than some ranger or Phantron, who apparently doesn't believe there is a soft cap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Look at it this way...<br />
<br />
The 'soft cap' for stamina is 200. Above 200, you get less hp per point of stamina that you do below 200. Noone stops at 200 stamina, just because they're hit the 'soft cap. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I don't know how there could be a universal soft cap for AC, since I'm of the school that AC benefit is inversely proportional to the mob's atk, or another hidden varient of THAC0.</div></div><hr />
