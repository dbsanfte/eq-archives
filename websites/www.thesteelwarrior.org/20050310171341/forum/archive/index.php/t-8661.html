Let's show our support for getting EQIM up and running again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's crappy. I suggest getting the full version of Trillian, and downloading the EQIM plugin. I can assure you that it still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, sure does, its crappy, but it works.</div></div><hr />

After you manually fix your .xml file, flag it read-only so the patcher can't overwrite it.  After doing that, EQIM is officially working for me again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did just that, and the stupid patcher overwrote it anyway.  Some security Win2000 has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I thought it worked for me under XP...will have to check again when I get home tonight.</div></div><hr />

edit: nm Prexus hasn't had it's 'maintenance' yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurge</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have TEQIM and I use EQIMd (the IRC to EQIM chat attacher) for my guild (as a loot/dkp tool).  When TEQIM and EQIM request the address for Terris-Thule, it gets the old address.  EQIM is now reporting that I have no characters on Terris, but that's because another server now lives at the old Terris address.  Lax over a Lavish (EQIMGuru) plans to try a fix for TEQIM, but that's not until next week.  Unfortuneatly just updating the serverinfo.xml isn't the best solution.  I made mine readonly, and the patcher just replaced it.  Hopefully, we can convince SoE to throw a few hours into it.  <br />
<br />
I've attracted a lot of first time posters to the EQLive boards so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurge</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the thread is locked on the eqlive boards.  Time to send emails to eqfeedback@soe.sony.com and see if we can get them to do something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check your ownership/perrmissions on that file. Likely the system still has admin access to the file. Changing ownership will probably do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuzzee</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never could get EQIM to work from the beginning. Some BS about my account/password not being correct and it most definitely always was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Works for me, I'm on test right now!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some servers work, some servers don't.  It's not a matter of EQIM/TEQIM not working.  It's the chat server not having the proper addresses for all servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some servers work, some servers don't.

<br />
So basically have an intern fix a few values, or stop making the patcher over-write our files?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, seriously I could fix the file in an hour.  Somebody who knew the server numbers could fix it in 10 minutes.  &quot;Supporting&quot; EQIM is one thing, but having somebody spend 15 minutes fixing one file and putting it on the patcher to make a lot of your customers more satisfied seems like the way to go to me.<br />
<br />
Works for me, I'm on test right now!<br />
<br />
Yea Test works fine (for a change something works on test but is screwed on other servers).  The problem is talking to people on Tarew Marr, since the file lists it's shortcut as &quot;tarew&quot; instead of &quot;marr&quot; like it's supposed to be.  That one literally takes less than 30 seconds to fix and has been in since EQIM came out.<br />
<br />
And for the record, the &quot;read only&quot; thing didn't work.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurge</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they'll put a resource on EQIM to change how the patcher works.  But, we only really want them to fix the connection issues.<br />
<br />
They shutdown the thread on EQLive, looks like if we want EQIM to be fixed we need to send them emails at eqfeedback@soe.sony.com.<br />
<br />
Hello everyone, <br />

I need to explain again that, EQIM is no longer supported. <br />

Ping ayonaero.everquest.com shows that it's eqworld-162.  Changing the server id to 162 and running EQIM with the /nopatch argument, I &quot;still&quot; get Server Is Down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, something has been fixed.  EQIM is fully working again for me now after letting it repatch the xml file back again.  The values in the file are the same they've always been previous to this whole mess, yet everything is working properly again.  Guess SOE listened to the uproar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice!  <br />
<br />
BTW The /nopatch thing doesn't work with EQIM as far as I know.  You have to patch it and THEN edit your XML file before logging in.</div></div><hr />
