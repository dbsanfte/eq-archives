<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">looking for a very detailed walkthrough, and maybe a few hints hehe thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No no no, don't spoil one of the best zones in the games!<br />
<br />
Here's some basic stuff:<br />
Most if not all trash mobs cast AE's like Uqua mobs did. 1 type spawns 3 golem adds. 1 type is mezzable.<br />
Njacka the Scourge hits about quad 800 consistanly, not bad but can mess you up if pulled with 3-4 others.<br />
Wanders are on a 5 min repop timer (give or take) statics are once per instance.<br />
<br />
Kelekdrix:<br />
Banishes, think of a way to deal with it. The hardest part is before kelekdrix not the mob itself. Buff all resists for the AE's.<br />
<br />
Stonemites: Not giving hints here as this stops alot of guilds, use your head, if you can't do Inktu'ta then your fucked for MPG trials and Txevu. It's not as hard as it seems.<br />
<br />
After stonemites are golems, good offtanking and good heals are the way to go.<br />
<br />
Cursecaller: Run, you figure the rest out.<br />
<br />
Noqufiel: Again, work it out for yourself.<br />
<br />
Asking for a full spoiler makes your guild look unable to do anything without a plan laid out for them, past Inktu'ta unless you have a friend feeding you strats from a top end guild, you'll have to work it all out, and it really is the most rewarding thing to do it yourself. Tonight we did Zun in txevu for our first time after 6-8 attempts and trying plans, and it feels great to of done it with only the general info on the encounter. Though saying that, I am not against people giving small hints and background information so the guild can use that to help themselves as I'm sure others here will, just don't spend you're whole time using other peoples strats.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way is to figure out by trying. You get more fun out of it if not then you are doing something wrong. We too have stuck on Inktuta for pretty long to try to figure out the script last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You walkthrough on your feet, your hint is that you have to think outside the box.  <br />
<br />
Dont look for spoilers, this is one of the most fun zones in the game, go enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sintaril</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like alot of people say, this is one of the best zones in game, and its worth running through it a few times and brainstorming. chances are youll find some really odd methods for dealing with some of the events, and imo thats where the real fun is ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inuktu'ta is something that imo you should not get any strats for. The stuff can be won so many different ways, I have been with 2 guilds through it and now going on 3 and it is different for everyone. The best part is you can pick the loot you get towards the end =D. Nijacka is also a great one group mob when you arent raiding to get an armor mold or aug from, you can safely get the exp and do it without any lockout timer so it wont effect you raiding with your guild. Since its instanced its a viable way to get molds when Mshas are perm'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as i said when i corrected myself, not looking for any spoilers, but rather an intro....  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I gave is more than an enough to get you started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, in fact it was more than i was looking for, but thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inktu'ta was a blast to learn =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renwin Everfool</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best raid design ever, especially for an instanced zone. Don't spoil it, learn it and savor it - you probably won't see another like it anytime soon. Well, I haven't yet at least. :(<br />
<br />
Need more like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Noq is one of the most fights I've ever participated in.  Unfortunately, I joined the guild after they learned the strategy for Mites...I wish I had been there to learn that :(  I still have no idea what's going on when we backflag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the stonemites event to be a cryptic really and not that much fun learning when you can't tell if you screwed up because people did the wrong things or you just didn't have enough people in each area.  Of course, I guess the point is that you're supposed to split up 4 ways but I can see how most would be hesistant to try this first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zuko</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just Live it and Love it! Like you would need an intro if you been progressing thru 4 expansions .. expect everything to happen sheesh :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha okay, so apparently we all have different opinions on what an intro is....  :eek: but thanks guys.</div></div><hr />

Actualyl this would be the one thing you should give a &quot;spolier&quot; for IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I know is, people say this zone is supposed to be fun.  While we can get far into it, I have yet to have &quot;Fun&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My intent was not to post spoilers, this isn't the safehouse, my post was a rough idea of what to expect from the first part of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tramir</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actualyl this would be the one thing you should give a &quot;spolier&quot; for IMO.<br />
 <br />
Why? This event is meant to be the learning curve of the whole zone. Also, spoilers just aren't worth it. Honestly, what kind of raiding guild can derive any pride from having a strat handed to them? Can you honestly tell me that you wouldn't feel the least bit shitty over winning by someone else's strat? <br />
<br />
Another thing, even if you have a strat sitting right in your hands, it's the execution of your own guild that gets you the win, or the wipe. IMO, people should just do the content for themselves, on your their own  terms, and eventually it'll get done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find stonemites event to be the most cryptic event of the zone and hence makes the most sense to ask for help.  In particular there is absolutely nothing in the game that'd indicate that you're supposed to split 4 ways as opposed to just leaving a handful of FDable classes at each Trusik because the game gives no indication on what's the correct # of people you need to get the hail to work.  Actually to this day I still don't know how many you're supposed to have in each room to get the script working which is why everytime my guild does it we just split 4 ways to make sure it works.  <br />
<br />
Everything else in Inktuta is pretty straightforward and don't need hints given, and besides hints would be pretty obvious stuff like 'don't get hit by the guys that DT on cursecaller event'.</div></div><hr />
