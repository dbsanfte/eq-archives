<br />
I would only be doing this for fun, but I think I could probably hold aggro with Blam Stick in mainhand(it's primary only) and my BoC or Wrath's Edge in offhand.<br />
<br />
Just curious.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">go for it, if it's all for fun. but usually slower 1h weapons dont hold agro as well as faster ones. if you get alot of EF adventures and dont mind buring a few points you might as well screw around and experiment, but if your guild actaully needs you to tank, you might consider putting anger3 on your GSot4W.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Proc rate is inversely proportional to actual weapon delay (i.e. comprehends haste/slow); putting an ang proc on a twig would give you about the same number of procs per minute as it would if you put in on a bam stick...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously I think this is a joke. It would be stupid to waste 1150 points on anger 3 for a blam stick when you could use those points for LDoN armor and HP augs or for a weapon that would actually be good to put it on. If you're actually serious and want to waste 23 adventures worth of points, go ahead then:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was actually just curious if youg uys thought it could hold aggro...yes it's slow but it hits VERY hard for a 1h weapon and with an Anger3 proc on it, it might actually be a viable weapon. <br />
<br />
I'm scared to waste that many points on it, but I would definately like to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It won't hold agro. Your dps is going to suck hard, and since the weapon is so slow; the proc won't make up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">blaa, crush my dreams of actually being able to use a weapon I got 3 years ago. /cry<br />
<br />
I wonder if I bitched and complained enough if they would make if offhandable...It still has a decent ratio, which would be ok for offhand use. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trmonk</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a Blam Stick in main hand for quite awhile, mainly due to PoP mobs riposting so hard.<br />
<br />
Blam in Main, can't remember what in off, but 30/40 isn't that seriously bad DPS and it is nice critting for 300+ with it. and Innerflaming almost 600 with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I know proc rate is independent of weap delay.  I was just goin for the disparity of a 40del mainhand with a 10del offhand.  =)</div></div><hr />

I got your joke. And it at least made ME chuckle.<br />
