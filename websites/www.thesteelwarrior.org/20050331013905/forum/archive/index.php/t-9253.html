Is there no benefit to improved dodge/parry I/II/III loot and if this stuff doesn't do anything then why do they put on items that only maxed characters can obtain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure it's the same.  Improved Dodge effects don't increase your Dodge skill, merely your chance to perofrm a dodge outside of the system.  Someone would have to parse to be sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Parry/Dodge 1/2/3 work &quot;perfectly&quot;, and by perfect I mean it increases the amount it goes off but chances are you would have avoided the blow anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so to sum up that thread the benefit is there but the beneift as tested was so low it shouldnt take priority over ac/hp or other effects<br />
<br />
one question, were those tests done at 65 or 70 and were skills for 70 maxxed if it was indeed at 70</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the worst part of the parse is that Improved Parry doesn't decrease the dps. but just change the distribution of parry/ripost/dodge/miss. by the way, parses show 9/12/22% increase instead of 8/16/24%  , this should be RNG issues.<br />
Nevertheless, this should be /feedback by our class correspond<br />
<br />
I gess that parry3 + dodge3 would do the same (more parry and dodge but less miss)<br />
<br />
this really looks like SoE is bending us on the barril...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much the same thing that was discovered about the +riposte mod on the bloodfrenzy back in Luclin.  I guess if you got dodge, parry, and riposte mods at the same level, they would cancel each other out and you would be exactly like someone with zero mods?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ibithior those were done at 65.  With the exception of an item thats really close ac wise (Pauldrons of Devestation vs Whispering Amice) you're correct, it shows that the effects not really worth giving any hp or ac up for.<br />
<br />
Parry 3+Dodge 3 would let you avoid more hits but the overall decrease on your dps intake wouldn't be all that much, about 0.6% depending on the mobs accuracy (the effect gets far far far better on mobs with crazy high accuracy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-05-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on those parses I think avoidance is overpowered.  But perhaps we'll see more stuff with higher to hit which would limit the effect of avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some stuff in GoD has idiotically high to hit rates, kyv's being the worst offenders.  OoW versions are wussed down though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They tuned down the psycho Kyvs quite a while ago.  I remember I had a log where a Kyv named in KT missed me 3 times during a 2 minute fight using evasive.  Parry/dodge/riposte stlil works fine though (in fact I probably parried 3 times as much as I was missed).  Maybe Kyvs still have an elevated to hit but nothing like 1% miss rate under evasive like it was before.<br />
<br />
Still, since Warrior tanking is usually built around paranoia (what if this mob doesn't miss?  what if it has insane attack?), until the days mob get tactical mastery it's good to know you have some defensive mods that mob can't get around.</div></div><hr />
