<br />
 The solution is available on foh guildboard and no doubt elsewhere but I noticed no reference to it here so thought would post for others. :p<br />
<br />
In eqclient change UseUmbra=False to True or delete the line entirely - apparently it's an artifact of old programming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, this happened to 2 of my chars who were logged in PoK - I deleted the pok files and repatched.. still no dice. Then I deleted every file with Baadan or Heelyourknees in the name (the 2 chars logged in PoK) and things were better, it seems the .OPT and .DAT files were the problem. Once I got back in, pressing the Height Filter button on the Map Window while in PoK would cause me to crash, but deleting the pok map files and repatching fixed this.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip, it's quite a bit less hassle than what I went through last night.<br />
<br />
Is it any better making it =TRUE than deleting it?</div></div><hr />

It didn't work well for everyone at first so the suggestion was to disable it (Useumbra=false) if you had problems.<br />
<br />
Now though I think they fixed it all so no reason to have that in the ini file anymore. Default (if deleted) would be TRUE I believe.</div></div><hr />
