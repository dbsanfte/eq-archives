<br />
its a 7ish min fight like all the named in VT. hes got a small ae silence so u have to range heal, dont remember him hitting that hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">iirc: has about a million hitpoints and quads for 1000.</div></div><hr />

Back when I first started going to VT we wiped more to TVK than any other boss there. Every other boss we killed first try. He isn't that bad mind you but I think he is harder than most bosses there with the exception of the twin blobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">he's one of the few bosses that can wipe your raid only because of the adds and repops involved.<br />
<br />
best way to do him is to pull trash to the first room, then when only he and his two guards are left, single pull him and tank him out in the hall, in one of the corners (near the doors to the side halls), might need to walk him to the corner to give pullers more room.<br />
<br />
also it's best to be prepared for an unexpected Kelun add while killing trash in the first room...</div></div><hr />

Adds out the arse, tanks dropping because the psycho clerics got too close and ate a silence, and the rangers lived! Once we got things stabilized though it became a long drawn out slugfest in the corner.....that is to say a typical Luclin fight.</div></div><hr />

If you are having problems with rampage, have your rogues check out their POP poisons... there's a 60+ dex debuff one that stacks with cripple, and possibly a bard dex debuff IIRC...<br />

TVK owns at that level and is awesome. We also pulled him to the entrance room and killed him with usually 10 mins to spare b4 repop. Hes so close to DXXT coth and drops awesome loot for a prepop boss.</div></div><hr />

No there not and VT is gimp.</div></div><hr />

VT creates a sturdy CC team in your guild, finetunes your tanks' reflexes and reactions to unexpected encounters, also makes your pullers better.<br />
<br />
you're not the quickest of cats, are you Beeffy. seeing that you don't have your VT key and all...</div></div><hr />

If you needed VT for that good for you =).  But VT is a pile of shit. Whether i have the key or not it still is.<br />
<br />
=)<br />
<br />
also i guess i can understand when you call VT gimp some people actually get offended or take it personally, i mean after spending so much time in 1 place, i guess its like trashing on your home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skycrasher</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">vt is a great rvr and yields tons of upgrades for people if you're still in your first 5 or 10 trips.<br />
<br />
after that, and if you're in elemental, it's kind of a waste of time imo. but pre-ep it's orgasmic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Necro cothing to Aten still owns for almost all Atens loot ( BP, Earring, Robe, Tunics….. gloves…..) unless your guild has cleared time 8348473783478 times. Cothing basically to 4 named + TVK for free easy fast loot late night with 1 or 2 groups for friends is awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TVK is probably the hardest mob in VT except for the Aten Blobs.  That's not to say that he's very hard though.  The main issue is if you can get him killed before the 200 mobs respawn in his room.  I think he's generally a 20-30 min fight with 40ish people.  We rarely get him down without at least a couple respawns, and then you have to fight respawns while doing loot, but he's not that hard.  I don't recall wiping to him more than once since we got into VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are few places in eq where you can get the amount &amp; quality of loots that you can in just a few hours in vt - it most certainly is not a &quot;pile of shit&quot; loot wise &amp; it does help your guild learn discipline cause no one wants to fuk up &amp; cause a coffin cr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, yeah, I don't think VT is a piece of crap.  It means huge upgrades for all classes and really enables your guild to progress in the game.  For our major VT run (our Aten run), we clear 6-7 mobs, get about 20-25 pieces of loot, and usually do it within about 2-3 hours.  That's about half to 1/3 (depending on turn out), of everyone on the raid getting something.  I don't know of anywhere else pre-elemental that you can reap those kinds of rewards for that many people in that amount of time.  Plus as other posters pointed out it sharpens much needed raiding/boss mob skills.<br />
<br />
As for TVK I think we pull him to where we port into as well.  This avoids repops in his area.  I'm pretty sure we did him last Wednesday when the server lag was just HORRID.  I mean, we would all attack a few times, then stop.  I don't even know if he hit our MT hehe.  It was terrible, took FOREVER too.  It must have been him.  Sometimes all the darn names in VT blend together for me though hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a zone, VT sucks.  Everything has too many hitpoints, making crawling through the zone take forever.  All the rooms look the same, all the mobs look the same (except Aten/Mini-Aten, which is a cool model).  The bosses look exactly like the yard trash.  Every fight is pretty much a straight up MT/CH chain fight where all the melees go AFK and make a sandwich during the fights.  No boss in there is interesting or challenging to kill.  <br />
<br />
I do believe it is worth doing though.  Crawl zones with lots of big bosses and lots of loot are great for gearing up your guild, and Aten's loot is decent even by elemental standards.  It's not necessary to get to the elementals, but if there are already multiple guilds in the elementals, or you just have a guild full of people you want to get gear for, then VT is pretty good bang for the buck (at least after everyone has their shards hehe).<br />
<br />
we clear 6-7 mobs, get about 20-25 pieces of loot, and usually do it within about 2-3 hours.<br />
<br />
I wish we could clear it in 2-3 hours.  Last raid took 6 hours to kill Aten, and that was faster than average for us.  We only had 41 people though, and I'm sure an elemental guild can clear yard trash faster than we can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigrr7th</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forged PR for your tanks(A Bard in group helps) or you'll need someone chain curing to counter  the Greater Shadow Poison. (Snare+Slow, procced almost every hit.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I agree with everything you just said about  VT Brutul!  What we do is CoH to one named.  Then we do a necro/ghetto CoH to another.  That whole thing probably takes us about 90 minutes.  Not the fight, just getting everyone to VT, CoHing to the first boss, fighting the first boss, CoHing to the next boss.  Once we start that second named though, its strait killing from there and takes us about 2-3 hours.  So all in all its about a 4.5 to 5 hour raid.  I'm not quite sure what/where we coh or jump to, although I do know that the last several mobs all lead up to Aten Ha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ralic</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you here,I think Kelun is another challenging fight after EMP at Luclin.<br />
Here comes out another question..<br />
Will your guild kill him after you could kill Aten?..<br />
Tons of 4arms stay in his floor even more then Aten's floor ,I would be many thanks if we  can skip him during VT cleaning fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veldriss</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to kill Kelun otherwise you cannot progress to Aten.</div></div><hr />

You have to kill Kelun otherwise you cannot progress to Aten.  <br />
Thanks to all :),today my guild has took him down..<br />
We are still looking for a safer spot at his floor to set up our coth mage.<br />
I think there's warder blocking the progression,but could ppls just coth to TXD or DXVT if they do camp a mage there?.</div></div><hr />
