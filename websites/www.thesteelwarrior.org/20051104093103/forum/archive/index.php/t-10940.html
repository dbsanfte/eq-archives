<br />
I'm a dwarf warrior noob (lvl 1 - just got the game) in search for &quot;must-do&quot; starting quests (rather, gear-focused starting quests).<br />
I looked on many WoW-quests sites, but it seems none allows per-class Xref search. Which would you recommend from lvl1 to lvl10?<br />
<br />
Of course, I'll also look for myself, no worry... it's a game, after all   :) <br />
I just thought as warriors seem very dependent on gear, I'd ask for some &quot;how to start a warrior and enjoy it&quot; advice.<br />
<br />
I apologise for posting something that has probably been done a thousand times already (I guess...) but I couldn't find much myself (the fact I'm a rather clumsy searcher sure didn't help).<br />
<br />

Just pick up the newbie quests, follow the story lines, you'll have plenty of quests to do and will level up very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guili99</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, yes, of course.<br />
I was merely asking which quests would help me get basic gear, really (like weapons/armour/bags, for a start)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthax</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do every single quest you see.  Regardless of rewards, they will always be the best source of experience and will guide you towards the best areas and zones for your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe at lvl10 the Warrior trainers in Ironforge and Stormwind will give you quests that reward you with either a 1h Mace or 1h Sword.  You can do both the quests.  Remember to get your defensive stance quest done at 10, should be given by a class trainer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is this one lowbie warrior quest i remember given by the trainer in Goldshire (Elwynn Forest). You'll have to talk to a guy in Stormwind then go help an old veteran retrieve something from a named bandit. You'll get a choice of weapon as reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guili99</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks. I'll figure that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best quest reward I've found isnt until your 30's when you get the Whirlwind Axe.  Thats a tough one to replace.</div></div><hr />

The only bag quests I'm aware of aren't available until you're in the 20s.  As far as basic gear is concerned, from level 1 to level 10 you could pretty much walk around naked using a sharp stick and still do fine.  It isn't until the mid teens that gear starts to become a concern.</div></div><hr />

You can actually get a quest in your 11-13 ish to make a Kodo Skin Bag.  From one of the LW's in TB.  Only one I know of until later on, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miron</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I wouldn't worry about gear until you're 55+. The only way you can go after a specific piece of gear is through the auction house because of the world drop system. You'll also probaly be doing a huge majority of the quests so you'll be getting the gear from those too.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even recommend setting your eyes on any gear until you're 55+. By the time you actually find it you'll get a better piece that randomly drops off some wolf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guili99</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all!<br />
I actually did a few quests so far (6 o 7) and there's one I cannot seem to fulfill (although seems rather easy). I have to distract the guard in the Thumbrew (?) tavern in Karadhros by buying him a beer. That I have done and he goes away for a few minutes.<br />
Now there's a barrel I have (for another quest) that I must place in the cellar while he's away and I can't figure out how to do that. I tried right clicking the barrel, or take it and put it among other barrels, but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Any idea? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Wave your mouse over the barrels in the inn until you get a gear thing, then click the gear thing and it automatically places the barrell from your inventory into it and you get credit.  You'll have to buy the guy another drink to distract him again, though.<br />
<br />
Btw the way I went after gear was to grind a bit of $ and buy a few upgrades from the AH.  YMMV tho, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WackenOpenAir</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few facts to start with:<br />
<br />
-The first 30 levels go so fast, equipment will only be usefull for a few hours at best. After that, it is outdated.<br />
<br />
-When you are lvl 60, 1 gold is nothing, when you are level 10, it is a fortune.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you want to RPG all quests and see whatever stories there are etc, you could try to do all quests. If however you want to play efficient, do the following:<br />
<br />
Take all quests when you enter an area. Move out to the place where you can do the nearest quest, killing everything on your way there. Then move on to another closeby quest, again killing everything on your way there. Do some quests that are not too far like this and keep killing everything on your path. <br />
When you return to the city and turn in the quests, you most likely have some of those quests remaining that were too distant, too difficult or even require you to go to another area. You can drop these now, or just drop them when your list is full and you need space for more quests as you start doing the same thing in another are. <br />
Just do not spend too much time on one quest. Do not focus on only the quests, but kill everything you see while moving around for the quests.<br />
<br />
Before level 30, gold is not important to treasure because soon it will be an insignificant amount. Items are not important because they will quickly be outdated. <br />
Therefore, focus on the experience, not on material. The gold you do have, just spend it on some items as you like. You don't have to keep searching for the best items at your level. Don't waste time on it. If you find your damage to lack, go to AH or nearest store, buy a weapon and move on.<br />
<br />
After level 30, you can start saving all your gold to buy a mount at level 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly i'd suggest not buying anything on AH at all until 40, at least. Because you'll want the money for a mount. Of course, this doesn't mean cut short on abilities! If you do instances and all the quests, you'll have plenty of gear though. <br />
<br />
Not sure about dwarf, but for night elves there is plenty of quests, starting in Teldrassil(1-10), then Darkshore(10-18/20), then moving on to Ashenvale and then Stonetalon. Of course the zones aren't the same for dwarves, but i'm sure it's something similar. You don't need to be doing much research yet(except for instances, which you should look into soon), just do all the quests. They will provide you with exp, plenty of gear, and move you into the next areas. This should last you for a while.<br />
<br />
What some people do is move into areas far from home and do quests for a different faction in addition to the ones they have at home, but i haven't had a need to do that until 30</div></div><hr />
