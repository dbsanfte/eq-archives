<br />
P.S. any suggestions for gear i can buy? i have money rollin in like there's no 2morrow right now. so i dont mind buying stuff or questing. Thx  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your haste is good, as are your weapons, so dont mess with them at all.<br />
<br />
assuming you have less than 50k to work with, here are a few thoughts<br />
<br />
boots- kingly boots of knightly splendor<br />
neck- amulet of mummy wrappings<br />
face- face mask of frozen mana<br />
ear1- solstice kit<br />
ear2- fine for now<br />
legs- kylong shinguards<br />
<br />
if you werent agnostic (dont worry i made that mistake too ...), i would reccomend cultural.  since you're not, you might want to look into kizrak's (ornate) for hard to upgrade slots such as arms and bracers (and potentially helm).<br />
<br />
if you really are rolling in boatloads of cash here's a pretty comprehensive list of very pricey items which are very very good:<br />
<br />
*helmet of rallos zek<br />
*2 crystallized acid bracers<br />
*2 steel rings of earthen resilience<br />
*bloodied boots of dark rites<br />
*warlords steel gauntlets<br />
*black plated collar (good)<br />
*amygdalan chain mask<br />
*elemental bow<br />
*blade of carnage<br />
*2 bloodmetal earrings of engagement<br />
*ornate Breastplate mold<br />
*ornate legs mold</div></div><hr />

<br />
P.S.how much HP/AC should i have at 58? Ding 58 btw! lol<br />
<br />
P.S.S. my hp is now 3455 and my ac is 1105 unbuffed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">solstice kit gives you an amazing hp/sta/resist earing for less than 5k on most servers.  its probably the best investment out there for ANY class .. not just casters for the FT.<br />
<br />
i would look to the:<br />
*amulet of mummy wrappings<br />
*face mask of frozen mana<br />
*solstice kit<br />
as your first upgrades if youre hard up on cash.  they are generally very cheap.  especially on crowded servers where you have lots of ldons going on.<br />
<br />
the boots and legs are wonderful items, and great upgrades as well, but i have no idea how much cash you have banked presently (ie how much youre starting from).  bracers need some serious consideration as per ac/hps, but honestly there is nothing cheap buyable for agnostics (once again i feel your pain).  youre hps are strong .. and if you can upgrades boots/legs/mask/ear to the suggested above youre hps will jump considerably.<br />
<br />
ldon is probably your best bet for cash atm, unless you like to farm or can think of some really good cash/gem/sellables camps.   perhaps droga camping (the named) could also provide good gear.<br />
<br />
ps- check out the bracers i have in my magelo.  they are both 1 groupable .. one form plane of mischeif killing a named on a ph system and the other from an old velious quest.  they are quite good for time investment and will last you a good long while.</div></div><hr />

You are fine for your level.  There are also a lot of good options for gear upgrades in the 10k+ range for you.  Check out my earrings, you can pickup a set of them for the price of a single bloodmetal earring usually.  Also I am thinking of steelslave bladed boots, I've seen them in the under 10k range, also kingly boots of splendor, the steelslave have much higher ac but the kingly boots have the hps.  Ornate bracers, at least on my server, go for around 40k and would be really nice upgrades for you, also rock molded wristguards are really nice and quite a bit less.  Check out my magelo for some ideas.  Some of my gear is a lot more than 10k, but a lot of it is within your range.<br />

The magelo profile URL in your board signature leads to my primary character (21159 = Onetree, a wood elf druid on maelin). Please change it to *your* character's magelo profile URL. To do that just replace 21159 with 625375 in your board signature.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">non deity cultural may not be as good as the RZ / Tribunal stuff, but its not bad either.<br />
<br />
Replace your bracers with 2x non-imbued dwarven cultural bracers (think its called brellium platemail).  25AC 30HPs and 6 svall is a big upgrade for you and should be about 3-5k each.  I'd look for boots and vambs from the same set.  Once those 4 slots are done you're gear will be in pretty good shape.<br />
<br />
To see if you are on track aim for about 20ac per level (1kAC at lvl 50, 1200AC at lvl 60, 1300AC at lvl65).  That will probably put you slightly ahead of the game for a non-raiding warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's another, more general test for how to tell if you are on target with your AC/hps/gear. Pay attention when you join a pick-up group that has a couple of players you've grouped with before. If in greeting you they say things like, &quot;Woot! Now we have a tank!&quot; You're good to go. If, on the other hand, part way through a session you start getting tells from your cleric like, &quot;You like leading with your chin, don't you?&quot; Then it's time to upgrade.<br />
More directly, if you're grouping with guildmate healers who are experienced players, simply ask them whether, relatively speaking, it's hard to keep you alive compared to other tanks.<br />
Here are three things that are always true about experienced/decent healers:<br />
1. You are always naked before your healer. You cannot hide much from them.<br />
2. An experienced healer will always know more about your relative mitigation than you do.<br />
3. Your healer is always right when he says he needs a med break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do u think u'd be able to do the same thing for HP plz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor Gnawbones</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hahaha, love your analogy Brabble.  I play both a 65 warrior and a 65 cleric and know what you speak of.  Generally what I was told to aim for when growing up was for Lvl 60 is 4k HP and 1200 AC.  The rule of 20 AC per level works well for a non-raiding tank.  Well not an everyday raiding tank that is.  Current goal is to push myself to 5500 HP and 1500 AC.  Got a long road ahead of me, but in Gerick's words I'm gonna leave a bloody trail getting there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pisco_ssour</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm.. well if that's what i should be aiming for then i guess i'm doin ok... i hvae 3.5k hp and about 1100 AC.... the only probi s that i'm lvling really fast cause i'm groupin with guildies in CoD so i get 1% per kill... i guess i gotta slow down and start questing and attending more raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
update your magelo and see where you stand. it's quick, easy, and painless.<br />
<br />
just look for your class and compare against all servers, or include just your servers info. Look at those above and below you and see where you fit in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pisco_ssour</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DAMN! thx! i never knew or heard of that site. thx a million!</div></div><hr />
