<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I picked up a Zek Crested Buckler the other night just to play around with it.  We did a small raid in storms to collect pieces for flag quests for some of our younger guildies, so I decided to break it out and see how well it worked.  Can't link it right now (damned proxy server), but it's AC 38, +str, sta and hps, and has furious bash II.  <br />
I used it for a while just to see how it worked, and didnt notice any real problems with SotB main and shield off until our friendly neighborhood BST showed up late and joined the raid.  He slowed while in melee and got pasted.   I went back to dual wield and had no problems.  <br />
My question is this:  What sort of weapon would I have to be using for my DPS not to completely suck, and are some of the better FB shields enough better aggro wise to warrant using them?  Unless there are weapon and shield combos light years better than what I was using, or mobs that hit so damned hard a shield is really beneficial, I can't see using a shield....well...pretty much ever.<br />
This is  mainly because my initial aggro wasnt bad, but later in the fight, one slip up got one of my buddies, who's used to my dual wield aggro, pasted.  I'd welcome any input on this that any of you might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Opps. Meant to post this in the bunker, and got distracted by a problem at work. If an admin could move it I'd appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't see using a shield....well...pretty much ever.Bingo. When you are tanking, the most important thing is agro. Holding agro while wearing a shield is no good for agro. Like someone mentioned in the other FB thread, the only real time it would be beneficial is when rampage tanking since keeping agro is not a concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">or offtanking in a raid, only reason I even carry my stormraiders carapiece in my bag still</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PinaduzRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I switch to shield after disc goes down when tanking mobs in Time.  Have never lost aggro on any of the named, and the extra AC helps, especially as some gain strength as their health goes down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can shield swap with a FB shield....its tedious but it does seem to add some extra agro (my subjective opinion).  On perma rooted mobs where you can chain incite before hand its a nice MT tool as well.</div></div><hr />
