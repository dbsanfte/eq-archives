My older ATI RAd All-in-Wonder pro runs just fine. I can load and play in some zones but not in PoP and others. It will even stall out and make the video fail and I have to reboot the computer. any one eles having issues withthe ATI Rad 7500 cards?. I have tried EVERY THING, except reloading Win XP. Have a real clean machine as well, no AD-Ware or Virus, even reloaded EQ from scrath.  ATI 7500, Athlon 1900+ 1 gb ram. DSL and a 1.2 gig Athon with 1.25 megs. Always ran sweet before patch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkwurm</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Friend of mine that has that card and was able to fix his problems by adding the following to the defaults section of the eqclient.ini: <br />
<br />
Vsync=1 <br />
HarwareTnL=FALSE <br />
VertexShaders=FALSE <br />
<br />
<br />
May or may not help your problems though, or you may not need all those.</div></div><hr />

Most know that all ATI Radions are DX9 compatable. EQ who supports the ATI line in their programing has messed up not ATI. I have no problems so far in playing any othe game that supports the new DX9b protacals but thank you for the advice, its the thought that counts and the taking of yout time to respond to my request for help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donbe Mesinwitm</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding those lines fix evey thing . Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">some of us are indignant about replacing our ATI cards simply because of their eq problems and the reasoning goes something like this.<br />
<br />
they do support dx9 or else i wouldnt be playing right now. all other applications work fine with the ATI (for me anyway). and if i get a new card that works better for eq then it might NOT work for another application. then we can go to the other application's website and see somebody offer the advice &quot;what you need to do is scrap that card of yours and invest in an ATI&quot; ... oh you just KNOW somebody is going to tell me that.<br />
<br />
as for adding those lines to the eqclient file this is what we call &quot;people on the message boards offering us debug solutions because sony couldnt figure it out.&quot; shame on sony but three cheers to those on the boards who are actually solving some of our problems.<br />
<br />
my ati has poor lag performance now but ive been sluggish to work out a solution because i can tell many lag problems in game are server side and are affecting everyone. when they fix those problems they may fix my framerate problem too. ... or they may not. maybe after they get tired working out the bugs ill go and try to take out the last few performance issues myself for example by trying the changes in the eqclient.ini suggested above. every time i try a change to that i have unexpected problems that take hours at my computer to fix. like the time i tried a suggested driver and discovered that it was for xp (and i have 98) and in my attempt to install it i wiped out my driver for the next 2 hours. (note to self ... label your installation disks).<br />
<br />
by the way here is another reason i believe there is no dx9 compatibility problem with the radeon. the frame rate may be very sluggish in some zones but in other zones there is no problem whatsoever with framerate. it CAN be made to work. it just hasnt been consistently yet across zones.</div></div><hr />
