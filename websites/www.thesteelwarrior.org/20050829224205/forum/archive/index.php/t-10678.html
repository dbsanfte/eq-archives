1) Introduction<br />
<br />
Pulling is the act of ideally bringing a managable number of mobs (NPCs/non-player characters you kill for experience and loot) to your party’s stationary location (often called a camp) to minimize risk and maximize gain.<br />
<br />
This guide will provide a general insight into pulling in World of Warcraft, and specific insight into effectively pulling all three instances of the Scarlet Monastery. Provided that your group is not only fairly skilled but appropriately leveled, you should encounter few difficulties.<br />
<br />
Also, a quest index is in the works. I'm considering adding some lore if anyone contributes some good stuff.<br />
<br />
If you have any additions, please let me know and I will of course give you credit. I may delete extraneous or redundant posts to keep this thread clean.<br />
<br />
 If you have any questions, I ask that you first read this guide carefully and ensure that your question is not answered in here.<br />
<br />
2) General Theory and Strategy<br />
<br />
Before you get started with Scarlet Monastery, look up the appropriate quests on thottbot (http://www.thottbot.com) or allakhazam (http://wow.allakhazam.com) or another good site. The biggest quest is In the Name of the Light for Alliance and Into the Scarlet Monastery for Horde. Aside from the minor prereqs, you’ll have to kill the four bosses to complete the quest. However, the rewards are quite nice, both from the quest and along the way.<br />
<br />
There are a few schools of thought on pulling.<br />
<br />
Some believe that a hunter is the end all, be all of pulling. Massive damage from range plus feign death and a decent HP and armor are quite valuable, but they are not necessary in most instances. In my experience only the most difficult places – like Molten Core – require the tools of a hunter.<br />
<br />
Others believe that ranged attacks aren’t important at all, that a paladin is good enough. Generally this is the case if the paladin and the corresponding group are quality players. However, you may run into places where a ranged attack would be handy.<br />
<br />
In my opinion – and it’s just that, my opinion – a well-played warrior is a worthy puller in most instances. Not only can a pulling warrior benefit from initial aggro at the start of a fight, using Charge will provide some rage from the start. Of course, sometimes using a ranged weapon to pull is best, but you can Charge in many cases and do fine – discretion is key here. Also, very rarely will mobs have to be split – you’ll have multiples no matter what you do, and a solid group can handle multiples with ease.<br />
<br />
Whatever class pulls, a very important factor is the skill and awareness of the player that’s pulling. I’ve seen mages pull incredibly well and had zero problems dumping off aggro to a tank.<br />
<br />
Another big factor is not only the level of the puller but the level of the group. Your aggro radius – the invisible circle around you that tells a mob to attack you once breached – is higher or lower depending on your relative level. A level 1 character will have an insanely high aggro radius in SM, for example. This is why it is generally good for the puller to be a high level, and for lower level characters to keep some distance from surrounding mobs and the puller.<br />
<br />
Don’t be afraid to bring a cluster mobs back – give yourself some room to avoid roamers.<br />
<br />
You should pull quickly enough to yield experience and loot at an efficient clip. Too many and you run the risk of wiping or needless downtime; too few and your group is soon bored. Most instances are not difficult to efficiently pull – if you’re smart, rarely will you fight more than 3 mobs at a time. Rogue sap, mage poly, priest charm – all handy for reducing the number of mobs you fight at one time.<br />
<br />
That leads me into group composition. WoW allows some flexibility in group composition, and a talented group can do much regardless of class breakdown, but I have very good experience with myself as the lead tank, at least one mage for poly and counterspell (nice when pulling enemy mages), and either a stud paladin or a priest for healing. The rest of the classes are pretty much up to you - raw DPS classes like rogues and hunters are arguably more efficient. A second mage for more DPS and an extra poly is definitely welcome.<br />
<br />
Priests often like to charm NPC priests. This is a great strategy - it neutralizes one mob and allows the priest to use the NPC's mana to heal your party. Just keep an eye out for when MC breaks - a taunt plus a quick sunder/revenge/shield bash is your friend.<br />
<br />
And last, but certainly not least, most of the regular mobs in here will flee once low on health. Hamstring, Judgment of Justice, etc. - do what ya gotta do to stop runners.<br />
<br />
3) Mob Index<br />
<br />
Note that, like most instances, all of the mobs are elite.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Gallant - lvl 33-34<br />
<br />
These are among the first mobs you will encounter in the Library. They're paladins - they don't do much but melee and hit you with holy attacks. Cake.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Adept - lvl 33-34<br />
<br />
Priests that heal for 800 and hit you with holy damage. I kill them first.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Beastmaster - lvl 34-35<br />
<br />
Hunters. Annoying because they sometimes don't like to follow you to camp. Accompanied by a hound.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Tracking Hound - lvl 33-34<br />
<br />
Dags? Oh, DOGS. Yeah, I like dags. I like trailers even more.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Diviner - level 34-35<br />
<br />
Fire mages. Moderately annoying. Counterspell rules them. I place high priority on them.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Monk - lvl 35-36<br />
<br />
Barehanded fighting specialists. Thorns or any kind of damage shield rock these guys. They put out decent DPS but I generally place low priority on them.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Chaplain - level 34-36<br />
<br />
Buffer versions of Adepts. I kill them quickly. They appear in every instance.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Soldier - level 35-36<br />
<br />
Warriors with shields. Not much to em.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Evoker - level 36-37<br />
<br />
Fire mages. They have an annoying AE fire damage shield. Kill them fast.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Guardsman - level 36-37<br />
<br />
Warriors with polearms who like to disarm.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Protector - level 36-37<br />
<br />
Upgraded Scarlet paladins.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Conjuror - level 35-36<br />
<br />
Fire mages who can summon level 35-36 fire elementals. They should die quickly.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Myrmidon - level 37-38<br />
<br />
Warriors who dual wield.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Sorceror - level 37-38<br />
<br />
Frost mages.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Wizard - level 38-39.<br />
<br />
Fire mages. They have fire shields as well.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Centurion - level 38-39<br />
<br />
Standard warrior mobs.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Champion - level 39-40<br />
<br />
Paladins with two handed maces and Holy Strike.<br />
<br />
-Scarlet Abbot - level 39-40<br />
<br />
Highest level normal priests in SM.<br />
<br />
-Bosses are listed in their respective instances.<br />
<br />
4) Pulling the Library<br />
<br />
The library is the first instance in SM. Most of the mobs are around level 34.<br />
<br />
Once you’re in the monastery interior, it is the upper right instance with an open archway, no door. <br />
<br />
An exact breakdown of the library (or most parts of every instance) isn’t necessary; basically you just pull in twos or threes, keeping an eye out for roamers and making sure nothing runs (at least not at full speed). The first courtyard can be dangerous if lower level characters don’t hug the walls – you can easily aggro several beastmasters and their hounds.<br />
<br />
There are two pathways off the courtyard here – the side entrance leads to Houndmaster Loksey (level 34) and his three hounds, while the other proceeds further into the library.<br />
<br />
Loksey is the easiest of the four bosses required for the chief SM quest. It’s straightforward – just let a tank lead and burn stuff down however you wish. If you’re underleveled or sloppy, you can wipe, but the chances of that are low.<br />
<br />
Through a few long halls you’ll encounter a staple room format – generally there is a pair of guards at the entrance/exit with a group of two or three mobs on either side. The book Mythology of the Titans (for an Ironforge quest, starts in the Hall of Explorers) is in one of these rooms.<br />
<br />
Basically you keep going through long halls and staple rooms until you see a large circular room guarded by two monks. Be wary – Arcanist Doan is in here.<br />
<br />
Doan (level 37)  is a fairly strong mage. He throws out a variety of spells appropriate to his level, including polymorph. At half health, he throws out an AoE fire that radiates from him – casters and the like may want to hang back when he says, &quot;burn in righteous fire!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doan drops some good stuff – a nice rod (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3228) for casters/priests, a dagger (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4015) with decent DPS and int, and a decent cloth mantle (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3213). Also in Doan’s room is a chest with the Scarlet Key – you will need this to access the other two instances.<br />
<br />
5) Pulling the Armory<br />
<br />
The armory is a bit more difficult than the library. Not only are mobs generally closer to each other, you’ll have to contend with several roamers. Again, keep your wits about you and it won’t be hard.<br />
<br />
Guardsmen like to disarm you, and Myrmidons dual wield. You’ll also run into some warlocks. Otherwise, mobs are similar to the library except they average around 36-38.<br />
<br />
The armory is the righthand door, just left of the library. Mouse over the door and you should see Armory in the tooltip. You'll need the Scarlet Key from Doan's chamber to open this door.<br />
<br />
The path is fairly straightforward – again, be patient and watch out for roamers and you’ll be fine. It is fairly long the first time but it’s difficult to get lost. Most mobs are in bunches of two or three.<br />
<br />
Herod (level 40) is at the end of the line in an arena behind a door. He is a strong warrior with a lot of HP and a devastating AE attack (think of a super Whirlwind). Whenever he says, “Blades of Light,” everyone but the tank may want to move out of melee range for a few swings. Otherwise, Herod does as a warrior does.<br />
<br />
Once your tank charges Herod, your casters and priests may want to move directly across from the entrance, staying up on the platform instead of going down to the arena floor. Once Herod dies, a bunch of cadets will rush the room from the entrance. They have very low HP but there’s a lot of them and they can wax a mage pretty quick. AE attacks work well here.<br />
<br />
Herod’s loot table is nice. He drops a solid mail helm (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3797) and shoulder (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3612), as well as a 37 DPS 2h axe (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4578) with a nice AE attack. He also drops Scarlet Leggings (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4441) for those of you looking for a full set (or not).<br />
<br />
6) Pulling the Chapel<br />
<br />
The chapel is definitely the most difficult instance. Not only are the average mobs just under level 40, they’re packed in tightly with quite a few roamers. However, again, just be patient and you’ll clear this easily.<br />
<br />
The chapel is the lefthand door, left of the armory. Mouse over the door and you should see Chapel in your tooltip. You'll need the Scarlet Key to open this door, too.<br />
<br />
The first long hallway is straightforward – just march through and kill. The next part is a bit trickier. I recommend that everyone but the puller hang back at the wall opposite of the opening to the garden. The puller should check out the garden and bring some roamers inside. Note that you may have to get out of a mage’s line of sight if you want him or her to come to you.<br />
<br />
You don’t have to clear everything here if you don’t want – just make a bit of room so your people can go to the central fountain. You may want to stick to one side, otherwise you may end up with four or more mobs at once. It doesn’t matter which side you pick, each is roughly as risky and rewarding as the other.<br />
<br />
Up the stairs, you’ll likely have to pull a few mobs so your group can jump in the fountain up here. Then, just clear out the stuff on the way to the chapel doors. You may want to grab the roamers on both sides as well – they may add at an inconvenient time.<br />
<br />
Once the way to the chapel doors is clear, bring your party to the steps and tell them to hold there. When you’re ready, open the door and look at all the mobs inside. There’s a lot of them, but if your people hang back and you play smart, it’ll be cake.<br />
<br />
There’s definitely a methodology here. I generally grab a roamer and an extra mob to the immediate left and right before tacking the four mobs in the center. Note that these four don’t have to be pulled at once – you can grab em in pairs from range. Afterwards, it’s pretty much whatever you want to do. I’ve found that, as long as you’re not incredibly low level, you can clear the middle or the sides as you like. One note I will make is that one of the rows in the center is comprised of three mobs. Grab the lone mob on the right and you should only have a pull of two; aggro either one of the mobs on the left and you’ll have three.<br />
<br />
One thing I'll note is that the mages here like to use AE spells. You may want to fight these away from your casters.<br />
<br />
Be very careful that you do not aggro Mograine right now – he’ll call all of the mobs remaining to his side, which will likely result in a wipe.<br />
<br />
Once the central area and the immediate sides are cleared, I start to work on the right wing. There’s generally a patroller around here, then three mobs against the right wall. Then, there’s a room with one mob, usually a monk. Alongside the left wall of this room is a candle – open it for a secret passage. Inside is High Inquisitor Fairbanks (level 40), an undead priest. He’s not too difficult, but his Curse of Blood is annoying. He usually drops three random green items.<br />
<br />
On the other side – and take the long way around Mograine to be sure that you don’t aggro him – are more of the same. There’s a couple rooms here with a few mobs each.<br />
<br />
Once everything in the chapel is dead, rebuff and med up to full mana, then have your tank charge Mograine (level 42). He’s a pretty standard paladin boss. He likes to use a shield which makes him invulnerable but he doesn’t heal himself much, if ever.<br />
<br />
Once Mograine dies, Whitemane (level 42) will charge out of the doors Mograine was facing when you attacked him. You might want to have your casters and ranged attackers move to the room she comes out of. Charge her and take her down. She’s a priest boss; among other annoyances, she likes to charm.<br />
<br />
Once Whitemane is brought to half life, she will sleep your party. She will then resurrect Mograine, heal herself, then both will charge you. I generally take out Whitemane first, making sure the tank has solid aggro on Mograine as well. Afterwards, it’s just a matter of waxing Mograine again.<br />
<br />
Both of these mobs drop good loot. Mograine’s best drop is his shield (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3653), but his 2h mace (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3567) is quite nice as well. Like Herod, he drops Scarlet Leggings. Whitemane’s biggest winners are her cloth cap (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3491), a caster/priest/paladin amulet (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3205), and a 1h mace (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=7662) w/bonuses to healing effects.<br />
<br />
Usually there is a locked chest in the room Whitemane came out of.<br />
<br />
Nothing to it.<br />
<br />
7) Conclusion/Acknowledgments<br />
<br />
SM is a very good instance in terms of risk/reward. Learn how to pull it and you will be invaluable for a good portion of your time in WoW.<br />
<br />
I must recognize Unstoppable for giving me a general idea of how to pull the chapel. Also, props to Solly, Bremmin, Bloodrose, and Pfil for bearing with me as I learned how to pull each instance.</div></div><hr />

http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=4578<br />
<br />
Of course by that I mean he uses the effect whether or not he's going to drop the axe or not. I'm just going by the observation that everytime he uses his AE melee he does it 3 times in a row.</div></div><hr />

He's got a super whirlwind attack.  Bastage.  I think his shout for using it is &quot;Blades of light!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first time killing herod on sunday and he droped i think it was called the Ravenger or something. but i rolled and won it its a decent weopon but its effect is   more like whirlwind for warriors. on chance of hit a channel bar that deceases goes and your guystarts spinning around attacking serveral targets very useful in big groups of mobs attacks up to 9 opponents i think also very nice when dueling a mage or warlock and or priest because i tried this yesturday and they always use some kind of fear on you but if u hit whirlwind which for some reason most of the time i do you become immune and just wack at them knocking thier life down enough for me to use excute and finish the job..</div></div><hr />
