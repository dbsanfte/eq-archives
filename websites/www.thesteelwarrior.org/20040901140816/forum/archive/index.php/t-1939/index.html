<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Rather than stating the obvious points about warrior taunt lacking in the face of spell casting hybrids, I 'd like to take this discussion in a slightly different direction by discussing what exactly it is that defines each of the melee classes. <br />
<br />
Monks are skilled fighters that hone their body into a deadly weapon.  To this end they get class-defining abilities such as dragon punch, flying kick etc which allow them to inflict a lot of damage. They also get utility in the shape of mend and most importantly feign death, a skill that makes them the most skilled pullers in the game. In a pinch they are able to tank, but they don't solo well. Their equipment can help them inflict more damage  and protect them on a pull but even with their bare fists they are quite powerfull.<br />
<br />
Rogues are a heavy damage group oriented class. They use piercing weapons and poisons as befits the role of an assassin. They gain the unique ability to backstab which allows them to inflict massive amounts of damage without expending mana. They gain unique abilities such as pick lock, disarm trap and hide and sneak. Rogues are as good as unable to solo and they cannot tank well at all. A rogue is dependant on weapons for damage but can function in average armor. <br />
<br />
Rangers are a mix of the druid and warrior class. They can track prey and are skilled with bows. As they grow in level they develop into a powerfull offensive class. They gain a lot of utility in the shape of their spells and unique abilities such as track and forage. They can heal themsleves, snare and fear animals. If they choose their targets carefully, they are quite capable of soloing. In a group they can tank at lower lvls but not at higher lvls. They can function in our outside a group in fairly average armor as long as their weapons are quite good and they have their spells. <br />
<br />
Paladins are a mix of the cleric and warrior class. Their role defines them as holy knights. To this end they gain the ability to lay on hands, which unfortunately has very limited uses. They gain a range of heal spells allthough these only really work during downtime and this is really their only real form of utility. They are masters at keeping monsters hitting them due to their array of stun spels. They are defined as tanks in a group and they can fill those role fairly well. They are able to solo undead (Hmmmm, I thought they were holy?)if they choose their targets carefully. They can tank fairly well with only average weapons but they do need good armor. There are quite a few good weapns available to them at the higher end which help their otherwise poor damage output.<br />
Wait a minute.....Exactly how is a Paladin a holy knight capable of protecting his group like this? Where are the holy swords that are able to destroy evi, not just undeadl?Sure he can hold aggro, and he gets group heals, which become pretty useless.....More on this later.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights are defined as part warrior, part necromancer. They are evil knights, bent on inflicting pain and destruction. To this end they get the unique ability to Harm Touch, which turns out to have limited uses. They are able to lifetap and cast dot spells on their enemies, which do reasonable damage. They get a large array of spells that make monsters hate them (Why would a shadowknight get this?) In groups their role is generally defined as tanks. They are able to inflict more damage than Paladins, but the damage output remains reasonably poor. They are able to solo very well and gain a lot of utility such as invisibility and feign death and a by and large gimmicky pet. They are able to function on poor armor if solo and with poor weapons in a group. Even so, there is a large array of good weapons availabe to help their damage output. <br />
Wait a minute......an evil knight that tanks and protects his group mates? Where are the evil powers of darkness and dark swords  that inflict huge amounts of damage on their foes? More on this in a minute.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the basic melee class. They are masters of armed combat in all its forms. They gain the unique ability to.......um.......help me here........I know this one.............er........<br />
<br />
Crit? Crits are so random and so usless it is incredible. Besides which any class can now crit due to AA.<br />
<br />
Berserker frenzy? O please, it hardly makes any difference due to you being mostly dead when it starts working and there is allmost no noticeable benefit whatsoever. <br />
<br />
/Disc defensive? Every other melee class gets discs, that don't fly. <br />
<br />
O, I know, /shield. Wait a minute.....why would a warrior want this? It is more suited to a Paladin surely?<br />
<br />
Ok on to the next thing. We gain a lot of utility in the shape of.......?<br />
Bind wounds? Everybody can do that.......at least as well as we can. <br />
In a group a warriors role can only be defined as a tank. His damage output does not justify him being able to fulfill any role besides that of a tank.  He cannot function at all outside a group. He needs both good armor and good and very rare weapons to fill this role effectively.<br />
Why would anyone want to play this class? It does nothing any of the others can't do and is basically just very average. Where are the monstrous battle axes, cries of war that strenghten your allies in battle, the devastating blows to your oponent that severly disorient him and weaken his ability to fight?<br />
<br />
A couple of solutions that have been given in the past is to either increase the amount of aggro a warrior can generate allowing them to at least fill in the only role they have or to allow them to do more damage, giving them some other utility other than tanking. A, yes, but that would imbalance us with monks and rogues...... <br />
<br />
I am lvl 64 and I never duel wield anymore. Sorry, but unless I get a PoI hammer (a rather rare drop again) to complement my red epic I know I'm only going to hold aggro on my 2h epic or Greatstaff of Thunder due to the huge advantage in damage 2h weapons have over duel wield. Ok, then let's increase the damage duel wield does to put it ahead of 2h again making it fairer to all pure melee classes. What? Knights wouldn't accept that? .....O dear.......<br />
<br />
This to my mind is the problem......all melee classes have now become so similar to each other in terms of damage output and in some cases tanking ability that it leaves those classes without spells and skills at a severe disadvantage. Making all classes even more equal with regards taunt, damage and tanking in my opinion is only going to make matters worse.<br />
The only solution is to make it so that melee classes can COMPLEMENT each other. <br />
<br />
Shadow Knights ought to be a DPS class, not a tank. It fits their role a lot better. They should be churning out the kind of damage a rogue does with the aid of powerfull weapons and spells. To compensate, their defensive caps and the armor available to them should be lowered significantly. In the end this would even benefit them when solo as they fear kite most of the time anyway. In a group they can cast aggro spells on the tank if they are to keep those and they can churn out huge damage, allowing them to complement both Paladins and warriors. <br />
<br />
Warriors ought to be what it says on the tin, Masters of Armed Combat. To this end they should have some of the most powerfull weapons available to them and certain class defining skills, a couple of which I have outlined below.<br />
The idea of critical hits is sound; certain parts of the body are very vulnerable. But the implementation in EQ is terrible. So what to do? Give them an array of special critical strikes, either on a timer (preferred) or randomly generated like a proc, obviousley the best skills coming at the highest lvls.<br />
<br />
LEG STRIKE: when succesfull, this attack acts a lot like a snare or in some cases root. It immobilizes an enemy for a certain period of time. <br />
<br />
ARM STRIKE: This acts a lot like a slow, but doesn t last as long. Will this upset shamen and enchanters? Well,no, a warrior still can't mez, heal or buff, but in high lvl groups at least warriors would gain a nice utility, possibly also making druids more attractive as group members for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
CRY OF WAR: A lot like a bard song in that it gives a small haste and atk boost to your group. It woul be nowwhere near Shaman haste but possibly something like 20-30% for 1 minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
ARMOR BREAK: An ability only the high lvl warrior gains. A well placed strike severely damages an enemies armor, forcing it to take a major hit to ac. This ability will make it much easier for the other classes to hit an opponent too.<br />
<br />
HEAD STRIKE: the deadliest of a warriors abilities, possibly only gained at lvl 65. This serves to severely disorient an enemy, significantly affecting their ability to cast spells and stunning them for a significant period of time. Obviousely, this should not be maid too overpowered so as to make most encounters trivial, but it should be a powerfull skill that is worth looking forward to. <br />
<br />
None of these skills would work on raid lvl mobs, however using them would induce a significant increase in aggro ( I think you d be pretty upset if a guy with a big club whacked you very hard in the noggin)  This would not take a lot of code to program in (hell even shield would have taken more code I think ) and if balanced correctly it would still not make a warrior overpowering. We still wouldn't be able to solo, even with these skills due to them being high lvl and the fact that we can only bind wound after our fight, making our downtime hideous. If we gain these skills, I see no reason to increase our dps significantly either. <br />
<br />
As for Paladins, what should they be? Their role should be defensive as it is now, but even more pronouncedly so. They should gain /shield, not us and possibly a better version of it. And maybe a skill such as holy flash of light which can cause a group of monsters to run away in terror. Maybe even a holy flash that acts like a ghetto mez like necro's have Screaming Terror. They should have the unique ability to save their group from dying when things are really going badly. <br />
<br />
Another change I would like to see implemented is the complete removal of bind wound caps for all pure melee classes alltogether. All spellcasting classes with the exception maybe of clerics are able to solo to lvl 40. Will it overpower us to be able to patch ourselves up after being jumped rather than dying at low hp from another mob? It will give us the ability to solo some mobs slowly while waiting for a group, at least at lower lvls. <br />
<br />
In my opinion with the right mix of classes it should be possible even for an all melee group to be able hunt for reasonable experience with the right mix of skills. I have lost count of the amount of times I have been sitting around with a full group waiting for a cleric to show up so we can actually do something worthwile. Clerics will still make it easier to do certain things, but it should at least be posssible to gain experience, even at higher lvls without having certain classes in a group. This is the only way Verant could possibly promote grouping.<br />
<br />
I would like to hear other high lvl warrior's opinions on this and if the ideas were to be refined and prove popular wether it would be worth presenting them to  Verant as a general request from the entire warrior community.<br />

<br />
Hrmmmm.....there at least a couple types of warrs I know of:<br />
<br />
1. that started pre-kunark and was just too bull headed to quit...and have really low expecations of the class (hell they saw rangers and SKs tank over them at one point!)<br />
<br />
2. those that started a warr after kunark so they could become the &quot;raid rock star&quot; aka the guy where the rubber meets the road tanking da big mobs.  Some of these moved on to run  really big guilds and use lots of curse words in their posts!<br />
<br />
3. those that joined after kunark who never got be a raid rock star but on occasion like to play that role in exp groups.  In most cases they are usually the warlord blue clad guy hanging out by the PoT book waiting for a group to need them for 4hrs and/or punctuated with a raid on which they toss their 80dps in the ring! <br />
<br />
None of them seem awfully happy these days...<br />

<br />
It's an outgrowth of the way that shadowknights used their spells to try and provide some utility on raids and maybe get an invite based on something besides that fact that someone needed to loot the SK only stuff. It's actually a real complementary ability when used properly.<br />

Only if you assume warrior damage output is poor.  And didn't you just get done talking about how our offensive spells add good damage?<br />

<br />
If you think the pet is gimmicky you don't understand the first thing about what a SK can do in an exp group.  AT 58, we get the 44 necro pet.  Which doesn't work the way a necro pet does (as a tank), it does act as a noticable DPS boost. Moreso than spells do (for exp groups anyway - raids running flat out is another story).<br />

<br />
Except shadowknights get resistant and 2 discs with enhance harm touch, which you claim is not useful (and it isn't really).  I've never seen a raid that waited for resistant to refresh, and the harm touch discs (and AAs) are relly for kill shots.  Yay. <br />
<br />
This is the equivalent of saying since warriors and SKs both get the taunt skill their aggro abilities are balanced.<br />
<br />
You might have a shred of a case if the SK discs were perceived as necesary as defensive.  Too bad they're not.<br />

<br />
Where's the complement? You are proposing to make SKs a necro/warrior hybrid instead of a warrior/necro hybrid. Oh, I get it.  It's a complement because SKs can't hold a tank slot, leaving it free for warriors to dominate again.<br />
<br />
Really, this proposed change would make SKs a copy of necros. Unable to tank and a DPS class.  Why would one at the character select screen pick a SK over a necro or vice versa? Both fill the same role in the same way. While there was some interest in making SKs more like rangers instead of more like paladins and there is a group in the SK community that would prefer this, the current direction of the SK reflects what the SK community wants the class to be - a offensively focused defensive (or tank) class. It's shadowKNIGHT not shadowRANGER.<br />
<br />
Rangers and druids are distinct, as are paladins and clerics. A beastlord plays distinctly differently from both a shaman and a monks. Why make SKs and necros play alike?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This remind me Final fantasy tactics, where warriors had the unique ability to Break armors and weapons of the enemy, with of course a low percent of sucess... Archer without bows were fun :D...<br />
But there was a &quot;holy knight&quot; (another class) in this game, who could strike at distance, AND had 100% chance of breaking the armor/weapon AND inflict damage at the same time !<br />
So I guess EQ is a copy of Final Fantasy :D !<br />

Rangers and druids are distinct, as are paladins and clerics. A beastlord plays distinctly differently from both a shaman and a monks. Why make SKs and necros play alike?  <br />
<br />
Here is my take on these hybrids-<br />
<br />
Ranger - cross between a warrior/ druid - this class gets decent melee skills, has outstanding ranged attack, they also share spells, a lower defensive melee capability, and lower hps with druids. Their defining skills are their archery, it exceeds the warrior skill. and tracking which exceeds that of druids. the rest of their abilities are lower than their parent classes<br />
<br />
Beastlord - cross between a monk/shaman - this class gets decent melee skills from monk, decent buffs/spells from shaman, and get a pet from their shaman side. The Pet is by far their defining skill, it exceeds the shaman pet. they do not buff/cast as well as shamans, or melee as well as monks.<br />
<br />
that brings us to the knights...<br />
<br />
Paladin - cross between a warrior/cleric -  these get decent melee skills, 90% of the defense and hps of warriors,  along with cleric buffs and spells. Their defining skill is ????? <br />
<br />
Shadowknight - cross between a warrior/necro - these get decent melee skills, 90% of the defense and hps of warriors,  along with necro pets and spells. Their defining skill is ?????<br />
<br />
The problem is a common one with computer games. In Role-playing games there are role-playing considerations when playing classes such as Pal/Sk. In a large computer enviorment, the RP consideration is greatly removed. That makes these classes easier to play with no downside. <br />
<br />
In a RPG a paladin who groups with an evil character/race would lose all of his special abilities and spells  That does not happen in EQ. This removes the RP restriction. Also,  these classes because of their power would normally progress  a lot slower than other classes, that has been removed. <br />
<br />
In an RPG a paladin was an UNDEAD slayer, in EQ this is very limiting, though Pal have all the undead slaying abilities, it greatly limits their usefullness. Same with a SK, he uses undead and fear, same limitations.<br />
<br />
The problem I see is this... They have completely gone against the design and basis of these two classes. Because the low content of undead in the game, people got upset and complained how these classes were useless..<br />
<br />
Eventually SoE/VI conceeded and have pushed the power levels of these classes higher and higher until we have the state now where they atr 90% warriors and probably in the 70% range for caster class. Making these classes overpowered  in that sense.<br />
Rather than having these two classes be limited and powerfull in their specialized areas, they have been made to be generalized classes.</div></div><hr />

Where is the logic of a SHD being a DPS class again?  All I gather is that it, &quot;fits their role better.&quot;  Im not sure I agree with this sentiment at all.<br />
<br />
Further, the whole idea is rather perplexing.  If the SHD is going to act like a ROG, why not just play a ROG?  The only difference I see above is that they can use spells---to do the same job nonetheless.<br />
<br />
While I applaud your effort to come up with something original, this idea is a very weak one...at best.  I would never want the role of a DPS (only) class.  It's not what I signed up for, nor what I believe is a reasonable solution.<br />

The part that caught my eye was the comment that PAL/SHD are 70% range for caster class.  Umm--what exactly does this mean?  Our spells are 70% as effective as the relavant caster class??<br />

<br />
So how do you get 70 percent out of that?<br />
<br />
Compare Touch of Volatis (350 lifetap 62 SK) to Touch of Mujaki (850 lifetap 61 necro).<br />
<br />
Destroy undead (1200 DD 65 necro) to deny undead (650 DD 62 SK).<br />
<br />
Neurotoxin (1300DD 61 necro) to spear of plague (600 DD 65SK).<br />
<br />
You going to tell me the 49 necro pet (65 SK pet) tanks 70 percent as well as the 65 necro pet? Or does 70 percent the DPS?<br />
<br />
From the paladin side:<br />
<br />
Hand of virtue (72 AC, 1405 HP) is actually more than 70 percent of marzin/hero/bulwark of faith (56AC, 1125HP), in terms of raw HP, but not any other factor.<br />
<br />
Wave of marr (900 group heal 65 paladin), of course, is a pale shadow of word of replinishment (2500 group heal, disease/poison/curse cure 64 cleric).<br />
<br />
Supernal cleansing (250 heal/tick 4 ticks 65 paladin) isn't 70 percent of supernal elixir (500 heal/tick 4 ticks 62 cleric).<br />
<br />
I mean it's nice and all to make up numbers to illustrate a point, but I fail to see the relevance of it.</div></div><hr />

I don't agree with this 90 percent number either to be honest, but let's ignore that for now (and for the record the number warriors have made up is a knight is 96 percent of a warrior for tanking not 90 like you say or 80 like the magelos say - but I digress).<br />
<br />
The ratios aren't intended to discuss the ratio of the functionality, which is to say, 75 warrior/25 cleric doesn't mean a paladin is 75 percent of a warrior and 25 percent of a cleric, but describes their relative functionality, that is a paladin spends 75 percent of his time tanking and 25 percent casting - actually that's not entirely accurate either, but the point is paladins are designed to be MOSTLY warriors with a bit of cleric functionality thrown in.  That being said, it's somewhat difficult at this point in the game to compare the two since no hybred has access to all the spell lines of the parent, and even worse, has spell lines the parent doesn't have access to (Brell's line for example).<br />
<br />
As for the supposed linearity (80 percent this plus 50 percent this = 130 percent), consider the following:<br />
1 -  A cleric without complete heal has access to 232 of the 233 spells clerics have.  Would this hypothetical cleric be 99 percent of a cleric? Would you group with one?<br />
2 - Would someone who tanks 90 percent as well as a warrior and does 60 percent of a rogue's damage be worth one and a half warriors? (hint: rogues are baselined for 140% of a warrior's damage, 60 percent of that is 96% of warrior damage - so the question is, is a warrior with 10 percent less tanking ability and 4 percent less damage worth one and a half warriors).<br />
3 - If a paladin is 50 percent cleric could 2 of them substitute for a cleric in a group?<br />
<br />

<br />
Assuming that the benefit scales the way you are manipulating the ratios, sure.  I cited 3 example that show that adding percentages is broken.<br />
<br />
Consider, say that defensive will subtract 40% of the mobs damage (roughly) OR lower the average hit from someone like Vindi by 300.  If I then apply these results to a 4k hitter, it matters if I assume it's a 40 percent reduction or a 300 point reduction - either could be valid, but only 1 is right.<br />
<br />
Percentages may be a useful technique in general, but not only are they being misapplied, but linear scaling isn't valid here.  That is, 2 paladins at half a cleric each won't EVER replace a cleric.</div></div><hr />

OMG I know this is revolutionary, but do you seriously think most warriors wouldn't jump at the chance to be a dps melee class instead of being the raid function victim? <br />
        I know my first thought when I made a warrior over 3 years ago pre kunark wasn't omg I just wanted have other players support me and do everything for me because I like being the gimp, actually my first thought when I created a warrior back then was just lke prolly 99% of the rest I want to play a weapons master that (and this may not be the case for all cuz some of you like to play ghey gnomes and half elves) that bore a striking reseblemence to Arnold Swartenegger .. shocker? No, not really.<br />
       Do you ever remeber Conan taunting his foes? even in the books? NOPE. He like just stood there, scowling at his new foe and just started cutting, mauling, grappling and biting  his foes till they were nothing more that a bloodied mass. Maybe instill fear or beserker rage at will .. the only time we get beserker rage is when we know were !@$#ing dead.<br />
<br />
      So I say Let the sks / pallies / monks taunt .. and give warriors some actual class abilities that make sense, and satisfy the majority of the warrior class players.<br />

I quit playing my cleric shortly after that.<br />

after trying cleric 3 more times over the spanse of my eq experience I simply admit clerics are weak and boring. But at least they can pull and solo &gt;&lt;.<br />

I did do a healthy bit of soloing as my cleric and duo'ing with wizzie friends the FP guards (b4 teh newbie nerf).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ive said this once and ill say it again, knights need to stop expecting the damn tank spot. SoE considers you hybrids and considers warrios as tanks/melees<br />
<br />
your are a jack of 2 trades, so you should be 50 50, not 90% warrior with 10% cleric/necro, for you being a hybrid you get LoH or DT both of which is a reward for taking a hybrid, you also get specialized DMG aa's this is also a reward, now as a punishment you should be lesser tanks, you should NEVER have the same caps as us because we are the masters, the ones that spend all their life perfecting one point and i think its rather crappy that you can catch up to our base HP with gear by using the brell's line, and if your a SK you can turn out alot more dmg than us using your Attk boosting line.<br />
<br />
basicly pallys need to relize that their stun line was made NOT to get agro but to stop some of the very harmful spells used by high end mobs, but this can not be fixed because alot of the great warrior wepoans you go on about use the same line and if this was narfed that item we spent 40k on is now worth 2k<br />
<br />
the thing is because warriors are the base line rule of thumb we are the HARDEST to change, much like clerics and wizards and shaman, because we are suppost to be the best at what we do, this isnt true for warriors because we have been reduced to itemization of our class, now you might wonder why this fate didnt fall in the 3 classes i just mentioned is because they use spells, they dont face a harsh RNG to get a proc or a crit or a succesful taunt, and their spells dont have to take up one of the 17 item slots that we have there spell books have 100's of slots so they dont have to throw away 1 thing for another. If they are ever going to fix our crappy class its gona have to start by leaving itemization for melees in the dust<br />
<br />
SK's i have no problems with you i relize how hard it is to play your class and be good at it, you dont step on my toes when it comes to agro, and there arnt 100's of you like there are paladins (hehe, cheap shot i know but it shows what people like to stick with, whats easy that is) if paladins didnt have stuns they would be in the same boat my class is in and the SK's class is in<br />

 <br />
<br />
Itemization is a VERY HUGE part of the curent imbalances. <br />
<br />
But not the only one, Rogues/Monks also are affected, though because of their large original skill set not so bad off. <br />
<br />
The fact is that there have been only 3 EVER upgrades to melee since EQ started. <br />
<br />
1.) New Gear... well dont you know every class gets new gear.<br />
2.) Disciplines... yeah nice, but all on the same timer? <br />
3.) AA's... well as above all classes get AA's.<br />
<br />
compare that to the New Spells, Focus effects and you can quickly see that  melee has been almost completely ignored since EQ came out... Everything is about new spells, all the gear is all/all or multiclass usable, etc...<br />
<br />
Want to fix itemization? It is very easy...<br />
<br />
1.) make all equipment ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
2.) give gear a prefered class, this class gets the maximum benefit from the piece of equipment.<br />
<br />
3.) give each class not preferred lesser stats, depending upon how far from the prefered class they are... example, same archtype, int/wiz caster, plate/chain/leather/silk wearer etc...<br />
<br />
This general idea can be modified, but I think the principle is sound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">so your saying there could be a BP with 50 ac for knights and 60 for warriors? i think that might be a good way to beat back some of the itemization</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually, Landrain, there were more upgrades than that.<br />
<br />
-Some Defensive skills went up, dodge was a big jump as I recall... I'd like to call this mid-late Luclin or so, was of the last tank review, but I'm probably wrong as to when it hapepned<br />
-Taunt's been upgraded more than once in PoP, as well as slow and tash aggro being reduced (too bad they were adreessing the WRONG ISSUE with the taunt bit), this was from feedback given at Fan Faires<br />
-We have had the addition of a new ability in /shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">yeah taunt went to 230... no noticeable effect, well maybe it increased our success rate from 50 to 55%.. lol<br />
<br />
Shield while a great Concept needs serious work. The duration is too long, the effect that adds 25% of a mobs dps, and the fact that a wielding a shield (like warriors use shields, without being laughed at) are problems.<br />
<br />
My fix to shield? <br />
<br />
Make it an on/off ability. reduce it to no bonus damage, ie 50% / 50%, and make one handed pally weapons war usable with shields...</div></div><hr />

While I applaud your effort to come up with something original, this idea is a very weak one...at best. I would never want the role of a DPS (only) class. It's not what I signed up for, nor what I believe is a reasonable solution.<br />

Ah, the irony &quot;<br />

Have to pick on you a little Val...  =)<br />

By defintion, what I stated is NOT irony.  I mean, did you REALLY expect a SHD to say something significantly different?  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Pestilence, disease, hatred, strife, and any other form of pain all rolled up into something that creates undead and uses big swords?<br />
<br />
Yeah that screams defense! &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
What does this mean?  Why does this *scream* defense?  What does *defense* mean anyways?<br />
<br />
Oh-I get it.  Because a SHD is part WAR *AND* NEC, the NEC part should completely abolish all aspects of the WAR...  /boggle<br />
