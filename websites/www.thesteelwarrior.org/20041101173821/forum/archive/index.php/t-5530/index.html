<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have played eq for quite some time now.  And consider myself knowledgable.  But for the most part of my experience in high end encounters I played casters.  These days, I fell in love with the war class and have played a war up to 65 with 97aa's.  Now we all know that many higher end encounters have big ae's or other spells.  It was easy to gain resists as a caster, swapping in some resist jewelry didn't do too much, I just had a little lower mana pool.   Now I am the MT for my guild and for most of the encounters we do atm it doesn't matter as I am being healed by a cheal rotation anyway.  But some of the encounters, resist would help greatly.  However I now face the dilemma of not being able to swap in resist jewelry as it would significantly effect my max hp.  I am in almost full ornate and other good equipment, but the resists just aren't there.  We aren't to the point where we can get the stuff that has uber stats and 20 to all resists.  So I am looking for advice as to how others handle this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found that the resists came with the gear as I progressed through content.  Raiding velious you will get a few nice svall items - Vindi BP for example.  By the time I was raiding Luclin my resists were all near the 100 mark - this was good enough at the time.<br />
<br />
Gear from raiding Luclin with a few nice VT bits had my MR close to 200 and the rest of my resists around the 150's and now being close to finished in the Ele planes my resists are all near the 200s.<br />
<br />
Im not sure what you are expecting.  There is alot of nice bazaar buyable gear out these days, some of it superior to what was raided for 2 years ago, but you can't expect to XP to 65 and 100AAs and jump into the high raiding game and have the required HPs, AC or resists without working through some of the earlier raid content.  Ssra and ToV / Kael geared people up to do VT.  VT geared people up to work through PoP Flags and the ele planes gear you up for time.<br />
<br />
As you are now you should be fine to swap in one or 2 bits of gear - a froggy crown or something, get a couple of resist buffs and your resists will be sweet for ToV AE's or kunark dragons etc - 100 unbuffed used to be the target for resists for those zones.  From there you'll start to pick up a few items that upgrade you in HP/AC and also have good resists so you wont need to swap gear in and out.<br />
<br />
When I first tanked halls of testing dragons I was swapping in 2 8svall rings, 2 BD bracers and a froggy crown.  Sure I lost a few hundred hps and a hundred or so AC, but if you werent the one taking melee beats it saved healers mana so was well worth it.  If you are the one tanking then you'll have heals landing on you anyway so resists arent as important (unless the mob fears).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drachnyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its hard to get resists as you know ... I had crap resists till my guild hit VT, and ssra has some good stuff.  But mostly VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pick up LDoN augs for those resists you lack too, all those +6 and 7s soon add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agree with Brokkah I have picked up several resist augs in a very limited LDoN time. Seems alot of people are not too intersted in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDon is a great way to increase your resists. <br />
<br />
Alot of times the augs aren't wanted because people already have the slots filled, or are saving space for a more needed item. I can't seem to get any FR ones to drop for me lately, and even spent points to get the +10FR one. I have to destroy augs now if something comes along that I need as an example. All my slots are filled after about 50 adventures.<br />
<br />
 I'm still trying to get all mine to 100 unbuffed. Outside of a raiding guild it's kinda hard to get them past that without sacrificing other stats, or swapping out all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At the end of the day, it really comes down to Guard of Druzzil, Circle of Seasons, PR and DR and Bard Songs.<br />
<br />
These alone and very ordinary gear will usually get you near 500 on your specific resists.<br />
<br />
For the most part you will be good there.<br />
<br />
Just make sure you bring a bard druid ench shaman necro with you everywhere you go and you will have plent of resists. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you got 500 resist and it's hitting full it might as well be unresistable if it isn't already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the problem with warriors is that if you were to swap in resists you'd probably lose HP and AC or other stats. if resist gear had desireable tanking stats we'd probably use that gear all the time.  when i was MT for my previous guild the only resist i worried about was MR, since most of the odd effects check against MR. the majority of the other spells that check against fire and cold are usually DDs where the majority of posion and diseases are generally DoTs. basicly, while i was tanking i had the full attention of the cleric chain so the extra damage from DDs and DoTs werent very noticable through a CH rotation (we had a very tight chain). seasons, GoD, and tribunal, are usually good enough for general raiding. in the event that your up against the odd mob that has some AE or proc that checks against a specific resist, a bard is usually enough to top you off or at least get you past 400.</div></div><hr />
