<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all ... been reading the boards lots lately ... and after much ready i have come down to a hard decision <br />
<br />
I recently was awarded a BoW and not sure what to aug it with ?<br />
<br />
Some have told me Anger 3 some have told me Yak ... <br />
<br />
Our guild has just entered the EP planes and i usally am the ma/sa on clearing but lack the hps for MT for most of the mobs .. any suggestions would be great ... also please comment on experience with this combo and if you have had troubles over aggroing on raids if not ma/sa ...<br />
<br />
Btw our MT has a BoW also if that helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I am a Rogue.<br />
<br />
Still, Anger III if you are going to be tanking or if you have a dps setup when you are not tanking.  BoW + Anger III is a wonderful aggro setup and not well suited to anything else.  BoW + Yekesha is a very decent aggro setup but likely too strong for dps use if your MT is using a BoW, even Ang3 augged.  A streak of procs and you could ruin a raid.<br />
<br />
But I think you knew that and I'm still just a Rogue.  Warriors will comment soon though I imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">usually you WILL overagro with a BoW, regardless of the Aug. If you tank alot and want max possible aggro, go A3, if you feel like, the 125stun dd is a nice toy and you want the 250 crits for eye candy, go yak ). The absolute difference in agro should be marginal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ive had my auged with yak...then removed it for anger 3 and the difference is like night and day.  If you are going to tank with it throw anger 3 on there no questions asked, if not put yak and dont kick or taunt, and engage 30 seconds late.</div></div><hr />

Go Anger3. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea, I did this thread a couple weeks ago :) <br />
<br />
Anger III is the way to go I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I'm a cheapo LDoN slacker so I went with the 510pt Ykesha Aug. I only have WA1 but find the aggro is more than sufficient for the level I play at (elemental farming, no gods dead).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Definently go anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anger 3 is really the only good augment choice for a BoW.  It isn't a non-MT assist weapon and if you are using it for damage then get something without the enraging blow.  It is a tanking weapon and you might as well maximize its agro and make it the best tanking weapon it can possibly be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taggen_of_Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ang3 for sure<br />
<br />
yak adds like what? just a couple dps no real diff there AND the stun is &lt; 600hate so go to EF!!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah I dont see how there is any choice but anger 3 aug.  BoW is a main tanking weapon, make it into the highest agro main tanking weapon you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slap an Anger 3 aug on it and bag it for the first 50% on big bosses so you don't steal aggro.  That's what I do with my SEWS and it works out great.  I don't steal aggro on bosses and if I do wind up tanking I have all the aggro I need.</div></div><hr />
