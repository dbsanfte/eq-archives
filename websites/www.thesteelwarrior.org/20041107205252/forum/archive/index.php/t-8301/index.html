<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>waza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
With new interface, showing numeric value of endurance, any of u can tell me what is regen rate with each lvl of the regen endurance AA plz ?<br />
<br />
Thx for the answers :)<br />
<br />
Waza</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was under the impression that it's 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the queation is &quot;What is warrior Endurence regeneration at lvl 65 while fighting/standing/sitting and with the HE1/2/3 AA ?&quot; <br />
and not &quot;What is the HE1/2/3 AA increase in endurence regeneration?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">end regen is constant, fighting, standing, or sitting doesn't matter. I can't comment on the aa though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bloodeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At lvl 65 with Heightened Endurance 3, my regen is 33 end/tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope, at least not exactly.<br />
I agree that standing/sitting doesn't matter. but for fighting I don't agree. I've never paid attention to the end regen during fight but I know that I am loosing endurence while defencive. And Lucy say it cost 10 endurence by tick so with the 30 to 33 end regen at lvl 65 it would not let us loose any end, it would just lower its regen. so at least when you are disced, I am would assume during the whole fight (I have to pay attention to this one, not quite sure actually),  you don't regen end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I imagine, endurance doesn't regen while an active drain is on the pool, I've noticed the same thing, except I have seen regen happening while fighting and undisced. Perhaps losing regen while disced is intended, or maybe its a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 65 no HE i was regening at 30/tic</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defensive takes 10end/second (60/tick).<br />
Actually, every disc takes endurance every second, not just defensive.<br />
You can see ammount in your CS window.<br />
So there is nothing to wonder why during disc your end goes down.<br />
<br />
It doesnt matter - u sitting, standing, fighting, swimming, with disc or without.<br />
Regen is 30end/tick , 31/32/33 with HE 1/2/3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've noticed this with healing will also, the endurance cost is subtracted every second, but the benifit is applied every &quot;tick&quot; of 6 seconds.  Kinda blows if ya ask me, at least for this specific disc, waiting 6 seconds of constant draining for 1 tick of goodness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Garthud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Attack on = regen of 20 per tick<br />
Attack off = regen of 30 per tick<br />
<br />
Sitting does nothing to speed it up, and neither does running or anything else... just simply based if your fighting or not.<br />
<br />
Those figures are based on no AA's in it to speed it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Standing still (stand/sit doesn't matter) is 30/tick, +3 if you've endurance regen AA<br />
Standing still, attacking is 20<br />
Running, not attacking is like 27 or so<br />
Running, attacking is like 17.<br />
<br />
The last two numbers I don't remember exactly, but you definitely regen endurance slower if you're moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Whopping and Viken are wrong. :)  Endurance regen is lower when attack is on, as stated by Garthud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye.Constant fighting makes it hard to recover endurance for me.When resting recovery is obviously far greater even if you used no discs while fighting.My wifes lil endurance regen pole thingys she summons if we're camped a bit is handy when I can't pause .I'm glad I got this aa it helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hempire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Do the old school end regen buffs (invigor, acumen, yaulp, etc) do anything these days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just wrote down some numbers, these are with +3 endurance regen AA so subtract what's necessary depending on what AAs you have:<br />
<br />
Standing, Not attacking - 33<br />
Standing, Attacking - 23<br />
moving, not attacking - 29<br />
moving, attacking - 19<br />
<br />
Not that you don't have to have a target either, auto attacking on with no target still gets you the penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nonsequittor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">nope, Invigor or the stamina regen part of Acumen dont do squat anymore ... kinda irritating.<br />
<br />
Gunnar ... what is this end regen pole thingy you speak of?  You have me interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Had to check her char hehe.Call of the ancients a gates aa allows the shammy to summon a ward(er polely thingy)that increases endurance regen for people close by.It go's with the cleric healing ward type stuff.I like it when we're fast pullng  to a camp on raids....er say poe rings.Incite runs down as we go and the ward along with the regen aa help alot.</div></div><hr />
