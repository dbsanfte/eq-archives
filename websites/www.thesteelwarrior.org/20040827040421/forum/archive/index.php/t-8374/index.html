<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ooogaboogabooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I just started up my warrior after a three year absence due to college.  Well, lots of things have changed since the first EverQuest first came out.  Starting out brand new again was not the same challenge it used to be.  I found myself coming the Steel Warrior forums for any tips or tricks for low-level characters with no resources.  I found some good advice, but it seemed to be scattered.  So, I decided to make a rough guide for fighting for levels 1 through 20.  I will be refining this particular guide all week, and will release a new guide every week or so about different aspects of the game for low level players, such as farming, questing, skills, etc.  <br />
<br />
Please pardon the roughness of this first guide, I made it during a lull of activity at work in about 15 minutes.  Please feel free to add any comments or make any suggestions you see fit.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

P.S.  The Library is read only, so I hope I picked an appropriate section of the forum to post this guide.  Let me know if there is a better choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ooogaboogabooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Start your new character and use the Plane of Knowledge books to travel to Ak’Anon.  You will level up here through level 13 with ease, though it could be quite boring.    Make sure you have something to do, such as read a book, chat with friends, or something.  In my experience, you will probably never run into another soul in the Old World areas, and if you do they will more than likely be twinks and not interested in grouping.  If you can find a group, at any level, group – even if it is with a twink.  Remember, don’t be afraid to ask everyone questions, most people will flat out ignore you, some will actually answer you, and very few people will insult you.<br />
<br />
Levels 1 – 4:<br />
	In Ak’Anon, go to the newbie zone and kill every rat you see.  Your targets here are the tails they drop.  Loot everything you see, but definitely the tails.  Sell everything you get to the druid there.  The rat tails sell for maximum 1.8 pp (gnome) and minimum 8 gp (troll).  Save any bat wings, bone chips, or spider/spiderling silks you get.<br />
<br />
Levels 5-8:<br />
	Kill the Grikbar Kobolds.  Just walk into the camp and start slaughtering.  For some reason, these kobolds will not assist each other anymore.  The shamen will heal kobolds, but that is it.  Whenever that happens, just run out further and the kobold will follow, and then proceed to kill.  The best selling items here are the kobold furs and kobold teeth.<br />
<br />
Levels 9:<br />
	Kill anything that you can at the Windmills in Ak’Anon.  If you are an evil character, beware of the guards.  Also, watch out for Skeletons, Brittle Bone Skeletons, and Krag Warriors.<br />
<br />
Level 10 – 13:<br />
	Move beyond the Windmills to just before the Minotaur Caves.  Here, fight any monster you can except for Spider Recluses and Plague Rats.  Plague Rats are aggressive and will attack you if you get within range.  They also have a disease spell that stop your hit point regeneration, which can be deadly.  Spider Recluses are social creatures, and will aid other spiders that you are attacking; this includes the Rogue Clockworks that look like spiders.<br />
	Earth Elementals are tough warriors who bash a lot, which significantly reduces your damage output.  They do yield good experience, however.  Loot will generally be very poor here, but the experience is good.  These levels should go very fast, but the experience will taper off at 13.  With the money earned from the kobolds and rats, it is time you headed up to the bazaar and bought some equipment.  Make sure you check out your newbie armor and determine what pieces you should upgrade based on item quality from the quest and its equivalent in the bazaar.  What ever you couldn’t purchase from the bazaar, do the newbie quest for.<br />
<br />
Level 13 – 15:<br />
	If you have a magical weapon or can hit magical creatures, go to the Eastern Commonlands and the Western Commanlands and hunt Willowisps.  Save all of your Lightstones and Greater Lightstones and complete the Concordance of Research quest.  This will generate an enormous amount of money for you.  If you do not have a magical weapon, head to the Northern Desert of Ro.  Specifically, look for Dervish groups; however, usually, there are none to be had.  Fortunately, at a place called Dervish Camp #2, there is a lone Dervish spawn that you can kill.  Be careful killing this monster because there will be an Undead Ruin behind you full of Mummies, Ghouls, Zombies, Skeletons, and other undead.  Also, in front of you is a full camp of Dervishes, if you get too close, they will assist the first target and destroy you in short time.  The Dervishes drop bronze weapons, which sell for between one and three platinum.  Remember, in the desert you will consume more food and water, so plan accordingly.  Be sure to upgrade your gear again in the bazaar before moving on.<br />
<br />
Level 15-17:<br />
	At this level, you can kill crocs in the Oasis of Marr or bears in the Western Commonlands.  If you kill the bears, the experience will be slower but the dropped items will sell for more because they are used for trade skills.  The crocs in the Oasis give fantastic experience but have poor drops and hit very hard.  The Oasis is a very dangerous zone, roaming Sand Giants will kill you in short order and Lockjaw runs faster than you can with Spirit of the Wolf.  Western Commonlands are not dangerous, but be wary if you are an evil character, as it is a hold out for good characters.<br />
<br />
Level 17-20:<br />
	Two options exist here for leveling: Paludal Caverns or the Orc Highway in the Oasis of Marr.  If you kill in the Paludal Caverns, you will gain experience at an unbelievable rate, and the loot is fantastic if you can get into a Bandits camp.  One caveat to leveling there is that you will level so fast, that your skills will suffer.  At the Orc Highway, you will have a constant stream of orcs to kill, and the environment is much more dangerous thanks to roaming Desert Madmen, Ghouls, Dry Bone Skeletons, Arthikus, Sand Giants, Mummies, and more.  Your experience will gain will also be slower, but this will give you more time to practice your skills, and the looted items are decent selling.  After you gain level 20, go to the bazaar and upgrade your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good guide, one thing you didn't mention is if this is for a complete newbie warrior or a twinked out one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ooogaboogabooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi Payn,<br />
<br />
I deliberately made this a generic guide because I wanted it to focus solely on fighting.  I followed this route on two characters, a now level 8 bard and my current main.  I started out totally new.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">he good guid <br />
<br />
but this days ther is a shorter way <br />
<br />
lev 1-5 hometown newbie area<br />
lev 5~25 Paludal caverns (Mobs at Shadeweaver's Thicket side are lower)<br />
lev ~25 ~25 echo caverns <br />
<br />
both zones have a nice xp mod so experiance come realy fast. <br />
also the drops from the mobs are normaly wort a few pp sold to a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mobs on the Shadeweaver side of Paludal start at about level 7, and are harder than old world mobs.  I can't imagine a warrior being able to beat them prior to level 10, unless significantly twinked.<br />
<br />
An untwinked warrior would be far better served by spending levels 1-4 in the tutorial earning gear &amp; charm there, and then 5-15 doing its newbie armor quests near its hometown, instead of rushing off to Paludal or other XP-zone-du-jour.<br />
<br />
Head for the high XP zones at level 15, not level 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Let me clue you in to my fave 'untwinked noob' plat camp. Misty Storyswapper is a bard NPC in WK very close to the QHills zone. She is level 13-17 and can be killed by almost any level 12+ toon equipped with only noobie quest gear. She drops a lute that sells for 1pp+ every time and can also drop rawhide armor pieces and research items. If you are a good/neutral character, you can sell to vendors right at the camp. And once you are to the point of not needing  to regen/med between spawns, you can kill wolves, bears, lions, spiders and spiderlings while waiting for repop for silks and pelts to sell. Right near Misty are 3 level 10-11 NPCs, a guard (not on Guards of Qeynos faction and won't asist Misty), a paladin and a wizard. If you don't care about Qeynos factions you can kill them too for a bit of extra xp, but the wizrd can be kind of tough.<br />
By the way, if you are a good/neutral character concerned with League of Antonican Bards faction, each kill of Misty = 1 bard letter or 1 run of the Watch Report quest in SQeynos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also worth noting that an untwinked warrior going the fast Luclin route (ie Paludal Caverns) for the first 15 levels is going to have a hard time funding upgrades with the drops available in the caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I first started out on stromm, I started with nothing, like all newbs do. However, by lvl 25 i had about 10k worth in gear. <br />
<br />
Here is how I did it... to the best of my recollection.<br />
<br />
From lvl 1-10 I hunted in Field of Bone.<br />
The scaled wolves, scorpians, skeletons, and spider are easy to kill to get to lvl5-6. You can collect all the bone chips and other loot to sell the merchants in PoK (or the merchants in FoB if you are an iksar)Then move to the pit. You can usually find a group or healer to duo with there.  You can camp on one of the ramp without worry of getting attacked. The mobs in the pit vary in difficulty, low lvl mobs by the city and higher mobs by Kurn's tower. The pathing of the mobs in the pit also make it ideal for pulling, although  you still have to be carefull of the occasional heartsting scorpion that wanders into the newb area. The pit is also an ideal place to get rusty weapons and shields off of bandits and skeletons. The burnynai's can also drop the odd piece of armor. The pit should be able to take you to lvl 10-12 without much problem.<br />
<br />
lvl10-15<br />
At lvl10 you can move camp to kurns tower. This is newbie exp heaven. Get a group here and watch the lvl's fly by. The majority of the zone is skeletons, with burnynai in the basement. <br />
<br />
lvl15-20<br />
At lvl 15-20 I like to go to Paludal Caverns. It shouldnt be too difficult to find a bandit group here at this lvl. Bandits drop weapons that you can collect and sell for a bit of coin.<br />
<br />
lvl20~ let the money making begin<br />
<br />
Once lvl 20 you can start to make some money. Go to PoK and buy and invis potion or 2 (maybe an invis vs undead too)for 10-12pp each. Then head back to Kurn's tower. Go down to the basement (invis and being careful to avoid skeletons) and on the 2nd floor of the basement there is a little corner known as the jester camp. The Undead Jester can drop a weapon called Iksar Berserker Club. When I was coming up on Stromm they used to sell for 750-1000pp each, and i still see them occasionally being sold for 500-1000pp. What makes the Jester spawn so easy to do is that you really on need to kill 3-4mobs per cycle to keep the camp clear. The Jester spawns as a wander in the halls of the camp, so you only have to clear 3mobs plus the PH(thick boned skeleton) or jester. The mobs in the rooms usually dont aggro, although there is a mob that wanders inbetween 2 rooms that you need to watch out for. Since you usually have a long wait inbetween spawn you can go down the hallway and try to spawn a fingered skeleton. The fingered skeleton drops various sized writhered fingers that are used in the monk epic. Sometimes a high lvl monk will come down and camp the place for his fingers. They usually offer to buy any you have on your for a decent amount ( i got 500pp plus some gear for a finger one time). <br />
<br />
This is probably the most profitable low level camp that I know of.<br />
<br />
lvl20-30<br />
From lvl20-30 I usually head down to Unrest. It's a long run, but the exp is great. from lvl 20-25 you can get into upper castle groups without a problem, there is usually quite a few people here. The cash loot and swords/gems/spell components usually add up quickly, easily paying for temps and maybe gear upgrades. From lvl 25-30 you should try to get into a basement group. These can be hard to come by since the basement camps can be tricky to break and there are only 2 camps.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is all I'm writing for now, I hope someone finds this usefull.</div></div><hr />
