<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday we had a bit of a discussion where i said that eoe is a superior offhand weapon than quarm hammer for a tanking warrior. This started a bit of a discussion, which sounded a bit like this =)<br />
<br />
'most wars dont have aggro proc in off with RZ blade'<br />
<br />
'how is eoe anybetter aggro wise'<br />
<br />
'intterupt stun proc aint such a big deal'<br />
<br />
'dps is the mainaggro a weapon produces'<br />
<br />
It's my opinion ofcourse that warrior tanking have no buisness using anything less than what's best aggro.<br />
And that dps is shit for aggro and that interrupt is good aggro.<br />
<br />
Now tell me im right~<br />
<br />
-drach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are right 100%<br />
<br />
Procs &gt; small dps boost<br />
<br />
Both do good dps but the extra dps isnt really gunna match the proc from the eoe.<br />
<br />
Quarm hammer can still be a good agroer with anger 3 aug, but eoe with anger 3 is still better.<br />
<br />
You can never have enough Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">dps is shit for aggro  <br />
<br />
Im not uber impressed by my quarm hammer (disappointing proc) but I believe youre very wrong by underestimating dps aggro</div></div><hr />

Disagree with you there, it's already known extra dps generates aggro but it's something you'll have to build up, whereas with the time snap proc it'll be more or less snap aggro, but you place reliance on the RNG for that proc.  Slap an anger 3 on the EoE and your chances of proccing for that snap aggro at the start of encounter increases.<br />
<br />
I was testing my aggro against an elemental equipped ranger in a pickup group.  It took her 2 ensnares and 2 flame licks to pull aggro off me (rogue) - I have no taunt, I have no procs to generate aggro, basically just dps to hold it which I did for 90% of the fights we tested it on.  I keep my orb of the sky bagged for times I go farm sub55 caster mobs or when I end up tanking; I could've pulled that out and made her work even harder to pull aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have both a Quarm Hammer and an EoE. When tanking, I use the Darkblade/EoE combo, both are Anger auged. When Im not tanking and more or less a dps person on a mob, Ill use the Quarm Hammer and an Ethereal Destroyer.<br />
<br />
I would never consider putting anger on the Q hammer or using it to tank with. The EoE procs a ton, atleast mine does with WA, and those added stun procs generate far more aggro than the dps from the hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">did you backstab derr? cause i know (im a rogue myself) that backstabing is what gets me high up on the aggro list. that is, backstab has a higher aggro/damage ratio than normal melee has so to speak.<br />
<br />
and me saying dps is shit for aggro is me saying that a warrior aint never gonna do more dps than a rogue, so trying to hold aggro with pure dps aint gonna cut it. <br />
granted damage = aggro, but if i remember correctly from that other thread where someone tested it all out, i'd say difference in aggro from melee damage would be negliable between quarm hammer and eoe in offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">like the other posters said: EoE agro &gt; Quarm 1hb agro. Dont underestimate dps agro of warriors but the pure ratio difference is marginal. The point is: EoE has a midlvl agro proc (between A2 and A3 prolly) and the quarm hammer proc is pretty much zero agro. The pet damage is more than the EoE dd proc but i think the pet agro is more or less independent from the weapon wielder.<br />
<br />
I have only the EoE but did some testing just for fun with a monk of us which uses quarm 1hb and the 19 22 1hb from HoH. He never pulled agro off me, even when i was at 30% selfhaste and offhanded bonechiller.</div></div><hr />

Of course I would BS but being in the front, they're all minimum backstabs (130 + 20 from Time bp, so 150 min bs) using the AA skill chaotic stab which is pretty much worthless.<br />
<br />
I'm not totally disagreeing with you on the EoE proc vs HotT dps but I'm just stating that you can't throw out DPS like you make it out to be.  About a year ago was when warriors started getting BoWs off RZ-Tactics; though the actual +hate would be less than a combo like BF / BoC due to the lesser amount of procs, I noticed an immediate difference in tanks holding aggro from the extra 20-35 dps that the BoW gave them, so there's a grey area where the additional dps will have it's own gain.  <br />
<br />
By the time you're wielding the DBotW + anger 3 / Time Bp / Pestilence shock / using Incite, aggro is locked down nicely.  It's just up to you to decide if going with a snap aggro proc will be better for your guild or if a DPS setup would be more beneficial.  If you're consistently the MT or ST, I'd go with the snap aggro setup on the EoE.  If you're the 3rd or 4th tank, I'd go HotT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GorouTSO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EoE is an aggro/bard weapon, Quarm hammer is a pure DPS weapon. If you want more aggro, you should get EoE over Quarm hammer. Quarm hammer is obviously more usefull in the off hands of DPS people.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">give quarm hammer to the DPS'ers and take the EoE for offhand. The difference in offhand damage isn't gonna make up for the proc of EoE in my opinion. Maybe down the line when you've got 20 quarm kills and all the dps'ers have quarm hammer, then pick one of up for dps. That's what i plan on doing. <br />
<br />
With the Ikk trials, the JOS is comparable, if not better, to quarm hammer. dual wielding that and HotT would be a nice dps combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Changing the subject slightly, you may want to add Jagged Onyx Staff into your mix as the perfect compromise...<br />
<br />
Jagged Onyx Staff:<br />
Skill: 1H Blunt  Atk Delay: 25<br />
DMG: 29  AC: 22<br />
Cold DMG: 1<br />
STR: +20  STA: +20  WIS: +10  INT: +10  <br />
AGI: +20  HP: +200  MANA: +180  ENDUR: +180 <br />
Effect: Frostbite (Combat) (60 pt DD and AC debuff)<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
Edge of Eternity:<br />
Skill: 1H Slashing Atk Delay: 20<br />
DMG: 20 Dmg Bonus: 13 AC: 20<br />
STR: +20 DEX: +25 WIS: +10 INT: +10 AGI: +18 HP: +180 MANA: +165 ENDUR: +165<br />
Effect: Time Snap (Combat) (150 pt DD L68 stun)<br />
<br />

<br />
Hammer of the Timeweaver<br />
Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 24<br />
DMG: 26 Dmg Bonus: 13 AC: 25<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +20 STA: +20 CHA: +15 WIS: +15 INT: +15 HP: +220 MANA: +200 ENDUR: +200<br />
Effect: Call of Time (Combat) (Swarm pet for 1 combat round)<br />
<br />
So...<br />
Jagged staff vs Hammer:<br />
20 hp less<br />
2 AC less<br />
3 damage more<br />
1 delay more<br />
+1 cold<br />
(Far greater DPS)<br />
Proc is a debuff vs pure DPS that generates aggro.<br />
<br />
Jagged Staff vs EoE<br />
20 hp more<br />
5 AC more<br />
9 damage more<br />
5 delay more<br />
+1 cold<br />
(Again far greater DPS)<br />
AC debuff vs Stun...  Dunno kinda a toss up I think personally.<br />
<br />
Reason EoE is better though is the L68 stun if you need to interrupt L66/67/68 casters like on LDON hard or Ikkinz single group stuff.<br />
<br />
I went with Jagged Staff myself and think it's the best of the choices available.  Popped Anger3, and I have to watch my aggro w/WA1 far more then I did with an Anger3 Bloodfrenzy.  (I keep taking aggro from WA5 warriors doing DBOW/EoE)<br />
<br />
Just noticed  Thalzaar's post...  I agree with him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally I like the high hp, resists and especielly cha on the Timeweaver.<br />
<br />
You can never get too many resists and hp. I am an ogre, so I have to choose items with care to get cha enough for DI. Concerning agro, I haven't find any problems with my current setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes I use DB and JOS its a very nice aggro combo so much so that I augged both with lifetaps ^.^ Im a firm believe in you CAN have to much aggro especially with WA5 ^&gt;^ I never have trouble with aggro so I see no need to put anger 3 on any so rather heal myself and have the small chance of the heals criting and adding up to enough to save me from a big hitter , its almost like mitigating dmg and much more preferred in my books but I am a rare breed of war I suppose!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>quirkyguy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got EoE/JoS and i take agro often w/ only wa3... well now 4 but haven't been in a fight yet.  EoE has anger 3, i put it offhand usually, and JoS isn't aug'd yet cause i can't lodn as much anymore.  But I'll prolly put rujarkan bile on it just cuase it doesn't need more then dps... maybe FoY, but definately doesn't need anger 3.<br />
<br />
I'm considering taking quarm hammer since I don't tank much, and it'd be nice dps, especially for groups and such.  I'd prolly put rujarkan bile on it since i wouldn't want to use it in an agro situation having JOS and EoE already... as for DboTW...  we started completely clearing time in december i think?  we have 2 DBoTW, one of which dropped last week, and with 3 warriors ahead of me in dkp by a lot due to time zone... i'm not exactly holding my breath.<br />
<br />
still wishign they'd fix shield agro less something's changed since i last checked, cause i have a good shot at the gay looking GoD shield c(o;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">that shield looks awesome ^.^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I thought about replacing EoE with a JoS for offhand but its fucking ugly and I fear I will give myself seizures,So I stuck with the EoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">they toned down the particle effects on JOB btw, it's not as spastic as it was, now it just sorta glows pink. also, check out your adventure staff, they toned it down the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I often read in this threat that the Quarm hammer in offhand is so much more dps than the EoE.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should have a look at the parses made with these weapons.<br />
<br />
DBotW + EoE = 118 dps<br />
DBotW + Quarm hammer = 122 dps<br />
<br />
These 4 - with speedbuff maybe 5.5 - more dps will give you nearly ZERO more aggro.<br />
<br />
The advantage of the quarm hammer is a bit ( and only a bit ) of more damage and a slightly reduces possibility of beeing riposted cause of the greater delay.<br />
<br />
The advantage of the EoE is the massive greater aggro of the proc and the stun of casters up to level 68.<br />
<br />
So when I real all over the board ppl declaring that aggro can't be enought than the EoE is far the better choice than the quarm hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I keep seeing warriors posting that they are getting too much agro. Hogwash. Maybe the MT is not getting enough agro when you are in a DPS role, but it is YOUR job to keep off the top of the agro list. If you are grabbing agro when you are not MT, then you need to reevaluate your DPS setup. As long as DPS classes are capable of doing over 2x warrior damage, there is no such thing as too much agro.<br />
<br />
To answer the original question, EoE &gt; Q hammer for agro, by a pretty big margin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There was a thread a few months back (I'm too lazy to search for it right now) that proved that Damage dealt has nothing to do with the aggro obtained.<br />
<br />
If I recall, aggro is determined like so:<br />
<br />
Every WEAPON has a set Aggro-per-swing value (although not discovered).<br />
Every ABILITY has a set Aggro-per-use value<br />
Every SPELL has a set Aggro-per-use value.<br />
<br />
In other words, Backstab has a high Aggro not because of how much damage you deal, but because you're using the ability.  Backstabbing for minimum damage yields the same amount of aggro as backstabbing for full (unknown if a crit is an increase in aggro or not, but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess no).<br />
<br />
While one weapon may proc less than another (someone mentioned BoW), the increase in aggro was not based on the extra damage taking place of the procs, but that the blade itself yields more aggro every swing.<br />
<br />
The testing was done by using normal aggro testing (casting known aggro spells, then meleeing without taunting until aggro bounced back).  Every time, a given weapon took the same number of swings (hits or misses, didn't matter), to obtain aggro.<br />
<br />
This means that the most important aggro buffs are Dex (for proccing, obviously), and haste.  ATK makes no difference on your aggro.<br />
<br />
The most important tanking AAs by means of obtaining aggro are Weapon Affinity, Flurry, Ambidex/PB.  Tactical Mastery and Combat Fury make no difference on your aggro.<br />
<br />
Therefore, you can conclude that, while the aggro number for a weapon swing is not currently known (like unknown70 values are):<br />
<br />
DPS + dmgproc or no proc &gt; less dps + aggro proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We called that &quot;potential dps agro&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if you miss 2 double swings with a BoW, you generate agro. However potential dps of a 20dam / 20dly weapon is higher than of a 12dam / 18dly weapon, thus the 20 / 20 generates more hate, no matter if it hits or not.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: High dps weapons generate more hate than low dps weapons,  regardless of procs.  Expection would be the hateless added damage from pet weapons. <br />
<br />
However i prefer a weapon that generates lets say 4000 hate per minute + 3 x 700 hate over a 4500hate /min pure dps hate weapon.<br />
<br />
So whats the point? 0_o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Talking about Agro .....  Since GoD is more of a Charge &amp; Burn expansion .<br />
I've decided to grab the next DBoW (if one decides to drop).<br />
Having 2nd thoughts however about the offhander, EoE or Onyx Staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>goobayouface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">if you have a bf, i'd say it's better than an eoe, because statistically eoe is only slightly better, but bf has a better agro proc and a high procrate modifier<br />
the amount of  agro you'd get from the greater dps of eoe probably isn't anywhere close to the proc advantage of bf<br />
on the otherhand, the stick is alot better dps than bf, better stats, and not a horrible proc<br />
so i'd probably say stick &gt; bf &gt; eoe, but really any of the 3 would be fine offhand if you have db, but out of the 3 only bf is really a reasonable primary weapon imo</div></div><hr />
