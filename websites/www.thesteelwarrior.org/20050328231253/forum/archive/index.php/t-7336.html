<br />
Teh Infoz: I have Aten Gloves, so I don't need a Symbol of the Planesmasters for the extra proc.<br />
<br />
I'm a TOTAL AC whore, I absolutely HATE dropping even one AC, so looking for something with at LEAST 25 ac minimum (using a charm of defense atm).<br />
<br />
My magelo is up to date, feel free to check it out and make suggestions.<br />
<br />
The items I see as possible upgrades now are:<br />
<br />
1) Symbol of the Planesmasters-good stats, way to DKP expensive though since I already have aten gloves for the added proc<br />
<br />
2) Globe of Mystical Protection-avoidance +10 looks juicy...but does it still have composure? Hate taking FT from casters.<br />
<br />
3) Ton Po Pouch-have yet to get any of these, and monks will absolutely flip if someone else wins one<br />
<br />
4) Ikky trial 2 range item- ok stats, nothing special at all, but DKP free, can get it pretty much at will (I've passed on several of these already)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any input</div></div><hr />

Ding ding ding.  This is by far the best defensive range in all of time.  10 avoidance will drop dps on most time gods by 30-50.</div></div><hr />

Inny Dagger is pretty good stat wise. Nothing really extra fancy about it though.  Could always try to go for Quarm range if your guild is getting close to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The attack does not suck at all.  The continuing trend with guilds advancing in Qvic and Inktu'ta and beyond is that with the exception of Vadds armor, nothing has attack on it so far.  Or very minimal attack at that.  <br />
<br />
Look at some of the magelo's of the people leading in the HP category on eqrankings.com or on guild sites atm.  All of them are falling into the 1400's on attack.  <br />
<br />
While im not saying dropping some attack is the end of the world, i do feel that having attack maxed can only help you.  The more attack you have the more DPS you are dishing out, and DPS ties directly into aggro.  While aggro isnt necessarily a problem for most people in time guilds, anger augs and darkblades have really solved that, the fact remains that attack is something that can only help you, not hurt you.  <br />
<br />
If the attackless items trend continues the further into GoD we get, you will be happy for the 50 on the Quarm ranged later on down the road.  <br />
<br />
Who knows though, maybe the items will get revamped and have everything get added attack ala~ time did about 3 months in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With an &quot;optimum&quot; tanking setup, your ATK and Regen take a massive nose-dive. I think I'm like 1470 ATK or something? That's almost 90 shy of the cap. My regen sucks, too.<br />
<br />
I have Lodestar in my range. It's  260hp/50ac and can be swapped into a very nice DPS 2hb when you aren't tanking.</div></div><hr />

That said, having more DPS on your side can only help.  Regen is starting to be more useful too since there seems to be more long duration attrition fights, at least based on stuff in Qvic/Inktuta (Rock Storm and Earth Wave damage adds up over time).  You're not always going to be tanking so why not try to do as much damage as you can?  Even if you're tanking, it really doesn't hurt that you're doing more damage as opposed to less, since using a Stone of Flowing Time doesn't exactly hurt you.</div></div><hr />

Though by it's stats, I'd guess it'll be close to a year before I'd see one. We're basically new in PoTime, and not progressing very fast due to several factors. So far we've only dropped TT, Saryn, and TZ, working on VZ now. Although I do have to say, if it were not for the DX9 issues, I really think we'd be in phase 5 by now.<br />
<br />
GoD progression wise, we finally got the Ikky raids open after months of working on them, and we've beaten raid trials 1 and 2.</div></div><hr />

If they just got to time  it will be months before they get to uqua in all likelyhood.</div></div><hr />

What in the hell? I don't have the words to describe how fucking ridiculous that is. Even if some moron tried to implement such a thing, what 60 morons would go along with it?  If you lose a /random on xp group loot to someone out of guild, does your guildleader try to charge them dkp? Or are you forbidden to xp with people outside your guild, too? =x</div></div><hr />

Lets face it the Inkkiz Ring is very overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I think the attack on Quarm is certainly a valid reason to get it, and the regen doesn't hurt either.  Yeah yeah you're a tank not DPS, but tanking doesn't stack, and DPS does.  I've thought about a Mythical Globe but decided at the end that 50 attack should help with balancing attack problems.<br />
<br />
And Ikk ring is quite overpowered.  5% spellshield is &gt; any amount of HP you can currnetly get on a ring when you're taking any kind of AE damage at all.  Speaking of spellshield, I should be ready to attempt to survive a DT pretty soon!</div></div><hr />

WHy is that? It appears Qvic is dropping better than Quarm loot with 2 groups...  Seems in line with the rest of GoD's fubarity.</div></div><hr />
