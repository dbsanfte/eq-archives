<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a new idea...it might be situational but I think it would help in some places, namely exp groups.<br />
<br />
Warrior only bows that have aggro procs. If I'm pulling for the group, I can usually get 4-5 shots in before the mob is in camp, depending on where I'm hunting. If I'm not pulling I can get 2-3. If the bows are set to a pretty high proc rate (enough to get in one or two procs before the mob gets into camp), then you could start the fight off with a decent bit of aggro.<br />
<br />
There could be lower level bows that proc something like pique, mid level bows that proc taunting blow, and high level bows that proc enraging blow+.<br />
<br />
Of course there's the problem of arrows...alot of people don't like/have time to fletch and aren't always grouped with a mage. There could be a warrior usable item that summons arrows, or, as I've seen suggested many times, an Endless Quiver AA. The problem with the AA is it would only be for people with lots of AA and the lower end bows would be less desirable for the lower end players who don't have enough AA for Endless Quiver.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think about this? Would you get one of these bows if they were in game if they had good stats? Would you get Endless Quiver if we had it?</div></div><hr />

we are warriors, not archers. :/<br />
Most of us want to get there in combat, slash, hack, maim....<br />
<br />
not try to shoot little arrows at the mob in hopes of getting what are close range weapons can't get us :/<br />
<br />
And if you shoot the mob with arrows before he gets in camp... you'de only get a proc every 3 or 4 mobs...<br />
of course, it would always be nice to have such a bow.<br />
But i'd rather have our melee weapons looked at ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why they should be set to a very high proc rate as I stated. And it's not like we would be sitting back like rangers and shooting mobs the whole time...that, of course, wouldn't work because you would get aggro from the procs and you can't use bows in melee range. <br />
<br />
I usually shoot a mob a few times before it comes into camp anyways. Plus, we use bows to tag mobs on raids or in groups as well. A proc or two would be pretty helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bror</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about just having an AA ability (passive) that does a taunt check whenever you fire your bow, or some sort of a increased hate effect like EB for firing arrows. <br />
<br />
That way we wouldnt need fletching. And would have an ability to create fast agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been advocating &quot;hate arrows&quot; for some time.   Fletched arrows or even a bow, that ALWAYS procs a &quot;hate&quot; type spell, that puts an icon that lasts for 30 seconds or so similar to Donals BP in that once it lands, it cannot be added again until it fades, thus ensuring that there's no &quot;proc&quot; randomness but can generate ranged aggro consistently, yet cannot be exploited by &quot;aggro kiting&quot;.</div></div><hr />

We need real skill changes, or new melee abilities. We simply don't do enough damage with a bow for this to even be a possibility.</div></div><hr />

And, truth be told, bows blow.  You can't be higher or lower than your target, you can't be too close, you can't be too far away.  The only places bows work well are typically outdoor zones or dungeons with large rooms.  They're situational, not always useful, and having to require their use for the class to function would be limiting in the extreme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty much my view as well.  It would be cool to have bows like that in the game but I would never want my whole class balanced around that.  What do I do when we're dungeon diving and fighting in small twisty tunnels?  Bows would be useless.  It's got to be some sort of innate ability.  I don't care if it requires AAs or not but no equipment dependence please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also the proc on a nightmare compound bow - not sure what the proc rate is, but the bow you want does exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
right now shooting a bow at something probably causes almost as much hate...<br />
<br />
SV no longer really does much more than take up a buff slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also like to mention that current &quot;procing&quot; bows do not seem to do much...<br />
<br />
I would be in favor of an arrow that did +hate (say 400-500) automagically as long as it hits...  you would have to fletch them, but shouldnt take many to get a nice hate lead at 500hate.<br />
<br />
<br />
endless quiver is likely to see the nerf stick... the devs really don't like it... no one else is getting that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another less painful plan would be to increase the range on TAUNT... the mob can probably hear you from outside melee range.<br />
<br />
If BOTH happened, I would be happy for all warriors.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about a quest or AA to give you a trained falcon pet that could fly over, attack the mob for a second and fly back to you.  It could be useful for pulling and getting back agro.  It could sit in your range slot and add some stats and would not be limited to vertical distance or proximity like a bow.  Give it a 2 minute reuse and make its attack add like 400 hate.</div></div><hr />
