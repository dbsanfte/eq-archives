<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On Eqlive Brenlo has mentioned that there is more regen for melees to stop the downtime, and it appears to scale with the amount of hitpoints you have, ie the more HP you have, the more you regen.  I only have some test buffed chars on test, but I was wondering from high level warriors on test server if this was noticable or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was on last night and didn't notice anything unusual.  This makes no sense to me.  When was the last time you had downtime waiting for someone's hps to regen?  Outside of melee twinks that like to solo I don't see this effecting anything one way or the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I could see this being nice for the non-twink newbies (if there are anymore)...I don't think getting groups before 15/PC is that easy anymore, so this might be to allow them to solo with a bit less downtime.<br />
<br />
No for the post 60 crowd...why bother??<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and I want a reward for that troll xp hit I took to get better regen at the lower levels.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would be nice to top yourself off when waiting for the next pull to come in, and who knows, it may top the Invigorate BPs, and if it stacks with Healing Will (which I use fairly often) it will be very nice in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My initial feelings falls under that &quot;too little too late&quot; for me, but I cant really comment on it since I havent seen it.  To combat my soloing ability(or lack thereof), i added a druid.  Seems this regen may get low end people to rethink getting another account for a healer, hehe.  No more $$ for Sony!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For the pre 50 crowd, this is probably okay but it won't make much difference for the lvl 65s out there.  If people want to regen back their health, pure melee can hit healing will, use an invigorate bp, or bind wound.  There's no point for myself to sit and regen 50hp a tick (instead of 47 standing) when I can do use my mrylokar bp (6 sec cast time) and get 147 hp in the same tick, or use bind wound if I need to stay invis (80ish hp heal with bind wound but it takes 10 seconds).  Unless the sitting regen bonus is 30-50+ at 65 for people with 8-12k hp, this is a drop in the bucket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Folks,<br />
<br />
Let's see what those who are actually trying the changes out have to say.  This is not a change to allow for soloing, rather it is to attempt to decrease the largest cause of downtime (other than Gems).<br />
<br />
Go try it and let us know what you think.<br />
<br />
Brenlo<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if they added 30hp a tick we're only talking 300hp's per minute. For me it would still take a long ass time to regen to full from even 50%. I don't see how this will be a big help, but since they won't come out and tell us the actual %'s everyone without a high level toon on test has to just wait. The reported difference at the testbuff level(25) is 2-3 per tic sitting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I played Ragnarok Online for a short while, and one of the best ideas I'd seen on there is the ability for the &quot;warrior-type&quot; class to significantly raise his regen.  Although this gave those characters with a small ability to solo a few experience monsters, I thought it was one of the best ideas for the stout tank to have.<br />
<br />
The Swordman class/job in that game has a passive ability to increase their regen.  It has 10 levels.  They gain 5hp/10 seconds for each level they get.  In addition to that, they receive 0.2% of their max hp for each level they get (max of 2%).  It's mainly used for downtime in that game, it seems.  Not only that, but healing potions receive a 10% bonus to their healing amount for each level.  this would make them full of health from 1hp in about 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
In this case, a swordsman with 5k hp and maxed regen would receive 150hp every 10 seconds just from regen.  Also, any potions they quaffed in this time would heal him for double.  It allowed them to kill very low monsters that really shouldn't be killing someone as buff as them.<br />
<br />
I thought it was the best idea ever, and still do.  I often wonder what the hell EQ is doing with it's 3hp/tick on a tank with 7khp....<br />
<br />
Although it'd have to be altered, I wish they'd institute something like that starting at low levels for all classes, and gave the tank classes twice as many levels as anyone else (5 levels for everyone, 10 for tanks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">maybe they are looking at the way wow works at lower levels... nothing like 30 sec after a fight that you have 2% hp left that you are ready to rock and roll again. Faster pace=good long ass downtimes =bad. <br />
<br />
probably the best for 1-10 crowd, always hated the amount of downtime between fights then.. once you had 160 or so hp 2 hp per tick = long wait</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, no downtime 1-10 now.  When you get low health you attack a guard and respawn with all your gear on and full health/mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A regular poster on the beastlord boards has said that the amount of hp regenned per tic scales upward the longer a person is sitting. The specific post can be found here : http://beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2003 <br />
<br />
Would there be a high-level test warrior willing to get to very low health and confirm that and possibly let us know what the hp per tic rate is after 3 or 4 minutes? I don't think my /testbuff warrior has enough hps to do a sustained test. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea I'll do it, brb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was sitting at about 8k hps, got beaten down to 2kish (lowest I could get because of adding your gear hps when you zone so  the hps/tick scaled up as follows:<br />
<br />
36<br />
40<br />
52<br />
64<br />
76<br />
88<br />
100<br />
112<br />
<br />
Took 8 and a half minutes to regen sitting from 2428 to 7793 hps (buff wore off).  Would have taken around 15 minutes to regen that many hps at 36/tick. Regen rate went up roughly once a minute.  Gained 12 hp/tick/min except on the first jump, not sure why it did that hehe.  Not exactly fast regen for a high-level warrior, but it will be nice for lower levels that want to solo I imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not too bad really. I really can't see how this would be anything but helpful. Sure, there are more helpful things that could be done but there's no reason to complain about this change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It could be useful for the soloing 65 warrior if it stacks with healing will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks Brutul :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks Brutul :)<br />
Yeah, thanks. It's too bad SoE couldn't have supplied this information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sounds nice for the day after a raid when I login and realize I still have 4 dots on me I forgot to get dispelled the night before.   :p</div></div><hr />
