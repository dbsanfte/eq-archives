<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was cleaning up some Programs I never use today. One of them was Microsoft Money 2002. When I was trying to delete it, I got an error message saying a .dll file couldn't be deleted (can't remember name, but was something like myopwin.dll)<br />
<br />
I deleted the rest of the files one by one leaving Microsoft Money/System/myopwin.dll left.<br />
<br />
After I did this, I started getting this annoying Windows Installer popup that trys to repair the Microsoft Money 2002 that I deleted every time I open a new program (or a new instance of a current program, like making a link open to a new window in IE). If I click cancel a few times it goes away and the program opens normally. If I let the installer do it's thing and then says The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is currently unavailable.<br />
<br />
Click OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containg the installation package &quot;MONEY.MSI&quot; in the box below.In the box below is &quot;\\qa-6\WhistlerOPK\apps\Money2002\&quot;<br />
<br />
If I click OK, then it says that path cannot be found and to make sure I have access to this location and try again or to find the installation package &quot;MONEY.MSI&quot; from a folder from which you can install Microsoft Money 2002.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what this is caused by and how I can stop it?</div></div><hr />
