<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- The entire lower end of the healing spectrum should be rebalanced. Rangers, Beastlords, and to a lesser extent Paladins and Shamans, and even the SK and necro are slowly having their healing abilities being made less effective, and in some cases irrelevant, by the vast increase in damage output over the last few expansions. It's gotten to the point for ranger and beastlord healing has gotten laughable. Heals for 400-500 when mobs hit for several times that in a single hit? &lt;shakes head&gt; let's make their healing actually make a difference again. Shamans are in dire risk of losing their role as secondary healer, their heals just aren't big enough any more.<br />
<br />
- Paladin stun caps should be raised to reflect the significant increase in NPC level. Paladins used to be able to actually stun mobs that they fight on a consistent basis, and now they are finding more and more content at the very high end that is immune to their stuns. Extremely high end Paladins can many times not stun their mobs, while middling paladins can nearly always affect theirs with their stuns. This should be rectifiied. Stuns should ALWAYS have an effect on any trash mob. Only &quot;special&quot; mobs, such as named, giants, dragons, and others, should not be effected by stuns. Not having significant amounts of the mobs stunnable in single group content, JUST because of their level is not right.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights should regain the ability to become invulnerable to or significantly reduce melee damage for a short time, just like just about every other melee class in the game does. There's just no reason not to have it, and they have more need of it and more of a reason to have it than many melee types that DO retain that ability. This is especially important, due to the high melee damage output mob design that SoE seems to currently favor. DA and Harmshield don't cut it, due to the fact they often times are counterproductive. A Paladin or SK uses HS/DA in an emergency, and one of their party memebers is most likely going to die due to the aggro issues. Solution? Add a autoblock disc or spell to the hybrids with the same limitiations as furious/weaponshield and the like.<br />
<br />
Change Cloak of Luclin to stack with BSS. It's a self buff that should be treated the same as the self buffs that the other classes have. Currently BSS stacks with just about any class's self buffs... except SK's, and there's no real reason for it not to stack, due to the fact that just about, if not every other class's self buff DOES stack with it.<br />
<br />
Hybrids really don't need a whole lot of changes or upgrades. Things like these, however, would go a long way to solving these problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
At the fan fair they made a statement that CoL and BSS won't be made to stack. Also that realize this is unfair, but have no intention of making them stack.<br />

Monks, rangers, hell even bards have one.  It doesn't infringe on warriors, we have 2 melee invulnerability discs and we can chain them with defensive now.  <br />
<br />
If you wanted to avoid the endurance/disc thing you could just make a modified version of DA/Harmshield that only works on melee and doesn't effect your aggro or ability to cast spells like normal DA.  Say 18 second duration 25-30 min recast.  It comes with the penalty of a spell and buff slot but nothing's free and the recast at 30 min is better than the melee disc version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said their are some good ideas, its just really hard for Hybrids to be powerful enough to warrant them being their, w/o being so powerful that they negate the need for the class's they derive their abilities from, and yes, I know this is a warrior concern, probably the biggest, and I do understand it =p</div></div><hr />

Wrong, every Hybrid has a buff that is of the same line.<br />
<br />
Ranger - Strength of Tunare line<br />
Beastlord - Spiritual Vigor line<br />
Paladin - Brell's line<br />
Shadowknight - Cloak line (although they really should make lower level versions, there are two spells, which make it a line)<br />
<br />
None of these will stack with each other, and they all bounce off each other. Shadowknights simply have a self only one, instead of a group version.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that will happen, really.  Paladins get Aura of the Crusader, SKs get Aura of Pain.   AoP is definately more situational(it's not useful if you're not tanking), but when it is worth it, I'd rather have it than AotC.<br />
<br />
A stacking change like that would be awesome, but I won't set my hopes too high.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh, actually, you're the one that's wrong.<br />

the SK Cloak line is self only buff, like AoTC is a self buff for Paladins, whereas SoT/BSS/SV are group buffs.<br />

Buffs that are self only are not the same as group buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daemonwynd,<br />
<br />
There is also the little problem of trying to cast that heal/lifetap while being hit for 1900 by the raid adds in GoD.<br />
<br />
The fact is, the heals just didn't scale with the mob damage output, but that has become secondary to the fact that when I need that 500pt lifetap, I am being hit so hard that only 2 in 5 spells actually don't get interrupted...  and those 2 spells better be aggro spells...<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, so we aren't add tanks anymore... so maybe I'll just do damage...  oh wait, warriors who aren't tanking outdamage me... (due to our damage spells not scaling right either)  and thats against yard trash that isn't as highly DR as the mobs on the raid who have made it a surprise to actually see our DR spells besides Bite(-500DR) actually land.  This makes Aura of Pain even more situational as well, and takes a good potion of my DPS and utility drains away.<br />
<br />
Okay so I am not an add tank, and the among the games' worst damage dealers... alrighty I will guard the casters/healers...  Too bad I die nearly as fast as they do (the difference is measured in milliseconds) in GoD raids, and raids like Uqua it is a very bad idea to die.  So on Uqua raids I am supposed to HT something and FD until my next HT?  Maybe add in some lifetaps here and there for flavor.<br />
<br />
I HATE sitting on my hands while there is add tanking to do...  I HATE knowing that it is tactically better for me to just FD than to fight...  I don't mind knowing the warriors absorb damage better than I do, but I DO hate being so bad of an ADD tank that I have to recommend not healing me as my life isnt worth the mana.  I hate knowing that not a single spell/discipline/AA/ability of any kind that I can get will change that.<br />
<br />
The whole fixed Harmshield/DA has been brought up before...  the whole parry/ripo plan has too...  and yes they would help... I might actually tank slightly better than a ranger overall.  However, if its just like weaponshield I am only really useful for the 18-24 seconds while the discipline is up...  and then I am dead weight just like before.<br />
<br />
How about a Harmshield/DA like spell that lasts 18 seconds and has NO recast...  it reduces ALL melee damage to zero (no effect on spells) and allows aggro to be held, allows melee, and allows spellcasting.  In addition, the spell would NOT be interruptable.<br />
Yah, I know, sounds too powerful...  heres the catch...  it costs a PILE of mana to cast.<br />
Should cost 1000+ mana per cast(would have to be adjusted for balance)  for a hybrid, that means I can cast it 7-8 or so times raid buffed for a whopping 126-144  seconds total if I time everything perfectly.  144 seconds = 2 minutes and 24 seconds.  Thats if the knight doesn't cast anything else save the shield.  That also leaves the knight at ZERO mana.<br />
<br />
Result for XP groups...  knight has a neato trick that is too inefficient for most XP groups unless they face a big mob.<br />
<br />
Result for raids?  knights can tank anything for a short time, and then they are manaless and pointless...  but while they shine,(their mana holds out) they burn VERY bright.<br />
<br />
Downsides?  Knights would have to hit that shield every 16 or so seconds or risk insta-death...  most encounter would still require healing due to AoE.  Mobs that silence or dispel would render this defense pointless.  Mana cost and 18 second duration makes it so the knight MUST be decisive.  most knights would not be able to maintain it for maximum duration as spells would NEED to be cast to maintin aggro.<br />
<br />
Also, in addition, I'd like to see the SK return to the plate-DPS crown and the hate addition crown when their spells and melee are combined.<br />
<br />
-Add zero second fear to the beginning of Terror line spells<br />
-Add new Sk line of Hybrid nukes...  short range(75) and low resist, that deal high end hybrid damage (1000ish) and cost half mana and half life.<br />

They do not stack with each other, they are therefor the same line (just like Focus and Shield of Maelin are in the same line, or Faith and Protection of the 9).  SKs unfortunately have a self only version instead of one they can target (like a good number of SK spells...shall I mention bobbing corpse and invis, for example?)<br />
<br />
You're saying SKs have a buff that is in the hybrid line (it's the hp that prevents stacking, nothing else), yet since it's a self-only buff it's not actually part of the hybrid hp buffs.  Yet it is, as they don't stack with the other three hybrids (just like they don't stack with each other).  Only hybrids have buffs that fall into this line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sigh.. .I never said that SK's have a buff that is in the hybrid line (by that, meaning the hybrid buff line that stacks with the pure caster buffing lines) in fact I'm telling you that the SK buff (Akheva) is NOT of the same line as BSS/SoT/SV.<br />
<br />
Group buffs are not the same thing as self buffs.<br />
<br />
What's so hard to understand about that?<br />
<br />
It's like saying FoS and Shield of the Arcane are the same line, because they block each other.<br />
<br />
Let me say this again. Group buffs and self buffs are not the same thing. Ahkeva is more like AoTC, Shield of Maelin, and other self only buffs, than it is like BSS/SoT/SV.<br />
<br />
The SK group atk buff, now THAT is more like SoT/SV due to the fact they both give atk, and are both group buffs.<br />
<br />
This isn't hard to understand, here.<br />
<br />
I mean, seriously, are you now going to claim that Shield and FoS must be of the same line because they block each other? It's just not that simplistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necromancers have a SELF ONLY hp buff.<br />
Clerics have a GROUP/TARGETABLE hp buff.<br />
<br />
Even the self only cleric buff has stacking issues, believe its PoT9 it does not stack with.  The self only necromancer buff (Shield of maelin) does not stack with Fo7.  That does not make these buffs worthless, because you dont always have the class that casts that buff with you.  Shadow Knights are used as tanks in a group role in most scenarios, therefore having a shadow knight and a paladin eats up a space that would be used for dps or backup heals, whatever.  Taking this into consideration it is easy to think shadow knights may use this buff to gain extra HP when a paladin is not present.  <br />
<br />
Shadow Knights arent necissarily supposed to have &quot;targetable&quot; buffs - and just because the buff they get is self only, does not mean it should stack with targetable buffs =P</div></div><hr />

SK don't really have mana taps. We have spell deal damage and increase mana of are self or group, but they don't decrease the npc mana.<br />
<br />
About reducing damage by a %, you might wanna take a look at Stonestance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4510&amp;source=Live) and Protective Spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4671&amp;source=Live) , however Warrior have a MUCH longer duration at doing this.<br />

<br />
Want to hear the ultimate irony?   What I'm beginning to see is that although warriors are indeed capable of inflicting more melee damage than you on raid level bosses in theory and on paper, in reality it doesn't happen.  The REASON it doesnt' happen is because we've invested SO much into aggro, that in order to do the kind of DPS you're talking about while there's a possibility of later tanking, we're putting ourselves into rather extreme danger of drawing too much aggro and getting prematurely plastered.  In other words, we've become on raid, the victims of our own success.  <br />
<br />
Mind you I think this is a good thing, but it's a consideration that people often fail to make when saying &quot;They can do more DPS than us&quot;, we really can't.   It's simply put, too dangerous to do so, and has too long of a cooloff period.   A tank who's relatively high in the tanking order will basically do bard level or less DPS so as not to get themselves premature aggro since we have no way of reducing that which we've magnified to such an extent.</div></div><hr />

2 minutes of glory and then the party is basically over.<br />
(and its only 2 minutes if I dont cast any other spells, AND if I don't fizzle, AND if I time every spell perfectly - count to 16! CAST! dammit I am silenced!)<br />
2 minutes and the knight IS the weakest class in the game period. <br />
(A knight without spells/mana is pointless)<br />

Yes, the ability is powerful... but compared to other classes at 65?<br />
The idea is a powerful ablity that is a mana hog...  yeah, I know it needs some cost/duration tweaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Powerful compared to???<br />
<br />
As compared to 3 minutes of tanking like a warrior many levels higher than you??<br />
(and not losing anything afterwards) (warrior)<br />
As compared to charm? (enchanter)<br />
As compared to Wizard/Rogue/Monk DPS??<br />
As compared to doing trueshot archery damage for 2 minutes from outside AoE range? (ranger)<br />
As compared to healing like a cleric?<br />
<br />
<br />
You really believe 1k nuke is that big of a deal? (Wizards nuke for 3K)<br />
If so, then you might want to try gaining 10-15 levels and then post.<br />
I nuke for 880 vs undead for tiny amounts of mana...<br />
Maybe you should try looking at lucy and find out what spells SK already have that are STILL not powerful enough to outdamage equally equipped/AA'd warriors.<br />

Oh, and its not AND, as the nuke costs mana and health...  its EITHER the harmshield spell OR the nukes, OR a combination of both that costs some nukes and some tank time...<br />

Oh yeah, they heaped us with goodies, indeed they did.  I mean they gave us defensive.  Uhm, hold on.  That's not new is it?  Well damn.  You mean that the changes they gave us really have little or nothing to do with what Knights are insisting they need?  Imagine that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember, neither can we...  In those raids, aggro is death for a knight...  Death Peace actually working while being hit for 1900 is closer to a miracle than a reality...  most of our damage spells are almost completely resisted, and we end up using 470pt lifetaps for DPS at 330ish mana before hybrid casting penalty and mana pres effect.<br />
<br />
Knights with any brains load shields for those fights with the hopes those extra 150HP will allow us to live an extra millisecond to cast something.<br />
<br />
Even with Knight 1H weapons, we take a 20%ish damage reduction by wielding even the GoD 1H knight weapons + shield bash.<br />
<br />
The reality is that knights have to be SO skittish due to not being able to even handle aggro for a few moments to lose it...  most bazaar equipped enchanters last longer in Elemental XP groups than I do in full time gear on GoD raids!<br />
<br />
The biggest blow to my knightish ego was a gnome warrior twink (in his shiny new ornate BP and mostly Ornate+ elem plate armor)  holding off an Uqua add for a great deal longer than I was able to...  the good-natured (but poorly timed) ribbing about logging out my SK to play the gnome warrior was sure to follow...<br />
<br />
For Inny's sake do NOT try to replace me with a gnome twink anything...  a dorf or elfie is bad enough, but a GNOME TWINK???<br />
<br />
My response to his good natured barbs was not one of my prouder moments...<br />
The worst part was, I wish I could firmly tell him he was wrong...  i cannot argue with the results.  I died in under 5 seconds... the gnome lasted a good 30-40 seconds. (mostly due to discplines...)<br />
<br />
in this case a twink and his disciplines &gt; time gear + augments more than 200AAXP and every spell I had.<br />

This kind of arguement has been offered up a number of times by various people.  &quot;I have XYZ gear, XYZ AAs, and OMG a Warrior without the same gear and AAs out tanked me for under 3 minutes!!!&quot;   Well, this is and always has been the Warriors &quot;specialty&quot;.   Defensive gives us the ability to tank things better than other tank classes for 3 minutes or less.  Sometimes it allows us to tank things they couldn't tank successfully at all.  It's the big compensation for never being able to feign death, harm touch, dot, fear, snare, group heal, buff, root, stun on demand, heal, rezz, lay of hands, and so forth.  We get defensive and one or two other half way decent goodies and give up a whole hell of a lot of other things.  That's the trade off.  The fact that they've dumped more mobs into GoD that currently require defensive in order to have any kind of survivability isn't a sign of the poor Knights being unloved and unrewarded by SoE, but rather that SoE has played to the Warrior strength a little too much in the design of the mobs.<br />
<br />
The fact that one of the only really big rewards for playing a Warrior means that some Warrior twink will be able to use his disciplines to live 20 or 30 seconds longer than a high tier geared and AAed Knight isn't news, nor is it cause for class modification.  It would be much like me bemoaning the fact that some Paladin twink could rezz better than I as a Warrior with gobs of AAs and gear.  Or that some Shadow Knight twink could feign death better than I could with the same.   It's a perk of playing the class.  It's one of the only real perks for Warriors.  It's not a surprise, it's not new, and it's not something warranting Knight enhancements.  All it may warrant is mob adjustments so as to allow Knights a reasonable ability to perform their role in the content without having to be granted Warrior special abilities, or something very like them, to do it.</div></div><hr />

Look, I dropped aggro!<br />
<br />
Death Peace being a &quot;miracle&quot; to get off while being hit for 1900... It's a ONE SECOND cast time. I wouldn't have thought I would have to tell you this, but ALL you have to do is just time the damn thing properly (IE, cast it JUST after you got hit) instead of mashing it in a panic. And with a one second spell, that's not all that hard to do. How do you think low level casters without high channeling get off their spells without being interrupted, while they're being beat on by a mob? It's all in the timing.<br />
<br />
Three more words for ya. Terror of Thule. Lets the tank increase his aggro generation so you can do even more without pulling aggro.<br />
<br />
Listening to you, you'd have us believe that you've got just as much of a problem with aggro as a warrior does... that just ain't true.</div></div><hr />

Paladins are a warrior/cleric hybrid<br />
<br />
Necromancers have a SELF ONLY hp buff.<br />
Clerics have a GROUP/TARGETABLE hp buff.<br />
<br />
Even the self only cleric buff has stacking issues, believe its PoT9 it does not stack with.  The self only necromancer buff (Shield of maelin) does not stack with Fo7.  That does not make these buffs worthless, because you dont always have the class that casts that buff with you.  Shadow Knights are used as tanks in a group role in most scenarios, therefore having a shadow knight and a paladin eats up a space that would be used for dps or backup heals, whatever.  Taking this into consideration it is easy to think shadow knights may use this buff to gain extra HP when a paladin is not present.  <br />
<br />
Shadow Knights arent necissarily supposed to have &quot;targetable&quot; buffs - and just because the buff they get is self only, does not mean it should stack with targetable buffs =P<br />
<br />
The cleric self only buff does indeed not stack with pot9, also, it does not stack with the shaman line of focus spells.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the paladin self only buff stacks with virtue and focus, I believe this was probably an oversight, it makes it so that their self only buff has no real draw back, (other than not being able to use 9/kazzad/wog) plus they get the benefits of their group buffs.<br />
<br />
The SK self only buff should stack with BSS, maybe add mana regen to it and make it so they have to use virtue instead of 9/kazaad/wog as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh.. .I never said that SK's have a buff that is in the hybrid line (by that, meaning the hybrid buff line that stacks with the pure caster buffing lines) in fact I'm telling you that the SK buff (Akheva) is NOT of the same line as BSS/SoT/SV.<br />
<br />
Group buffs are not the same thing as self buffs.<br />
<br />
What's so hard to understand about that?<br />
<br />
It's like saying FoS and Shield of the Arcane are the same line, because they block each other.<br />
<br />
Let me say this again. Group buffs and self buffs are not the same thing. Ahkeva is more like AoTC, Shield of Maelin, and other self only buffs, than it is like BSS/SoT/SV.<br />
<br />
The SK group atk buff, now THAT is more like SoT/SV due to the fact they both give atk, and are both group buffs.<br />
<br />
This isn't hard to understand, here.<br />
<br />
I mean, seriously, are you now going to claim that Shield and FoS must be of the same line because they block each other? It's just not that simplistic.<br />
<br />
Not because they block each other...you can make any spell in the game block each other.  It's because the hp are in the same slot.  That is what makes it the same hp buff line.<br />
<br />
Rangers have a self only buff in their line, does that mean it should be moved over to AotC?  No, it's the same fucking line.  It doesn't matter if it's self only or single target or group buffs, IT'S THE SAME FUCKING LINE IF THE HP DOESN'T STACK!  BSS/SoT/SV all have single target versions earlier in the game, they didn't have a group version until BMB (except now they have BSA)...rangers and beastlords didn't have a group version until PoP.  They're all hp buffs with extra effects.<br />
<br />
1. Focus/Shielding/Zealot<br />
2. Faith/Pot9/Virtue*<br />
3. Symbol<br />
4. Hybrid (BSS/SoT/SV/CoL)<br />
<br />
Check all the buffs there, all their hp falls into the same line (slot).  Virtue is different because it takes up slots 2 and 3.  AotC has it's hp in slot 10, which is completely unlike any buff in this game.<br />
<br />
It's pretty stupid IMO to say Cloak of Luclin is the same as AotC when Cloak not only doesn't stack with the other 3 hybrid buffs, but it doesn't stack with Call of the Rathe (another Ranger only buff).  It's the SK hybrid buff.  This is why AotC is such an anomoly, it fits outside of every single hp buff out there.</div></div><hr />

Akheva is not of the same line as BSS and the like. The affect is in the same slot not because its of the same LINE, but because it's a BUG, that needs to be FIXED.<br />
<br />
You can think they're of the same line all you want. That doesn't make it true. <br />

<br />

<br />
The SK self buff line that is being spoke of does not stack with BSS. (note the period)  Paladins happen to be a hybrid of cleric and not necro, compare necro buffs to cleric buffs kk thx.<br />
<br />
As for adding heals/taps that are worth casting, the best necromancer DD tap is 850 pre focus/crit dmg - thats good enough to cast, but you give something good enough to cast to sk's and its unbalancing to necros.  You upgrade necros more to make it balanced, and you have necros lifetaping for 1500-2k dmg.  See why this altogether is unbalancing?<br />
<br />
Oh and btw - if you give me lifetaps or heals, ill cast them.  I would put them to use and gain benefit from them - but you know what, i chose a warrior, and being a warrior means no spells and i can deal with that.<br />
<br />
Sk's dont get the same group buffs as paladins, but they DO get group buffs.  Group stat taps count, dont leave those out.<br />

PoT9 DOES stack with the cleric self only buff ! To mitigate close to a warrior on a mob quadding for 2500 you would need a tap or heal that would be around 4000-5000 on the outside and 1.5-3k as a minimum, THAT would break all lower level content.</div></div><hr />

oh, oh, I know, I know - Bard.  It's still only 3(as fall as mana tapping) though, SK's dont have any mana tapping spells.  Mental Corruption was orginally a mana tap spell but got changed to a straight DD(around when Luclin was the new expansion) to make it halfway useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That reason is because BSS is better than Cloak, and only the SK can have the Cloak spells.  SKs have been rather self-only, you know.  You can call it a bug all you want, the Cloak spells have been in the game far longer than AotC ever was.  You just want it changed, so you call it a bug.<br />
<br />
Yes they acknowledged it wasn't fair, it really isn't fair that Paladins have the only self-hp buff that stacks with Focus/Virtue/BSS.  I read that Dev statement more as AotC was supposed to fall into the same line as BSS (like the Ranger self-only hp buff falls into same line as their SoT), not &quot;we were thinking about  changing the SK's spells too but didn't&quot;.  I still see no reason why it's intended to be a separate line, and your only argument is &quot;it's not, I can't cast it on others&quot;.  Woop-di-do.  <br />
<br />
Like I said before, and will always say, it doesn't matter in the slightest that it's self only.  The SK hybrid buff is self only, but you have one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's NOT because BSS &quot;is better than&quot; cloak. BSS is &quot;better than&quot; SoT and SV, and until recently overwrote the others. Does that mean that it should only be &quot;BSS&quot; when referring to the hybrid group buff lines? Of course not.<br />
<br />
You can call it a bug all you want, the Cloak spells have been in the game far longer than AotC ever was. <br />
<br />
So? That's supposed to make a difference when it comes to stacking issues? It doesn't matter one bit.<br />
<br />
 You just want it changed, so you call it a bug.<br />
<br />
No, I don't call it a bug because I want it changed, I call it a bug because I call a spade a spade. I have no vested interest in it being changed, I don't benefit from it personally at all.<br />
<br />
Yes they acknowledged it wasn't fair, it really isn't fair that Paladins have the only self-hp buff that stacks with Focus/Virtue/BSS. I read that Dev statement more as AotC was supposed to fall into the same line as BSS (like the Ranger self-only hp buff falls into same line as their SoT), not &quot;we were thinking about  changing the SK's spells too but didn't&quot;.  <br />
<br />
That's a whole nother issue. But AoTC IMO shouldn't stack with focus, it's more like the cleric line and the maelin line than BSS, that's for damn sure.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, and will always say, it doesn't matter in the slightest that it's self only.  The SK hybrid buff is self only, but you have one.<br />
<br />
Like I said, if that's what you wanna think, all the power to ya. It doesn't make it true, however. Like I said, all I have to do is point to conventional wisdom that points to the hybrid buffs as BSS/SoT/SV and doesn't mention akheva at all. Instead, Akheva is known as something completely different... the SK self buff, just like every other caster in the game has a self buff.<br />
<br />
But hey, all the power to ya.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, I'm not an SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just funny to me how you continue to claim Akheva is not in the same line, stacking-wise, as BSS/SoT/SV when before they added the stacking commands the only damn reason all 4 spell lines came into conflict was the HP.  They even set this line up (well before any other lines) to bounce off each other...just like they did with the Shielding/Focus/Armor spells (again, all the same line). That's pretty damn strong evidence that they ARE the same line.<br />
<br />
Akheva isn't anything different, it's the hybrid line of hp buffs for the SK, but just self only.  For a non-SK, you certainly have a burr up your ass about this though.<br />
<br />
 Like I said, all I have to do is point to conventional wisdom that points to the hybrid buffs as BSS/SoT/SV and doesn't mention akheva at all.  Akheva is overlooked as the hybrid buff for SKs because A. it doesn't stack, being the same line and being specifically coded not to stack with those other 3 buffs, B. BSS has more hp, or the other two have more atk, depending on what the SK wants and C. it's self only.<br />
<br />
Whether a spell is self-only or targetable doesn't determine anything, it's what it does and doesn't stack with.</div></div><hr />

Think whatever the hell you want, I for one am done correcting you. If you want to even ignore DEV comments that certainly do not suppoint your beliefs, and even contradict them by sayng that it will not be fixed... If that's the way it's supposed to be, which by extension means that everything is perfectly fine the way it is, then the devs would not be admitting to the fact, that there IS a problem with it. The fact that they even acknowledge a fix as a possibility, even in the context of the fact that they aren't planning on fixing it, shows that your argument has no basis in truth and fact.

Yeah, I thought that's how it was. That link doesn't mention anything about working as intended, butit does mention what IT hought they'd said, that it's not fair.<br />
<br />
Interesting to see that AoTC shouldn't stack with it, though. That's a little strange. BSS is inferior to AoTC for the pally himself, but superior for the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If mirrored its parent buff stacking, it would be a very well balanced tradeoff: Do you take the superior HP of the Shaman buff, or the superior mana regeneration of the paladin buff? Or do you get 9/Kazad/WoG/Focus and waste a boatload of rather valuable buffslots for the best effect? <br />
<br />
Reguardless of what Cloaks are nebulously 'supposed' to be or would be 'fair' to be, it's the absolute least of the issues with the SK spellbook. Our best debuff is a level 44 necro dot that reduces target AC by 18 and strength by 40. Our base lifetapping power has gone up by a total of 40% since Kunark. With 72 man raids and a 30 debuff limitation on mobs, we have stacking issues with DoTs, namely, there's no buffslots left for us to cast on. With exp groups, mobs die so swiftly that even our fast dot wastes multiple ticks of damage on a corpse. At the highest level, casting our damage spells can actually /decrease/ our damage output. Spears can be the exception, but without the Shaman decay line of resist debuffs, partial and full resists are extremely frequent against high mobs, and the line's mana effeciency is poor. With full compensation for regen loss, the pact of hate - bond of death mana cycle competes with breeze for regeneration effeciency, while killing the new regeneration bonus. Our pet is less than half our level until level 64. At this point, our pet is only 24-25 levels beneath us. <br />
<br />
Cloak stacking would be nice, but a 'free' 279 HP on raids isn't exactly the choice of battles to be fighting over the spellbook, especially when we're already being exceedingly careful about our buffslots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about a tap/self heal that proc'd when you got hit and scaled in power depending how hard you got hit?<br />
<br />
Orc Pawn hits you for 2...chance to proc a tap for 1.  Boss Mob hits you for 1900...chance to proc a tap for 950.</div></div><hr />
