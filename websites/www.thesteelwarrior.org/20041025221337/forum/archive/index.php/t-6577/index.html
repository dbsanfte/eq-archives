<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So the other night, we do some named encounter in Yxxta for the first time.  Named itself isn't that hard, but we fail to clear out everything else in the building before engaging, and wipe to adds.  No biggie, we wipe and recover all the time, its part of the game.  Except this is GoD, and our surviving rogues and necros are shortly mulched by wandering mobs that see SoS.  So now its time to spend 40 minutes having everyone run back to KT, doing a CoH of the entire raid to the Yxxta zoneline, and then doing a CS of the raid inside Yxxta. Fun, fun.  Oh the fun.<br />
<br />
And this is not an isolated incident.  I think since we have been raiding GoD, we have probably had to do half a dozen CS's to get a raid going again.  The expense isn't a problem, we've got enough plat from selling spells during PoP that we can keep this up till the sun grows cold.  But it got me to thinking - when was this anything like normal?  I remember occasional coffin jobs back during Velious if we wiped deep inside HoT, or if we wiped to Trak.  But CS as a matter of course?  We used to CS only if we were stupid enough not to get a cleric camped or a necro FD in time.  And even if we did wipe totally, there was almost always a chance to get the corpses dragged out and rezzed up in reasonably short order.<br />
<br />
I suppose PoP might have been this way without the graveyards except that SoS worked 99% of the time in PoP.  This isn't a return to an older, harder, more challenging EQ.  This level of tedious difficulty is something new, with no reason behind it other than to slow down progression by making failures a time consuming cluster fuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should never have been able to just camp or drag all corpses to a safe spot on a raid in the first place.  It's not that harder is better but there definitely needs to be some kind of tedium associated with failure.  Otherwise why not have Kevren in Kod'taz spawn whatever uber mob you feel like at zone in?  Isn't clearing to those uber mob tedious too?  Heck why not make them die automatically, because losing to the uber is tedious too?  It's not like EQ is THAT hard to play, so if you lose it must be the game's fault right?<br />
<br />
Some of the CR efforts are a bit extreme in GoD, but needing CR itself isn't a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My objection isn't to doing a CR.  That's a normal and expected part of the game.  Its to the level of tedium that occurs when the CR involves getting the entire raid back from their bind points to KT, then CoHing them, then CSing them.  40 minutes to get a raid going again isn't fun and challenging, its simply pointless and tedious.  And I stand by my assertion that the frequency with which this is happening is unprecedented in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh we had coffin cr's in old sky, chardok, ToV, Ssra, Grieg, VT ...<br />
<br />
oh the endless fun of running naked or with your CR gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chardok. I remember wiping out in Chardok. Thank god for Necros.</div></div><hr />

Early PoFear raid wipes Friday night at 8PM. Semi-naked alt equipment rescue fails at 8:30 and 9:15. Reinforcement fails at 10 PM. #2 guild rescue wipes at 10:30. Combined #1 and 2 rescue wipes at 11:30. Saturday 10 AM #1 guild rescue succeeds - CR begins. 11 AM rescue/res party wipes. 1 PM reinforced rescue resumes CR, Resses, and Ports. SUNDAY 7AM, I loot my gear and am ported out. Sunday 2PM last corpse located and looted CR complete.<br />
<br />
There were at one time between 300 and 500 corpses scattered all over the zone. (CT and the entire temple were on the loose and very not happy).<br />

Normally mobs that see through SoS aren't a problem for rogues, but with the mobs running at SoW speed when you're naked, it doesn't make for a good combination.  In most previous zones, there's enough space to sneak around the mob and remain indifferent but with tighter halls and passages, using sneak is all but useless in GoD.</div></div><hr />
