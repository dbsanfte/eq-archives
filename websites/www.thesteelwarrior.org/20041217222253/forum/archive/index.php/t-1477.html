<br />
What if we got some AAs or a disc that let us &quot;suck&quot; the mob towards us? Instead of each hit pushing the mob away, it would pull it in. Someone more creative would have to blend this into making roleplaying sense, but I think it could help to solve at least one problem - mob positioning.<br />
<br />
#1 Mob Positioning + Evasive/Defensive = Raid Tanks for sure<br />
<br />
#1 Mob Positionng + What we have now = Better EXP Tanks because mobs couldn't get as far away when aggroing slower or healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zilden</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pushing helps to keep a mob from casting or gating. being able to pull a mob at will would be over powering becuase you could use the disc to drag the mob around and keep it from gating.<br />
<br />
Positioning a mob is a skill that ppl need to learn. kinda like agro control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahhj</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, I think this has potential... if the warrior had some sort of Grapple ability where he puts the monster in a headlock and makes him say uncle ;)<br />
<br />
Could be an AA that beefs up Taunt even heh, plenty of other AA's expand on existing skills, why not Taunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd prefer seeing a Push skill.<br />
<br />
A way for the MT to counter the rogue's push, and would allows non Tanking warriors to help with the positioning :p<br />
<br />
And, it would have a more logical reason to exist. How do you suck in a mob?<br />
But you can hammer a mob hard enough to make it tip back.<br />
<br />
Skill:<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Clash of Steel:<br />
<br />
The warrior is capable of channeling his energy through the steel blades he wields, and thrust any target a few meters away from him.<br />
<br />
Reuse time: 12 seconds<br />
<br />
Effect: 1 second stun, knockback**, 50 Hate modifier.<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
** the Knock back could be different wether you hold a 2hs or a 1hs (would fit with the description above). a bigger weapon allowing more energy to be channeled at once.<br />
<br />
say, with a 1hs knockback = 3 meters, with a 2hs, knockback = 6meters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good thing about this, is it would allow us to get a good hold of aggro once Taunted successfully.<br />
But overuse of it is annoying and wastes dps,<br />
thus its a great tool to use at the correct time ;).</div></div><hr />
