<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How effecient is endurance on your sta regen / loss total ammount plz ??  Is there a cap at 305 as well as the other stats ? <br />
I really like these Inkinz legs and wondering if it really makes a dramatic difference to have high endurance or not . <br />
thx in advance for your inputs .</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt that, seeing as it's about as prevalent as +mana on GoD items.  Wouldn't make sense to cap it at 305, and then have most GoD stuff adding 100 or more per item.</div></div><hr />

Endurance isn't a stat, as STA, DEX, STR (etc.) are.  It's a quantity, as HP is.  There is no cap per se, although there is a number you can't get past with gear currently available in the game.  And that number, just like HP, will keep changing with expansions and so on.  (And I dunno what either number is ... bigger than mine, tho. :p)<br />
<br />
+END is not about *sta regen* (it's endurance regen, now), it's about how large a wad you can blow all at once.   The more Endurance you have, the more /disc's you can chain together, or the more you have in reserve when you need to throw a couple up in quick succession.   For improved regeneration, there is the AA *Heighened Endurance*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see says the blind man . <br />
thx for precious infos .<br />
 I have the AA rank 2 now but not impressed with the STA regen difference  : ( i hope lvl 3 will really improve it .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pahtoonya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You guys  actually been running out of endurance?  I don't think a single melee in our guild has looted an endurance aug.  I'm not uberuber geared, but I've never run out of endurance except for when I was jumping nonstop to see how fast that lowered endurance. :P<br />

Jumping won't do drain End by much, it doesn't burn Endurance the way it used to burn the old Stamina bar - I tried the same test, but it took too long, even on the g/f's druid, and I got bored. :p  Incite/Furious/Stonewall/Charge could finish of the Endurance bar tho.  I've been OOE 9 or 10 times, mostly when I've blundered into a dungeon room I didn't want to, or when we let the rogue pull.  That said, yer melee stats are all well above mine and I wouldn't expect you to run out nearly as often as I do.  I've yet to see a +End aug - tho we have casters in the guild that do everything they can to up their mana pool although they rarely (if ever) go OOM.  I suspect that when I do start seeing those augs, few of them if any will rot.  (But I thought I'd never hit 65, once, so whadda I know?)<br />
<br />
I have 2,276 Endurance, according to my char sheet, which I assume was coded by someone who understands the formulae involved.   It doesn't run out often - but I'm not at 0 hit points most of the time, either, and yet the more HP I have the happier I am.  I'd do what I could to boost either one.  But I need to be burning discs almost as fast as they come available to run dry - happened once last night (chained a few, multiple Incites), and once a couple of weeks ago.<br />

Heightened Endurance<br />
<br />
This ability raises your natural endurance regeneration by 1 point per ability level. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Level 3 will improve it by one more ... it's not much, but it's a tweak and Endurance regens quickly when your not in combat at any rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pahtoonya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dig.  The huge STA boost I have over you no doubt plays into things there as well.  Plus a few pieces of GoD gear with +100ish endurance a pop.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I can'ts ee any reason at present time why I would spend AA on the endurance regen AA.  The trick here is that they need to remove the reuse timers and limits on the discs.  THEN it'd make a difference, bigtime. You could go ripsote disc for as long as your endurance held out, for example- that would ROCK.  I'd be excited about upping my endurance then.<br />
<br />
But that won't happen... so I'll reserve my aug slots for +hp and +ac, and let the casters loot the endurance augs to aug as a gag, because hell, at least they get a laugh out of it, whereas I'd jsut remove it once I got something more useful- hell, let's be honest, I wouldn't even aug a +end aug into my gear since I'd need to take the time and effort (and 10pp!) to remove it later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">that just shows how lazy ogress are especially the pink ones .<br />
hehe but yes chaining disc or using aggressive ones when not MT etc can eat your sta bar pretty quick . I m still curious to see what the difference will be once i stuff me face with nice endurance stuff  :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I run out of END pretty frequently actually.  When XPing and getting chain pulls I try to incite every mob (or close to it) so the casters can lay in right away.  When fighting Quarm Furious/Stonewall/Fellstrike runs me out every time (pop Resistant at the end for the heck of it).<br />
<br />
I have no END augs yet and I will look for AC/HP ones above those since items will be recieving END in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only time I've gone OOE is fighting Seru with a force of 20+....<br />
<br />
Then again, it's boring as hell, and we melee usually end up chatting with each other while beatin on em hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some Ssra mobs DO have endurance draining procs (Rhag 1 I know offhand, I believe others). I guess more endurance could be useful if there are more mobs that drain endurance. Endurance regen would also help offset a draining effect as well, I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As far as I'm concerned, +END items are pointless.  Unless you can drain all your endurance using discs like Furious/Stonewall/Charge, etc, you should never run out.  The natural END regen rate outpaces that of Incite as long as you wait for it to wear off before laying on another one.  The extra pop of the initial Incite hate isn't worth running out, and that extra 40 hate isn't going to kill anyone that doesn't deserve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Incite&gt;Furious&gt;Defensive kills my End pretty much for the whole fight.  It seems to regen alot slower when you are fighting vs. when you are just standing there.  Also, I gave up my Disarm Hotkey to put up Incite, so I'm still trying to break my habit of hitting it constantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say so if I am hunting exp in PoEA for 20 sec per inc<br />
In that situation, in order to keep mob's sight on me, I need to incite every mob and results in OOE for a couple minutes</div></div><hr />

<br />
New mobs now have a proc or AE that drains Endurance, so don't be too quick to say +End is useless. I can see it becoming important soon. <br />
<br />
Hell, even in Qinimi, the named already drains Endurance.</div></div><hr />
