<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The LDON beta gave me a chance to try out the Blade of Carnage.  On my own character I've had a CHSD from Xanamech for many months, and just recently I got a GBOS from Eindride.  I was looking forward to seeing what it was like to have a &quot;real hate proc&quot; by playing the LDON warrior template with the BOC.<br />
<br />
After several hours on the LDON server, here is my impression: the BOC just doesn't proc much at all.  It procs slightly less often than the CHSD does.  When BOC does proc, the effect is substantial, but it can go for whole minutes at a time without proccing.  I kept checking my avatar icon thinking it must have dropped, but it was always on.<br />
<br />
The GBOS, on the other hand, procs like crazy.  Sometimes the spam is like a cleric hammer.  It continues to proc consistently with or without avatar.  The GBOS's proc is clearly equivalent in hate to Taunting Blow (450 hate), but it seems that the GBOS procs between 2x and 2.5x more often than BOC does.  To me this puts the GBOS equal or ahead of BOC in overall aggro generation.<br />
<br />
I know I should have parsed the proc rates.  It never occurred to me to take logs with the BOC, because pure hate procs are not typically parsed.  Please tell me I am just seeing things, or that the LDON warrior template sucks or something.  Is the GBOS a match for the BOC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have both GBoS and BoC, and I use them consistantly.  I also have CHSD, but I NEVER use it anymore.  GBoS is easily &gt; CHSD.  As for BoC vs. GBoS, well, I personally use BoC in Main and GBoS in secondary.  GBoS certainly procs more, probably due to its lower delay, because even though it is in secondary, I get almost as many GBoS procs as BoC procs in main.  I actually don't think about it as one vs. the other, but that they compliment each other VERY nicely.  The Stun proc is resisted on almost every mob I fight now, but the aggro is still good.  <br />
<br />
However, were I to compare them as a main aggro weapon, I really would have to pick BoC over GBoS.  Maybe I'm crazy here, but BoC is just better at aggro on higher level mobs.  Its especially nice because the hate cannot be resisted.  (Yes, i know that even if the mob is unstunnable, the stun still causes the same amount of aggro, but some mobs resist the entire proc, which IMO is not as great aggro as landed DD and resisted stun)<br />
<br />
Anyways, thats just My 2cp.  I'm looking forward to throwing a dmg increasing augment on both those weapons, hehe.</div></div><hr />

It doesnt proc nearly as often as it used too IMHO.<br />
That all said, all the warriors in my guild who have both those swords all weild BoC in main hand over the GBoS.<br />

<br />
agro is most important right at the start, i know which one i would mainhand in hopes of an early proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please parse before you talk about &quot;proc rates&quot;.  All of this is useless speculation if you don't parse to confirm your suspicions.  There is no way you can seriously compare proc rates just by grouping unless you parse or at least count procs on a long series of fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish I could parse and compare the results and compare them to an old parse on the BoC. The thing is the tests would be so radically different that you couldnt compare them as I am referring to when I was level 58 and now at 65.<br />
To me a warrior at 65 with higher skills, and better gear stat adds should proc more.<br />
I am certain it doesnt proc as it used to. Of course, all of this is based on the broken agro that warriors currently have versus the agro I know I used to generate.<br />
My apologies..my comment was simply based on a feeling and what I know to be true.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is the real info from a parse of me using BoC mainhand and GBoS offhand in BoT.  I also was swapping out primal every once in a while for avatar procs in the offhand, but anyways this was the best log I had.<br />
<br />
Number of BoC procs: 196 (mainhand)<br />
Number of GBoS procs: 77 (offhand)<br />
Number of Avatar procs: 20 (offhand)<br />
<br />
I dont have ambidex but from looking at this parse the BoC procs ~2 times as much as the GBoS and primal warsword combined when the BoC is in the mainhand.  Since I sorta figure that my main hand swings ~2 times as often as my offhand I bet that the GBoS and BoC proc rates are exactly the same.<br />
<br />
For those of you who think that GBoS in the offhand procs just as much as BoC in the mainhand, well the parses don't lie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be noted that 14/18 generates more dps than a 15/20 , factor in the damage from proc's and the gbos has a distinct dps advantage. Personally i hate relying on procs to hold aggro , dps aggro is much more reliable. The lower delay means more damage bonus from the gbos also . Its a no brainer to me , gbos mainhand , boc offhand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately that parse doesn't tell us much.<br />
<br />
If my memory serves, Safehouse did a systematic test of proc rates about a year ago (along with most other aspects of melee), and found that the same weapon procs much less in the offhand - less than can be accounted for just by the swing rate.  Offhand rate was something like 30% or 40% of mainhand rate.  It would be nice to have that info handy, but I have terrible luck finding results when searching the Safehouse, and I suspect the information has expired by now in any case.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see a parse of mainhand GBOS vs. mainhand BOC, and yes the speculation is of little value as I admitted in my first post.  It is clear, for example, that CHSD procs less often than GBOS, but by how much I can only speculate without a parse.  I'll try to find time to parse it, but it would be nice to see a parse of BOC vs. GBOS (in the same hand) too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sassinak is right, you need to parse both weapons main hand to have a more accurate comparison. In this case, this is the test I would do -<br />
<br />
Parse 1 hour with BoC main, then switch weapons and parse 1 hour with GBoS main.<br />
<br />
Then I would count 2 things - the number of total procs with each weapon mainhand and the number of total swings for each weapon mainhand. This will not only give us a raw # of procs to compare, but also a # of procs/swing for each weapon.<br />
<br />
You will need to make sure that you have the same buffs for the entire duration of both tests. I would recommend NOT using an avatar proc because it is one more variable that can skew results. If you must have avatar, get it from a shaman and don't let it fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm interesting idea about offhand weapons procing less for some other reason besides fewer swings.  I had never heard of that before.  It was my general understanding, however, that all weapons procced ~2 times per minute except for a few select few weapons that have modified proc rates such as Bloodfrenzy, BBoTE and of course the insane procing cleric summoned hammers.  <br />
<br />
If you believe this, that except for the oddball increased proc rate weapons, that all weapons proc at the same rate than my data makes perfect sense.  If you count up total swings your mainhand will have 2/3 of the total swings and your offhand will have about 1/3 of the total swings.  The data I posted shows that if you add up all the total procs from mainhand and offhand that mainhand is about 2/3 of the total procs and offhand is about 1/3 of the total procs, suggesting that BoC procs at about the same rate as GBoS / Primal.<br />
<br />
I admit the test I did wasnt ideal but I wasn't really running I test I was just xping in BoT like I always do and I had a log sitting around.  That said I feel that my agro is more reliable with BoC mainhand and GBoS offhand, despite the admitted dps advantage that GBoS has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think only the mainhand can do a triple attack , so that would be a factor as well.<br />

Bagged GBoS and i plan not to ever wield it again. It never proc'd for me like you all say it does.<br />
Usually Hammer in offhand will proc once in the very first seconds of the fight to give me aggro then maybe a second time then i'd get a proc from BoC to make the mob (raid boss or xp trash) permenently stick to me.<br />
Before having the BoC i used hammer over GBoS of course :)<br />
But that's just me, dont take my words for truth hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I don't believe this.  There is no way that willsapper = primal = CHSD = GBOS = CHOS = BOC in proc rates.  but I will try to back up my belief with parses before I criticize your data any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's been stated that the majority of weapons basically proc 2 times per minute....with things like the cleric hammer being an exception, so yes, the majority of weapons do all have the same proc rate</div></div><hr />

Myself and another 65 warrior grouped. I asked him to tank. I dual wielded GBoS and Copper Hammer of Striking. He went with BoC and CHSD. He couldn't get the mobs off me...</div></div><hr />

The dps agro from the gbos is a nice thign to start out with while you are waiting for a proc.  <br />
<br />
On a boss fight I usually start off with gbos in primary and then when either BoC or Gbos proc I call assist and put BoC in primary and Gbos in secondary.</div></div><hr />

I felt the same way about the CHSD, I bagged that the day I got it.  I could never get that thing to proc when I needed it to.  GBoS was in my mainhand/BoC in offhand until recently.  Grats me on my new BF :)</div></div><hr />
