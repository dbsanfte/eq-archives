(for someone that doenst have AHR gloves /Sky Orb)<br />
<br />
I'll only be able to get 1 range ... so its :  <br />
Symbol / Orb Protection/ Quarm Stone <br />
<br />
So its kinda of a dilema ...  Procs vs Defence vs Stats/Atk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of our Wars just got one a few days ago.  He hasn't really said anything about it since.  I'll try and ask him tonight.  <br />
<br />
He's the first in guild (surprised me) to get any kind of stun/proc item... somehow either the one's with VT stuff didn't want them at the time (cause they didn't taunt) or those with them have quit.<br />
<br />
Talked to him tonight and he says that he loves it 'it truely does pwn' was his comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's my favorite item by far. It's clickable from inventory so there's no problem switching in a bow. It procs all the time and the added aggro is a huge plus. <br />
<br />
Put it this way, it's noticeable when the effect fades mid fight and the mob suddenly turns on the rogue. It reminds me of losing haste mid fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda hard to answer, but will try:<br />
<br />
Its not an agro &quot;miracle&quot; cure, but yes it is noticeable and a nice additional help. I dont think its quite as much hate as 1 EB proc, 30-50% or so would be my guess. <br />
<br />
1 proc wont make a mob snap to you or be enough to counter a slow, but 2 in a row might. <br />
<br />
Its very handy to use if you are second in a MT rotation and you want to stay #2 on the agro list. <br />
<br />
If getting the AHR gloves is out of the question, then I dont think you will be sorry about buying Symbol. It can give that little extra oomph when you need it. And you can always retire it to cast from inventory at a later point, so its not like it will ever be a total waste.<br />
<br />
The proc rate is decent, it procs a tad more than the nightmares proc on my vanazir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have the symbol but I do have the AHR gloves and I can confirm that the aggro from them is quite significant.  I haven't seen the proc rate on BF/HG/BoW so I don't know how it compares to those but it procs MUCH more often than BoC.  I would estimate that I get more aggro from the gloves than from the proc on both BoC and Blackout combined.  Totally worth it and I would say the gloves are my best item hands down because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is very well worth getting the Saryrn Ranged, you will definitely notice it and it definitely helps hold aggro.  Wouldnt trade mine for any other ranged in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An extra dd+stun proc on all weapons is gonna do a damn sight more for your 'tanking' manifesto than any other item of armor, with the possible exception of Raex BP. You'll also probably do more DPS in raids and exp groups than the 50atk from Quarm range would give, even assuming you're far enough away from worn atk cap to benefit from all of it. Proc rate seems independant of weapon latent procs rate (eg: you'll get more Call of Fire procs/minute than EB procs), possibly because it's hardcoded proc rate is tailored more for 1handers (since it's a ranger spell)<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm even considering the Teir 4 range with avoidance over the Quarm range. Got a few other things to get first, but 10 avoidance is a very hard thing to ignore if you already have an addition proc rightclick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kildace</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's own.<br />
I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also love mine.  Unfortunately i must go take a shower now for agreeing with a frenchman :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrimsonBanshee</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the symbol  but it can also cause  agro issues  it you are not attentive.  I  tank third  for my guild.  I use  a BoW atm  MT  is Atten Gloves  and Vanazir atm  Second tank  uses  BoW  and  Symbol aswell .   I have noticed that if i  start attacking  at say 96% without symbol and  then  click symbol in  after  first tank goes down  or  92%  if he stays up i have no agro issues.   But   if  i go in at 100% and  have the symbol  on  a couple  procs  back to back   im stealin  agro    its a nice  toy   just  have to be awake and count procs and its  a sure nice addition to  a BoW.<br />
<br />
 As far as the  VZ  orb  over it  if you  dont have a  agro  proc  i would personally  get teh  Symbol   i belive that if you cant   keep agro  the avoidance  wont help  when you not  tanking<br />
<br />
  just my  2 cents</div></div><hr />
