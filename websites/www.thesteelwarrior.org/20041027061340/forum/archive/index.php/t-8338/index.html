<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">An interesting question was brought up on the sony boards in frod's thread.<br />
<br />
Why do you raid? What would make it more enjoyable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like to raid because I enjoy the content, and love to take on the most powerful creatures/forces in Norrath and Everquest.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the victory and fun of it, and because the most powerful beings in Norrath have the most powerful treasures in Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Raided for fun and friends, items of course. Fun has been sapped out of it, for me I doubt there's anyway to restore it. GoD hasn't helped that fact, nor has a better job then former. I can't raid much anymore cept weekends, but even on weekends i'd rather sleep in then get up and waste 5 hours in eq bored out of my ass in a raid. Only keep acc's active for few friends pretty much, doubt that will last much past the fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like to raid for a few reasons (Voted other as no other choice adequately represents my postiion) ------&gt;<br />
<br />
~I like to succeed with my friends<br />
~I like to see new content<br />
~I like the problem-solving aspect of figuring out a new encouner<br />
~I like the rush i get when we succeed and/or wipe<br />
~I like the progression (new zones and gear)<br />
<br />
A lot of the choices you presented imply that raiding is a chore ... and i'm not sure i agree with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats what &quot;other&quot; and I like it for other reasons are for :D<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get this nailed down, I'm surprised this hasn't come up before now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I liken a raid to a puzzle, and I like being a part of the solution to the puzzle.   The more intricate the raid, the more complex the puzzle, the better.<br />
<br />
I like killing things that requires a force to work together to defeat<br />
<br />
I like the treasures found from the mightiest creatures</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like raiding for figuring out strategies and beating hard new mobs.  I don't like loot farming, but I do it to get to the next level.  I hate zones like VT where there's nothing but loot farming and none of the mobs are challenging even the first time you kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like raiding mostly:<br />
1)To be a meaningful  part of a team of good people in eq.<br />
2)My wife and I love seeing new stuff and interesting mobs/places.<br />
3)I'm sentimental about the warrior class now and I like tanking big bad mobs for my guild.<br />
<br />
Roughly in that order...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I concur with apoloyon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I detest grinding experiance or AP's. While a good group going after named mobs can be entertaining, the fights are generally too straight forward.<br />
<br />
In contrast I like almost everything about raiding.<br />
<br />
I like to MA/Plow tank with 3 assist buttons and sight checking mobs. I like participating in the movement of a guild through an area when complications might well occur and everybody has to be our their toes.<br />
<br />
I like add tanking, straight melee, and the complexity of some fights.<br />
<br />
It's easy, but I like the brutality of the Zoo event in QVic. I enjoy the level of difficulty of Uqua - it was by far the hardest thing I had ever done in the game and it's not just stuffing AoW in the corner.<br />
<br />
Unlike Brutul, I even like farming. Every single item someone gets I'm cheered. It's the pay off for sometimes an incredible amount of coordinated effort in previous gatekeeper content.<br />
<br />
I thought and I thought about what I don't like about raiding. All I could come up with was:<br />
<br />
1. Failing at the same event for the 15th+ time. It happens.<br />
2. Bad itemization.<br />
3. In the dim past (never in my current guild) loot arguments and bad feelings.<br />
<br />
BTW the PoP EP/PoTime raid progression is unbelievable. It surprises me to say although there's not nearly as much content, GoD might be better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd have to say what kills raiding for me is the numbers needed, I'd rather work with a tightnet group of 24-30 than 50ish or more and the backflagging/farming.<br />
<br />
If those 2 things didn't pack a 1 2 punch I would raid ALOT more then I do now but farming the mob 100 times just sounds boring to me.</div></div><hr />

since lag makes me hate raiding i think its the loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like raiding because female characters get neked while looting their bodies. I like pixalated boobies.</div></div><hr />

These are my favorite events, at least when you win on the 16th.  I'm always disappointed when we beat something on our first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like to raid for other..<br />
<br />
I Like to see and do new things. I would have got bored and quit a long time ago if all I ever did was single group stuff.<br />
<br />
The loot is just a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sometimes it's for loot, sometimes it's for friends, sometimes it's just to see something new. There's no one OVERRIDING reason why I enjoy raids.<br />
<br />
 If there are downsides to raiding, it's racing guilds/groups much farther progressed than yours for content they pretty much don't need. A lot of stuff also takes raw power and numbers my guild can't come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Corinav was our hardest challenge yet.Lacking in ae and ranged dps it was a really hard go we wiped many times.Putting him down was an awsome feeling although relief was uppermost in my mind hehe.We did RC yesterday first try in 2hrs 20 min.I died on the last non mez got rezzed in,the gl and tank of the moment promptly died and I jumped back on the mob unbuffed.Got speed (forgot lev at this point doh) and we raced the clock back through the unmez's to where we were holding the mezzed ones.Hit the water swimming and had sa call engage on the first unmez..he died...got back and plowed through the last with the HOTT showing robes tanking 50 pct + hehe and we won.Winning like that while learning on the fly and stuff being fresh is great too.I like solvng the puzzles,but, getting the last little out of place cog tidied away can be a lot of work.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy raiding because it's rewarding, much more challenging then single group encounters, and a much better &quot;fun factor&quot; for me.<br />
<br />
Raiding pwnz!</div></div><hr />

I raid because I suck ass at EQ and there are more people to make up for my poor play, but I'm ashamed to admit it publicly, tho thru the anonymonity of the internet, I will in this poll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Cute, Haass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I enjoy raiding for the sense of accomplishment and progression. I tried joining a guild that was slightly ahead of where I was, and since I didn't really know them well, I experienced neither the sense of accomplishment or progression. Needless to say I quit them, started my own guild, and am enjoying myself much more, despite being much lower end content wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>arlakisd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">People are free to have their own opinions. Haass is as welcome to his as anyone else.<br />
That said That is a funny option. not one I'd choose but it is funny.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to say I'm the best monk ever. I screw up all the time. But usually it's me that pays the price for that. Except in Tipt.. Cleric dies even on good pulls and you can drop.<br />
Wasting everyone's time like deep seb once upon a time. CR wasn't fun then Not at all. <br />
 But CR's are too hard. Admittedly no one naked can match the mobs we arre fighting now. <br />
<br />
But the thrill in some ways is gone. <br />
<br />
That's why I like raiding I love Uqua even if it's the most frusterating zone in the game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'd much prefer to do things in a 2-4 group scenario, so the  large raid numbers required disappoints me.  As does the cookie cutter zones and mobs. <br />
&quot;Oh wow, look at that mastruuq! And that Kyv, and that Noc.......Oh wait, I have been, in every zone for the last 6 months (at least it feels that long).<br />
Obviously the rewards are always nice (who doesn't like payday?)<br />
I do enjoy seeing new things and beating really challenging targets for the first time.<br />
<br />
I know that larger numbers allow the designers to  create more complex encounters, but in my experience, it usually means that a successful guilds needs to operate in a more militaristic type manner, which also saps the fun away at times, hence the reason why I prefer smaller encounters. much easier to manage 12-24 people than 54-72.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The single most fun thing to me about raiding is not any of the following:<br />
<br />
01) the loot<br />
02) the time you spend sitting around doing nothing but rag on your compatriots<br />
03) the wipes<br />
04) the CRs<br />
05) the herding of cats<br />
06) the late people,<br />
07) inattentive people,<br />
08) the one person who never quite seems to understand that &quot;stay on the wall&quot; (or any other specific instruction) doesn't mean &quot;stay somewhat close to the wall&quot;<br />
09) spawnchecking<br />
10) the lag<br />
11) all the pretty colors and lights<br />
12) seeing content I've never seen before (but close)<br />
13) or anything else BUT THIS:<br />
<br />
Watching the coordination of 24 to 72 people all working for a specific set of goals where everyone has to be contributing if you're gonna win consistently.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Karlea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I used to raid cause I liked the fact of seeing new things and slaying stronger foes and the general touch it has to &quot;get stronger&quot;. <br />
<br />
But after a year of raiding I can't stand it anymore. I only go on raiding (only one in guild to never miss a single one) cause I'm dedicated to my guild and me leaving or quitting raids would weaken it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>TheHuzMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I voted for the smaller numbers, primarily for the idea that raids could form faster if they were built around 32 people instead of 72. Also triples your chance of getting a moron who'll kill the raid when you have to gather 72 people. <br />
<br />
I love the big fights and new loots, but the hours sitting around kill me. Since most of the raids I'm doing now are open flag raids, I get way more &quot;sitting around&quot; than fighting and looting right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gundahar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Why do you raid? What would make it more enjoyable? <br />
<br />
That's simple - cause there was nothing else left once you reached 60 and death penalty didn't matter anymore. Needed a year for me till SoL got released and during this time we had learn to play without leveling up in xp-groups.<br />
<br />
So raiding is always fun ? Heck no, it's more tedious and straining but only way for charakter-progression and gaining access to new zones. The reasons I still play after all these years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I like to raid to see big mobs, mobs that most people are too afraid of fighting, dead.<br />
<br />
I get a bigger thrill out of killing mobs most people never see then I do out of getting loot. And if I get to MA? Icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I use to like raiding.  Usually about the first 2 times of a raid in a new place are the most fun.  You might sneak in a 3rd time if you go to another place in the zone.  After that, it becomes so repetative and redundent that it bores most folks.  If only you could fully equip your raid force in 2-3 raids, that would be ideal.<br />
<br />
Then your raid force can move on to newer things and not get stuck in doing stuff that bores people.  There would be a new zone every or every other week.<br />
<br />
But my problem was my job/moving/RL issues and that cut my time that I could spend on EQ down to a minimal.  To raid and progress, you would REQUIRE a LOT of time spent online, which a lot of us cannot afford.  <br />
<br />
So my last few weeks on EQ were spent with friends.  Doing occasional raids or fights kept things interesting till my month was up.  Other than that, you need to devote a lot of time to raid and play EQ to get anywhere.  Only if I quit my job, get someone to support me, and play all day would I want to go back to playing EQ.  It just takes that much time because casual gamers get the shaft.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Those grapes are probably sour anyway.&quot;, said the fox.<br />
<br />
I have a shock for you Haas. The most complex encounters and difficult content is found in raids. While the EP's and PoTime hinted at just how challanging a raid could be, GoD is something else again particularly with 54 maximum player content. Believe me, you can't zerg Uqua or afaik Inkta'Tu.<br />

Nothing beats that feeling.  You dont need a raid force to do it, but there is more to do in EQ with one.  I also like it when folks from guilds who are balls deep in the latest expansion stfu cause my guild killed something they never thought we'd be able to do.  Yea, that rocks pretty hard too.</div></div><hr />

Damned straight. But you gotta understand that in Battleblade's world, every person he raids with his an excellent EQ player and gives their 100% at all time.  Going AFK is a cardinal sin.<br />

I'm plenty rational.  I just don't buy into the bullshit that some people here spew about how great and talented they are, and how they're better people, and smarter too, all because they raid in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">OK Haass I am sorry but it did not come across that way.<br />

2. Not all Raiding Guilds are the same.<br />
3. Going AFK will get people killed <br />
4. Yes everyone makes mistakes but a insiginificant mistake in a Raid is much much more likely to cause massive deaths than in a group. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Ikkinz Trials are pretty complex for single group encounters, particularly Malevolant Priests.   Heck, even the 6 man Qinimi BiC event is damn fun.   Now that I think about it, the damn PoJ trials are pretty cool and complex for a 6 man group.<br />
<br />
In other words, there's 6 man content that's tricky and requires coming up with solutions for.   <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Uqua really does force a new level of concentration on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I just don't buy into the bullshit that some people here spew about how great and talented they are, and how they're better people, and smarter too, all because they raid in EQ.<br />
lol EQ's bearing on RL would be akin to where you went to school.  While you're going its all anyone cares about.  When you get into the real world, no one really gives a shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">It's become cool to be the lone guy or individual who is obviously self reliant and plays his part exceedingly well with his small group of friends.Thats kewl.In a xp group you can only do so much though.Raiding is a bigger challenge to actually win against appropiate content mobs.EQ was designed this way.Yeah some people will slack(it's rare I see anyone slacking when things are going hard on one of our raids...trivial easy stuff sure some folks are probably grabbin a soda or finishing a friendly tell instead of applying themselves)but most won't and cannot in order to win.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'm smarter or more leet than Haass.There are ,however,many challenges raiders  face that don't really apply in xp groups.Raiding does force people to learn new skills and improve some others.This doesn't mean that a practiced LDON group won't be far more efficient in their environment than a bunch of raiders on their time off who don't normally LDON togeather.It does mean that raiders are forced to grow in ways not required of  group players.Yeah, there's lots of sucky raiders playing in ep+ guilds.I bet there are more sucky players playing outside ep+raid guilds  tho.I think most raiders that have supported guilds long term through raid content would say they have had to learn and adapt otw.For most it's not mindless /assist stuff whatever you believe.At least not where and when we raid.<br />
<br />
Social challenges are also a part of EQ like it or not.No one needs to suck up to anyone to become a member of our guild.They do need to show a good attitude when stuff gets rough and doesn't go their way tho.All the people I know are too busy trying to win on a lot of our raids to bother sucking up and that behaviour is not appreciated.<br />
<br />
When we group in god or wherever it honestly feels like slack time after raiding  hehe.Even in tipt when im pulling and tanking theres only such much going on that I can react to.I usually have lots of time to clown and exercise my gimp typing skills.Raiding takes more effort from me.I do both and I often find grouping more fun...but easier.My wife is a 65 shammy in my guild,you should see her on raids hehe.She never grouped until she was 65 only duoed with me when she was online.She has more time raiding then grouping,but, finds raiding far more stressful and effort requiring.She groups with us all the time in GOD and it's easy for her by comparison.Haass has a serious bias .<br />
<br />
In no way do i think being a raider automatically makes some one elite or highly skilled.I do think raiding with a guild  from velious to time/god is far more challenging for good players than grouping in droga,bot,LDON,tactics,GOD etc.etc.Do some people get free rides through content and others hide in the crowd ...I'm sure they do.If the majority of our guild did that and only followed instruction blindy we wouldn't have made ep's nevermind time.<br />
<br />
I'm not ringing my bell.I'm just stating my truth that I have experienced in eq.You start out soloing &lt; then grouping&lt; then raiding that is progression in eq in terms of play experience and ability.If ex raiders or perma groupers want to group forver and not raid that's fine and there should be a path for them.It is not the main progression path in eq though,not since kunark at least I imagine.Yeah, i'm sure the balance has swung to the raid game quite a bit since epics.More emphasis on grouping content would be good imo.<br />
<br />
Non of this is a judgement on greatness ,talent or any other personal trait players may enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I&quot;m just here to counteract the bullshit spewed by random people around here who think that raiding should be the only way of obtaining any gear better than an orc pawn pick.  I won't argue most of your list, except number 4.<br />
<br />
A minor, minor targetting mistake in a 6 man group will usually lead to your CC's death, which will usually lead to you popping up in the nexus next to your buddies going &quot;Damn...what the hell just happened?&quot;   I really can not believe that 72 people vs 1 mob (The majority of fights) is as concentration intensive as single group encounters.<br />
<br />
You might have some basis for your argument on multi mob encounters such as Rathe and whatnot, but the VAST majority of raid targets are one mob...and it's pretty easy to limit the chaos if you have any idea what you're doing whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Now, on to the next guy who actually wants to have a valid discussion.<br />

<br />
I'm curious, could you give me some examples of this?  I'm wondering what exactly you learn that &quot;normal&quot; people wouldn't be able to do.  I base this question on knowing that up until recently, most mobs were the same fight, with a minor, minor twist to them (AE, stun, knockback, banish, DT, etc.)<br />
<br />
What skills exactly have you developed as a result of your raiding schedule that you could not have if you weren't in a guild similar to your current one?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's funny.  Once you get a family you realize how fucking important EQ ISN'T.  I'm sure raiding every nite from 5-9pm may seem exciting for the socially impaired, but normal people do have activities to attend to that do not involve the computer.<br />

IMHO if you are on the bleeding edge this is true.  But if you are like 99pct of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds this means you are executing strategies you've culled/read/stolen from someone else's experience.  <br />
<br />
Somehow most folks seem to equate training a bunch of dogs to run together and jump through the right hoops at the right time based on someone else's playbook as the &quot;most complex and hard encounters&quot;.  This is organizationally complex but its not exactly intellectually or skill complex.<br />
<br />
I used to love to raid but the massive zerg-corpoartions that are most high end guilds lead to alot of dead weight and/or waste/or just blatant unchecked favortism (lets not forget you dont really need more than 5 solid warrs)...my favorite raid size is about 24.<br />

People will out grow EQ. Every day it happens. Many here will tell you that they only play for their friends.  I quit the game was happy I came back because of friends. I'm actually enjoying the game, The Rat race. I see it far clearer than I used to but it doesn't matter. Doom 3 is a different rat race one I can't do nearly as well in. So I gravitate to what I enjoy and can have a reasonable degree of sucess. You don't feel like you can suceed so I do recommend that you take a step back and stop paying for your account (Which if I have read correctly you've done) and play other things, do other things. Maybe enjoyment for what EQ is will come back maybe it won't but blaming others for your lack of enjoyment is unfair. <br />
<br />
You don't like What eq has evolved into You want to be only of 6 that Kicks ass and takes names. That's good for you. That's what you want. What about others? I've never said parts of the &quot;Complaint&quot; aren't valid.  The problem I have is that the complaints issues are that there are 50 billion complaints and all of them are saying different things. Except these 2 points GOD is TOO hard. (I can't buy this for people that won't even go are saying this. ) and that LDoN is too Boring. (Too long I'll agree) And they could have designed it MUCH better. <br />
Limits as to what can be done have allways existed. Solo you can do X amount, Duo Y group Z amount Raid AA amount. Blaming Raiders for doing stuff they want to is about as silly as me blaming those with families for WANTING to spend their time doing family things.<br />
It's Not about who's better. At least not to me. It's about how people choose.</div></div><hr />

You're mistaking my seething rage directed at idiocy for hatred for the game.<br />
<br />
I don't like what the game turned into right before I quit (before GoD was launched).  For you to be able to advance, you needed to be in a 70 man raid to get thru RZ, and RZ is NEVER going to be a low numbers encounter.  I hear things are different now, so I'm gonna check em out.<br />
<br />
Now, what you're seeing here is me putting my foot in the ass of anyone who thinks that because they can follow the instructions of the usually 1 person who knows what's going on in their guild, that they're better EQ players than me and deserve more.  It's simply not true.  If they wanna come here and have an honest discussion about the game, then we need to drop the egos, drop the bullshit, and then we can talk about raider vs non raider problems.  Until then, it's just gonna be a &quot;Look, my dick is bigger than yours because I fuck more women than you do because you're ugly, quite frankly&quot; thread, and that's not productive.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I'm curious, could you give me some examples of this?  I'm wondering what exactly you learn that &quot;normal&quot; people wouldn't be able to do.  I base this question on knowing that up until recently, most mobs were the same fight, with a minor, minor twist to them (AE, stun, knockback, banish, DT, etc.)<br />
<br />
What skills exactly have you developed as a result of your raiding schedule that you could not have if you weren't in a guild similar to your current one?<br />
<br />
Well let me begin by saying I do not consider whether a person is presently raiding or not  at all relavent to the use of the term &quot;normal&quot;.I've only been playing eq for about a year and a half and I'm pretty sure you have a fair amount of raid experience pre pop.I also don't consider the basic execution of any class skills particularily challenging to anyone with some play experience.To better understand some of these basic skills I often read the old board where you,Brutul and Isk were very helpful btw.I don't personally distinquish playing skill ,or, knowledge of class at all between raiders and those who are presently not raiding.Experience with certain encounters and playing environments be it LDON or GOD will advantage players greatly in those situations of course.As well the raiding environment takes some experience to be functional within.A lot of hardcore ambitious raiders play a lot of hours in very high paced environments so do tend learn skill more quickly than non raiders.As we play a restricted schedule and are a very easy going bunch I don't apply this advantage to our raiders in anywhere near the same qoutient as I would for more hardcore type guilds.<br />
<br />
As far as challenge gos basic tanking skills are easy to master and what creates difficulty is the environment they are applyed in.In a group setting the varibles are  highly limited.There is normally one tank with one to two healers focused on him and possibly limited crowd control to coordinate with.You pull 1-7 mobs or so, your group exerts what crowd control measures it has available and you tank the rest.The function of what I can tank and how many is limited to my gear and the skill of my healers with speed and heal choice affecting aggro and survivability.<br />
<br />
In a group that is used to me and careful with early aggro expenditure I can consolidate and tank 3-4 solro trash mobs with fair reliability.The most important aspect is debuffs coming in behind my  switches and the mobs staying close to me with careful heal aggro.Still what I can do is very limited and although my attention is focused on the 4 mobs to a degree there is not much thought or extra awareness required.There is no ae,rampage serious dots,mana drain,dangerous push,ticking clock,50 people with dps/debuff aggro,or incoming red monster from hell to watch out for.Also simply coordinating tasks with 6 folks is way easier than 50+.<br />
<br />
Tipt may be the most dangerous place I group in at the moment...the place my group is most likely to fail.Becuase mobs hit harder there a mistake with cc,pet break,heal aggro,or bad pulls can quickly wipe my groups.However, there is only so much I am reacting to there.I generally single pull the majority or get one add to mez.If I don't pretarget the incoming mez for the chanter than he off assists me or simply uses my targeting ring(weee HOTT/target rings hehe :) ) and locks down the add. Then well I erm tank and break the next one in normal fashion and so on.Perhaps if I am pulling,or ,we are low dps group movement in coordination with spawns takes a lil sense.Mostly the healer has to be on the ball and we gtg till I slack and train the group.Again, only worrying about 1 to 2 mobs without any real threatening special abilities makes my job pretty simple.<br />
<br />
In both situations above after I have pulled and have slow aggro done(kinda automatic now) I can relax and chat(my typin skillz sux) and really it's fun but mellow and non stressful.Er my clerics might not agree. :o <br />
<br />
Lately, we've started doing hard ldon without cc.That's kinda fun and tests my pulling a fair bit.I learned there are some rooms just better to pass by altogeather hehe.Still I can't do too much.I decide whether to risk a cleric pacify and the method of pulling out the rooms,or, whether to die away from the group.The tanking is still simple and if i get 3 or less it's pretty much a repitition of the old switch targets to cover slow and heal aggro and mow one down at a time.<br />
<br />
K... really I've given a story of examples instead of answering Haass's direct question.Honestly, I think the most basic aspects of class skills are easily learned.What provides some challenge is the ability to coordinate those skills with others in increasingly difficult environments.A soloer is more likely to have much tougher struggles with the same mob a group plows down.Does that mean that no extra experience or skill is required to work well in a group?Of course not.The amount of variables in play with one person soloing a mob are far less than a group engaging an environment equally tough for them.The same is true with a raid force.As groups grow in size and they engage trivial encounters for them is their more waste than with the soloer?I would say yes because coordination of effort becomes more difficult the more people that are involved.<br />
<br />
The easiest place we raid now is fire.If stuff is up we'll go there and clear all the named in short order.I usually have furious up for one encounter per plane.We pull the named now with adds and if the clerics are focused when the mob hits camp we are likely to win easily whether i have a disc up or not.Clearing to Fennin requires more attention and effort from me then any chain pull group I have ever been in.Everything is magnafied.POE and POA rings are similar.Lots of incoming mobs very fast with a varying selection of targets that sometimes require special handling.POW is just a sucky tanking environment.If the pullers out pull me then looking for my next target in a crowd of 50+ people who may not do everything perfectly can wear a guy out hehe.Push, aggro and mob effects are often complicating factors in these places beyond the group experience and can break raids.Of course those are the easy targets...<br />
<br />
Pop flagging was set up with a ladder of targets to overcome opening up environments to farm behind them to get ready for the next set of flag targets.Depending on your guld structure Xeg,Coirnav and the Rathe will test you and many individual members of your raid force considerably.I've seen several guilds break against these targets and disband in my limited eq experience.<br />
<br />
The skills i would not have developed without my guild go to coordination and communication.The ability to anticipate consequence to raid force activity and do what i can to mitigate it.The situational awareness that all raiders need to prioratize their efforts based upon the flow of the encounter.Healers and cc people are often forced to make rapid decisions involving many targets.#3 tank assisting the ma in one moment must catch the added unmezz that just came out of the blue on his way to pwn the clerics and hope he gets enough heals to do it.Alot of raids run under a timer and or have many adds that can cause a wipe if improperly handled.Often one persons actions(beyond just the rl and ma) can be pivotal many times in a raid imo.A mistake can easily cause a wipe that it takes hours to recover ground from or days with blowable spawns.<br />
<br />
I can see the social aspects of a raiding guild also being very challenging especially for younger folks.Stuff often doesn't go the way you want it.From the raid timings and hours involved,to little bobby giving you a hard time or winning the loot you wanted,or worse;apparently marginalizing your efforts among your peers mistakenly.EQ is a social game and raiding guilds take it to it's highest level.You can accomplish and see more of the game with good company that makes off raid hours more fun as well.Solo&lt;Group&lt;Raid.<br />
<br />
I know many people have had differant experiences with guilds and raiding.I'm lucky.When Stromm opened we moved there to play the game from the ground up with other people on the same footing.We got to do lots of old world quests along the way and enjoy a little bit of old school eq.I didn't play eq before there were POK  books.In my first serious lasting guild I have been predominantly sa then ma .Also I have been very lucky with the quality of leadership and members I've been able to see stuff with.Of course I have my wife with me as well who everyone likes and she loves playing her shammy.So it's easy for me to have a good opinion of the possiblities inherant in soe's raid game.We have adjusted our rl schedule somewhat to suit our hobby and I've gained about 30lbs...ulp.I prefer old world eq and velious to other expansions in quality and texture,although I am most often in pop and god now.<br />
<br />
I posted in this thread because like Haass, I am sentimental about eq in spite of some of the things soe has done.It's the only game thats really sucked me in since D&amp;D 25 years ago.I know there's a lot of pitiful pick up raids and guilds learning the ropes out there.I just think raiding deserves a better deal then it's often given in these threads.I don't think raiders are anymore skilled at regular play than non raiders.There is no &quot;leet&quot; attachment to raiding for me.There is more challenge though.Taking a guild from wacking kael giants to time with gear they earn on their own is a pretty tough and very fun achievment for the players who worked to get there.<br />
<br />
PS.As I've posted many times I'd like to see more content brought in for the 65 bazaar/ornate crowd.I'd like to see more emphasis on the non raid game with interesting, immersive group content of better than LDON quality...erp sry.I think level 70 will begin the mudflation ep thing on it's own and would like the pop expansion to stay as is.Sorry,sometimes I'm not good at short to the point answers hehe. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">This is just a game.It's about fun.More effort and time with the aid of friends similarily contributing will get you farther than logging in whenever is convienant and wacking some mobs after you find a group.There's nothing leet about it.Anyone can do it given the desire and a decent attitude.When I was on courses in the infantry that passed less than 30 pct of the proffesional apps ...that was kinda elite.Still it was about drive(read desire) more than anything.Hopefully, they make the game fun for everyone without nerfing stuff stupid and undermining everyones past efforts.I like fun...I just want the game to have the integrity of it's design some reasonable vision and not bend to the wailing of every pocket book screaming &quot;unfair&quot;.Just put the bloody rules out and stick by them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started raiding in EQ because as a monk you hit a ceiling gear-wise. And it's a pretty piss poor ceiling. Tradable gear quality for plate classes continued on for a bit but monks ended up being capped (I'm talking, like AC 20 BPs being the best tradable BPs monks could get back then, and what not).<br />
<br />
So to make any improvement in my character at all, I was forced to raid.<br />
<br />
It kind of sucked. I never did like the large-scale raiding that EQ ended up turning into. I liked smaller scale stuff. 1 to 3 group encounters. Kunark ... Velious. Really tight groups, where you knew your people, and you depended on them. And where you didn't need a huge monstrous roster, filled with healers, just to get enough regular turnout to raid regularly.<br />
<br />
Ah well, I've rambled too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it true there are leeches? Sure. Think of your guild - you know who they are. EVERYONE knows who they are and they get whats coming to them in the end. The swap from 72, to 36 eliminated a ton of them, going back to 54 allowed us to add some quality players. When I'm on a raid and I see people who are not only &quot;ffollowing instructions&quot; but are improvising as the situation changes, you can't convince me that these aren't qality players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about the facts that show that the majority of the high end players aren't slackers? And no I don't believe all high players are slackers, but I know for a fact, because I've known some of the players, that not every high player busts their ass and is a highly competant EQ professional.  That's just a silly fallacy.<br />
<br />
There are, beyond a shadow of a doubt, high end players who suck.  Maybe you can rightfully claim that your guild is free of such players.  And maybe they've managed to disguise themselves well enough to get by.  But even if your guild is free of such players, your guild isn't every high end guild.  The &quot;entitlement&quot; high end players claim they should have because they've &quot;earned&quot; it would be a lot more credible if we didn't know most high end guilds are filled with a big chunk of semi-marginal players which the truly competant players manage to carry along.  This is in fact a small slice of life, in that many organizations have a similar pattern.  There is a core of hard working truly competant individuals.  A big group of marginally competant individuals.  And a group of really horribly incommpetant individuals that for one reason or another don't get fired.  The success of the organization usually can be traced back to the ratio of competant/marginal/incompetant employees.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Haass is right about how irritating it is to read that other thread if you are a non-raiding player.<br />
A few things about this thread, though, give me pause. For example, in the other thread I find myself disagreeing with Apolyon at various points. Yet here, when he speaks about why he raids, he writes:<br />
~I like to succeed with my friends<br />
~I like to see new content<br />
~I like the problem-solving aspect of figuring out a new encouner<br />
~I like the rush i get when we succeed and/or wipe<br />
~I like the progression (new zones and gear)<br />
<br />
There's absolutely no difference in what he likes about raiding and what I like about going places with one  or two groups of my &quot;casual&quot; friends, who are far less geared up than EP raiders yet have been playing EQ since 99 or 2000.<br />
For a 9K hps/ 2000 AC warrior with 400 AAs and a similarly advanced, well-oiled group of friends backing him, of course a lot of single-group content in this game looks pretty trivial: steamroll it and move on. Eventually it's pretty easy to convince yourself that sort of content takes no skills. But for the 5.5k/1250 tank with similarly geared, but well-oiled long-time friends, the same content is going to look different. Some of it will be a significant challenge.<br />
<br />
Most--but not all, by a long stretch--of the best players I've met ingame have been raiders or former raiders. I really don't know whether this is a function of raiding making them better players, or whether better players with enough time to raid generally simply tend to raid. Probably some combination. It's been nice to meet these folks, both for the pleasure of watching them fight, and because sometimes after I fight with them for a while I get invited to go with them and their guilds to places I wouldn't otherwise be able to muster the force to see. <br />
<br />
Some really good players choose not to raid (say, the Haass category); a good many more simply don't have the time for it. In my current incarnation ( I retired a warrior shortly after Luclin came out, quit playing for some time until I got a computer that would run Luclin and PoP, heh) my real life stuff pretty much precludes playing large blocks of time or large numbers of hours. No one is going to make a game as interesting to me or as important as my 3-year-old son. Your raid starts before his bedtime? Well, good hunting to you.<br />
<br />
One consequence of my circumstances is that I meet a lot of other casual players I might not have otherwise ever even seen or known about, and some of them are very skilled (and sometimes darn eccentric) players. Necros who are ally in multiple Paladin guilds. Level 59 gnomes who are nearly 1750 tradeskillers, plus tinkering. Rangers who have done hundreds of quests of weird little quests. <br />
You wouldn't necessarily think that people who are fanatics about faction work or the minutiae of quests would be very skilled in combat. But, in my experience, they are. I think it has to do with the same impulse Apo &amp; Brutal and several others mention about raiding: the game presents a puzzle &amp; you work to figure it out. Sure, these eccentric people may not be raiding much, but the same quality of mind that makes them work out complicated game mechanics in one area doesn't just shut down when the &quot;puzzle&quot; before them is a mob. Do they know all the tricks to raiding boss mob X? Obviously not, and to that extent they do not know their class as well as some raiders do. But, the part of the game they can get to they know damn well, and I suspect they'd have no problem with the raiding learning curve. Certainly you can tell them to &quot;hug the left wall&quot; and you won't find yourself a few seconds later typing &quot;/rsay NO NO NO NOT THAT LEFT YOUR OTHER LEFT GODDAMNIT1111&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's something that I think is probably true about players who focus on any class, but might especially be true of warriors: Good warriors don't tolerate gimping their friends, and I think that's true of casual players and raiders. So, when raiders tell nonraiders that the nonraiders are lazy or fear risk or some such, it's hard for us to keep our temper. Just as when casual players say, &quot;Hitting '/assist someguyoverthere' makes you a kneepad wearing punk automaton and the fact that your kneepads are endgame kneepads doesn't change the fact that they're kneepads&quot; probably irritates some raiders.<br />
<br />
Some people in raiding guilds are sponges, but so what? Some casual players are complete retards, but so what?<br />
<br />
The biggest rush I've got in the game (if I had to pick just one) was the first time I raided naggy. Only one or two of us had seen Naggy. Maintank fell when naggy was 60%-ish, I tanked the dragon the rest of the way. I can't remember any more what I was wearing, but I'm pretty certain some of it was bronze, so somebody backing me up in similar gear must have known something about what the fuck they were doing. and they are the same casual players I play with today. <br />
<br />
But raiding isn't the only place I get a rush in the game. The final mob for my LoW was darn intense too, and it was obviously not a raid situation. Not necessarily tactics-wise, but I'd have lost the mob without the ranger helping me track, and I was risking a bunch of work I'd done over three or four weeks and the drop was going to be a big upgrade for me. Or, years later, the time my baby SK troll got purple sticked three times in an LDoN fight and everyone lived. That was a rush. Or the first time I went to Chardok with a casual guild. I think small casual guilds who go in there are taking about as much risk as anyone else in EQ, because it's hard to deal with a wipe relative to your resources. Or the first time I went to West K, to help someone I didn't know recover his corpse. He didn't know where it was exactly, just that he thought some ogres had killed him. No maps and no lightsource yet for me: had to back down the cave into Blackburrow and barely survived all the aggro I got just running through there. If we died we might never get our corpses or stuff back! If I died I wasn't sure I'd be able to get backt o my corpse and if I couldn't recover it I wasn't sure I'd have the heart to do all the work necessary to replace my leather gear (gack, lol: I'm quite serious).<br />
<br />
A wise warrior will be careful who he lectures about risk and who he lectures about knowing game mechanics, just as he will be careful about who he lectures about riding other people's coattails and who he lectures about being an automaton.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A similar feeling can well come from a good group and here it is extremely noticeable.  Still, for me, a raidforce that actually gels and works well together with confidence is incredibly satisfying.  Sadly the opposite is an exercise in sheer frustration for me and far more common.  No guild I've ever seen is immune to &quot;The Night of Suck&quot;.<br />
<br />
EDIT: On Clerics I think it should be said that even the CH rot does not kill the class in raids.  Beyond the encounters that disable or reduce the dependancy on CH-rots, I can always still see competance in Clerics through the entire process.  A *good* Cleric is worth 10 bots right up until that CH-chain, just as a *good* Warrior is worth 10 gear-tanks right up until gametime.  It's a bit sad that many of the pre-GoD final encounters reduce warriors (and others) to gear and not competance but this is hardly a phenominon unique to Clerics.</div></div><hr />

Many high end fights CH doesn't cut it, people use HL instead.  Theres also many fights which are purely chaotic in those areas you have to change whos being healed a ton, one example of this is Kelekdrix thats one mob where a tank order doesn't work, instead you have one person take the hits for 30 seconds basically.  Fights that change slightly each time also keep people constantlly thinking, the stonemaster fight in Txevu for example, the fight will be similar every time but always alittle different based on luck, the same can be said of the final 2 Ikkinz 4 raids.  Exp grinding breeds mediocrity, anything beyond that (espically with the fewest numbers possible) forces people to get better and eventually excel wether its single group, raid, solo, whatever... so long as it's a challenge.</div></div><hr />

What you said was generally true up to and including some of PoP.    PoP kind of changed things a bit, but in Gates, it completely threw the &quot;It doesn't take skill&quot; out the window.   It's one of my favorite parts of Gates, the &quot;idiot detector&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Usually, people who die on the way to Yxxta will be the same people who wipe your raid in Uqua.    There's consequences for screwing up far beyond what there used to be, GoD raids are pretty damn impressive, ALTHOUGH.... <br />
<br />
GoD single group encounters are as well.   When you get to the Ikkinz trials (and I have no doubt you will), you'll be doing shit with one group you never thought possible.   That's one of the things that impresses me the most about GoD is the single group encounters make everyone pay attention.   Then again so do the raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing that Gates has done better than any previous expansion is showing what can be accomplished with skill vs. class or gear.  In my mind, the 2nd Ikkinz trial is the epitome of single group challenge, that thing is insane.   That's actually something that I liked about early GoD that's changed is that everyone used to have to do all the 6 man trials to advance.   You can't really be a bumbling moron and be successful in those.<br />
<br />
That allowed idiots to advance to places where they're a danger to their raids, but seriously, those peiople will get booted out of their raids fast if they keep doing stupid shit slowing progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend went and pulled the cragbeast mother to my group after we cleared the ph's in tipt before I could stop him.I had to pull him back away from the healers to avoid rampage on them and get the melee off to stabilize the fight,but, thats about as complex has a group situation gets for me.<br />
<br />
Tanking 3hard mobs or 5 easy ones in ldon takes a lil speed with the tgt key and timing with the slower ,but, there's not much more to grouping...communicating with one enchanter is easy ,1 cleric is focused on me...the pulling is probably the most skillful thing hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what, I had my own guild, and I was progressing thru the content we had available to us, and you know what, some people (who thankfully don't read this board) are gonna be pissed off when I say it, but the only person who did ANY goddamned work was me, and occasionally 2 of my top notch officers.  Everyone else didn't do fuck all.  When I wasn't on, they weren't on.  They sat on their twinks or on their trader until I popped up in guild chat and then they came out.  <br />
<br />
Don't fucking tell me that it's hard being in a raiding guild, or raiding in general.  You show up, you follow instructions, you show a fucking glimmer of intelligence every once in awhile, you learn quick enough to avoid people being pissed off, and that's it.  My contention is that there is 1, sometimes a small group of people who are running the show, and the rest of the people you can randomly pick from a pool and do just fine with a little basic cooperation.  It's  grade A bullshit if you think that random_monkey_02 in your fucking guild is ANY better than random_monkey_05 in my guild.  He has better gear to make up for more errors in judgement, but that's IT.  There is no fucking IQ test for your guild, there is no situational aptitude test...if you can perform the basic duty of your class and don't piss anyone else off, you're in, and don't even fucking argue that it's any different, because you know damned well it's not.  How many fucking clerics did EVERY guild recruit in POP? You're telling me that they're all completely 100% top notch players?  Your fucking eyes are brown you're so full of shit.<br />
<br />
Someone is running the show in your guild.  It might be you Gunnar, and everything you say might be 100% spot on, because I've been there, and I've done that, and I've zero desire to do it again.  But I think if we go down your guild's roster, we're gonna find a few exceptional players and a WHOLE fuckload of people who are championing mediocrity.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Well Haas has said 1 (one each) thing I believe to be accurate. Guildleaders and Raid Leaders do a heck of a lot of work. To some extent others do ride the coattails of their efforts.<br />
<br />
However Haas misses two important things:<br />
<br />
1. In guilds that are not pure hardcore (some guilds do get downright testy if you can't be counted on to show up for the vast majority of raids - but they let you know this will be the case when you apply) there is a raiding core. They are generally the ones who patiently try hard content over and over again until it's cracked. Are there some along for the ride? Surely, but then they don't get DKP if they don't show up, they don't have the latest flags, and eventually many drift away.<br />
<br />
2. I thought GoD sucked brass initially. I had no idea why they even bothered to release it. It darned near made me quit. However, I read all the little hint dropping (not much) that suggest it would be worth it and stuck it out.<br />
<br />
Haas, The EP/PoTime raids are very very good. They are so unlike Trak and AoW that it's like an entirely different game. The GoD raids are much better. They are harder in many dimentions. I've completed Uqua - it's unbelieveable. I'm working on Inkta'Tu - atm, I hate it like poison. It's VERY hard to get traction on some of these raids. You puzzle it out, take a crack at it, fail, fail, succeed at a little piece of it, push on a bit, etc. It puts the whole guild - all of it through their paces.<br />
<br />
I understand you can't change your mind about the quality of the high level raid situation in GoD since you haven't experianced it. But rather than go on and denigrate stuff you don't know about, concider that maybe you have insufficient information to form an opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Nah ,I'm not raidleader and I'm not guildleader.I give a little instruction when I feel it's warranted as MA ,but, I don't feel I'm working harder than all the other folks in my guild.We simply clear stuff way faster in more challenging situations than any of my groups could possibly hope to.Also a lot of the raids require me to be  much more situationally aware than ma'n for a group of 6 people in an easy to control environment.Even doing something easy like poe rings I'm constantly on a new target running around like a chicken missing my head.Stuff constantly roots,blurs,ramps,splits and hits hard enough to mow down 20 robes in a few blinks.Thats trivial to us and it still gives me a way harder workout than the toughest tipt group ever could win or not.We did all the rings the other night non stop to pop the arbitor to flag a few folks on him.There's no way any group will work me that hard hehe.<br />
<br />
Doing that stuff constantly has made tagging,engaging and positioning an automatic exercise in a group where everything is easy to see and there's no tricks involved.I don't think I'm a great tank,elite,or that raiders possess any special IQ.I know for a fact I work way harder on raids than I do in any groups I've ever been in.There is no contest imo.I know for a fact as well many raids tire folks out who normally can group with me pulling stuff non stop for 6-10 hours.I sincerely doubt many raiders here who worked solely with guild got quality gear and normal size raids didn't find themselves more seriously challenged with Coirnav,Xegony and RC then they are in groups.Course stuff seems trivial when you're over geared over manned and over practiced....That's not usually the case working through that stuff for the first time.<br />
<br />
Fact is what I can do in a group is so limited it doesn't compare to raiding imo.I'm not full of shit you're just blinded by frustration and er ignorance.Nothing in eq is rocket science.I don't feel leet in any way cause I happen to tank for a great bunch of folks when we raid.Our guild/raidleader is very good and works  much harder than I do.Still It's a team effort and if his raid is slacking when we are in tough content we'll generally lose.You could take 6 Haass's who new their respective class well and toss them in any gear appropiate group content I've done and they would probably sail through.However,put 60 of them togeather in against coirnav and I bet they wipe several times.On a competitive server it could take months to get through coirnav alone.I bet they would wipe alot on many raids and find themselves challenged on differant levels consistently.Don't need a high IQ,don't need to be elite,don't need to be full of shit....Do have to work harder consistently over time and sometimes seriously challenge folks in your raidforce.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of times some people are slacking,but, most of my friends find raiding more challenging and tiring than grouping...truth.It doesn't make them special it just is...<br />

Never raided LDON have ya haass? :) And besides, it's not that certain people have always been arrogant, it's that with people leaving the game, someone has to take their place. With that mangelo comes the attitude.<br />

Anyhow, I won't deny the fact that high end players are not always playing 100%. Why would they? This is a game -- I go afk to get anoter beer whether I'm main tanking  or just standing around. It's the way things go.<br />

<br />
Of course it is.  And I don't think Haass has a problem with that.  Where he has a problem is when people start trying to portray raiding as some overblown IQ test where only the brightest and the best succeed.  All raiders give 100% of their attention to it all the time and they're all top notch players.  And that's crap.   A couple of decent leaders, a good puller or two, a few on the ball tanks, relatively aware healers, and everyone else able to hit the assist key when necessary, and you've got a raid that has a decent chance of success.<br />
<br />
Some raiders are superb players.  Some clearly aren't.  It really begins to gall when time after time some very vocal raiders try to project this sense of entitlement because every high end raider is god's gift to EQ and a veritable raiding genius and all non-raiders are idiot newbs.  Clearly, just from the posts on this forum alone, it's easy to conclude that not every high end raider is a veritable genius of any kind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">K Glatius,Haass obviously seems to have a problem with me and my contrast of raiding to grouping challenge and effort.Note it's the activity I'm contrasting not the players.Any decent player can be of value to a raid force and to a group given the right content.I can say over and over I don't think that raiders are leet,have better IQ's,or are genius's in any way shape or form.Heck my wife and I are eq newbs imo and I'm sure we found adapting  to a video game more difficult than many of you folks with a lot more experience in that area.<br />
<br />
Still, Haass can scream bs all he wants I'm telling you the truth.When we raid we find it far more challenging and tiring than when we group.This doesn't make us better than anyone.This is true of most of the people I play with regularly.Especially,flag mobs can be very challenging in our recent experience.Far beyond anything required of us in any groups we've been in.Even clearing for our raids is a much more energetic and challenging way to play than the relatively slow pace of a chain pull group,or, myself pulling and tanking mountain trials in GOD.<br />
<br />
None of this means that any particular raider is a better overall eq player than any particular non raider.I do believe that raiding as a comitted contributing member of a progressive raid guild through content over time is harder work and more challenging on a few levels than grouping for the same period of time.I think soe trys to make raid content challenging almost to the same extent it does group stuff based upon a particular gear/aa/level strength and set of numbers.For 60 people to do everything right in challenging content and not overlap their efforts too much is much harder than for 6.<br />
<br />
When you have extra people,gear,practice it always mitigates challenge in given content of course.Still working with your guild from velious to time is harder work than banging around god and ldon imo and my wife and I've done both.The raids get harder and more complex with flag mobs especially in ep's.I'm sure GOD will step this up more.<br />
<br />
Imo soe has clearly distinquished differant types of play to require more practice has players progress from level 1 newbs to god raids.Most begin by soloing to learn the basics of movement , class ability use and exploring the eq environment.Then they move to grouping to learn how to best utilize their abilities to the benefit of 2-6 people against varying content.The next step is raiding and it's particular challenges.No one should have to take that last step full time Imo and the content should be placed to better support group play.None of this makes #45 raider leet or exceptionally smart.Also of course some folks will get pl'd,e bayed,piggy backed on the coattails of friends etc etc.Those are not the most rewarding play experiences imo regardless of whether after a year your bp has 400hp or 40hp on it.<br />
<br />
Just the coordination required to bring a progressive raid force into play and use it well consistently over a year is a challenge.Harder raids in higher content are challenging enough to cause guilds to disband when faced with defeat after defeat.I simply don't run into that in xp groups though I know they're making some cutting edge god stuff a little more complex.Still getting it right with 6 will be a lot easier than with 60.<br />
<br />
Again I don't think raiders are smarter,more leet,or genius's.I do think progressive raiding is more challenging and harder work than grouping.Haass does seem to have a serious problem with this regardless of my being certain that many presently non raiding tanks on this board are better warriors than many presently raiding tanks.He's upset about his hobby that he takes very personally.I don't blame him really.I also think it makes him irrational at times tho.</div></div><hr />

I am guessing you are talking about the Front Page poll and not the one at the top of this thread.  There is quite a gap between 5+ days a week and 1-4 raids a week depending on how you look at.

Vaniki (and everything else in DN outside of JD) is soloable.  Vaniki can be solo'd by any class in EQ that can cast or get SoW and/or DA.  However, the druid would have to learn the zone's geography and to a certain extent faction rules  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Raiding is supposed to be about progression, that's what I always heard. You fight and fight and fight and fight and get your heads beat in and fight and fight some MORE until finally, you crack that encounter, and are in to the next level. It's a pretty neat feeling.<br />
<br />
 Of course, until the day you log in your 6 groups (Yeah, you don't need 6 groups, but they are your guildies, so you take them anyways.), go to hit that progression mob.....<br />
<br />
 Now, keep in mind, casual folks can't do these kinds of numbers at the drop of a hat. It takes prior planning and LOTS of legwork to get attendance up, especially if it's a mob that doesn't drop as much in the way of loot as a dragon type encounter. I'd make a rough estimate that a truly 'casual' guild could try a really big, challenging encounter from that guild's standpoint once or twice a month. (Note: I'm not talking about Apolyon style casual-but-still-three-times-a-week-at-set-times-everything's the same as an uber guild BUT frequency type casual. I'm talking actual casual.)<br />
<br />
Then you get down to spawn timers and bottomfeeding. And I know folks like BB don't like to believe this, but it IS a problem, and eventually people stop coming after the fifth or sixth time a target is gotten by a group of highenders bottomfeeding. Then you go to the NEXT thing on your list, with fewer people available, and hope THAT'S up when you log on.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, here's a real simple test. Go to Dreadlands. Wait for Gorenaire. See who kills him and how long after he spawns. Note the guildtag of said killers. Rinse and repeat a few dozen times. You'll notice 'casual' guilds go after him not at all. Not for lack of desire (People still buy them Scales, doncha' know), or for lack of skill, but simply because they cannot outrace highenders to the content. And after a few times of trying, they give up, and go to the next thing on the list. And as more guilds pass the magic barrier of the EP's and enter instanced raid content, it's going to get worse - because you don't HAVE to race for your raid mob anymore. You can raid in blocks. And leave bigger blocks of downtime for your bored uberguilders to try and find something to kill.<br />
<br />
 If anything, Sony should Ragefire the whole damn lot of old content. Go back and instance everything. Let progression be determined by the content, not by the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

You're a fucking idiot.  The things that I try to do &quot;To see if I can do it&quot; are ABOVE my level of play.  These things are BELOW the people i'm bitching about.<br />
<br />
Like I fucking said, whenever I become capable of doing harder shit, I fucking do it.  You don't see me going back to fucking Kaesora to perma camp the HS key piece just because I can.  Whenever you guys become capable of doing harder shit, it just adds to the list of stuff that you kill on a regular basis.  If it's okay to lock me out of content because I'm not good enough to be there, then it's okay to lock you out of content because you're too good for it.<br />
<br />
So I fucking bottomfeed droga now huh?  Funny, it was a dungeon designed for people just like me...who don't have the fucking elemental playground that you retards do, and who don't like the outdoor bullshit presented in PoP.  That doesn't sound like bottomfeeding at all, that sounds like it's the content I'm supposed to be doing.  You guys make such a point of driving home the fact that I'm not as l33t as you are, and yet you try to call me on this shit?  Not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
There is a difference between bottomfeeding, and farming.  You and I both farm shit.  We farm stuff to equip ourselves and our friends.  That's how you get new gear in this game is farming.  Bottomfeeding is doing content that you neither need, nor engage in any real risk of doing so, just to do it.  That's what you guys do, not me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is pretty much an accurate statement of some of the problems faced by very casual guilds. I realize that other people have as much right to any mob that's up as my friends and I have; and, of course, it's obvious that if folks in my guild didn't have all the real life issues that cut into play time, then we could get things done faster (I know, because I used to play 6 hours a night five nights a week). But, for us, you can't get much traction explaining that if we didn't have families or the kinds of job we have now or our other interests, that we are too lazy to advance in EQ, or that EQ should be the sort of game that isn't rewarding to play.<br />
<br />
Getting cut off by uber bottom feeders is not, in fact, in the top five (or maybe 10) problems my friends and I have in advancing our characters, but it is irritating when it happens because it can cause a week or two or three to go by between chances for us, as a guild, to take on the very hardest content we can hope to try. We routinely plan targets two or three deep, because it's often the case that we fight our way in somewhere and mob's not up or camped by someone else, and in cases where that someone else is obviously bottom feeding, well, that's discouraging.<br />
Even in the case of drops from mobs that are single-group targets for level-appropriate toons, this is a problem. Try to convince young warriors that cobalt drops somewhere other than the bazaar. Take young warrior alt to Karnor's with level-appropriate group or half group. Kill the caller, get no drop. Kill the Captain, get no drop. Rinse and repeat. Then while you are killing the caller yet again watch lvl 65 shaman run in, solo the captain, then auction the cobalt drop on the spot right in front of you!<br />
Come to this site, get lectured on how casual players fear risk and that's why they don't get their own loot or spend all their time in normal LDoNs.<br />
The irritation factor is far higher than the practical effects.<br />
Pretty sure that hardcore players who raid for their main's gear and attempt to efficiently gear up their alts or help gear up alts of guildmates by farming stuff are also more irritated by casual players listing their problems than damaged by these lists. Again, the irritation factor of fighting your way past a mob with a valuable drop and then being told it's not fair to farm that mob is higher than the actual practical effects of such arguments.<br />
These threads are driven by such irritation factors.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, in the midst of people being at each other's throats about this, someone will mention an interesting mob, and then there will be a civil and remarkably open discussion of how to deal with the mob, the zone, the force you need, and specific dangers to look out for. In such matters, and a perhaps unhealthy desire to have the mob always be hitting us and no one else, rests our common ground.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as for ragging Haass about droga farming: don't forget to rag him about taking advantage of the early market for cultural armor by getting his smithing up, or for making sure that his group hit the same Velious quest content over and over so that the second tank in his group is essentially geared as well as he is. My guess is that he's done similar stuff for all the classes of toons in his regular group. If you're going to attack him for all the time he's spent killing mobs that drop gear that is equal to or better than the stuff he and his group have, you guys haven't even begun to scratch the surface of things you can rag him about.</div></div><hr />

Gerick, who are you to judge when bottom feeding is and when it isnt?  EP characters have the same fucking platinum needs anyone else in this game has, and being EP flagged doesnt magically solve everything.<br />

<br />
I'm not saying bottom feeding isnt a problem (it is) on most if not all servers.  You've just chosen a fucktastic example of &quot;bottom feeding as a problem&quot; and brought it here to show how evil EP characters are.  I could probably count on 1 hand the number of times Vaniki has been killed for progression in the last month on your server.

<br />
You are correct sir.  I don't bottom feed, because bottom feeding would imply the content was trivial.<br />
<br />
I was in CT before Taunt worked there.  Were you?<br />
<br />
I was in droga before anyone on a live server had figured out where the hammer and sword dropped.  Were you?  In fact, if you owned a Hammer or a sword in the first month or 2 after Droga opened on CT, I can state pretty confidently that you got it from me.  I don't think anyone bitched about spending the 15 or 20 or whatever I put on the price back then, because they were happy as shit that they could hold aggro.<br />
<br />
I was single grouping the Kael arena before Luclin came out...while we were under 60.  Veterans hit fucking hard, and we had to avoid them until I got defensive at 55.  Even then, we had to really ration the amount of blue shirt mobs we took on, or we'd run out of mana.  I was also in Kael long enough to gear up EVERY SINGLE member of my guild with the same level of gear that i was at.  We waited until everyone had as much gear as we could farm out of there before we moved on, in order to make sure that everyone felt like they had accomplished something.  We did the same thing in Halls of Testing when we started single grouping that area and could only kill 5 or 6 mobs in the 80 minute spawn time.  <br />
<br />
When the cutural recipies were released, I was one of, if not the first smith on CT mass producing Fierce.  Again, if you owned Fierce within a month or 2 after the patch, you probably got it from me.  The only exceptions were the top end guilds with their own smiths, but they weren't selling it, they were just equipping the guild.<br />
<br />
Is this bottom feeding? I don't fucking think so.  I've always been on the forefront of what I could do, pushing the limits and doing things that other people said couldn't be done with the groups we had.  I plan on being in Sleeper's Tomb in another month or so here, with a single group.  If you think just doing old content qualifies as bottom feeding, you are sorely mistaken, but then again, there's a lot of people who are sorely mistaken about a lot of things, so it doesn't really surprise me.</div></div><hr />

If youre going to bitch about Bottom-feeding then lets come up with a clearcut definition.  From what i'm gathering ... bottom feeding is killing content beneath or at your skill level whereby killing said mob will not directly upgrade your character or those you are with.<br />
<br />
It's a two-way street, and unless you never kill mobs to sell the loot they drop and always spend your time on cutting edge, appropriate content, then you're a hypocrit.   You cant draw some arbitrary line and say anything beneath &quot;this&quot; doesnt count as bottom feeding.  Everyone farms ... most people have at least one twink ... everyone likes to make money in the bank.  Just because someone is better than you and can kill shit that takes you a raid to kill doesnt make them wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to rationalize bottom feeding, as i personally dont think highend folks should cap AoW/Tormax and now Trak every time they spawn for coin ... i'm just saying that it goes both ways.  You have no right to complain if you've ever participated in such activities in the past on any scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">You are correct sir.  I don't bottom feed, because bottom feeding would imply the content was trivial. <br />
<br />
I dont care what kind of gear you have ... doing AoWar with 6-8 , Tormax with 6 or under, or Seru with a single group cannot be considered trivial by any stretch.  It's no more trivial than any of the above you listed.  It still takes a ton of time, a fair degree of risk (if there is such a thing), and a lot of skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">2. The percentages of casual and non-raiders are lower than I expected. Perhaps a random sample would give different results, but given this poll it can't really be said that SoE is developing 95% of it's content for 5% of it's players.<br />
<br />
3. The degree that casual non-raiders &quot;blame&quot; raiders and others for their &quot;woes&quot;. While mostly confined to threads it's been everything from SoE not providing a progression path (IMO there is one) to &quot;ubers&quot; bottem feeding and soloing Rumblecrush every time he's up.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see SoE do a sign-in poll. While things like the Casual Warriors Top Ten List may help identify the issues, SoE (and EQ players) would benefit from determining the size of the player base affected by them.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
#2 is BS. TSW is in no way indicative of the population of this game.<br />
#3 if this is not an issue than flag mains of Time flagged (as an example) out of old content. If you want a BoC, use your twink not your main.<br />
<br />
Mini-poll, agree would be interesting and guess what you might be shocked by the results (not to your favor). First off EP+ and GoD have broken the casual content progression model so most casuals are pissed that they will never UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES (unless we get level 80 and the content isnt tweaked) see 50% of the content of the two largest expansions in the last 3 years. That is my major heartburn (for me its GoD non-single grp only but you get the point). Farming Ferubi, Q, Barindu, etc. is no different than farming Tier 1-3. You hit a point where its routine (at least until some fuckstick leet uber warrior trains the whole zone on to you).<br />
<br />
And most of my casual guild, btw, has not set foot on this or most classboards and if they do, they likely do not get involved in these types of discussions.<br />
<br />
And my vote is I like raiding cause I get to see my casual guild struggle with and succeed in content. They know some basic strats but we bot the hell out of the ecounters so that creates its own issues. And we have yet to fail to take down the content in the first two tries despite some closes calls (like losing all designated tanks on Emperor xcept a monk while letting one of the mez lockdowns drop). I enjoy watching them succeed in a game that has become way too freaking cynical.<br />

Gerick, who are you to judge when bottom feeding is and when it isnt?  EP characters have the same fucking platinum needs anyone else in this game has, and being EP flagged doesnt magically solve everything.<br />

I'm not saying bottom feeding isnt a problem (it is) on most if not all servers.  You've just chosen a fucktastic example of &quot;bottom feeding as a problem&quot; and brought it here to show how evil EP characters are.

Here's your problem.  You are confusing 2 different things -- bottom feeding, and farming.  They are not the same.  In your deluded mind, you for some reason think they are.

Oh that's right, you fall into the category of people who think they're important because they're in a big guild and have lots of HP and a low EQrankings number.  Listen up fuckhead, what you do with your 50 friends, is not challenging.  It's not any more challenging than what I do with my 5 friends.

And Who know's, he could just as easily destroyed it.  Since he was out in the middle of nowhere with no one else around he certainly wasn't doing it with the starting intention of giving it to someone that could use it, we just happened upon him.  Are you really that desperate to prove to yourself that bottom feeding doesn't occur that you feel it is more correct to attach some kind of honorable intention to this guy?  Seriously, this dude was bottom feeding.  He is in a top teir guild was attempting to kill a mob that drops an upgrade for middle or lower progression people that is nodrop and not even for his class.<br />

Haass is killing something for xp, avatar of war is not for xp, and you are damn right if that goblin pops with the king boots or the droga combo he will go for it, it is the same as a named monster popping in a LDoN, it is not bottom feeding because they are xping and they are not dropping something that will not respawn for days and days.<br />

<br />
So tell me exactly what equipment were you acquiring by &quot;farming&quot; Droga weapons and selling them for PP in the bazaar?  Or your smithed armor?  You can't exactly give it to your friends if you are selling it now can you?  You are doing the EXACT same thing as a Time flagged group killing AOW (or insert mob name here) and selling the drops.  There is no difference, try to wrap your mind around this concept.  I am sure it will be difficult since it isnt laced with four letter words which seem to be the majority of your vocabulary.<br />
<br />
Oh, and when did Vaniki become a progression mob?  Did I miss the patch when DNB zone was implemented?  I am assuming you meant to say &quot;sought after mobs&quot; and not progression mobs.  You like many other people bitch and moan when mobs like that are killed because it &quot;takes away&quot; loot you want.  Yet you weren't actively putting forth the effort to go and get a Willsapper, you were after a PSC.  *edit, guess DE Cleric can't use Fine Heraldic, my mistake which I had suggested.*<br />
<br />
And no, I do not think that hps or gear makes a person any more valid than another.  I base it on what that person does.  I have tried to make wise gear decisions to allow me and my friends in our guild to progress and try more difficult encounters.  We find this fun.  Sounds very similar to you in this aspect.  We don't belong to a large guild (unless you consider 35-45 raiders large for an EP raid).  Anyone who thinks their gear defines them as a person has a very poor self esteem.<br />
<br />
I don't think you any more or less skilled of an EQ player than myself as I have never seen you play.  You may want to try to reserve judgement yourself until you have enough information to make an intelligent conclusion.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">Vaniki is a bad example, out of all the possible examples of bottomfeeding to bring forward.  Vaniki can't be spawned by players, and doesn't spawn on a schedule, and despawns himself if left alone, and is more common since the DN revamp.  So when someone finds him up, and there is nobody else in DN, you really can't blame that person for fooling around with him.<br />
<br />
For a good argument about bottomfeeding, argue about BOT tower or Dozekar permacampers, or some predictable mob like that.<br />
<br />
However, to answer the question of &quot;when did Vaniki become a progression mob&quot;, his heart (or Neb's) is technically needed in order to make ST keys, so if ST is a progression step then Vaniki is part of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">Well Fried, you have a lot of venom in your words towards someone that wasn't even talking to you, but since you brought me in to your little pissing contest, allow me to enlighten your narrow mind.<br />
<br />
Vaniki might be considered a progression mob for some do to the length of spawn on him, he certainly isn't a 20 minute camp and drops a very nice no drop weapon, maybe not for someone such as yourself but we aren't talking about you.  Now, you liken killing Vaniki to killing gobo's in Droga.  This argument is flawed in several ways.  First, droga is designed for people of my level and progression, it is an XP spot for me.  Every now and then a named will spawn that can drop a weapon that is desirable do to it having procs that generate some nice agro.  Now these weapons are lore, my toon can get one of each and he's at his limit for the day so to speak.  Now the next group of people can come in and get their fill, since the respawn on the named mob or PH is roughly 20 minutes.  Now, if I happen to get a few extras I can sell these in bazaar for about 3 to 5k now a days which I can then use the plat from to buy pieces of ornate that drops in zones that I either A) don't have access to because I am not a member of a raiding guild and can not get flagged for it or B) drops of mobs that are duo'd by EP+ geared people as they move onto the next zone that I don't have access to and farm up more stuff to sell to me.  Now those mobs that say drop Ornate BPs such as in BoT tower are many hours or even days in spawn time, they are not mobs that I can have a shot at or their PH every 20 minutes and their spawn time is often locked down by an EP+ 2 boxer.  But that's fine, that's fair market.  <br />
<br />
Now, when an EP+ happens across a multi hour or multi day spawn and decides to kill it despite the fact it drops no loot that is droppable or usable by their class just for shits and giggles, that is bottom feeding and unnecessary.  I realize this may all seem trivial to your uberness but it all contributes to the overall problems that hardcore non-raiders such as myself face.  We are locked out of zones where we could get upgrades for ourselves and so are limited to a handful of mobs that drop in zones that I can reach but are harvested like wheat by people that have no intention of gearing up friends or giving it to someone less fortunate then them.  These are people that are geared in such a way that there is nothing they could buy that would upgrade them plat is, in essence, useless to them. However, their actions make it more difficult for non-raiders to progress because they either have to find lesser items to use, spend an exponentially longer time working on equal or even slightly less powerful items via LDoN or have to farm shit below them so as to make enough money to buy the items from those farmers above in effect creating an avalanche of shit that falls squarely on the shoulders of those below.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said, I realize you are a very angry person but do not include me in your monkey shit tossing rampage when I was in no way even addressing you.  You may have a differing opinion then me but you have no idea what the state of the game is for me.  Feel free to express your counter view, but do not come at me like a 5 year old throwing a tantrum.  I am not threatening your farm mobs, I am stating my own opinion.</div></div><hr />

So tell me exactly what equipment were you acquiring by &quot;farming&quot; Droga weapons and selling them for PP in the bazaar? Or your smithed armor? You can't exactly give it to your friends if you are selling it now can you? <br />

You mean like my sceptre of destruction?  You mean like giving all my friends RZ characters a full suit of armor?  There are things in this game that I&quot;m never going to be able to get because I choose not to pretend to associate with 80 other people who are all as greedy as I am and only want phat lewts.  Instead, because of the obvious problem of any mob that a single group can take down doesn't need their loot, such people have to buy upgrades in the bazaar.  This is the same trickle down concept that happens everywhere.  You fuckers farm SoD's or BoC's or some such, and sell it to the most profitable of non raiders, who in turn pay for such purchases by being smart and acquiring loot that the general public wants, but doesn't have the means to get (IE : armor, weapons).  In turn, to pay for stuff that I sell them, these people farm tradeskill components or sit around foraging all day and sell the uber guilders who just made 500kpp off that BoC silk swatches for 20pp each and everyone is happy except for the people right in the middle...the people who are forced by your actions to have no other route than buying their upgrades in the bazaar.  To further the problem, we have you assclowns coming here and telling us to work harder, and that we don't actually have any skill.  To that, I say, Fuck you sir.<br />

So tell me, what can a fully geared EP+ person buy that would be an upgrade for them?

<br />
Lets see.  Is there any difference at all between someone killing a mob that spawns once every hour or two hours, even if they do it all day, and someone killing a mob that spawns once a week?  Why yes, I think there is a difference.  See, the guy who is camping the mob that spawns once every hour or two has to stop eventually.  He has to sleep, has got to take a shower, has got to go get food, something.  Once he's gone, then that mob is up for grabs by anyone who is interested.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if a group of ubers roll in and smack down a mob that spawns once a week, what happens once they're done and have moved on?  That's right, you have to wait a week for the respawn.  If they do this each week, pretty soon you've had months go by.  See the difference?  See how one is a minor annoyance to a guild that wants to progress, as most, while the other is a major cockblock?  Since I've had to explain it at all, I seriously doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">I am just recently EP flagged so I dont know about fully EP+ peeps.  But I imagine some of the same things that I use on a daily basis when I play.  Invis/levi potions or GVD and batteries,  Stat food, tradeskill items (for a killer earring), money to make Ornate/Elemental/GoD(?) armor, ports (rare anymore), gate potions, tribute (if they use it), augment solvents that allow you to save an augment.  I am sure there are more, but those are off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
I have 3k in the bank atm and the BoC is my guild's (only EB weapon in the guild btw), not mine.  If I attend about 20 more raids or so I think I will put in for another elemental mold and it will cost me probably about 2k to make it (5oopp for furnace, 500 for sheets and 1k for the aug switch).<br />
<br />
I would agree with you that if you are killing AOW with the sole intention of selling the drops that you would have a very hard time purchasing an upgrade in the bazaar.  There are a few exceptions maybe, like Thulian Visage of Horror.  I tried this quest and it is painstakenly long.  Mostly what these people buy is the time that others have put forth.  You may not like this but it happens outside of EQ as well.  You may call this unfair or immoral or whatever you want but if you work for a living like I do, then people are paying you for your time to do things they do not want to do or cannot do themselves.  People are lazy and take the path of least resistance normally.<br />
<br />
I am not trying to rationalize or justify killing mobs to sell their drops.  It happens.  You do it Haass, I have done it, at one point or another almost everyone has sold a drop they got.  It is no different if you sell a CHoS that you got farming it or selling Zlandicar's talisman for an ST key.  You killed the mob to sell your time and effort to someone else so you can purchase someone elses time and effort for something you do want but cannot get.<br />

There, sir, is your answer.  I dont presume to think myself superior, but i'll not put up with such shit from a senseless whiner.<br />
<br />
I'll stand by my point: Bottomfeeding rants are useless and redundant unless there is intentional cockblock involved.  If you think otherwise than you're kidding yourself.  At every level of the game there is someone being &quot;robbed&quot; by higher level or better gear base people ... this goes all the way up from Greater lightstones through Droga weapons ... you've effectively taken something from someone who could have really used said item as a direct upgrade.  Any time you farm something to sell you are guilty of the same fucking sin.  To draw lines in content is silly.  <br />
<br />
Yet you still think that the server owes you your BoCarnage.  I'll tell you what, every person who has actually raided for a BoCarnage has had to fight the same problems ... why should this be any different for you?  I had to wait and monitor the kael zone for over 2 months before we actually got our first shot at him 4 months ago.  Did i complain when i saw EP guilds kill him?  No.  It did bother me, but i sucked it up and dealt with it ... watch when he died and logged in a week later.<br />
<br />
If you want something badly enough, then take the time to camp it.  If you dont, then dont throw a fit when someone else takes it for whatever reason.  Unless their purpose in killing it is to keep you, Gerick, from having a BoC, I honestly fail to see the ultimate problem.<br />
<br />
BoC = 350k = upgrades for any/all<br />
HoRZ= 200k = upgrades for any/all<br />
RoD= 30ac 100hp ring all/all ... it is a much better tanking ring than found in EP's<br />
<br />
I really wish trivial loot codes could be enacted to help fight these kind of problems.  Hell, make everything nodrop for all I care.  Point is: unless you've never given/bought anything for a twink, and unless you've never killed/camped soemthing for loot or coin you can't honestly bitch when someone does it as well on a larger scale.  It's hypocrisy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Apo what is the damn differance between intentional and not intentional?<br />
<br />
If you leave a large mess and someone slips on it and breaks a hip, your liable even if you did not intend for them to get hurt.<br />
<br />
If you hit a ped while driving, your liable.<br />
<br />
If you kill the AoW monday and a guild comes in tuesday for their first attempt on him (which they may have had planned weeks in advance.) and it is down because some shithead wanted some plat, they are liable to their boss and family, and your liable for fucking them over.<br />
<br />
Here is what you do not understand, your post about being in a casual guild is no longer true for yourself at least, as you have transended casual to outright jackassery.<br />
<br />
When lets say, my guild tries the AoW and he is not up that is a big hit for us as we had to have EVERYONE go to their boss and ask for the day off, we had to plan weeks in advance to make sure we had enough people on, that may not be a big deal to you, but after we show up 4 times in a month and not have the chance to kill him really puts a hurt on us,<br />
<br />
1) because our bosses have had enough of our shit about &quot;raiding&quot; in something called &quot;everquest&quot; <br />
2) because our loved ones sat on the furnature watching us play instead of going out and having fun with them <br />
3) because we stagnate when we do not kill a milestone monster every once in awhile and we loose people or they stop logging in.<br />
<br />
Of course you could give 2 shits about our problems because your beyond that point, and of course, if the devs pay attention to us for 5 seconds you might wither and die! omgz! You and your type are fucking selfish in that you want the lionshare of everything, from loot to dev attention even tho we all pay the same amount to log in, I am sick of this bullshit where all the attention has to be focused on what is wrong in time this week, what is wrong in Ikkinz next week, and whatever else pissed you off the following week, when the hell is it our turn? NEVER.<br />
<br />
Not every person that has a BoC faced the same problems, not every person that has a BoW or SEWS faced the same problem, hell I would wager it is harder to get any of those 3 in some respect today, than ever before.<br />
<br />
You did not have people farming YOUR content with a third of what it was intended to take, we do so until you start a new toon outside of your &quot;casual&quot;  :rolleyes:  guild then shut the fuck up about casual problems and useless rants, I hope OoW gives you a ass raping with its bugs, like a bossle wood phallic device!<br />

<br />
 Sirrah, you are wrong in a couple of respects. Some simple logic will prove that.<br />
<br />
 There is a difference, a vast difference, between those who got BoC's in the past, and those who could try to get BoC's now. In the past, the first folks who got BoC's were at worst racing a full handful of guilds with the power to take AoW. In many cases there were only two or three guilds to do so. In the here and now, you have not only the increased number of guilds who have that ability, you also have those folks who are well beyond the content who farm it, or twink it out. Racing 2 or 4 similarly equipped guilds != racing the (Hell, I'll throw out a guess here) 8-10 similarly equipped guilds plus another 6-8 splinters of superior equipped guildmembers who can and DO do content for just those reasons.<br />
<br />
 Secondly, if I go farming, the easiest way to make good cash is to farm acryila at the lower levels, frankly. Mobs that drop acrylia are neither progression mobs nor mobs with 3day to weeklong spawn rates.</div></div><hr />

Change that the word &quot;guild&quot; to &quot;group of 6&quot; well geared farmers Apo (in context to AoW).  Its ridiculus in this day and age that the BoC has not been made no drop....300-500k item on a mob 6 folks can do really doesnt give a casual (or even low level serious guild) much of a shot at it unless there is apathy on a given week.<br />

<br />
<br />
Apolyon's reasons why a person might like to raid are still quite reasonable. There's that moment when you're MT on a raid against a mob you haven't seen yet: you've buffed up and the medding's over, you're standing at the entrance or whatever to the boss mob area, you're about to go in or the puller is about to grab the boss and you don't know exactly what's going to happen or even whether you have a chance to win. You know you've got to grab the mob and position him and if you fail or are one-rounded 18 or 30 or 70 people could conceivably wipe, mwuhahahahaha. You can get a bit of that with groups bent on tackling tough content, but for me the rush on a raid at that moment is much greater. I enjoy that moment about as much as the &quot;dragon down&quot; moment of success. Both of these rushes far exceed the satisfaction of whatever gear upgrade drops for me personally.<br />
<br />
Some people don't raid not because of raiding per se but because of real life time constraints. My guess is the majority of people who don't join raiding guilds are doing so because not only does raiding take a large number of total hours, but those hours often have to come in big blocks. It's not that these people are imune to the pleasures Apolyon describes, rather they have to try to get such satisfactions from grouping. <br />
<br />
There are some hassles associated with raiding, of course: you give up some choice in what you are going to do, as often targets and schedules are decided by the needs of others (and this is no less true for guildleaders and officers than it is for rank and file--if you are an officer, you are responsible for the guild's progression, which makes you responsible for helping folks gear/flag up for the progression, which means you're going to spend a lot of your time doing things for other people). <br />
And, of course, if you have six active warriors (say) in a raiding guild, not everybody is going to get to be MT. Even the top tank will have to rotate out just to give other tanks a chance for fun and experience. For me personally, this would be a drawback. I don't mind offtanking because it can be pretty fun and exciting when that ohshit moment arrives and you still manage to lock down the adds; indeed, that's why I have an SK alt. <br />
But being fourth tank is not why I made a warrior. No sir.<br />
A good many guilds, to be large enough to muster forces sufficient for their targets, have to recruit some people who might have characteristics that are, um, less than ideal. Personally, it would make me wince a bit to be an officer in a guild and suspect that some folks with my guildtag were running around being as big an assholes in front of nonguildies as they sometimes were on guildraids. Of course you can get rid of any one individual, but if your guild is big enough, there's a reasonable possibility that one or more apples are bad at any given point in time.<br />
<br />
As much extra content that raiders get to see, they probably also miss some things that are pretty cool. If you are maximizing your progression and that of your guild, there are certain places you just don't have time to visit, and it doesn't matter whether they'd be fun or not.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, there are some reasons to raid and some reasons you might not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">AoWar with 6 people is rather unbelievable.  The encounter would take at least 8-10 people all in Time+ gear.<br />

But, yeah, the chance you'd sometimes end up being a sponge is a possible drawback, not an advantage, of being in a raiding environment. All in all, though, probably a minor point next to the human hassles of trying to get 70+ folks to pull together and get along with each other and be patient with gear upgrades, etc. When I see officers in large and long-time guilds, what I admire them for mostly is that they've stood up to various people problems.</div></div><hr />

Not sure about this.<br />
<br />
The hammer has no increased proc rate, so at best you're looking at 30 seconds per minute where the cleric is vulnerable ... not to mention the cleric cannot cast WHILE DA'd, and would have to be meleeing the whole time, thus not able to properly heal.<br />
<br />
Time gear goes a long way, but you're looking at a monk being healed by a druid for 10-20 minutes with the cleric frantically healing himself and trying to melee?<br />
<br />
Maybe it happened, i cant say for sure, but the DA hammer just doesnt add up.  The procs are unreliable at best, therefore if they did it, it shouldnt have been because of this hammer.<br />
<br />
Vindi's melee isnt that bad, but he is not slowable and that kind of dps can make for funny problems in the long run with a druid as the primary healer ... that and frequent rampages supposedly bypassed by a cleric hammer (who cannot heal while DA'd) ... it just doesnt add up.</div></div><hr />

So it is your assertation that on Gerick's server that not only is Gerick's guild not ready for/capable of taking down AOW, but neither is any other casual guild on the server?  And that in fact that when these uber geared cockblock dorks get 8 or 12 together so they can get a BoC to sell in the bazaar, that they're actually doing a public service?  Interesting thought process.  Totally fallicious, but interesting.  The only service they're doing is for themselves.  And they most certainly are not motivated by a burning desire to make BoCs available to the poor unfortunate casual players at an oh so reasonable price.  They're interested in lining their own pockets and jacking the casual for as much plat as they possibly can.  Attempting to justify it as anything else is hypocrisy of the worst kind.  But rather to be expected of you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the members of his guild are fully geared with over than 75hp  / mana if not 100 on each slot with weapon with a better ratio than 13/17 for dual wield set up, I thought they were casual ? =/<br />
And I haven't even started with luclin mobs like THO / burrower / IV which are often up for several days. PoP would be a bit different ( due to open raid ) and people always claim that you need 70+ persons to raid there !<br />
More BoC in bazaar leads to more BoC available and those price going down.<br />
<br />
<br />
So do you want your loots on a silver platter ?<br />
<br />
PS : I am all for it for AoW loots being no drop, and it's  not even a sarcasm, if you really think that it will stop the bottom feeding you are solely mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">More BoC in bazaar leads to more BoC available and those price going down.<br />
<br />
Ha!  First off a BoC doesn't always drop.  And second, most of the time when a non-raider gets a BoC, that BoC never hits the market again, because that's the best aggro weapon they're ever likely to see.  So there is a slow dribble of BoCs into the market which once purchased are most times off the market for as long as that person plays.  This is not a recipe for dramatic &quot;price drops&quot;.<br />
<br />
But anyway, thanks for making the case for casuals needing to be willing to farm plat for weeks and months on end just to buy a aggro weapon that is 4 expansions old now, and still the best they are ever liable to see, from bottom feeding ubers with dollar signs in their eyes.</div></div><hr />

Mob quads for just shy of 800 quickly and unslowable and rampages fairly often ... you're telling me that 1 cleric is using a DA proccing hammer to dodge rampage (a silly assertion) and that a single druid is keeping the monk alive for the 20 mintues of the fight?<br />
<br />
If they had a 4th toon for rampage i could see how it is doable, but frankly it looks like you're blowing smoke up our asses to strengthen your argument.  The math just plain doesnt add up with this DA hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u185"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p185">I think that aow is an attractive target for a lot of people.On Stromm when we went through that content I think we only caught him up twice in a few months due to our casual hours and preset raid times.We tried for awhile to catch him as we always have a warrior or  a couple on the roster without eb weapons.He was normally put down by elemental folks pretty fast beause they were hardcore players always on line and quick to mobilize.This was a problem with a few of the juicy targets that warriors love to hit.You don't need to kill AOW to progress though.Especially not with the weapons available today.It would be nice for all upcoming guilds to have more shots at him,but,people find it easy to reach that level of content now and too many folks often compete for the spawns.I do think making his loot no drop would discourage pa folks and pp farmers.It's late for that though.<br />
<br />
Lelith is right in suggesting that AOW not being available is not a serious impediment to a guilds progress.He wasn't there for us.I'd bet there are tons of good targets up all the time for guilds at that stage on most servers.If he was up when we had folks available and a warrior needing a BOC we'd probably kill him.Certainly someones going to.Personally,I don't like bottomfeeding &quot;special&quot; targets that I know lower content guilds desire just because I know what it was  to want to raid AOW.Still it's a grey area.My wife and I used to kill LODI when he popped in the wee hours for a month when we needed spells and stuff.Of course almost no one was around back then on Stromm tho someone usually latched onto his spawn time to farm him awhile.We only killed him about 10 times,but, we did it for loot to sell and give away.<br />
<br />
So I hate pa folks farming content intended for gamers enjoyment.However,It can be fun to occaisonally take down what used to be a raid target with a smaller force.I know there were level 40 to 50 ish gulds that would have liked LODI ,though, he would have been killed before they got there.I did manage to pass him to a guild once hehe.Where AOW used to be a difficult target ,now any bazar geared raid force can run in and drop him.Mudflation has made him a walking bullseye.From ubers who are on line  alot and can mobilize quickly to casual guilds who have down very little raiding at all he his an easy &amp; juicy<br />
 target.That is the problem. Making his loot no drop would help a little imo,but, I doubt that will happen.He was hardly there for us and he was our number one target 4 night a week for months on what was at the time a very new server.Only one warrior in our guld got a BOC then.This didn't hinder our progression at all.I'll bet there's lots of stuff up for the majority of guilds at this content level.The easy shiny targets like kael and bot towers often go down first.</div></div><hr />

They did have a 4th toon, my friend was a pally doing patch heal but he is not elemental so I do not think he was that much of a booster, he also did some meleeing/second rampage for when the cleric backed off to heal.<br />

DA can be clicked off btw, so not being able to cast can be worked around.</div></div><hr />
