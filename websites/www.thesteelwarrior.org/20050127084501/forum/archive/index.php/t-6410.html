Of course Im trying to get Great blade of storms, but until then I need to debate weather to use my red epic( 15sta and nice proc ) or Copper Hammer of Striking or Sword of the Bloodsworn, suggestions please.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">put the GBoS in primary when you get it and offhand the hammer.  proc on gbos is = to or slightly better than CHSD, and the GBoS will, of course, do more dmg.<br />
<br />
for now i would just stick with your red epic as an offhand weapon.  in the offhand its not that much worse than either of the other 2 ... the dps loss is minimal and the proc is good aggro.   epic weapons are a badge of honor.  if you have em, show em off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a BoC in my primary (with Anger2), and I've recently decided to move away from the Ancient Prismatic Mace I'm toting in my offhand in favor of a double-proc weapon.<br />
<br />
Since I already have the epic, I'm starting with the red epic offhand.<br />
<br />
My first goal, tho, is to upgrade the Anger2 to Anger3 on the BoC - no matter what other weapon I get, I'll always end up using the BoC for aggro control, might as well &quot;finish it off&quot; as it were.<br />
<br />
If I don't have another decent aggro-proc weapon fall into my lap, I'll probably put Anger2 on the red epic, for offhand, since double-hate proc is more valuable to me than DD or DPS - and the proc from the red epic is a NICE hate proc to have around.</div></div><hr />
