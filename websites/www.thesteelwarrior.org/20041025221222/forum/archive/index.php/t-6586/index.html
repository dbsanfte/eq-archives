I don't use the new skin, partly cuz the *New Posts* button is the button I use and I like it up top and prominent in the TSW skin.  Tren-Z is too low contrast, the fonts be too small (but tweakable via browser, so no biggie), and the buttons to *squinty* for me, on my machine.  Looks gorgeous, just doesn't work for me well.  The TSW skin is great for me, tho.  Behind the  skins, the new site layout works great.  <br />
<br />
The TSW skin menu drop-downs don't line up with the links that drop em down at full screen, but they're pretty close when the window is half-sized.  If I could turn the menu *wipe* effect off, I would, but I'm like that and I don't really care.<br />
<br />
Overall, I really like what you've done with the place tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On the frontpage can you place a link that take you to the Forum List.  The only link there takes you back to the first page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i thought the old skin was great and easier to read</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Theres a link to the forums on the main page of every skin i've seen.<br />
<br />
Which are you using that doesnt have one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Steelwarror Vbulletin V3 style.  On the frontpage the only link that works is the one that takes you to the frontpage.  Also for the the adds on top of the forum should be set back to the images not the text it will get people attention more.</div></div><hr />

If yer go to the top level (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org) of the site, there's this dealie near the top left:<br />
<br />
The Steel Warrior<br />
 &gt; The Steel Warrior<br />
<br />
In the old style red and black skin, the top *The Steel Warrior* links to the top level page, and in the TrenZ it links to the forum list.<br />
<br />
It's actually a little wonky either way, design wise - it seems counter to the site hierarchy ... could just be like:<br />
<br />
The Steel Warrior &lt;~~ no link, this is the top level<br />
&gt; Forums &lt;~~ link to forums board</div></div><hr />

Yep that did it.  I wasnt suspecting the Logo to be the link to the Forums I was thought second &quot;The Steel warrior&quot; the one that was indented was suppose to be the link.  Sorry about that</div></div><hr />

I never thought to check the logo either ... I always assume *logo == top level (home) page*, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Change is hard to go through. THough in a week all will be used to it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like it!  Look is nice and clean although like someone else said earlier it was a tiny bit easier to read before IMO but definitetly looks more profesional now.  I do however have a question.  Does vB3 support database read/unread topic tracking?  Just wondering since I can't tell from their feature list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am having an issue with still recieving email notifications when people post to threads I suscribed to even though I turned off that feature.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the old way was way easier to manuver through, just click on talkin and you were where you wanted to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You can just click 'The Steel Warrior' now and it takes you straight to the main forum page. It's a small bit down on the left side (if you're using Tren_Z)</div></div><hr />
