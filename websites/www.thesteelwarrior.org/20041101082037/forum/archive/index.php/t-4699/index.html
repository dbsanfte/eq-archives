<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>norbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick question about the Furious IV bash shield I picked up from Auliffe (I think, bad memory) What is the verdict on this sheild on how well it is for aggro? I use it with Copper Hammer, or I would use Copper Hammer with Sword of the Bloodsworn. I just got it and haven't really tried it out yet. So if anyone out there has had much experience with this shield or in a group where tank uses this shield I'd love your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you want to lose 20-30% of your dps for exp groups? I own one myself but only time I break it out is if im offtanking something solo while rest of guild beats something down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Stormrider Carapice has limited usefulness IMO.  I bascially use it when I don't have to worry too much about my agro.  Such as when I am off tanking, or when I am taking a rooted mob.  Other wise, it only comes out to boost my hps when we have a hps contests he he.<br />
<br />
It might be better once the changes on the 16th occur, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to have to aggree. I blew a ton of DKP for this shield thinking FB 4 was something spectacular. Needless to say this item either rots or goes for 1 pt.<br />
<br />
A good use is if you are offtanking Ssrae emp encounter, and don't want mob to die =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its marginally useful if you use &quot;ruatha&quot; shield swapping (which depending on your tolerance for swapping is acceptable or not).<br />
<br />
As posters stated above it has extremely limited usages as a &quot;stayed equipped&quot; item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">only time i ever use a shield is like the above poster. when im oting something and just want to keep dmg down whilst the rest of the raid is beating on other mobs.<br />
<br />
unless SOE change shields use, the marginal mitigation you get from the extra AC is not sufficient to offset the loss in dps and the aggro that you get from a decent offhander, especially in exp situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're willing to go through the hassle of dual wielding until bash is ready, swapping your shield in to hit bash, then immediately swapping your secondary weapon back in then a FB shield will work nicely.  Otherwise really the only use is for rampage tanking where you don't care about your DPS, you want low aggro, and the extra AC from a shield is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It helps you on EQrankings.com<br />
<br />
Beyond that it is barely worth a bag slot but I did pull mine out occaisionally when I had one.  I wouldn't even think about using it in an exp group though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kruscher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The old tried and true method (Ruatha? it has been a long time) of shield swapping was done so puny warriors could achieve a stun result on a bash, or whatever it is shorties do with a shield, instead of us trollies with our fist.  It isn't hard to set up, just have an open inventory slot, enjoy your shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dvorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For me, I have found that I use it in two situations.  1.  Doing high risk adventures and the riposte is killing me and 2.  Off Tanking mobs and I want to boost to the upper 1500s AC.<br />
<br />
Of course, number 1 would not happen if I had a good 2hs with an anger proc, but no way am I spending points to slap an anger aug on a Windblade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nordicsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just got an Aegis of the Earth and have been using it stictly for playing the off tank on raids and I love it for that aspect.  <br />
<br />
But... from what I have experienced, for most MT and especially exp situations... lose the shield atm....  Sword and Shield is not ready for prime time yet :( <br />
<br />
Although,  the melee changes might change some things that will make shields more viable for warriors....  So don't destroy that shield yet lol.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

Nordic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>digmus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">was thinking the exact same thing as Nordic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll use it for pure defense situations.  Especially if I'm not sure that I can trust my healer.  The extra ac and hp are a little bit of an edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love mine for off tanking and for wading into unslowed boss mob types during the debuff.  Supposedly the FB focus affects spell hate, but afaik that dont work.  It does seem to be ok a generating steady (but a bit low) hate.  Its also great for pulling trains setting up for a rampage hit.  But as a MT aggro item, its not very helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use it (Aegis of Earth)  for Rampage tanking and on some elemental gods and for offtanking in time trials.<br />
<br />
Its also nice if you have Living Shield 3 and need to save an enchanter when charms break in LDON hard etc.<br />
<br />
It doesnt do what people orginally thought it was suppose to but its still useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got an Aegis of the Earth this weekend and I tried it for the first time when tanking Sol Ro last night. It was a pleasant surprise. <br />
<br />
For about a minute I DW BoC and Double-Edged Stormblade. We were a little light on healers and when my DI fired, I thought it might be time to experiment. I swapped in the Aegis, never lost aggro, had only one death, and the fight was a breeze.<br />
<br />
Until I get a good 2 hander, this seems to be a reasonable alternative for tanking bigger mobs.<br />
<br />
I would not use this for exp groups or when not MTing on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">also nice for tank mezzing during the Rathe encounter.  gnoll hide lariat + shield gives you low sustained dps to limit the damage you do plus extra aggro to keep your designated healers from getting smacked.<br />
<br />
our guild has the aegis of earth way overpriced for its limited use (rampage tank and tank mezzing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">pulled out my Zek Crusted yesterday in BoT, killing mini bosses.<br />
<br />
the cleric and I were fresh lvl 65, the slower was 62...<br />
<br />
we had  a rough time keeping me alive, so i decided to go slash&amp;board and fights became easy : more AC/HP, less ripostes, good agro (zek is FB III)<br />
<br />
so to answer partially the question : should we use a shield ?<br />
my answer would be : it depends :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Agreed, its very situational, I have fb shield<br />
and I slapped a sv magic augs on it, loads of fun <br />
in a closed setting of friends where you can not have to worry about ping pong.  Few named that hit pretty hard with no slower<br />
and iv used it several time like that.</div></div><hr />

We got like 3 of them in 2 adventures :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I have used it, I don't have a feel for it's true effectiveness.<br />
<br />
What's the aggro on a bash, anyway?  More than the blow from a weapon?  Bash cycles about once a tic, my off-hand is up to 3x that fast.  So it would have to be a lot of aggro to make it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
And against boss mobs, you'd still have that problem of ripostes with our on-hand 1h weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ruges</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you can keep agro with it. It would be better to use when MTing a boss mob right? after all you are just there to absorb the dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I use Aegis and bbote sometimes after i've achieved solid aggro, its not too shabby, much &lt;3 for the AC and HP boost<br />
keep bow out though if i need damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I tried the shield I mentioned above in some hard LDoNs.  The cleric said he couldn't tell the difference.  I didn't hold aggro any better or any worse.  My DPS dropped.  So I don't use it.  I think in order for me to use it it would have to be something like 200 AC.  Simply put, it has to have a discernable effect.  Or perhaps something more than &quot;increased bash aggro&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe these shields are meant for those few-and-far-between untauntable mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The ONLY use I see for shields is for a rampage tank that doesn't want aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow, did they nerf the fact that FB adds aggro to procs?  ie a FB4 shield adds 40% hate to each proc.  I've used the FB4 shield with a BoC and after one proc the mob locked on me solid.  For an exp group, I'd say its useless unless you're tanking a named with a short stacked group.  I use it in situations where surviveability is much more important then Aggro.  Given of course that the aggro is sufficient not to get your healers killed.  <br />
<br />
I have been tanking wing nameds with my 4 winds when our Cleric LDed leaving our Druid surprised and healing.  So I went Shield 1hs to lower ripostes, increase hps, and increase AC all by a little.  With a surprised healer who I am personally unfamiliar with, I just want to give him that extra second or two.  At that point in the fight I had aggro fine.  If you might need every little bit to stay alive in very rare and hectic situations, its a decent choice.  Especially with the help of Incite.  <br />
<br />
I've also gone shield on the Caprin Cycle.  With a nice Piggy back from our Knights on the rooted boogers, I never lost aggro once and I called Assist very very early.  I also survived a 5k lifetapping mob without spellshield getting chained on my ass.  <br />
<br />
Keep in mind, I'd never spend DKP for a shield.  Easy enough to do Auliffe that it's not worth the points by a long shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Do remember that AoE &gt; Stormriders Carapace very much so.No really a good comparison</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bjarki_bearskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I am glad I came and read this.  I have been wanting, if not definitive information, at least someone else other than myself.  I so wanted this shield (Stormrider Carapace) because I just knew it would be great aggro.<br />
<br />
I have been under the impression lately that it isn't working as well as I had intended or SOE intended.<br />
<br />
Going back to CHSD &amp; SoBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I use my Stormiders Carapace to ghetto bash on raid-level mobs.  I haven't tried leaving it in after I have solid lockdown of aggro, although that might be worth a try.  In exp groups, it stays in the bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Geneya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It looks to me like we may see 1h + shield become a more viable choice for boss mob tanking with the release of Gates of Discord. The inclusion of the Shield Specialization skill in the GoD Beta makes it look like warriors may be getting the &quot;innate chance to block with a shield&quot; they have mentioned in the past, and this pending AA skill will further increase the ability:<br />
<br />
Shield Specialization<br />
This is a passive ability; it does not need to be actived.<br />
Requirements: Level: 65, No previous ability requirements.<br />
Ranks in this ability increase your chance to block with your shield.<br />
<br />
Levels: 5 - Cost for first level: 3<br />
<br />
This could be pretty cool. We will have to wait and see if/how they implement it.</div></div><hr />
