and a big question...<br />
<br />
do augments take the procrate of the weapon, or their own value?<br />
<br />
I'm sure this is answered elsewhere, but the definitive  answer would be a welcome addition to this information.<br />
<br />
EDIT: a large rat &gt; Korinn  :P HUTTAH!  <br />
<br />
LDoN augments should have their own value.  The original weapon proc should proc more often than the LDoN augment.  I've parsed this on my rogue and beastlord and I've also seen parses on the ranger forum.  Here's what I parsed on my rogue:<br />
<br />
305 dex unbuffed, zero buffs, 41% worn haste:<br />
39,181 seconds ( almost 11 hours )<br />
<br />
Ifir................... 1285, 1.976 / min<br />
Ifir augment ...... 1167, 1.78 / min<br />
GRMK................ 660, 1.01 / min<br />
GRMK augment.... 608, 0.93 / min<br />
<br />
another stat, ingenuity 3, 288 crit blasts, 9.25% crit blast rate</div></div><hr />

It looks like for the 2 cleric weapons I had concerns about, EQEmu didn't have up to date info most likely, as Lucy now has correct info for the Coral Headed Mace, though it hasn't collected the info from the Hammer of Holy Vengeance yet. Another EQ mystery solved :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take the BF one makes it 2.55 procs, the other makes it 3.1 procs per minute. <br />
<br />
The 530 mods would make those weapons proc 7.3 or 12.6 per minute. 12.6 seems too high to me so I reckon its 2 procs per minute + This_Mod/100.</div></div><hr />

<br />
530-mod weapons get 12.6 PPM.<br />
<br />
PPM (assuming 305 dex) = 2((100 + unknown_070)/100)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Logic would agree with the other couple posts about it already, http://eqemulator.net/item.php?id=MTM1MTAwLjMwMjA4MDg5 has a 070 number of 0, I did not check every aug, though. Why would they have a number of their own otherwise is the logic?<br />
<br />
However the best way would be for someone to take a Bloodfrenzy and aug it with whatever (the one above is a cheap 40pt aug from Tak) then parse it... if you are getting as many procs as the main BF proc, then you know it IS dependent on the weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, read my post on the first page. Clerics have already done this - Furious Hammer of Zek = 12.6PPM, any aug proc = 2PPM. Augmented procs are independent of a weapon's innate proc, and use the standard 2PPM.</div></div><hr />

Scepter of destruction is not in there  SoD was parsed as normal long ago on this board. Do a search for BoC and SoD procs, you'll find it.</div></div><hr />

It's listed that Hategiver and Blade of Carnage have the same proc rates, but almost everyone seems to agree that HG procs far more often than a BoC does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panazule</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a HG and a BoC and honestly I notice no real difference in proc rates between the two of them.<br />
<br />
I also have a Anger III augment on the sword from Maestro (15/19 with the 160dd poison proc) and from using that sword in primary it appears, no parse info to prove this, but it the naked eye that that the rage proc somehow coincides with the proc rate of the items innate effect.<br />
<br />
I have anger III on my HG/BoC and my Anathema and while there is no way to tell them apart log wise since they seem to have identical messages, the items seem to have easily doubled the twists in fury messages.<br />
<br />
Before I had anger III on my BoC, I had the ykesha proc on my BoC and I must say that Ykesha proc went off like MAD, again leading me to believe that it somehow was tied into the proc rate of the parent effect.<br />
<br />
Just speculation, If I get some free time I'll actually try to parse some things although it will be more difficult to now since the dd proc is now off of my BoC since they upped the hate on the Anger III.<br />
<br />
Very good thread and informative, will be good to see more results on this down the road.</div></div><hr />
