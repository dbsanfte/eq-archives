<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A Full log of AoW is gonna be way too long to post, what exactly do you want to know?  I have a few logs of AoW lying around that I could crunch numbers for you if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's one from some time ago, I took over when MT died with AoW around 60%. At the time I had 1350AC, 7500hp and no defensive AA. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks! <br />
<br />
Was trying to figure out what his DPS was while defensive and once defensive wears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How many Hit Points does he have btw?<br />
<br />
Looks like max in one round damage while defensive = 2816? (254 DB and 22.5 DI)<br />
<br />
AoW = Rampage, not flurry, yes?<br />
<br />
He appears to hit about once every 1.56 seconds on average? That seems really low...392 total hits including bashes etc in 4 mins and 12 seconds? am I missing something? <br />
<br />
Is part of that time not you tanking? <br />
<br />
My understanding was max quad 704 every 1.7 seconds or something, so 4 Second Cheal Chain on a 7500 hp tank would be sufficient...<br />
<br />
Did you live Brokkah?<br />
<br />
Did you tank him for 1 min 12 seconds non-defensive? Is that when the 19 max hits for 1154 came in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes I lived :)<br />
<br />
Log is from when I started tanking only, I tanked full length of defensive and 1m 12sec without disc.<br />
<br />
The max hits are from when discipline wore off, yes.<br />
<br />
He flurries so dmg output is pretty spiky, hence the need for a tighter ch chain than the average numbers suggest. He doesnt flurry very much, but a bad round can still really hurt you.<br />
<br />
No clue on his HP, he does have fairly high mitigation though.<br />
<br />
As you can also see from that parse, damage shields are a nice bit of dps for the MT, get a bard in your MT group :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How fast was the cheal chain on you and how many clerics?<br />
<br />
So no rampage on AoW or Rampage and flurry?<br />
<br />
and I still dont understand how he only gets to 392 total hits in that time frame.<br />
<br />
I am right at your Hps, but have CA 3 PE and CS 1. I wonder how much my parse would look like hmmmm......<br />
<br />
<br />
Jakle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AoW flurries, bashes, kicks and quads.<br />
<br />
Max number of hits in one round would be quad, 2 hit flurry, bash, kick = 8 hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We usually do 2 second chain on AoW, better to be safe than sorry since after disc goes down your maintank is gonna be hurting.  Looking at my log from the last AoW we did we killed him in around 7 minutes and he did 690 dps on the MT who has defensive AAs maxed.  Of course this average dps number is a mix of defensive and non-defensive.  Also as people above have mentioned AoW has very spikey damage.  I was two boxing in the CH chain on this kill and I landed one CH for 7.3K even with a 2 second chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2 second chain, seven clerics = cheal every 15 seconds (ish) so 4 cheals a minute, 28 cheals over the fight?<br />
<br />
You must have some mega Mana regen amigo, or ridiculous mana pools, or lots and lots of clerics.<br />
<br />
The best we have been able to get to lately is: <br />
<br />
Tranq 16<br />
Manasong 14<br />
BST crack 5<br />
POTN 9<br />
<br />
or about 390 mana per minute. That basically gives you one free cheal a minute. so if you had 7 free cheals, you would still need to be able to cast 21 over the course of your mana pool, which is 8400 mana?<br />
<br />
I think we must be doing something wrong LOL. I wish I had clerics/mana like that. I would do a 2 second chain too :)<br />
<br />
Maybe my math is screwed up:<br />
<br />
We did a 5 second cheal chain on vindicator with 3 clerics and the little one (admittedly only level 51) was OOM after 5 minutes and 17 seconds. He got back 5 cheals total and I guess he let off about 20 total. so he cast 6000 mana worth of heals. Oh yah our bard died immediately too. so we didnt even have Manasong...there is no way he has a 6k manapool.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong with my calcs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Specialization checks could be the reason the numbers don't come out so nicely on paper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Our MA just tanked him Aggresive for the final 20% of the fight. Was pretty funny to watch - think he hits in the 1600's when you're aggresive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Add Yaulp VI, Paragon, Mind Wrack (albeit we dont use this) to your mana numbers :)<br />
<br />
Just killed him again, 8 clerics and MT hp hardly moved :( He's kinda easy now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We usually do a 5 cleric, 2 second CH chain for AoW. While I'm defensive he's not so bad, but I always seem to get a couple flurries close together after defensive wears off and die. Most of the clerics don't come close to going oom, but some of our newer or less geared ones do have mana trouble. My wife has ft 13, etc, never ducks a heal and usually ends the fight around 50-70% mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well in the parse I have a log from while 2 boxing a cleric I did 39 CHs in 10 mins or so.  The cleric I was playing isn't uber, but he is 65 with scm3 and some low FT number like FT 2-3.  We did have a necro in our group doing mindwrack and I had the usual Po9, C5 beastlord crack type buffs on.  Oh I also used a mod rod either once or twice during the fight I can't remember.   On Rallos zek server you can mindwarck PCs so that makes it somewhat easier than on a blue I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What am I doing wrong with my calcs? <br />
<br />
Quite simply, you're relying on them too much.  You can crunch all the numbers you want, but that alone isn't going to win you any fights.  Instead of trying to find the lowest threshold you can win at, go out and improve your guild's equipment and skills.  Tell your clerics to work on shawls, make sure they have CT boots, have them get the SCM and MC AA skills, etc.  Failing that, get more clerics and stop using 51s in a chain.  I don't know where you're at in terms of raid progression, but if you're just starting out and you can only muster 2 clerics and a 51 for your raids, you're going to be in trouble.</div></div><hr />

VoQ and yaulp VI will give more mana. Also, set up your necros to twitch.  Mod rods help too, you want to mod as soon as your mana drops enough for it to be useful, in case you need to mod again at the end.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if you do a 2 sec CH chain(cleric counts 2 then hits ch), its really 4seconds in real time due to latency. otherwise you couldnt get away with using 5 clerics for 2sec CH chain. you can see this for yourself by looking at logs.<br />
<br />
in fact the fastest you can do real time CHing is about 2seconds, even if cleric2 casts as soon as cleric1 says go. if there is any lag, it may even wind up being as much as 3-4 second delay realtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I doubt that the lag in EQ is as much as 2 seconds.  Maybe if you are running on a really realy slow computer or something.  You can test this because if you are running a really tight CH chain at 2 seconds with 6 clerics then your spells will have just recycled when its time for you to cast again (CH takes 10 seconds to cast and spells gems take 2 seconds to refresh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Great info :)<br />
<br />
Aeryl, the reason I use the bottom calculations is that we dont recruit anyone and we arent likely to have new people stepping through the door any time soon. I can only use what I have available. This is a tiny family guild and that is the way it will stay :) The AA stuff will take care of itself. I am not sure how the clerics feel about tradeskilling, but I will mention it. FT 3 boots is a great idea. I will set up some CT loving hopefully soon. We are going to take out Velk one of these years too.<br />
<br />
Gnomos, same comment goes to levels. I cant get these guys going any faster :) Yaulp VI looks almost impossible from where I stand ROFL. Our Chanter is awesome though so VoQ is not too far off. Great advice though.<br />
<br />
Velk, that looks great. MGB paragon is an awesome idea, I just have to get my BST friends up and levelling LOL. Same with our bard, who is only 55 :) No Necros in the guild atm :(<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information you guys. It does help a lot. I love being able to pull off stuff with my guildies. Every time someone wins an item, its like christmas around the house :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Fought AoW last night, figured I'd share the info. I tanked him the entire fight, first in defensive and then quite a while out. There were 6 clerics on a 2s rotation, and I had shammies and a couple druids doing backup heals. Divine Intervention was used and fired at 3/4 of the way in when I went about 4s without a heal (definitely not in disc at that point). <br />
<br />
I have max defensive AA -- CA 8, CS 8, SE 3, PE, PP 5, etc. I also have TM 3, and Ferocity 1 for the fight. I was wielding GBoS and CHSD. HP was a bit over 8600, AC 1400ish. There were 49 people in the raid, 2 people died. One was a warrior who is dual wielding a GBoS and XTC offhand, he simply got agro and poofed 2s later. The other was a ranger with a Tunare snare stick, he didn't last very long either. ;) Beyond that I held agro the whole time.<br />
<br />
The log is at http://www.hivetheory.com/aow.txt so you can parse it yourself.<br />
<br />
My magelo the same as I had during the fight, except for getting Ferocity 2 later that night and a new BoC that he was kind enough to drop. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Grats on BoC time to retire that CHSD :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Jesus. That 2 second Cheal chain was crazy...<br />
<br />
I didnt see a single Cheal for more than 3k for like the first quarter of the parse LOL.<br />
<br />
Looks like you had lots of spam healing though too...<br />
<br />
Hey if you got it, use it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not that my guild was the first ever to kill AoW or anything, but back then I only had 6700hp and 1300ac fully buffed and we still won. Ofcourse we did switch tanks when disc was down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Basically it was just the way we used our resources. We have one other warrior at about my level, plus 2 who are on break at the moment. We have a lot of druids, at least 3 of which are more focused on the backup healing side of things vs nuking.<br />
<br />
So, rather than go through the potential chaos of a tank switch, it seemed safer to stick with one tank and just assume the healing could keep up, which it did.<br />
<br />
As you can see from the log, tanking AoW in defensive isn't that tough. Out of defensive is another story completely, even with him missing me about 30% of the time it doesn't take much of a hiccup to die. So yeah, I don't think this is the ideal strategy for a guild trying to kill him without our healing resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well looking at that parse check out the MAX complete heals from the clerics.  Even at 2 seconds one CH landed for 7.6K and another time DI fired and saved him.  Really that is the way a CH chain should be, the average CH isnt going to be too much, but you will have some really large heals when the mob gets a luck round of mostly max hits + flurry and such.  I mean if you don't plan for the spikey bad damage rounds from mobs then your tanks will end up dying a lot.<br />
<br />
This is the same way we do AoW, btw, one tank the whole time without switching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So you basically cant do one Tank on AoW until you have a 7 minute sustainable 2 second Cheal chain and Tanks with 8k+ hps?<br />
<br />
Bummer hehe.<br />
<br />
P.S. Thanks for all the posts jerkys, I dreamed last night that I was coming out of Vindi's little pathing area just as the Statue of Rallos was falling down to some friends of mine. <br />
<br />
Then I caught a glimpse of the Idol scurrying back down the vindi ramp trying to get in place in the tunnel, like he was late or something rofl.<br />
<br />
Their GL kept asking me, where is the idol, where is the idol?<br />
<br />
I peeked around the corner and some coldains were building the idol from the ground up in some weird thurg-looking room that doesnt exist in the game in Kael Drakkal...<br />
