<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When is the last time you heard of a successful 10th ring war?<br />
<br />
We tried one last night on Povar--which supposedly has not had a successful one in 3 months. I do know we failed on the 3rd wave. <br />
<br />
From what I understand is that some of the runners are impossible to stop. They immideately break root and wont even stop with 10+ people hitting them. Most in the guild now consider this quest broken.<br />
<br />
Additionally I am hearing reports that it is currently impossible to raise Dain faction (that there is something bugged with it.) Can anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>arkhat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's still working fine, as far as I know. My guild had one scheduled saturday and got bumped by another guild that successfully completed it. The runners are annoying and hard to stop, but it doesn't seem broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No idea on the Dain faction thing but my guild had a successful ring war last week.  Not overly concerned with him myself: I have my ring so as soon as my guildies are done, he can die for all I care.<br />
<br />
For runners, snare and root, repeatedly. Get debuffs on if you can. Remember this is a Velious event (Velious: home of magic reistance from hell) and especially on the 3rd wave, the mobs can be hard to control if you're not ready. The key is to get tanks/knights on as many as you can, as soon as you can (once they are clear of the Spearmen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drinal completed one perfectly succesfully about 2 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Completed the 10th ring war yesterday on Xev. Nothing seemed broken to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK then, How about some pointers then, I was there at the Povar one, I was just taggin for faction. But I did notice last night that everyone was waiting at the gaurds in front of the water falls. I have seen previous ones where the forces were both here and further out. By the time they got to where you guys were it was a very very short run to the entrance. Also most of the giants on the final wave ran behind alot of your guys, so it was more of a chase fest. My guess would be it wasnt organized enough. The third wave came from the side, but all the people were lined up to take a hit from the fron. Just an observation, hope someone post more on this as I am not totally familure with this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I for one was up on the hill behind the spearmen on the west on the 3rd wave, and there were a goodly number with me there. Looked like we ran into some problems with the elite guard, but I have no clue where they came from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmmmmm<br />
<br />
Well the ones i saw run right past without problem came between hill and gaurd tower. The forces were in between towers and a little behind, so these guys just flowed through, I was in the group that was running behind them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Key to a nice easy ring war is a bard with Highsun.  Gates the runners back to spawn point...rinse...repeat.<br />
<br />
About Dain faction, I don't know, but there are only a few mobs in game that give Dain hits anyway.  Tormax and his guards give Dain hits, so that would be my recommendation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have  using ranger track. to figure out where they are<br />
position on the river by that big rock.<br />
<br />
When you know the dircetion put MT on the warlord and have everyone else handle the runners. ( Have lots of rooters )<br />
<br />
Using the ranger fing out when everythign is kileld ecept warlord, then engage.<br />
<br />
Thats the strat we used and we won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Razzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We did a Ring War about 2 weeks ago on Mith Marr.<br />
<br />
Have a bard goalie... mobs are a lot slower when AE Snared. We also just sent the tanks headfirst into the waves of mobs right as they spawned. If it got hairy, they'd /disc Defensive and hope for the best. <br />
<br />
Runners were not that big of an issue last time we did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Corpsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had problem on first attempt at ring war where west mobs ran up the hill before some where engaged.  Warping was really bad and they wouldnt stop for anything.  I even did ae taunt in a group of them and they didnt even turn to look at me.  I think it has something to do with how quickly you engage the mobs.  Second time around we where sure to agro all giants right away and we had no problems.  Try it again with quicker engage.  Bards also is good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Strong Root on runners</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I two-boxed my druid for my own ring, and the roots breaking is not the biggest problem.  For the 3rd wave, anyway, it's getting the roots to stick at all.  I think a bard is just the best way to stop runners, no contest.</div></div><hr />
