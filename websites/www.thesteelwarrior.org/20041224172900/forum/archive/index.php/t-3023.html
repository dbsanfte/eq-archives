<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the consensus is that defensive AAs are the way to go, since the &quot;job of the warriors is to take damage, not deal damage&quot;.  However, I never hear the flip-side of what the benefits of offensive AAs are by comparison.  The obvious answer is they generate more aggro.<br />
<br />
If I recall, there are posts here that say having all the offensive AAs increases your dps by 40%.  So that would also increase your dps aggro component by 40%, on top of increasing the total number of double attacks, flurries and off-hand attacks you get per minute.  These likewise directly increase the number of procs you get per minute.<br />
<br />
Therefore you could potentially be looking at a sizable aggro increase by investing in offensive AAs.  Obviously, if you are having trouble holding aggro, this mitigates that problem. But even if you aren't having much trouble holding aggro, increasing your aggro allows your groupmates to further go &quot;all out&quot; against the mobs.  For example, the extra aggro might allow your casters to each throw in an extra spell or two per fight and the monks and rogues to avoid having to spend time feigning or evading to help toss back aggro occasionally.  Finally, the extra damage you do makes the fights a bit shorter, and therefore more mana and time efficient.<br />
<br />
<br />
So while I'm not saying you should neglect defensive AAs, I think a reasonable argument can be made that a warrior who takes some offensive AAs before completing their defensive AAs is not necessarilly losing anything significant, and might even be helping their group fight more efficiently if their defenses are already high.  <br />
<br />
I just always found it ironic that I see so many warriors complaining about our aggro, but then ignoring the AAs that can increase aggro.  Why not take a look at strengthening the weak area of the class a bit?  Just something to think about, I guess.</div></div><hr />

I beleive warriors are shooting themselves in the foot by takeing all the defensive AA first , meanwhile other dps classes are takeing offensive , widening the aggro gap even further.<br />
<br />
 I personally took 1 defensive then 1 offensive most the way through the AA , and ive really never had aggro problems.<br />
<br />
 People complain a lot about the warrior aa's because no single one does &quot;that&quot; much . However we have far more melee related AA than any other class and when you start to get a bunch of them it makes a big difference with regards to aggro managment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, the problem is that there are 2 roles for warriors... The raid warrior and the exp group warrior. In a raid, the warrior is assumed to have enough time/buffs/whatever to get aggro. Therefore having more defensive AAs means that the warrior is more likely to survive, while eatting less healer mana.<br />
<br />
  In an exp group, defensive AAs aren't nearly as vital. Important, of course, but you're fighting for aggro with people that generate much more than you easily. In this situation, any method of holding more aggro helps a ton. This combination means that offensive AAs are more useful.<br />
<br />
  I personally think I'm fine in exp groups. However, with even just half the defensive AAs, I was getting eatten far too quickly on raids. Therefore my focus was entirely on defensive AAs and I will be getting offensive AAs when I get the chance.</div></div><hr />

He decided that he was inferior to the rest of them (a complex of some sort) and that he would never be allowed to main tank, so he decided to put all of his AAs into offensive things.  A lot of them too.  The problem?  He was constantly drawing aggro.. and due to the complete lack of defensive abilities he would go splat quick every time.. at least while clearing trash in NToV or Ssra.  He was quite a bit more careful on boss mobs but would still overaggro every now and then..<br />
<br />
We all got a big laugh out of it, but it seems that putting points into offensive AAs (at least before the PoP ones came out) helped with aggro quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

Heh, that's a funny story. =)  It does illustrate the point pretty well, though, that offensive AAs can make a big difference in aggro.   It also demonstrates that if you DO go this route, and you're not the main tank, you may need to watch your aggro.  A lot of warriors, though, aren't used to getting too much aggro, and it sounds like that's exactly what happened to the warrior above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the HP AAs first, but after that I considered the AAs that increase your number of swings to be more important than defensive AAs.  With the exception of flurry (which takes a ton of AAs) I got all of the swing increasing AAs for 1 handers before doing any of the defensive stuff.  IMO it was worth it for the improved chance at aggro procs and the improved DPS that both contribute to holding aggro.<br />
<br />
It really depends on your aggro combo though.  I had BoC + Blackout and wasn't satisfied with the aggro when I had no offensive AAs.  If I had Bloodfrenzy + Hategiver I probably would have gone straight to defensive ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we've already found out (thanks to shammie boards, I believe) that proc is a set rate over time and haste and slows don't affect proc-rate over time.  I believe, like others, that this is coded as a set percentage chance of proc per swing under normal circumstances.<br />
<br />
If this is true, and the chance-per-proc doesn't decrease when you get additional attacks from AA, wouldn't it make sense that getting additional attacks would increase your proc rate over time since you're increasing your amount of swings in that time?  (did that make sense?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, this was exactly my point months ago and warriors like Haass kicked my ass for having the nerve to suggest offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem we face is perception, IMHO.  People already perceive Warriors to be the defensive king, and they should because we are!  It would take quite some defensive AA for a knight to reach the defensive capability of a warrior with few or no defensive AAs.  <br />
<br />
I personally am trying to be balanced, but I continue to lean toward offense.  People are surprised with my abilities to hold aggro in pick-up groups, and I think its because of my balanced approach.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I didn't get on your case for picking offensive, mostly I got on your case for going CF3 without getting flurry.  CF3 nets next to zero DPS increase.<br />
<br />
I can definitely see a bonus for having extra swings...Flurry, Ferocity, Punishing blade, Tactical Mastery, but Combat Fury just ain't the way to go for dumping 12 points in offensive AA's.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I also know the difference between having full (pre luclin) defensive AA's and having none, and it's a HUGE difference.  ND, CS, CA are a really big deal in your survivability.  I know it's a large point investment, but it is also a really good return on that investment.  In the end, do what you want, but the reason everyone says that defensive are the way to go is because they can see the difference without parsing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with defensive AAs is that your clerics start daydreaming about being wizards...  In a typical LDoN normal adventure the cleric will heal me once every 3 or 4 fights and nuke the rest of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anything to get rid of the monotony of the &quot;stand, click CH, sit, wait for next stand&quot; routine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By all means, get all AA's.  But, if you are on a budget, then you simply have been best served by most defensive AA's as a tank.  PoP emphasized this more than grouping in LDoN, for sure.  Defensive AA's aren't as fun or flashy, but they make you a much better tank.  Offensive AA's make you a much better tank too, but do you really wanna be a mana sponge paper tank looting your corpse all the time? :)  Tactical mastery is the only offensive AA I'd recommend getting early on, especially in PoP.</div></div><hr />
