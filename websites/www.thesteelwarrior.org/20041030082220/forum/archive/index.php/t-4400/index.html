<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all:<br />
<br />
Like to get some feedback on best 1 hander setups for aggro and DPS from the following weapons/AAs...<br />
<br />
Current aggro setup:<br />
<br />
pri: Sceptre of Destruction (SoD)<br />
sec: Copper Hammer of Striking (CHoS)<br />
<br />
Current DPS setup:<br />
<br />
pri: Horror Shard Blade (HSB)<br />
sec: Loathsome Bludgeon of Depravity (LBoD)<br />
<br />
stats:<br />
<br />
SoD:  12/18, 288 dmg proc (procs fairly often - 2/3 per short fight)<br />
CHoS: 13/20<br />
HSB:  13/17, 120dd proc (procs very often - 5/6 per short fight)<br />
LBoD: 15/20<br />
<br />
I've been using 2 handers exclusively for months now, and just decided to get back into 1 handers and upgraded to these weapons, so have not had a chance to parse extensively. Early parses show (surprisingly) that SoD+LDoB gives me roughly the same DPS (~105 average over an LDoN addy) as HSB+LBoD, I'd guess due to the 288 dmg proc from the SoD, even though HSB's frostcall procs more often. <br />
<br />
In terms of offensive AAs, I have CF3, PB3, TM3, Fero3.<br />
<br />
Tangentially, a question for those with Ambi: did this improve 1 hander DPS substantially? Can you quantify? Trying to decide between ambi and flurry next...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have any parses but if you're deciding between flurry and ambi, get flurry. It works wether you use DW or 2h. eventually get both but flurry would be more benefit first I would think.</div></div><hr />
