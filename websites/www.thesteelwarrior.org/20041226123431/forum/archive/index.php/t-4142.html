<br />
Proposed changes headed by &quot;*&quot; symbol, commentary in parenthesis<br />
<br />
Proposed changes as follows:<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Innate Class Abilities:<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
*  Skill caps: All caps for weapon/secondary/defense skills should be set to 252 maximum.<br />
<br />
(This improves Warrior tanking slightly without necessitating a change to a higher mitigation table and potentially unbalancing the class in relation to other tanks)<br />
<br />
* ADD: Instill Doubt ability recieved by Monks and Rogues. Warrior I.D. skill cap should be set to a maximum of 252.<br />
<br />
(Adds some utility and a way for the naked warrior on C.R. to potentially stave off a MOB.)<br />
<br />
* Berserk: Health at which Berserk takes effect changed to be equal to the current level of the warrior, Ex. a level 65 warrior becomes berserk at 65% health.<br />
<br />
(Makes better sense than the current system, and increases the amount of time we can perform crippling blows, which makes use of our &quot;superior&quot; critical abilites. Also differentiates us from other tanks) <br />
<br />
* Shield: Change to hotkeyed, group only ability. All current benefits and penalites, however the warrior can shield a person as long as the sheilded player remains within shield range(I.E. no more duration).  <br />
<br />
When the hotkey is clicked, a menu with current group member names and an option to &quot;End Shielding&quot; pops up. The warrior can select the player they wish to Shield by clicking their name in the context menu, and Shielding will begin provided the chosen player is currently in range. <br />
<br />
If for whatever reason the Shielded player moves out of range they are no longer Shielded, however if the player comes back into Shielding range, Shielding resumes with no input from the warrior. Shielding of the chosen player continues until the warrior changes the player he wishes to shield or discontinues the use of the ability via the option on the context menu.<br />
<br />
(Shield is at the moment counter intuitive, a pain to use, and very often useless due to the length of the /shield, the reuse time, and the close range which must be maintained. This change addresses these concerns. It also improves warrior stackability in exp groups and raids.)<br />
<br />
* Taunt: Each taunt, regardless of success or failure of the skill, shall add a small amount of straight &quot;hate&quot; points equal to the  level of the warrior, I.E. 65 points each taunt for a 65 warrior. <br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Disciplines:<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
* Resistant: Increases resistances 2 pt per warrior level, for a total of 130 to each reistance score for a level 65 warrior. Duration of 3 minutes, reuse of 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
* Fearless: Duration increase to 3 minutes, Reuse lowered to 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
*Evasive, Defensive, Precise, and Aggressive changed into hotkeyed abilities called stances. <br />
<br />
Stances:<br />
<br />
- Grant all the benefits and disadvantages as per the current disciplines<br />
- Cannot be used in conjunction with one another<br />
- Are hotkeyed abilities simliar to sneak, hide, Feign Death, etc.<br />
- Can be used as long as the warrior wishes(extremely lengthy duration)<br />
- Can be stopped when the warrior wishes<br />
- Can be changed with a minimal (six second) delay between stance changes<br />
<br />
(Massive change. This change will allow warriors to be much more flexible in combat, improves stackability thanks to the ability to use precise/aggressive stances to improve DPS if not tanking, and gives warriors a unique set of abilities which tie into the &quot;masters of combat&quot; motif.)<br />
<br />
* Charge/Fellstrike/Mightystrike: Collapse into one discipline, 10 second duration, 30 minute recycle at 60. Call it &quot;Charging Fellstrike of the Mighty&quot; or whatever.<br />
<br />
(So many separate offensive disciplines are overly redundant. Combining the three makes sense, as the warrior is concentrating totally on doing the most damage in the shortest time possible by any means possible.)<br />
<br />
* Furious/Fortitude: Unchanged.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
AA:<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
* ADD: Fighting Words(Ed. note: stupid title, but appropriate) This AA has three levels, and is available as a Luclin class ability. It increases the chance taunt will succeed by 15% for each level of the ability. Each level costs 2 points, for a total of six points to max the AA. <br />
<br />
(Taunt isn't broken per se, ladies and gentlemen, it just don't work often enough. This addresses the issue somewhat.)<br />
<br />
* ADD: War Steed, instant summon horse similar to current Unholy charger/Holy Steed hybrid abilities. Horse summoned should be brown. Cost of 5 AA, availiable at level 60.<br />
<br />
(Helps with non PoP CR, it's neat, improves mobility, survivability.)<br />
<br />
* Flurry: Change to hotkeyed special ability which shares the Kick/Bash timer, each level of flurry ability allows the warrior one more swing in the flurry (total of six). Reuse time rises by 5 seconds each level. Addition of &quot;emote&quot; which indicates usage of ability.<br />
<br />
First level: one extra swing, reuse 5 seconds<br />
Second level: 2 swings, 10 seconds.<br />
Third level: 3 swings, 15 seconds.<br />
Fourth level: 4 swings, 20 seconds.<br />
Fifth level: 5 swings, 25 seconds.<br />
Sixth Level: 6 swings, 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
(Reduces reliance on the R.N.G, and adds another way for the warrior to potentially add to or regain mob aggro during combat through temporary increased DPS and/or the chance of a proc, adds stackability through increased dps. At lower levels, the skill acts as an improved &quot;kick&quot; ability. At the highest levels, it becomes a mini damage discipline in and of itself.)<br />
<br />
* Rampage: Reuse change to 5 minutes, each level of of Furious Rampage subtracts one minute from reuse, at F.R. 3, reuse is 2 minutes. Addition of &quot;emote&quot; which indicates usage of ability.<br />
<br />
(Great ability, too long a reuse time to be useful for anything except possibly farming faction. Lowered reuse time encourages use and adds more flavor to the class as a whole.)<br />
<br />
* Warcry: Reuse change to 6 minutes, duration of effect change to 1 minute. Effect change to add a mitigation bonus to the warrior and his group, similar to the &quot;Bulwark of Vie&quot; line of spells introduced in the LDoN expansion. Addition of &quot;emote&quot; which indicates usage of ability.<br />
<br />
Level one: 3% bonus<br />
Level two: 6% bonus<br />
Level Three: 9% bonus<br />
<br />
(Current ability is worse than useless. This change further increases warrior desirability since a warrior with this ability can increase the total survivability of the entire group significantly, at no mana cost.)<br />
<br />
* Ingenuity: Change to add a 1%, 2%, and 3% chance-to-proc increase to the main hand weapon along with current benefits.<br />
<br />
(Increased taunt, dps from procs without giving warriors unbalancing &quot;aggro locking&quot; ability.)<br />
<br />
* Living Shield: Change to increase the total raidus in which the new &quot;Shield&quot; detailed above can be active on the chosen player.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
Adoption of the above changes would, quite simply, turn the warrior class into something of a powerhouse. It provides:<br />
<br />
Added utility(Stances, improved /shield, ease of travel, improved warcry, addition of instill doubt) <br />
<br />
Added group desirability (improved tanking, improved taunt, increased DPS through use of proposed flurry/stances/improved ingenuity, better able to protect group members via improved /shield ability) <br />
<br />
Added stackability (Dps, offtanking, Shielding vital group members, increase group survivability through warcry, ETC.)<br />
<br />
Added Raid desirability (See stackability and group desirability)<br />
<br />
The nice part is, these changes can all be implemented via current game code. With a few exception, everything currently exists within the warrior class structure. It's just tuned up and improved.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is probably much too radical an overhaul this late in the game for a core class such as the warrior. But then again, so were the hybrid mana changes, the 2 hand weapon changes, the hybrid cap changes, the addition of the &quot;CH&quot; type spells to druids and shamans, the bazzaar, Instanced zones, the addition of beastlords, ETC.<br />
<br />
Please share your opinions.<br />

<br />
(This improves Warrior tanking slightly without necessitating a change to a higher mitigation table and potentially unbalancing the class in relation to other tanks)<br />
<br />
Given that the only one that's not is piercing, and stepping on Rogue toes to fix us isn't warranted, NO.<br />
<br />
* ADD: Instill Doubt ability recieved by Monks and Rogues. Warrior I.D. skill cap should be set to a maximum of 252.<br />
<br />
(Adds some utility and a way for the naked warrior on C.R. to potentially stave off a MOB.)<br />
<br />
 Possibly for CR, but for XP groups and Raids a worthless idea. NO.<br />
<br />
* Berserk: Health at which Berserk takes effect changed to be equal to the current level of the warrior, Ex. a level 65 warrior becomes berserk at 65% health.<br />
<br />
(Makes better sense than the current system, and increases the amount of time we can perform crippling blows, which makes use of our &quot;superior&quot; critical abilites. Also differentiates us from other tanks) <br />
<br />
 Good idea, but it should cap at 50%.<br />
<br />
* Shield: Change to hotkeyed, group only ability. All current benefits and penalites, however the warrior can shield a person as long as the sheilded player remains within shield range(I.E. no more duration).  <br />
<br />
When the hotkey is clicked, a menu with current group member names and an option to &quot;End Shielding&quot; pops up. The warrior can select the player they wish to Shield by clicking their name in the context menu, and Shielding will begin provided the chosen player is currently in range. <br />
<br />
If for whatever reason the Shielded player moves out of range they are no longer Shielded, however if the player comes back into Shielding range, Shielding resumes with no input from the warrior. Shielding of the chosen player continues until the warrior changes the player he wishes to shield or discontinues the use of the ability via the option on the context menu.<br />
<br />
(Shield is at the moment counter intuitive, a pain to use, and very often useless due to the length of the /shield, the reuse time, and the close range which must be maintained. This change addresses these concerns. It also improves warrior stackability in exp groups and raids.)<br />
<br />
 Again, too much work for a marginally useful skill. I also advocate Paladins having it, but leave it as is.<br />
<br />
[/QUOTE] Each taunt, regardless of success or failure of the skill, shall add a small amount of straight &quot;hate&quot; points equal to the  level of the warrior, I.E. 65 points each taunt for a 65 warrior. [/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
 Given that EB items add at minimum 300 hate, I'd prefer a failure adding 100 hate if you're going to implement this, and add a sliding scale of added hate by level for a successful one. Not to mention at 65 for all taunting classes, taunt should have a success rate of 70% rather than the current 45ish.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Disciplines:<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
* Resistant: Increases resistances 2 pt per warrior level, for a total of 130 to each reistance score for a level 65 warrior. Duration of 3 minutes, reuse of 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
* Fearless: Duration increase to 3 minutes, Reuse lowered to 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
*Evasive, Defensive, Precise, and Aggressive changed into hotkeyed abilities called stances. <br />
<br />
Stances:<br />
<br />
- Grant all the benefits and disadvantages as per the current disciplines<br />
- Cannot be used in conjunction with one another<br />
- Are hotkeyed abilities simliar to sneak, hide, Feign Death, etc.<br />
- Can be used as long as the warrior wishes(extremely lengthy duration)<br />

<br />
(So many separate offensive disciplines are overly redundant. Combining the three makes sense, as the warrior is concentrating totally on doing the most damage in the shortest time possible by any means possible.)<br />
<br />
* Furious/Fortitude: Unchanged.<br />
<br />
 I favor complete unlinking of the disciplines and the removal of /defensive. I also favor lowering refresh times of the offensive ones to match defensive ones. At 55 I would replace /defensive with /disc strikethrough, allowing 30 seconds with increase of one second per level ignoring all defensive abilities of the mob.<br />

<br />
<br />
 Won't comment on these other than to say that fixes to the class should not happen as the result of dinging 51, 55, 59, 61, or what have you - they should be innate.<br />
<br />
 I'm going to also state some NEGATIVE balancing that I feel needs to happen to bring the playing field back to completely level. Some are mine, some are others' ideas.<br />
<br />
 *Removal of all defensive AA's from casters, removal of all defensive AA's save for General/Class from all leather/chain classes, and removal of Planar defensive AA's from non-Warrior plate classes, with full refunds to all.<br />
<br />
 *Retuning of aggro from spells that could not affect mobs. They should gain 0 aggro. At the same time, aggro levels should be adjusted by the resist margin of the spell cast - If it's mitigated for half, it should generate half the aggro.<br />
<br />
 *Reduction of riposte ability in all mobs. Simultaneously, a slight upgrading of 1hs damage to be functionally equivalent to 2hs damage.<br />
<br />
 *Double and triple attack should be available to Warriors using shields. Also, delay on Bash should be reduced to 4 seconds for all Bashing classes.<br />
<br />
 *Realignment of all avoidance tables on these guidelines, low to high:<br />
<br />
 INT/WIS pure casters<br />
 INT/WIS non-plate hybrids/bards<br />
 INT/WIS plate classes/Rogue<br />
 Monk<br />
 Warrior<br />
<br />
 *Realignment of all mitigation tables on these guidelines, low to high:<br />
<br />
 INT/WIS cloth classes<br />
 INT/WIS leather classes<br />
 INT/WIS chain classes/Rogue/Bard<br />
 Monk <br />
 INT/WIS plate classes<br />
 Warrior</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gazarion</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see two very good ideas that catch my attention here.<br />
<br />
-refunding defensive AA to all class except tanks, while having knights lower version of those defensive AA. To me it just doens't make sense that a caster can have ID5, LR5.<br />
<br />
-strikethrough discipline : very nice idea, if implemented well it would give back a reason for dual wielding to live, although in the current state of the game, strikethrough is only a dps abilitie and doesnt cut down the riposte dmg for some buggy reason... pls SoE if you have half a brain, strikethrough and tactical mastery should lower riposte dmg, for the sake of saving dual wield.<br />
<br />
However, parse have shown that dual wielding is still the best dps, see furor post of Vanazir vs darkblade/EoE.</div></div><hr />
