<br />
Hi all, <br />
<br />
My guild is just getting strong enough to do raids where /random just won't cut it anymore. I've read numerous posts extolling the pros and cons of Merit vs DKP, but since DKP is only 3 characters I cannot use search engine to look for info. Can anyone link a site that has an explanation of, or shows how to create and manage a DKP system?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall there are 2+1 DKP systems but the basis is the same :<br />
<br />
* Every time someone attends to a raid he gets 'rewarded' for his presence (points)<br />
1 hour of HoT farming : 1dkp<br />
Trakanon kill : 2dkp<br />
Arch Lich kill : 6dkp<br />
<br />
* Every item has a point cost<br />
HoT plate BP : 30dkp<br />
RBB : 10dkp<br />
CoF : 15dkp<br />
<br />
* When someone loots an item, he pays the item cost in points<br />
(Kinda like RL with work/wage/expenses)<br />
<br />
<br />
There are 3 little variations in the looting :<br />
<br />
* The person with the most DKP loots, period<br />
(Ex : I have 40dkp, you have 35, Alex has 14)<br />
We all want the item, but since i got the most, i win by default<br />
and get the item price reduced from my DKP total)<br />
Zero luck here, its all about saving up to get what you want<br />
<br />
* There is a random between all the people interested<br />
(Ex : I have 40dkp, you have 35, Alex has 14)<br />
/ran 0 400 for me<br />
/ran 0 350 for you<br />
/ran 0 140 for alex<br />
The one with the highest roll wins. This system allows some luck.<br />
<br />
*A mix of the two above kinda like : If the there are people within a<br />
5 point range from the one on top there is a random<br />
(in our example /ran 0 400 for me , /ran 0 350 for you, Alex is out)<br />
<br />
<br />
Here a few extra tips :<br />
* MAKE sure de DKP database is UPDATED quickly (pain to handle)<br />
Its very very important since the whole system is based on clarity<br />
<br />
* Total DKP Given per Boss = Total DKP value of the loot<br />
(A boss that drops 3 items from 10-15dkp each, should not<br />
give more than 45-50DKP total reward)<br />
Thats 0.5 to 1DKP per member. <br />
<br />
* Have 2-3 PEOPLE take logs,  and get 2-3 people to run the DKP<br />
Database its a VERY boring  &amp; long task</div></div><hr />
