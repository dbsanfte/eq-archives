<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, <br />
<br />
Just came back to EQ after about a year off.  Curious as too any zone recommendations for EXP or cash spots for an avg gear 61 War/61 Druid duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For xp any group will blow the xp of 2 boxing out of the water for you. I mean I can 2 box tier 2 pop with a bit of down time, but even then xp in group is like 2-3 times faster and much more fun.<br />
<br />
revamped Droga is definatley doable for cash and xp.<br />
<br />
Sebelis - good cash shit xp.<br />
<br />
hole was one of my fav cash pharm spots, but I've quit in August and I know they revamped the zone some so not sure about that anymore. could easly make 500+ in merchant sold crup in an hour.<br />
<br />
Velektor's kobald village is not bad cash pharm. I forget whatever they solo pulable at 61 or 65. This will be on the hard side for you.<br />
<br />
Howling Stones - both not bad xp and cash. Pain in the ass CR and can be tricky because of HTs and druid having shite for hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah group xp &gt; duo exp but we are not really after the best exp just noticeabl progress w/o having to deal with camp checks and idiot bards/dr00ds training us.   If we can make a couple 100 plat and come away with the exp or AA exp bar actually moving we are happy.<br />
<br />
I like pickup groups about as much as i like Bards. :)  We have some RL friends that play also and that is the ONLY place where our grouping comes from.  Any given night we have any combination of Warrior,Druid,Paladin,Rogue &amp; Enchanter.  Not the fastest killing group but we try to have fun with what we have.  LDON Adventures are nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Veksar is a new zone since you played last I think, it's in the bottom of Lake of Ill Omen (it has air inside tho).  Probably a good place for you to start.  The front parts are easier than most of the other zones that were mentioned, but should still be dark blue to you.  The difficulty ramps up smoothly as you go deeper, allowing you to learn your limits, and choose whatever challenge level you are comfortable with.  Pulling is pretty easy.  As loot and XP go, this is one of the better zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I duno about you but I like a chalenge when I 2 box I go for hard to do stuff.<br />
<br />
If you wana have some fun HS is definatley great place to start. As I mentioned be ware of CR. This dungeons is really great place to crawl thought and learn the ropes.<br />
<br />
Sebelis crawl can be fun but dont camp instead do dungeon as it was meant so start from ZI clear to Disco, then to chef, then if you still rdy for chalenge go try lower ZI. BTW juggernuts are awesome xp and cash at your level and is definatley doable, but hard :) I would not advise going past the locked door. You wouldnt survive with just you and your druid.<br />
<br />
Clear FGs in Sol B. Thats a lot of fun for me :) Forget loot/xp, but ton of fun.<br />
<br />
Sol C is fun place to crawl too mobs are pretty ez until you get deep. Me 2 boxing and a pally cleared everything except boss with ease. Spider queen kicked our asses :) Gets kinda tedious thought for me since it was too easy.<br />
<br />
Once you both hit 65 and get some AAs can definatley duo most if not all of druid epic except for dragon. I had a blast duing this quest.<br />
<br />
Coldain rings are awesome duo events.<br />
<br />
Can try WW lesser dragons. Yedelema and the rest. Was good cash a year ago. Just fun to beat on dragons :)<br />
<br />
Can try Charadok. BTW good xp and cash too but bad faction if you doing the sarnak quests.<br />
<br />
Once again hole was chalenging to crawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yah Veksar pretty easy I've exploered all of it.<br />
mobs same dificulty as revamped old zones aka Sol C/Droga<br />
xp is on par with said zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't see a 61 duo with average 2002 equipment and few AA's killing anything like Yeldema.  But maybe it's been too long since those days for me to remember properly.<br />
<br />
I would think SolC would be quite a challenge for that pair, since they lack a means to split up mobs.  To find your comfort point, I'd try something like the following progression, start easy and move up until you find your limit:<br />
<br />
Easiest: Veksar or HS<br />
Moderate: Sebilis or Chardok<br />
Difficult: SolC or Droga<br />
<br />
There are many more choices at each step, e.g. deep Nurga, ChardokB, POJustice, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you for all the suggestions :)<br />
<br />
The Druid and I have checked out Droga and can probably do the Seer camp but it would be tough since it really drains her mana.  <br />
<br />
We checked out Veksar and she and I can go from the zone in to the entrance to the water tunnel w/o much trouble and then hit the respawns.  Was pretty easy and not bad EXP.  We had a 61 Pally friend join us and we went thru the water tunnel and eventually camped the Soulscream belt guy for while but he never spawned.  It would be difficult for just the Druid and I to go that far into Veksar.  <br />
<br />
Havent checked any of the others out yet.  PoJ is a zone im sure neither one of us would like to see again.. We spent WAY WAY too much time their before we quit the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 old world suggestions...<br />
<br />
1) umbral plains. the moktors like most things in the zone summon but thats no problem for a warrior. the no drop moktor armor may be an upgrade for you and there are a number of named or quasi-named mobs that drop decent sellable gear. you can do them safely at the zone-in and its not usually heavily camped.<br />
2) maidens eye toilers (toiler hill near the lake. again not heavily camped. most are dark blue to 61 a few are light blue. they are among the easiest things to kill in the zone and have extremely good tradeskill loot if you can tolerate the bazaar. this is best done if the druid is skilled with pets and then you would assist the pet and tank for him. be warned. the pet will outdamage you about 4 to 1 and this isnt good for your ego but its very good for your experience. and again its safer than the plains. its comparable for experience at your level. it gives you an excuse to do aa since if you level past about 62 you will have to leave the area due to proliferation of light blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I thought ME xp is awfull. Plus ton and ton and ton of wondering mobs and traps make me avoid this zone as much as possible.<br />
If you charming in ME make sure to give wolf the swords that drop there off mobs so it dual wields and dont even try to tank that thing when charm breaks :) hasted dual wielding wolf of around lvl 53 will kick your ass really fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wouldn't go to Umbral those Moktor's have a ton of HP.  PoJ Jails would be good since Druid can Harmony pull hit for 250ish might be semi trouble unless you got ToD or can find a slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What is Sol C?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">arf arf<br />
<br />
Sol C a.k.a. The Caverns of Exile (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Caverns_Exile.html).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">droga or nurga, can't remember which, awesome cash.  you can camp the king for copper hammer, and if you camp some other spots, kingly boots of splendor or drogan earth totems to make soft leather bracer of gore (not a good war item) but definatly a great monk or rogue item with vengence and 70hp  all you need is a good healer and snare which a druid generally is= )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">SolC is a new zone between SolA and SolB, but harder than either of them.  It was added last summer around the same time as ChardokB.  I feel that it is harder than ChardokB, but that might be debatable.  Compared to Droga, the mobs in SolC hit harder but die faster.  Loot is of similar quality to Veksar, Droga, CT.  There is a boss that would be a raid target at L60, or a mini-raid for mid-tier POP people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;2 old world suggestions...&quot;<br />
<br />
When did Luclin become &quot;old world&quot;?  Sorry, but when I think Old World zones, I think SolA &amp;B, Paw, Guck, MM, Unrest, Kedge, Highkeep(God I hated that place), etc.  I actually laughed out loud when I read that post.  Not tryin to bust your balls or anything, just thought that was really funny stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by Pumilio <br />
droga or nurga, can't remember which, awesome cash.  you can camp the king for copper hammer  <br />
<br />
She and I have scouted out the King Room and did not attempt anything cause i just could not tell how I would single pull it.  Its hard for Druid/Warrior combo to handle much more than 1 add.<br />
<br />
Any advice on pulling the King or Seer camps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Originally posted by Bulbog <br />
Heh I've done this camp duo as a 61 war with my 65 shammy friend.  To clear the seer/king camps you really only have to kill 4 mobs per round total.  Go up above invis, kill seer PH, invis back down and into kings room.  Fight at the little opening to the kings room, the 2 that should be behind you won't aggro.  We just pulled the first to the left which comes single, killed, invis'd to the left corner, engaged left one and if you can keep it pushed into the wall right, it won't screw you and add the other one, but unfortunatly if aggro bounces, it likes to run to the center then out again aggro'ing the other npc, so we just route CC'd the third mob which was the King's PH.  Then we killed the King's PH next.  <br />
<br />
The only way we got screwed was because our dps was sort of lacking and the King PH decided to run out to the middle again and aggro the 4th spawn at a bad time after the shammy had just c5'd and virtue was down so had low hp and got killed.  Otherwise this camp was a joke really considering the rewards duoable solo most likely and duo for sure.  Have seen about 4 swords drop, haven't gotten copper hammer yet though, got the crappy rune maul, argh/ <br />
<br />
search is your firend there is tons info on this board regarding this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i called luclin &quot;old world&quot; because my druid can and does still tank mobs there if he needs to save a ld groupmember. and because my warrior can still kill a mob with zero heals while the cleric goes afk.<br />
<br />
both zones i mentioned (maiden and umbral) are terrible experience for traditional warrior/cleric type groups. but the response addressed the question &quot;warrior/druid duo&quot; and druids (not warriors) can still soak up a ton of experience there (in maiden) at level 61-62. reason why is because there is a huge disparity between the power of the charmed wolves and the very weak toilers allowing a hasted duel weilding wolf to kill a toiler with about 10 percent of hitpoints lost and about 45 seconds time. the warrior is there for the ride and soaks up experience from the druid. most druids wouldnt stand for that arrangement but if you are duel boxing what the heck? futhermore if my druid solos there he can get reliably .. consistently ... every single time ... about 2500pp worth of bazaar tradable loot per hour. again we are talking about duel boxing so the warrior can use this loot to upgrade. i know this has little appeal to the uber time-guilded but this isnt the context to which i suggested this.<br />
<br />
yes after the wolf breaks charm he hits extremely hard and fast. only sensible way to tank it is if you have furious up and nothing better to do with it than have fun slaughtering a hasted wolf.<br />
<br />
as for umbral the experience is terrible for anyone. but the large number of no-drops that can equip a warrior with currently low end gear can be very enticing as a quick way to upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You can probably do pretty well aggro kiting in Plane of Storms.  She pulls a frog and kites it, you run along behind using your best DPS low aggro weapons and beat on it's back.  If you want to do a more traditional tank/healer combo then you should probably stick to the easier dungeons mentioned in the other posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thank you all for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
Last night she and I were able to successfully camp the Seer in Droga and I got myself a new sword.<br />
<br />
We tried camping the King room but its abit too much for just the two of us.  Hopefully I can gather one more friend and head back there.  My new sword needs its brother the hammer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Grats Gaylon, good luck with the king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">cazic thule is a great money zone too, just kill lizards at zoneline for their bloods.  depending on server they sell for a couple hundred pp each and they're common as hell.  and since theres very few roamers and nothing runs when wounded, its pretty easy to invis around and use harmony to pull nameds/PHs</div></div><hr />
