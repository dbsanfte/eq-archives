<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well anyone who dosn't think that SOE is going to be selling leveled toons and in game items for $$$$$RL heh...<br />
<br />
They are asking people now &quot;Is it a good idea for them to make a sucure way to transerfer in game items and toons for RL$$$&quot; LOL... <br />
<br />
Woot! Hope I can by me a EoE (warrior weapon) or something heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who is this &quot;they&quot; you so ambiguously refer to ? <br />
<br />
BTW once SoE directly sells pre-levelled toons EQ is screwed, glued, and tattooed. The game is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mady</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was a poll SoE was taking at log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no shit....wow. that is scary; it seems like almost taboo to mention selling virtual items for $$$'s by the parent company.<br />
<br />
wow..i'm speechless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shik, if I am not mistaken, they have already done this in other games they have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To clarify a bit, the poll didn't mention selling characters, it was asking if people thought Sony should provide a secure environment for players to sell in game items/plat for real life money. <br />
<br />
Of course, having said that, if Sony goes forward with this idea can selling characters be far behind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't want SoE moderating the plat trade....<br />
<br />
<br />
Some people deserve to get scammed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am glad I am not playing EQ any longer...<br />
SoE has proven that the only thing they good at is murdering the original EQ idea. I remember Verant and their &quot;Vision&quot; sure some were not happy with it then, but at least EQ still was role-playing game where your character level meant something. Now whatever was a BIG no way in Verants &quot;Vision&quot; has all come to life.<br />
-all the previous expansion rewards become obsolete as soon as new one comes out.<br />
-difference between classes becomes narrower and narrower... everyone wears exact same gear...and many AAs are exact same for every class...<br />
-the experience of the &quot;World&quot; has been eliminated through Nexus/PoK. No one knows anymore how to get from A to B.<br />
-levelling has become way too easy. Eliminating need for almost all low/mid level content. By the way did I mention that’s where the best gameplay lies? Like Awesome thought out quest, challenging areas for solo or group...<br />
-EBaying has been always shone away from by &quot;Vision&quot; and even prosecuted. Now they decide to take that business themselves...<br />
<br />
All that is left of EQ now is go to new expansion and crowd into best xp/reward zone along with the rest of server population. Well at least they have instances now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well said Casai.  I have to admit I was somewhat speechless when I saw the poll when I logged in last night.  I was disappointed that the only response options were &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, and &quot;I dont have an opinion&quot;.  I kept looking for the &quot;FUCK NO!!! What the HELL are you idiots smoking?!?!?&quot; button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Those of you who have read some of my posts may have noticed that I seldom use profanity, except when Shikarii casually mentions that there is a waterfall in EK that I knew nothing about.<br />
There's a time and place for everything, however.<br />
This is one sonofabitchin cocksucking dumbfuck shitheaded idea. Christ on a crutch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grixz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's the actual question from a Mage board:<br />
<br />
http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=14725<br />
<br />
This totally opens up tons of new problems, especially to the Warrior class, because equipment is what separates the players (usually).<br />
<br />
Although we ALL want great weapons and armor, this is going way too far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I constantly see people projecting what happens when you have newbies walking around in Time or GoD end game loot.<br />
<br />
Where does it say they are throwing out the No Drop flag?  Unless you are on Firiona, I don't see this as a problem.  Even with all the $$ in the world you can't gear up like that.<br />
<br />
And, if someone buys a Time equipped character and is a complete tool, well, guess what they are no different than the tools who got their legit.  Deal with them like you always have, and they probably get thier kicks, realize it wasn't what they were expecting and fade away or do something else.<br />
<br />
But... what happens if that guy who bought a Time equipped char is a pretty good joe, knows how to play the char or picks it up really quickly because they are an experienced MMO player who had the wherewithall to buy such a char and the inclination to do it.  Well you know what, they just become another player you don't mind having around. <br />
<br />
Just like the peeps that are already buying and playing chars through the other sites.<br />
<br />
Sorry I just don't buy the &quot;the world will end if Sony does this&quot; crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The angle for SOE is not a percentage of the transfer fee, its that once you can buy and sell from other people, then its just a tiny step to buying directly from SOE. And it did say characters in addition to items.<br />
<br />
They may as well have asked &quot;How much are you willing to pay in RL $$$ for a EoE?&quot; LOL. <br />
<br />
Still its a welcome deal for me.<br />

travelling was cool at the beginning, but once youve done it a couple times it gets old. theres already enough timesinks, getting around when youve been playing the game for years and have seen almost all the zones shouldnt be one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm kinda surprised (but happy) this thread has been so tame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well, I logged on the other day, and saw the poll mentioned in here, and then a couple days later I saw a poll for buying characters. Kinda upset me, but either way, I'm more than liekly still going to play this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raivene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The reason they are asking the questions has nothing to do with SoE getting into the plat or character selling business, though I have no doubt if there was enough support from the player base they would do that as well.<br />
<br />
It's for the exact same reason you can now change your last name by yourself now.  It would reduce the core customer service requirements by removing a great deal of fraud from the plat and character aftermarket.<br />
<br />
In one of the summit reports (and no, I don't remember which) they were talking about the number of petitions received and what *70%* of them are for is fraud.<br />
<br />
Now one of OUR complaints is lack of customer service to in game (and to most of us that means non-fraud) issues.  If they could develop a system that elminated even 50% of user to user seller fraud, then available customer service to the rest of the petition queue would improve (at least on paper) by 35%.<br />
<br />
The reality is SoE can't shut down the Yantis' and others selling stuff for cash.  It's like the government trying to shut down alcohol during prohibition, it just doesn't work.  If SoE put all their customer service resources on shutting it down no other petition would get answered ever... even at double their current resources.  But you can control it somewhat by putting mechanisms in place and in doing so free up the &quot;cops&quot; to do other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You can change your own last name now?  When did they do this?  I have been on vacation the last few weeks but this is the first I heard of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">arf arf<br />
<br />
A few patches ago ... about 5 weeks I think.  I did so shortly before I stopped logging on.  Something they slipped in while we were all up to our chins in the geometry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I didn't see the big issue with it. It looked like all it asked was if they should provide a secure way to transfer characters. I do not like the idea of items or plat getting sold by Sony but secure character transfers I wouldn't mind being available, that already happens just many times it ends up whoever sold it suddenly decides they want it back. Atleast this would cut back on who actually owns the character. /shrugs   Not something that would affect me anyways except for the same run in with noob 65's that already happen. That's why guilds have a recruiting method rather than just letting anyone in so they have enough to zerg the next mob. If it's a pick up group all you can do is hope really but unless they can stop the selling totaly I would rather them have a way to make it secure and final to where there is no coming back and trying to reclaim a char..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Malkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Seems like everyone is making a big fuss over nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It wouldn't be that big a deal when you're grouping/raiding with folks you know are good. They'll be good whether they looted their armor or bought it for plat they earned or for rl money. Even if they buy a toon in a class they've never played before, they'll catch on pretty quickly.<br />
But it will make a difference if you're in a group with someone who started the game last week, bought a lvl 65 cleric on Thursday, and gets you killed repeatedly on Saturday.<br />
Have any of you been on raids where someone couldn't follow simple directions, or couldn't stand still for two minutes? Couldn't use assist? Couldn't back off mob when told to do so? Just had to see what was around that corner? Broke mez at random, or decided it would be fun to try to gank aggro from the MT?<br />
Go to PC and observe the quality of play on display. Now imagine level 65 players playing that way.<br />
Not only do I think this would be a detriment to the game, I can't think of any strong argument that it's a good idea. I've seen none posted here.</div></div><hr />
