<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-13-2005, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this event freaking broken after several years?  The spider waves seems really screwed up.  We were doing great on our first night against Xegony, 4 waves down, had our intercept groups in place... knocked her down to 40%.  Spiders activated.  And then, unlike all other waves, when our intercept groups attacked teh spiders, the freaking things completely IGNORED US.  I know.  I attacked and also threw a bazu bellow on the named spider within seconds of it moving.  It ignored me and kept running toward Xegony.  All of the spiders ignored all of our attempts to aggro them.  You can imagine what happened next.  All the clerics died and that was that.  <br />
<br />
WTF are we supposed to do in this wave?  If the freaking mobs are completely immune to all aggro attempts, we cannot kill the wave.  Period.  They will run to Xegony and kill the clerics, fight over.  Seriously pissed me off because every other wave we fought was a joke and we were handling Xegony fine.  But those damn spiders... it wouldn't have mattered if we'd had 72 fully Time geared people.  We still would have wiped given their utter disregard for aggro.  <br />
<br />
This was a long fight obviously.  I could have dealt with just plain wiping, but I feel farked over by a broken event instead.</div></div><hr />

The spiders should be easily interceptable by just about any class capable of generating some sort of range aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baam</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't remember, but are those spiders messable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One an attempt a little earlier in the evening the spiders were the first wave and we intercepted them fine.  They took some getting use to and killed a few people, but intercepting them didn't seem to be a problem.  With all other mob waves fought, one bard was capable of grabbing most of them and we tagged any extras and aggroed them easily.  But when those damn spiders were wave 5, it was all messed up.  Oh, and it wasn't low health from someone by Xegony as far as we know.  That did have an impact on a previous attempt when a few adds took off for Xegony because a bard over there was at low health.  The range on the aggro for that was crazy long.  <br />
<br />
Very frustrating to lose such a long fight to something so screwy...<br />
<br />
edit: yes, the spiders are mezzable.  We were down to 1 chanter and they moved fast enough even if she'd been near the spiders instead of over by Xeg keeping the goddess tash'ed, she only would have gotten one before they got over to Xeg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My roomate likens some of these waves to the 10th ring war in Great Divide.  Those things have a hard-on for Xegony and the folks she hates the most.  Get your rangers and knights to lock them down ... had mobs rush straight past melees whacking on em.<br />
<br />
Do whatever it takes to piss em off shy of sticking your thumb up their ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, they all lubz Xegony, but no other wave was a problem to get aggro.  It was very strange for an unaggroed mob to totally ignore bazu bellow.  A paly guildmate said a spider who targeted completely ignored his stuns and kept running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never done Xegony myself but i've done enough 10th ring wars to know that the last wave of giants will ignore stuns/snares and even straight up melee sometimes.  We always had to set up snare/root teams because it seemed that you could only hold aggro on one mob if you had a decent amt of hate built up and were actively meleeing them ... and even then might break away and run.<br />
<br />
Bard with highsun made it easier later once they got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm... well, last night's weird spider aggro was an aberration.  We did Xegony again tonight and it didn't happen, so Xegony went down.  The aggro on all the waves is still kind of odd in that it ping pongs like crazy no matter how hard our tanks try to hold aggro.  I'm one of those tanks and watching it bounce all over the place on HoTT isn't fun.  :p   That was ugly when we got the high councilman of the queen who had a big DD proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's possible that maybe the tank had low health aggro for a little bit over at xegony, or maybe someone was afk in the ae range or something and drew locked LHA aggro, and when they died, the spiders were all over the clerics, maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't think it was low health aggro.  That we'd seen before and no one by Xeg this time was low health.  *shrug*  no idea... it didn't happen again.</div></div><hr />
