I think I missed this up, because my values with the 150+ endurance came out odd Almost like it gave me 3500 total endurance rather than 2400. It was all asumed, thanks to the unknown (cant find the number) regen rate of endurance. The values for regular endurance make sence.<br />

yours were maxed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On raids yes. But thanks for reminding me, i cant confirm that all the stats where 305 since I normaly take off agi buffs agenst mobs that cast a lot of dots/debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real question is how will Itemization with added Endurance + new abilites figure in with discs and such.Will have to wait and see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that cant be correct, because 1 incite does not use 11% of my endurance bar</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am hoping that they hurry up with the +end to items...... you start chaining Disc's/skills such as incite .... and you can burn your endurance bar pretty fast.   <br />
<br />
Basically I reserve my END for incite, and defensive now ... I typically drop an offensive disc towards the end of a big encounter though to raise DPS.  <br />
<br />
Some + X END Regen effects similiar to what Casters have with Flowing thought on some Gear we allready have would be nice as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These numbers seem a little off to me, did the basic math on it and got much higher end pool than some of you. Being 62 with stats of str 265 sta 265 afi 197 and dex 227 using Berate (200) went down 4 % endurance, doing the math 200=4%*End therefore endurance =5000 ... am I doing the math wrong or is this a very high endurance pool or am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope some one figures it out, hope its simple math hehe.<br />
<br />
ATM is there any way to regen endurance quicker? I really dont notice the diffrent between sitting and standing, i have just returned to EQ after a 4 month break, and i must say im glad the openings thing never happened and im totally addicted to incite&gt; Also love how i can use my offence ablitys with no guilt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wudgurorm</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah will be happy to finally have some gear to upgrade our Endurance pool.<br />
<br />
Some raids I have downgraded to using Provoke because thats all the endurance I have left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time when endurance regens slower is when we have autoattack on.  Sitting and Standing it regens at the same rate. <br />
These have been my observations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melstan</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is anyone else a bit dissapointed with the END system? Frankly, it really enragens me that anytime I use a disc, my entire END pool is drained. That means the moment I use my evasive or defensive disc I can forget about using Bellow again (I am lvl 55) for the rest of the fight.  Does anyone else feel that since the re-use timers on disciplines is so long they should not drain endurance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">once you level up you wont see as much of a problem with that. plus by the time your disc is available again you should have plenty of END again, unless you are unwisely spamming the incite(bellow in your case) everytime it pops up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melstan</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only use Bellow during a pull, once after the pull to build up hate, and if I lose aggro I use it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No clue what my endurance is.  But I rarely run out on long fights.  Warnign though ... the Arch Lich in ssraa seems to proc something that drains endurance.  I run out on him everytime, even on High preist in ssrraa I typicalyl have just enough.<br />
<br />
Also Melstan that is the typical methodology when xp grinding.... what most of us ar referring to are tanking boss mobs on raids.  I sometimes incite twice if possible before calling assist due to our rogues/wizzy's ability to dish out some amazing damage.  Regardless on long fights I incite multiple times to stay ahead of the aggro generated by our rogues and wizzy's.  <br />
<br />
Defensive and my first Incite typically takes me to 70%  before it peters out...and I incite again when the first wears off....then I incite every time my END regens to like 60% or so.<br />
<br />
Also, for you math people, this is with 305 STR, 305 Sta, 305 Dex and a 305 AGL, lvl 65.  Like I said before,  I DON'T know how much I have.</div></div><hr />
