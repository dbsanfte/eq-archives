The only type 1 augments available for primary/secondary use is this. I personally think this is a rediculous price for this augment in this slot. It would be nice but not needed obviously right off the bat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My take is that instead of putting a high aggro proc on those weapons, make them your DPS set.  Put either a pure DD (Permafrost - 760) proc or the lifetap (Vampire Kiss - 1150) proc on them. <br />
<br />
Why go DPS?  If you're after aggro, go get a Taunting/Enraging Blow weapon and add a Ykesha or Anger proc on it.  You'll have much better aggro.<br />
<br />
Personally, from reading this board is sounds like Ykesha is the way to go for aggro.  Not only is it cheaper than Anger 3, but it does have actual DPS and (on sub 55 mobs) interrupt.  I'm quite disappointed that the Anger proc line apparently so fricking useless.<br />
<br />
Only question is whether or not they would be better DPS than say, a Staff of the Four Winds, Windblade, etc.  If not, it would appear that LDoN weapons are basically useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with the above poster.  For agro the &quot;old&quot; weapons that already have a proc with an open slot 4 are a better bet than anything you can buy from a LDON vendor for agro (as pointed out you can trick them out with a 2x agro proc).<br />
<br />
The LDON purchasable weapons appear to lend themselves more to the DPS route.  There is also a 15/21 axe from MM for 760 pts.  I have thought about adding the +dam slot 6 to this to make a nice 16/21 (or as you pointed out a 16/20 using the weapon listed above) when the role is to be pure dps and not to generate agro.  Of course this is alot of points to build a utility I could probably just solve swingin an &quot;old&quot; 2 hander.<br />
<br />
So I'm kinda mixed on the buyable LDON. No ability to 2x proc = not good enough agro, not enough dPS = keep swingin a Windblade etc instead of spending points.  <br />
<br />
I think that it would have been cool if they had added a 1492 1HS weapon with 2x slot 4 and a &quot;Big Gun&quot; 2 hander (50/40 area with a slot 6)...that would have better suited both missions (agro/dps) and made pts worth spendin on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">procs are lore it seams you can only have one. mirror 1 and the first dd from mig's are. i trided to buy a second mirror 1 and i couldn't.<br />
<br />
the list i currently use dosen't say whats lore or not.<br />
<br />
lore augs can certinly cut back on some dreams.<br />
<br />
certinly runined my cheep caster wepon set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;The only type 1 augments available for primary/secondary use is this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not quite true.<br />
<br />
I put my  +6 CHA augment from opening a box the other day onto my Scepter of Mastery.<br />
<br />
I was bored.<br />
<br />
In any event, I'm sure you can add the +6 STA aug or whatever other aug you get from these adventures to your high priced weapons and save 1150 points.<br />
<br />
ALSO ...<br />
<br />
I have two coldstone fragment thingies (the 20 point cold DD proc from Guk) on two different weapons.<br />
<br />
Once you apply the aug, you can buy another one, even if it's lore.<br />
<br />
At least so far I have been able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why add the +20 hp and +20 mana for 1150 when you can added the +40hps from Ruja at the same price?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or the Glowing Prism of Brawling which is 5 dex, 5 sta, 20 hps for the same price from the same merchant as the 20 hp/mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vixyyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My understanding is that the type 6 slot will also take type 5 type 4 etc....so you could in effect still double proc the weapons, if you wanted more agro instead of DPS.</div></div><hr />

Nope :mad: <br />
<br />
This doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But some of the Augments are type All, meaning as far as I know they will fit into any type of slot, and those include the 40HP augs so they would fit in the type 1 slot.</div></div><hr />

From the eqnews.txt ...<br />
<br />
** Use Augmentations Wisely **<br />
<br />
If you have an item with more than one slot available and you intend to apply an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot (i.e. Type 1), be sure to apply it last.<br />
<br />
For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item.  In your bag you have an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) and one that fits into Slot 2.  If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be Slot 2 in this case.  This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-specific Augmentation Item you had available. <br />
<br />
So, remember, the rule is that if you have an Augmentation Item that can be used it any slot, be sure to apply it last! <br />
<br />
Inferrable from this is that the highest numbered slot is &quot;the first open slot on your item&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can get all the Ldon vendor items with a group of 4 players. I would think the items are pretty decent considering that. <br />

At least most would be very hard pressed to get anything better anywhere else with same number of people.<br />

Slots and types are two different things, often wrongly used interchangably</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, this combo is incredible aggro.  I am glad I didn't hold back and get the Ykesha proc for my main (I didn't like the idea of three procs with Pushback 1).  Perhaps, since two of the procs are stuns and two self-heals, the mobs now believe me to be a Paladin and think they are mandated by SoE to lock onto me :p <br />

<br />
Absolutely. <br />
<br />
My inference was based solely on the SOE's description of slots in the text file, and I meant to be clear that I was quoting a reference to slots.<br />
<br />
To clarify - the text implies an augmentation will go into the highest numbered slot that can take that augmentation, rather than the lowest.<br />
<br />
Assuming that I have:<br />
<br />
Slot 1, type 1: (empty) and<br />
Slot 2, type 1: (empty)<br />
<br />
I at first assumed that the first type 1 aug I added would go into Slot 1, but the text implies (but doesn't say explicitly) that it would go into Slot 2 first.   That's why I mentioned it.<br />
<br />
Obviously, it's only important when you have a mix of &quot;All Slot&quot; and &quot;Specific Slot&quot; items, as described in eqnews.txt.</div></div><hr />

From the eqnews.txt ...<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Inferrable from this is that the highest numbered slot is &quot;the first open slot on your item&quot;.  <br />
<br />
if by highest numbered you mean highest from top to bottom (slot 1 being the 'highest' as seen on the info box of the item)you're right... <br />
<br />
but your statement could read as though out of slot 1 slot 2 &amp; slot 3 that slot 3 (being highest #) will be filled first by the 'any type' items, which isn't the case... re reading what you quoted, they state there are 3 slots &amp; slot 1 is filled, then that if you use an any type/slot aug (type 1's) that it would go into the 2nd slot leaving only the 3rd to be augmented with whatever type it can hold, in their example causing the aug that would have only fit in Slot 2 to be unuseable...  <br />
<br />
they want it realised that the type 1 augs will go into slots in numerical order regardles of the type of the slot, so say you have bought a weapon with:<br />
Slot 1: Type 1<br />
Slot 2: Type 4<br />
Slot 3: Type 6<br />
and for whatever reason you wish to apply 2 type 1(fits any type) and a type 4 aug. You need to apply the Type 4 aug before you apply the 2nd type 1 aug... if you apply both the typ 1's first they will flow into Slot 1 &amp; slot 2 leaving only slot 3 open, which will not take your type 4aug...<br />
<br />
they really could have come up with a less confusing naming convention for the aug system, using #'s to define both in different ways can be more than slightly confusing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a type 3 aug that slots into the slot 2: type 3 slot of my range slot item with 3 aug slots. <br />
<br />
I hope that clears things up for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ompa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">type 3 aug will go into only a slot that's type 3 yup... it's the type 1 augs that have a chance to mess you up if you're not looking</div></div><hr />
