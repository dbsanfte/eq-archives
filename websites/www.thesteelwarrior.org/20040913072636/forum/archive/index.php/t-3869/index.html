-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
A man was beating a 16-year-old girl with a pipe Wednesday morning on Detroit's west side. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the man was dead, shot several times by a passenger in a passing car. <br />
<br />
Police are looking for the driver of the car and the gunman, who might not be a criminal suspect, but a much rarer species -- a drive-by vigilante. <br />
<br />
&quot;Under certain circumstances, a citizen taking violent action to protect themselves or others is warranted,&quot; said Detroit Police Cmdr. Craig Schwartz of the major crimes division. &quot;We need to know if these actions are justified.' <br />
<br />
The dead man was identified as Johnny Donaldson Jr., 22, of Detroit. Police said he was swinging a metal pipe at several women and girls at Northlawn and Plymouth at 7:45 a.m. <br />
<br />
That's when the motorist, with the passenger next to him, rolled by in a silver Pontiac. The driver stopped, and the passenger opened fire from inside the car. Then, police said, the car might have driven over the man. <br />
<br />
Police were investigating Donaldson on Wednesday evening and had no motive for the pipe attack. It was not known if he knew his victims. <br />
<br />
Several children and adults suffered minor injuries from the pipe, police said. At least two of the girls were on their way to Mackenzie High School. <br />
<br />
Police said they do not have a description of the two men. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need them to come in to talk to us and tell us exactly what happened,&quot; Schwartz said. <br />
<br />
&quot;The information is that a girl was being violently assaulted at the time of the shooting. We really need to talk to these guys to get their side of it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Anyone with information is asked to call Detroit police at 313-596-2260<br />

<br />
Were you there?  It is because of people's narrow minded opinions that makes people not want to stick around after they have to use a gun for self defense or in defending another.  You have already convicted this person and you were not even there and all you have to go on is heresay and your opinion.  Murder is different from homicide by the way, that person committed homicide(took a human life) not necessarily murder.  Whether he is guilty of a crime (murder) is for the police and possibly a court to decide, not you.<br />
<br />
I am someone who was trained in the use of a firearm by a certified police academy and had to use one at work for several years and I assure you that if someone is beating an unarmed person, especially a child, with a pipe, that you are 100 percent justified in shooting them if you feel the victims life is in danger.   A chance for the person to give up peacefully may or may not have been warranted but if the aggressor was in mid swing with a pipe, about to possibly kill his victim, I wouldn't wait to shoot him.  If that person had waited for the police to show up instead of acting, there might have been a lot of dead people there so it sounds like he did the right thing possibly but he was afraid to stick around and trust his fate to some narrow minded jury.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're quite correct, we don't know the full facts and justice shouldn't be blind, however justice should have strict rules and harsh penalties to ensure people think twice about taking the law into their own hands. For every 'justified homicide' how many unjust ones do you encourage? <br />
<br />
It's the reason vigilantism is against the law.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue isn't people stopping the offender it's people winding down a window and going bang without attempting a more peaceful/less deadly solution. <br />
<br />
'Natural selection' pays no attention to the justice of a situation - ask any innocent murder victim - they failed the test after all didn't they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sometimes Peace is only obtained by a extreme show of force.  <br />
<br />
Murder a little harsh since the guy was protecting someone elses life.  A person died from this but ask yourself the question did he care if that girl lived or not he was beating with the pipe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Was it a lethal situation? Did the man deserve to die? We have little to go on but all the evidence we have from that report suggests that only minor injuries were sustained by the various people the man attacked, that the shooter gave the man no warning that if he proceeded he would be killed, that a mans life was taken from him before all other means were exhausted. <br />
<br />
Society doesn't consider citizens killing each other acceptable or people wouldn't jail/execute murderers yeah?  <br />
Because instances happen where self defence or defence of others is required that is 'sometimes' an acceptable excuse for a regrettable action. <br />
<br />
That this action was 'needed' or 'acceptable' is far from clear, that's why in most situations people rely on the justice system to determine what is the needful course of action to punish anyone who breaks the law. The fact that the justice system fails to make itself felt in meaningful fashion isn't an excuse for vigilante's it's a sad failure to be lamented and rectified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Did the other person had to interfere? no,  was there a chance that the girl who was getting beat on with the metal pipe have been killed? YES.  Did that person used excessive force? Yes.  Was he in the right or in the wrong? I can not answer that question for some reason I want to say he was right and then a part of me thinks that their could of been a better way to deal with situation.  I am torn from taking a stance on this either way for some reason and will probably dwell on this for the rest of the day.   But this thought keeps ringing in my head.  The man didn't care if the girled lived from his attack why should I care about his life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">How can you put it in a different light like that?<br />
A Police Officer on presence alone would have deemed a different outcome; they KNOW they're not allowed to use excessive force; and are trained to use other means to subdue an assailant; and KNOW the point where using force is necessary.<br />

so these two people showed up and shot someone that was quite possibly going to kill someone, he was using deadly force (a pipe) to attack someone.  and then, because they did not want to be sued by this persons family because &quot;he was just misunderstood&quot; or &quot;he had an anger problem&quot; or &quot;he was drunk/high/stoned&quot; and thus not responsible, they left.  <br />

Wrong. What si the motto of every police officer in America? To SERVE and PROTECT. IF all they did was cleanup bro the entire nation would have one hell of a lawsuit in their favor since your tax dollars are what keeps law enforcment ( emphasis on enforcement ) actively protecting this nation/town/city/state/etc.<br />
 all they do is take statements for events that happened and attempt to find the individuals responsible if they decide that it was in fact something that could have been a violation of the law.<br />
Yes, they do that. When a crime of any sort is reported and/or seen they actively try to find the culprit(s).<br />
they are not responsible for protecting you from would be assailents.<br />
Bullshit. Plain and simply Bullshit. Go do a little research because I could most likely break this board with links to Police procedures and law enforcement. So, it's easier to play my Bullshit card on that one.<br />
the problem is that people have been told over and over again &quot;don't protect yourself, call the cops&quot;, now the criminals know that people will not stand up for themselves, they will do what they are told and try to call the cops, if they cannot do that they will cower in the corner and let things happen.<br />
Bro, put the remote down. This ain't TV Land. Like I mentioned before; it's YOUR TAX DOLLARS at work here. Just reading that last statement makes me think you have NO IDEA NOR CREDENTIALS whatever to make such a statement other than drunken speculation.<br />
i normally dislike to invoke the mystical numbers &quot;9/11&quot;, but part of the reason that those hijackings worked was because people were told to do whatever hijackers wanted...<br />
Holy Shit bro; you're really getting delusional here. You read a lot of Crime Drama? OR watch too much WE channel? <br />

It has been a while but here is what I have been told.<br />
<br />
Deadly force, in a nutshell, is force that can cause serious bodily harm. Serious bodily harm includes, but is not limited too, broken bones, severed limbs, deep cuts, and fatal wounds. <br />
<br />
So based on this, and with common knowledge that a person beating on someone with a pipe can cause such injuries, it is not unreasonable to say that the person in question was using deadly force. <br />
<br />
Now that is important to understand, because even if the person beating was not looking to kill the girl he was using deadly force and could have killed her. Not could have in some abstract sense, but rather in an immediate and direct threat to the girls life.<br />
<br />
So that answers that question.<br />
<br />
( And read what Flair said too. )<br />
<br />
However I am curious, does anyone have a link or know about the laws that require a person to come to another’s aid if they see them in distress?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I know we had one here where a lady caught someone stealing her car. The guy was driving off and someone from I want to say an autoshop stepped out in front of the car. The man in the car didn't stop so he shot him once in the head. Police came and said the guy was using the car for a weapon so the man was never prosecuted. Texas is just kind of leniant that way, we would have let the guys off especially if they didn't run or came in to explain after they got their nerv back. I would bet the girl in this situation was happy someone came to her rescue. It's a harsh punishment but will never know what would have happened if they hadn't seen what was happening.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">i have zero sympathy for someone that gets shot while attempting to do bodily harm to another.Bingo!<br />
<br />
If I walk up on some guy beating an unarmed little girl with a pipe, I am going to shoot him. The next swing could kill her, hesitating can mean life or death for the victim.<br />
<br />
I don't blame the guys for driving away. In a justice system where a criminal can sue the victim and win, you are better off either not getting involved at all, or killing the criminal and walking away. Ask any cop his advice on shooting an intruder in your home, I bet they will you (off the record of course) shoot to kill to avoid possible law suits from the criminal. It sucks, but that is the reality our legal system in it's current state.<br />
<br />
It's really quite simple. If you don't want some crazy vigilante shooting you for beating someone with a pipe, DON'T BEAT SOMEONE WITH A PIPE.</div></div><hr />

Deadly force has been adequately explained.  This dumbshit was using it on an unarmed, female minor.  The next breath is one of these peoples last, whose should it be?  If your answer is, call the authorities, yet you had the means to stop the crime.  You, my friend, are an accomplice.<br />
<br />
Be part of the solution, not the problem.  If that is your mother or daughter about to be struck on the head with a pipe what do you do?  Call the cops and hope it doesn't hurt em bad?  Walk away?<br />

<br />
Little girl getting beat with a bat?  Yes, something has to get done right away.  What would I have done?  Jumped out of the car, fired a shot in the air, got his attention and stopped the immediate possiblilty of harm to the girl.  If he ignored my shot and me yelling for him to get the fuck off her and went after her again I most likely would have shot him.<br />

Sorry guys, I definitely do not want idiots running around with guns shooting people when they think it is warranted.  EVER.

This is from my neck of the woods.  Gainesville, FL (university of florida) bar downtown called the salty dog.  Basics, uf student out with buddies gets hammered at the bar and then is driving down the back little college park area roads to try and get home like a dumbass.  Hits a stop sign trying to turn right and a cop pulls him over.  At some point he realizes &quot;holy shit Im fucked...DUI&quot; and tries to drive away but his car is stuck in the mud beside the road.  As the car is revving cop runs up to the window, gun drawn and begins banging on the window with the butt of the gun for the driver to get out of the car.  Somehow the officer gets in front of the car and then, rationalizing his life is in danger, opens up and fires seven shots at the driver thru the window - hitting him three times.  Driver runs into a fence, staggers out and towards the officer and dies at his feet.<br />

Guy driving drunk like a moron needs to be in jail, not a coffin.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Heh, let me give you a real life example of misreading a situation.  About five years ago I was dating a girl and she was gone for the weekend with her friends to the beach.  Well, on Sat night (she was supposed to get back Sunday) I went to this titty bar with some friends ( I didn't drive as it was fairly likely one of her friends could have seen my car there and I am waaaay to smart for that).  Anyway, I am not supposed to hang out at titty bars heh. <br />
<br />
Well, she got sick and drove home saturday night and gets back around 11pm and im not home.  She waits and about 1 am or so she figures she will go look for me (heh, psycho jealous type).  She goes to Trader's (&lt;----- titty bar) in my jeep and is sitting outside in the parking lot when I come stumbling out tore up.  There is not a single street light in this parking lot and it is dark as hell.  I don't see her and as I am about to get in the car with my friend she clocks me in the back with a bat I kept in the jeep.  I am pretty drunk and hit the ground and she goes after me again.  She is wearing a ball cap and could easily have been mistaken for a guy trying to mug/kill/rob me.<br />

What if some redneck yahoo sitting in his truck had decided my life was in danger and pulled out a 44 and opened up on her to save my life?<br />
<br />
hmmm....<br />

btw, not a real story but it sounded good and makes the point (the girl in question would have been more likely to smack me if i didnt take her with me to the titty bar  :p  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I do not like the idea of guys driving around with guns taking matters into their own hands and shooting people. What if he misses and shoots the girl instead, or some other innocent bystander? What if he just totally misreads the next situation (in this one I will grant he got right what was happening) and sees two people fucking around with each other and what looks like a metal pipe? <br />
<br />
Little girl getting beat with a bat? Yes, something has to get done right away. What would I have done? Jumped out of the car, fired a shot in the air, got his attention and stopped the immediate possiblilty of harm to the girl. If he ignored my shot and me yelling for him to get the fuck off her and went after her again I most likely would have shot him.<br />
<br />
Sorry guys, I definitely do not want idiots running around with guns shooting people when they think it is warranted. EVER. Hell, cops don't even always make the right decisions when it comes to when to shoot and when not to shoot and they friggen train all the damn time on that very subject...<br />

This is from my neck of the woods. Gainesville, FL (university of florida) bar downtown called the salty dog. Basics, uf student out with buddies gets hammered at the bar and then is driving down the back little college park area roads to try and get home like a dumbass. Hits a stop sign trying to turn right and a cop pulls him over. At some point he realizes &quot;holy shit Im fucked...DUI&quot; and tries to drive away but his car is stuck in the mud beside the road. As the car is revving cop runs up to the window, gun drawn and begins banging on the window with the butt of the gun for the driver to get out of the car. Somehow the officer gets in front of the car and then, rationalizing his life is in danger, opens up and fires seven shots at the driver thru the window - hitting him three times. Driver runs into a fence, staggers out and towards the officer and dies at his feet.<br />

Guy driving drunk like a moron needs to be in jail, not a coffin. <br />

Someone who attacks a little girl with a steel pipe has consentually given up any rights they had as a human being.  If you saw a mad dog attacking a little girl, and had a gun in your hand, you know what you would do.  I don't see it as being any different.<br />

I've recieved a bit of training on the subject, if her life appeared to be in immediate danger it would have been an appropriate response.  The person who posted &quot;the rules&quot; above was pretty much on the mark.  It's a spot call someone has to make, and depending on your state\county what the consequences might be.  I live in the deep south, I doubt anyone would be prosecuted for that here if it was remotely justified.  A warning may have done more harm than good, allowing him an extra couple swings or taking a hostage.<br />
<br />
Warnings work on normal people, not someone who's currently beating a minor with a pipe.  Jail only deters non-criminals from crime for that matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Where did i suggest the man shouldn't have been stopped? Did i suggest ignoring the nutjob with the bar and letting him beat the girl to death? Lets substitute a cop for the bloke in the car. If a detroit police officer was on the scene would he have rolled up in his car, put the window down and plugged the guy? I doubt it, last i checked killing someone was a last resort used by officers when all other means failed. It's possible they might have had to kill him certainly, however I note nobody in the report was treated for serious injuries, including the girl, you'll argue from your viewpoint that that 'may' mean the guy with the gun acted right in this instance to prevent injury, it 'may' however mean the situation could've been resolved with no deaths, which to anyone with a decent respect for all human lives (not trying to be a freaking peacenik, thanks all the same) is the better outcome and one that even the most hardened cop would seek to create (by training or at worse to avoid the paperwork).<br />
<br />
You certainly can't be any more sure that your read of the situation is more correct than mine, the only reported evidence here doesn't support gunning a man down in a hit and run.<br />
<br />
Interesting that they shot the guy and then possibly ran him over if you read the report, that makes our motivation for these 'good samaritans' dubious in it's own right or at least suggests that there was a lot less reasoned thought than adrenaline/panic/emotion going on in the shooters car....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Laws?  Our laws are rooted in the belief that people should be allowed to protect themselves and others from physical harm.  The law isn't there to usurp personal responsibility and choice.  It is there to strenghten it.   We live in the fucking wild wild west, man.  <br />
<br />
The law very specifically and explicitly permits the defense of others.  Don't like it?  Talk to your congressman.  But don't expect results since that is foundational premis of our society, dating back to its origins in common law England. <br />
<br />
I think its sad that folks argue that this protection is solely the job of the police.  This is why the Kitty Genovese incident happened in New York.  For those of you who never heard of it...A new york woman was raped, shot and beaten over the course of around 2 hours in a NY street.  Her attacker ran away when she first began screaming for help and trying to drag herself to safety.  When her cries continued unanswered he came back and kept at it.  Not a single on of the 40 or so New Yorkers who heard her cries called the cops or came to her rescue. <br />
<br />
This is a different incident, but the underlying point remains the same:  coming to defense of one in danger and in need of protection is NOT wrong.  So to those of you who argue that only police are granted the right of protection, I call bullshit.  And that isn't just my opinion, that is the law that you claim should apply here.<br />
<br />
For those of you who instead argued that the degree of force used was wrong...think about this: The actual statement of the law for defense of others that  the force used must not be more than the force that the offended individual could have used.  That basically means that any of us could defend those little girls and women by using the same degree of force that they would be justified in using to protect themselves.  <br />
<br />
What were the women or little girls justified in doing?  Well, none of us know all the facts, but presupposing the ONLY facts that exist are those in the report, they were justified in using deadly force.  Why? I think we would probably all agree that the assailant was assaulting those women and children with a deadly weapon.  Hnce they probably could have used deadly force to protect themselves. <br />
<br />
BTW,  when I read that story it sounded to me like a fucking set up.  No way would a normal story state that many times how much the police want to get &quot;their stories&quot;....BS.  The police just want these vigilantes to come into the office and, when they do, they are going to be sad sad pandas by the heap of charges laid on their shoulders.  <br />

Oh, and p.s.  IMO all drunk drivers should be fucking hosed down by shot guns.  Give that cop a medal.</div></div><hr />

Here's the subtle (:p) part - Stopping someone does not neccessarily mean making them dead!!!! That should be questioned unless it is an absolute last resort - as it would be with a cop. <br />
<br />
Even if you are technically covered, taking the law into your own hands and appointing yourself judge, jury and executioner should be frowned upon (and no doubt would be in this case).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Lets see. From what is known about the attack,<br />
<br />
A girl was getting beaten with a metal pipe.<br />
<br />
What do you do? You have a gun and see this going on. <br />
<br />
Call the cops and then yell? What if he doesnt stop. What if the cops dont get there in time? What if he swings one more time and the girl is killed or worse left brain dead?<br />
<br />
Maybe he stops, the yell stopped the beating. What if he takes the girl hostage and worse things happen from there? Now someone has to be talked down if things go the best case here.<br />
<br />
Maybe he runs away. How do you feel if he hurts someone else later, knowing full well you could have stopped him before?<br />
<br />
Maybe you shoot him? So you going to shoot him in the leg? Great, expect a lawsuit from him. Do you think your insurance is going to cover this?<br />
<br />
If it was me, I would have done the same thing. I how ever would have stuck around to face the cops. Leaving the scene of the crime (flight) usually you did something wrong. You are hiding from something, you obviously feel you did something wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Relying on my leet ninja skillz, I would probably have snuck up behind and jumped him while my friend held the gun which was pointed directly at him.

Ok, Val Cops will use a gun when all other methods have failed or cannot be reasonably employed. You can't use most restraining devices at a distance. What are you going have them do, throw the handcuffs at suspects? <br />
<br />
The most a cop would have done in a situation like that, is yell at the guy to stop, then shoot him if he didn't, that fast, in that order. It's what is supposed to be done.  If the cop tried to run up to the guy in order to restrain him, and the guy hit the girl again causing her death, the cop would have been at fault. Yes, the cop would have been held accountable for the girls death.<br />
<br />
You can try to argue against the law with personal ethics, but it just doesn’t work that way all the time in real life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I accept that, but look again at the report - the guy was swinging at a number of different people before he got shot none of them suffered severe injuries. Our mad dog killer of a 22 year old wasn't very effective with that pipe now was he. Typing away here how do you know that the man couldn't have been restrained? How can you be sure he wouldn't have taken notice of a shouted warning? Shouldn't he have been given that chance rather than a one stop trip to the mortuary? <br />
<br />
That's why you the ordinary citizen aren't encouraged to use a lethal weapon to solve a dispute because you are not trained to assess the situation or to react with appropriate levels of force. Sure there are occasions where it's neccessary, this doesn't sound like one of 'em to me, it is not a clear fact that the girl would be dead if not for the death of the pipe wielder, far from it.  I severely doubt that a majority of incidents involving pipes end in a fatality wether or not the pipe is 'potentially' lethal. Particularly when the assailant doesn't appear to be focused in his anger or otherwise exhibiting deadly intent. 'Shooting him just incase' isn't really the correct rule of thumb :p<br />
<br />
Life is all about grey area's agreed, but suggesting this incident is perfectly acceptable given the very murky nature of the situation is sending the wrong signals.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. What si the motto of every police officer in America? To SERVE and PROTECT. IF all they did was cleanup bro the entire nation would have one hell of a lawsuit in their favor since your tax dollars are what keeps law enforcment ( emphasis on enforcement ) actively protecting this nation/town/city/state/etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds good in theory, falls far short in reality:<br />
<br />
In the case of Warren v. District of Columbia.  Two women were upstairs in a townhouse when they heard their roommate, a third woman, being attacked downstairs by intruders. They phoned the police several times and were assured that officers were on the way. After about 30 minutes, when their roommate's screams had stopped, they assumed the police had finally arrived. When the two women went downstairs they saw that in fact the police never came, but the intruders were still there. As the Warren court graphically states in the opinion: &quot;For the next fourteen hours the women were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual acts upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands of their attackers.&quot; The three women sued the District of Columbia for failing to protect them, but D.C.'s highest court exonerated the District and its police, saying that it is a &quot;fundamental principle of American law that a government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services, such as police protection, to any individual citizen.&quot; [Warren v. District of Columbia, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. Ct. of Ap., 1981).]<br />
<br />
Furthermore atleast here in California it is explicitaly stated that you can not sue:<br />
California's Government Code, Sections 821, 845, and 846 states, in part: &quot;Neither a public entity or a public employee [may be sued] for failure to provide adequate police protection or service, failure to prevent the commission of crimes and failure to apprehend criminals.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Now that's fucked up, it's not exactly true though that the police do not attempt to protect and serve.  The reason that legislation is probably there is not to 'excuse' such cases but to prevent massive amounts of 'dubious' legal actions crippling the Police's funding entirely. They can't be omnipresent.</div></div><hr />
