<br />
<br />
Skill name: Grapple <br />
<br />
Effect: Root2 ( works on immune to run speed changes mobs: see below ) while grapple skill is being used.<br />
<br />
Penalty: User cannot attack and also has run speed changed to 0. User cannot use the /disc command or have a /disc up while using grapple ( see /shield )<br />
<br />
<br />
Restrictions: Cannot work against targets of phenomenal strength or size ( I.E. dragons, gods and other boss type mobs ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Reasoning to allow root on otherwise immune mobs: The immune tag is to prevent people from attacking said mobs with lessened risk of getting damage from the mob and seeing as how a rooted mob will attack whatever is in melee range, the restriction of having a PC in melee range negates the use of root to completely avoid mob damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may now pick it apart and do whatever other nasty things you like too it</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about triping as an adding feature to kick<br />
<br />
effect:  2 second stun or snare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BUT... BUT ...<br />
<br />
we have a snare, SWOE... <br />
<br />
of course its a proc and never goes of when we need it... DAMN RNG's!<br />
<br />
Awesome idea, though.. would love to see special feets/skills/attacks that have MUNDANE effects approximating spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skill: Kick to the Nadgers<br />
<br />
Effect: 50% slow, V low aggro, greys out taunt hotkey for 1 minute<br />
<br />
Give pallies CH! Lets have all tank groups! :p<br />

Where's my medication.... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grapple was thought of primarily for aggro problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that I wouldn't mind seeing some form of  non-damaging push attack ( knock-back effect ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other than groups without a snarer, I can't think of any use for this ability, could somebody enlighten me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's simple: you grab onto a mob when it comes into camp so people can de-buff ( slow ) it without being smeared into paste.<br />
<br />
Nukes break root too, so it’s not like you could have a wizard incinerate it with safety</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember when we first started doing Vindi and couldn't get him without the guards.  I don't know about you but we offtanked Vindi and killed his guards then camped and rebuffed...<br />
<br />
Now, we have a tackling chain!<br />
<br />
Tells raid, &quot;OK pull and I will tackle Vindi.  Once he runs me over Bigbull will tackle him.  Hopefully he will fumble the ball and we can recover!&quot;<br />
<br />
hehe, I like it.<br />
<br />
Slower slows on inc and then mob heads for him and Warrior tackles him halfway there...<br />
<br />
/grin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Decorin Berik and Gunthork are dead.  Here comes Tallon!  Buun takes off down the hall to tackle him...<br />
<br />
RZtW at 15...Add Chaos Boar on the clerics...Buun tackles it.<br />

<br />
after a bit of thinking it just doesnt seem very warrior like to root stuff plus some mobs that are mr and very ping pongy by intent would be nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL i just want to watch some barbarian warrior running around tackling things......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it's a skill, not a spell, so no MR check.<br />
<br />
Also the concept is simply getting something to stand still via physical force. I.E. jumping on someone and pinning them to the ground, lifting that assling up by the scruff of the neck, charging at something then &quot;locking horns&quot;, grabbing someone around the waist and lifting them up off their feet, basically strong-arming . A feat of strength, if you will.</div></div><hr />

If the warrior can't attack while he uses this ability then he can't build agro. Now admittedly he could taunt, but with everybody else attacking, the mob would inevitably bounce around anyway as soon as it became unrooted. Now ofcourse he could just stand there and keep the mob rooted the entire fight, but I doubt many exp groups are going to want a dead weight warrior who just stands around with the mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right: grab it, let people de-buff, taunt it, let it go and beat on it.<br />
<br />
Spells are so high aggro that someone beating on the mob while this is going on will be nothing.<br />
<br />
but I doubt many exp groups are going to want a dead weight warrior who just stands around with the mob.<br />
<br />
That would be the point of the penalty: you couldn't just stand around doing nothing.</div></div><hr />

Basically the same as having them debuff on inc and you taunting when it gets to camp. Also, if melee were attacking while it was rooted, unless you simultaniously taunted(successfully) and began to attack at exactly the same moment, the mob would turn onto them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically the same as having them debuff on inc and you taunting when it gets to camp. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not at all.<br />
<br />
The differences: The mob is not moving, and the mob is trying to eat the warrior. As opposed to the mob running after the de-buffer to eat them.<br />
<br />
Also, if melee were attacking while it was rooted, unless you simultaniously taunted(successfully) and began to attack at exactly the same moment, the mob would turn onto them.<br />
<br />
Again, spells generate so much aggro it is not even funny. I can't remember the last time I had to taunt off of another pure melee class in a group wasn't pulling. And they rarely got aggro after slow landed. It might be different at the level that casters get all the -% aggro AA's and items, but I have never grouped with a caster that has and couldn't tell you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not that the melee are drawing lots of agro, its the fact that unless you taunt and break root/attack at exactly the same moment, they're going to get a hit in and draw agro as soon as you break that root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err, I'm not quite following you on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step one: Mob rooted = you getting hit, cause you are closest <br />
<br />
Step Two: Taunt = you getting hit, because you are the closest and have the most aggro.<br />
<br />
Step Three: break root = you getting hit because you have the most aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Root breaking does not reset everyone's aggro to 0; it simply removes the aggro multiplier that root uses to see who is getting hit. And if you have the most aggro before and after the root break I see no way in hell that someone else is going to get hit.I see no way in hell that someone else is going to get hit.</div></div><hr />
