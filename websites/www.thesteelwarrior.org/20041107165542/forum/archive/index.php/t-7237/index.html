<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, my SS tanker is level 19 and I'm finding that Skyway City is pretty close to tapped out.  Yes, there are still mobs that give experience there, but they're getting harder and harder to find.  So I ducked into independence port and talos island today and found that independence port starts off at about level 22 or 23 and goes up from there while in talos island there are some level 20-21 NPCs, but they're exceedingly rare.  So where does a level 19 looking for level 19-21 NPCs go to hunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is just speculation, but perhaps Boomtown or the Faultline.  I'm pretty sure you should be able to find mobs to hunt in either one of them.  Also Faultline should for the most part have more higher level mobs than Boomtown.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been to both Boomtown and Faultline and they're pretty much along the line of Perez Park, which means mobs come in groups of 10 or so.  I'm really looking for solo territory, where I can get mobs in groups of 4 or less most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hide Park in Skyway City. You find level 15 to 19 range trolls and clockworks there. It's where Superchum ground out level 18. I knew about the &quot;dead time&quot; between contacts in the 18 to 20 range, and how people get STUCK ... so I ground out 18 and saved a bunch of missions for 19, cause I hate not having missions to do.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
Also, there's some spawns of level 20 Family in Steel Canyon, but they're too sparse to really focus on.<br />
<br />
19's the closest this game has to a hell level. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've found the very bottom of the Land of the Lost in Skyway City has some level 19s, so I've been spending my time there.  I did the levels 20s family you mention for a while, found that they have a regular spawn area near the zone to independence port, but not enough to work for more than an hour or so.<br />
<br />
I can see that getting levels 19-21 or so is going to be a challenge.  I may have to go back to missions, but I was getting tired of them since they always seem to have at least one mob or combination of mobs in each mission that is just a serious PITA.  For example, did a Circle of Thorns mission the other night, and there was a yellow con Spectral Demon Lord, damn thing must have taken me 20 minutes to take down at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Talos Island<br />
New Thebes district<br />
<br />
Personally I'd go do patrols for 2 hours and get a level.  You can solo Talos Islang with your LFT thing on.  I do it and usually end up soloing 15-30 minnutes before I get picked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got lucky and had a bunch of missions back from 14th that I had let rot. Make sure you check out all your old contacts.<br />
<br />
That said, I have done very little outside hunting, and almost none that was not missions based.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I've got missions I can do.  But I'm a soloist for the most part.  Yes, I've grouped.  And yes even some of the groups were fun.  But most of the time I find that I play at odd times for odd durations and just prefer to go off and do my own thing rather than messing with a group.  And recently I've been burned out by missions because as a tanker there are some of the mobs that it's just hard as hell for me to beat down alone.  I can do it, usually, but it is very time intensive.  I'll spend an hour, as an example, just killing two or three pairs of Tsoo Socerers/Enforcers or 20 minutes killing a Spectral Demon Lord.  It gets frustrating to be beating and beating on a mob only to do 8 damage with an attack that normally does 18 or 19 damage with an attack that normally does 35.  And then to have that mob life tap heal itself or to use temporary invulnerability and run from me, just too much grief to be dealt with in large doses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you can stand it, duo with a blaster.<br />
<br />
And i love the sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I almost exclusively outside hunt now.  I get dragged into the indoors from time to time - but they aren't  mine since I don't do any missions of my own.<br />
<br />
Inv tankers with provoke are welcome in any group even if the person has only 20 min to burn.  All tankers are a key part of any group doing higher than avg group level bosses &amp; such.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest duoing with a bunc of blasters and building your friends list.  As a blaster (main) myself I love tankers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got with a group in Faultline last night, eventually we ended up going to Talos Island and as a result I was able to get level 20.  I've had provoke for a bit now and picked up invinsibility last night, sounds like I have just the ticket for the grouping scene.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some if's for ya.<br />
<br />
IF you have an EMP healer, a controller, another tanker or scrapper, a near full group.....<br />
<br />
You can easily, with thinking and using right tactics (read assisting not aoe'ing), do groups outdoors up to 10 levels higher than your group.  I'd suggest building up to it testing your group as you go.  I have founf THE key, THE cornerstone - an Invul tank.  <br />
<br />
The benefits:<br />
<br />
1. Great, wonderful fun - dangerous AND rewarding<br />
<br />
2. Good xp<br />
<br />
3. DO enhancements will drop that are either extremely useful or sell for good inf.<br />
<br />
CoH is a decent game soloing - but really not that special in my mind.  It is a fantastic game grouped and if you like combat (imo).<br />
<br />
I would guess do 4-5 groupings like that and when you start logging in you will start getting tells unsolicited to be the tank for a group.  Good tanks are amazing.<br />
<br />
Something to tantalize you with for future levels:<br />

I sk'ed with a 32 invul/stone tank.  He was taking on groups of 36-38's and allowed me to tag along.  He was showing me his normal SOLO hunting.  I couldn't believe it - he wasn't taking a lot of damage from these lt's and minions (passed on bosses, mezzers, stunners).  He did choose the fights very very carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As a note Geko has mentioned they have their eye on invul tankers--and possibly setting a hard limit on defensces to 95% (instead of the 100+ now attainable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am a temporary invulnerablity tanker, and I have invincibility.  The combination of the two can be extremely powerful.  Last night I took on a group of 6 light red 22s using it.  But I have yet to see a situation where I took no damage, sometimes very light damage, but not no damage at all.<br />
<br />
And if I get stunned and my defenses drop, oh boy do I get a beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes.   Your tank key will be to pick your fights very carefully.  Avoid stunners and mezzers.<br />
<br />
I was buzzing around Talos and taking on groups of even cons and 1 level ups solo.  I was feeling pretty powerful.  So I decided to take on a boss.<br />
<br />
I got mezzed - fell to the ground - 1/2 hp gone.<br />
<br />
They ran to me and in 1 shot - dead.<br />
<br />
I don't fight those bosses anymore solo.<br />
<br />
You, as an invul tanker, will be able to take on purples shortly once you get your defenses completely slotted.  You will STILL have to pick the type of villain you fight carefully. <br />
<br />
Yes, the 95% thing is due in at any moment.  That is only smashing and lethal damage though.  You still take damage from other types.  So, pick your fights with villains that only do lethal and smashing damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I took your advice. And my little 19 controller, Superchum, has been kicking some major buttocks in Talos. I've solo'd groups of yellows ... two oranges at a time ... and Reds and Purples one on one (after using confuse to make their &quot;friends&quot; go away, heh).<br />
<br />
It's been kind of empowering.</div></div><hr />
