Hope none mind but I know I always like seeing what new zones look like. The first two mobs are from furubi (what ever happened to simple names like west commons lol). Been hunting there a lot kill like 35 mobs but loot is nanda but just pulling to the zone line cause CR looks to be impossible so I don't dare venture deeper alone. Getting 2percent AA each toon each kill so at least the exp is ok.<br />

<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well if you been to these zones I doubt the shots are of interest but some people might be considering buying GoD or not and some nice SS might effect their decision. And some people might not have gotten into those zones yet. I know that I would like to see some SS of zones that I have not been into.... <br />
<br />
I mean if you have no interest in SS of GoD then why click on a post titled &quot;5 nice GoD SceenShots to share&quot;.<br />
<br />
Posted 2 of the SS on wizard forum and no negative comments after 1,600 hits.... <br />

Samlancer<br />
Samdancer<br />
Samfinancer<br />
Samtrancer<br />

Samenhancer<br />

It scares me a little but at least they all have a theme.  o.O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Went to the new zones a couple of days ago.  Nice models, and really thought they looked interesting when my group started an expedition.  <br />
<br />
That anime elven ghost chick lost her appeal when she punched me in the lips for over 1k damage. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SAM YOU'RE JUST TOO FUCKING SEXY :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think they look great.  Will definatley weigh in on my decision to buy or not thanks Sam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the ukun boneretriever reminds me of Hellraiser movies...not sure why though</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The point of my flame was that Sam treats this board as his personal shrine. These weren't intended to show people 5 GoD screenshots, it was intended as 'look at me'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">YOU SEE THOSE 2 NUKE CRITS? THAT'S  AMAZING IRL!</div></div><hr />

The point of my flame was that Sam treats this board as his personal shrine. These weren't intended to show people 5 GoD screenshots, it was intended as 'look at me'  <br />
<br />
Regardless, that is not a reason to flame in the tavern.  Hell half the posts here are &quot;my guild beat rallos zek!&quot; type things.  Sam has never posted anything innappropriate on these boards, which is more than you can say for his stalkers from fohguild.org</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i think the SS are exactly what the title says. i *have* been to all the &quot;free access&quot; GoD zones, but i run the lowest graphics setting possible just to be able to walk around and/or tank and i must say, the mobs look a lot better with full effects loaded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wrathbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The stuff here looks like something out of a Tool video =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ya I take good SS cause I do have every effect on (main computer that has the warrior on it has a Nvidia5700 card and 1.5G of PC3200 ram). I think the graphics are an important part of the immersion in the game. 1024 X 786 seems good enough, considering I show a lot of the screen.<br />
<br />
The graphics in GoD are the best in EQ yet, the game just keeps improving as time goes on......<br />
<br />
To the guy who asked I have 6 accounts, click on the link to my forum and you can read about my six boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Janus_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As, uh, fascinating as that may be, I will pass.  Was merely curious is all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Benlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I enjoyed those SS, looks like some rather cool places to visit.   <br />
<br />
I like seeing what other people think is special in game, I don't see it as an ego boost type thing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Cool stuff Sam, how are you doing on the trails for advancement?<br />
Have you beaten any yet bro? Prolly is a lot easier coordinated as you are. and hey to the haters.<br />
<br />
Sam just makes this inctol a console game he has his party of 6 and is ready to rawr /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That elven ranger model is the coolest thing EVER.  <br />
<br />
If rangers had that animation when they shot, I bet they'd hit 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 faster!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wwwwhhhhhhyyyyy can't we NOT be Sober?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Its sad that I do not even know if those are new spell effects or not with GoD as I have had mine off for so long now lol.<br />
<br />
Nice looking screenshots none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The Kyv are about as similar to Elves as uh.. Clorox to Kool aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Twiisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I really like the SS  thanks for posting! I always hated not being able to see the new zones of Luclin! (when it was out for about a year I still didn't have it hehe) :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The stuff here looks like something out of a Tool video =/ <br />
<br />
Tool fucking owns~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I took another batch today but running out of room at MFO, go here and just click download if you see a SS you might like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">yeah those pics look awesome showing in slideshow whilst having Tool playing in the background :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'd say, over all, that GoD graphically kicks some ass =)   really cool looking mobs =)</div></div><hr />
