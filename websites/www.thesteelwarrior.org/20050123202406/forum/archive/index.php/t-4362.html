<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dvorak</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, thanks in advance for your thoughts...<br />
<br />
I have currently done enough adventures in EF to get AngerII and enough total adventures to get two or three of those little disgust stones or whatever they are called.  I weild a GBoS and BoC and have pretty good agro, but there is always room for improvement.<br />
<br />
My question:  Should I wade through another 10-12 adventures in EF to get anger3 (and only the one I would imagine) or use some points and put two anger2 augments on my GBoS and BoC?<br />
<br />
I currently have 1500 points or so spread out in all the adventures, with 510 being the highest in EF.  The other adventures have not unlocked anything I would reall want and I am getting sick of just sitting LFG in EF with the auto reply &quot;Thanks for the offer, but I am really looking for an EF adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

You're crazy to turn down groups for that reason. Get your groups where you can. Adventure points will come, and points in other themes are never wasted. If you do adventures whilst waiting for the elusive EF group, you may well find you'll have enough points for two angerIII aigs when you get there.<br />
<br />
The other point is it's a lot easier to guide a group towards EF once you're actually part of the group, rather than turning everyone down if they don't do exactly what you want. Most groups are fairly mobile as to which theme they do, and you may find you'll have a couple of Guks and a MM already lined up when you join, but after a couple of adventures, you'll have as much sway as anyone in determining where to go next. Better to do 2 Ruj, 1 tak and 1 EF, than to sit LFG for 3 hours, no?</div></div><hr />

b) always take any ldon adventure, in the end it will be a moot point which ones you did first cause you'll have the same gear in the end (possibly more points since less lfa time)<br />
c) once it's unlocked you won't need to press EF so /shrug</div></div><hr />

I put anger2 on my GBoS and I love it but I'm already planning on replacing it with anger3, not right away but definitely somewhere down the road so I advise you to hold out for the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dvorak</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice, its all pointing towards waiting, but with my play time ( have had Dvorak for 2+years) I get 3-5 adventures done per week.<br />
<br />
Guess I was falling in love with the idea of spamming Rage during fights with the chance to proc it once on an 18 delay weapon and twice on a 20 delay weapon.  <br />

Thanks guys,<br />
