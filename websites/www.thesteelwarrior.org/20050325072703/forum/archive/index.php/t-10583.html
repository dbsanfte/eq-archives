<br />
I have a quick on the inner workings of the LDoN System.  At my current level, 57th, I would need about 48 LDoN successful missions to grind out the 2 Yak augments.<br />
<br />
My question is this at what point can I draw points from other LDoN's to help offset the mind numbing thought of 48 more LDoN Grinds?  I know that I will not be able to get 48 missions in Lowest Guk with my guildmates before they will riot.  But if I only need like 20 missions and then can draw the points from other LDoN's that would be much easier to get people to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Then you can use your accumulated points from any theme to purchase any item at that value or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the type 4 yeksha aug (slimestone fragment of shock, I think) is lore, so if that's the one you're thinking of, you can't have two.<br />
Anger III out of Mir is not lore, but heh costs 1150 points.<br />
<br />
The general answer to your question is, I think, this:<br />
All the points you get for wins in LDoNs go into one pool. All your purchases draw from this pool.<br />
But, to buy a specific item/augment at a camp, you must have earned enough points at that specific camp to &quot;unlock&quot; your ability to purchase it.<br />
So, if the Augment of Greater D'oh! (procs Rage of Homer) comes from a Guk merchant for 100 points, you need to have earned 100 points in Guk to get your first one. If it's not lore, though, once you earn 100 points in Guk you can use the 1,000 points you've earned in Mir to buy 10 more.<br />
If, on the other hand, you have 90 points in Guk and 1,000 in Mir, then no Homer for joo.</div></div><hr />

You might consider camping that Ykesha proc from the bloodfields and using that until you get a few more levels and can get more points per win.</div></div><hr />

Your information has just saved me a bunch of time, there are 2 Augs that can be earned in Lowest Guk.  <br />
<br />
Slimestone Fragment of Dread - 760pts - 125DD and Stun<br />
Slimestone Fragment of Shock - 510pts - 100DD and Stun<br />
<br />
From what you are telling me is that I just need to earn the 760 and then I can use points from any of the others to buy the 510 pt augment.  That saves a boatload of time.  People always seem to want to do the Butcherblock LDoNs so much more.<br />
<br />
Brutul:<br />
<br />
I did not realize that Bloodfields would not turn me into a stain on the ground at 57th.  I will have to drag a few of the higher level peeps I know to get that augment.<br />
<br />
Is there a chart as to the points earned per level?  I have the highest person on the last Ldon I went on and I earned 22 points.  I thought it was sad, but everyone else I talked too seemed excited.<br />

Thank you also for your information.  I had heard that exact same information from a guildmate, but she was not sure, so I came here for the lowdown.<br />

Last I remember, it was 51 points doing an easy at level 65, if all members were that level or lower. Hard was 107?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hof,<br />
Yep. You get 760 points and you can get both if you have 760 in Guk + 510 anywhere else.<br />
Here's this, though you may already have it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fjalarr</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why on earth did you want ykesha augs? Oh yes, you wanted to do more damage, hmm. I guess you understand that playing a war is the wrong class for dishing out damage. You might consider the anger2 aug from everfrost ldon. The recommended level for the aug will decrease all stats including damage for the stats on the weapon equipped until you reach that level.<br />
<br />
Say for instance you equip an ldon ykesha aug and its recommended level 65 and you are 51. Your weapon that is equipped with it might have about 20% less stats. Soo, for a 10 damage weapon its now 8 damage. Say you have a 20 damage weapon, its now about 16 damage. Say you have a 50 damage weapon, its now 40 damage.<br />
<br />
The reduction of stats is not so bad when you reach closer to the recommended level for the item. These augs (ykesha) make your weapon a recommended level weapon. If you want further ideas on how this effects you, go look up some weapons in the bazaar and see how recommended level 65 affects a weapon at your level. <br />
<br />
I would suggest the ykesha 100dd and angerII augs. I had them both for awhile and found angerII was better aggro on both weapons. I thought that ykesha would be a nice damage aug and aggro, but the necros and wizards found my proc damage amusing at best. You may soon realize that you are no longer level 10 and everyone can deal out the damage. There are damage classes, with AA you can do some ok damage. The DPS classes with some AA do booku damage.<br />
<br />
Get the copper/bloodsworn and put anger2 on em, you set. There is a nice anger proc weapon from the dragon in POI. Its a raid mob, drops cord hilted spike driver (no drop) and with a ykesha aug , youd get anger and damage and stun. That's the holy trinity of aggro procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ykesha is generally accepted to be equal or greater aggro then A2, before the dd portion is even considered.  A2 is 510 pts, 100damage Ykesha is 510 pts. The only reason I can see to buy A2 is if you have 510pts in EF, you don't have 510 pts in SRo and you don't plan on doing any more LDoNs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oh man, where to begin....<br />
<br />
I dish out lots and lots of melee damage.   As a matter of fact, it runs from 240-280dps undisced normally with normal buffs.    When I'm going Balls to the Wall with maxed out offensive buffs, I can pull up to 540DPS.     In guild parses I am ALWAYS in the top 10 in terms of DPS and usually in the top 5.   I don't know for the life of me why you think that a class who has in our description &quot;Also able to deliver heavy damage to their enemies&quot; should voluntarily restrict themselves or think of themselves as anything less than a class which lives up to it's description.   <br />
<br />
Second, as someone else pointed out to you, Ykesha is really solid aggro, with the side benefit of doing damage.  There is no negative to doing damage that I know of.   At the level of the poster (57), he's fighting mobs that Ykesha augs will also stun (up to level 55 mobs), to help him prevent heals/gates, etc.    Anger any number except that on the Darkblade will not interrupt anything.<br />
<br />
In short, you're right about the Ykesha augment with the rec level on it.   There's not a whole lot of difference between the 510 and 760 ykesha augs to justify a warrior upgrading.   I use 2x 510 ykesha augs on my epic, and am extremely pleased with the performance.   Spending the extra points would probably not be wise.<br />
<br />
Now, having said ALL that.... can the LDoN aug path, and focus on DoN.   The augs there rock, and the pricing is WAY better than in LDoN and it's more convenient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A post of Brutul's yesterday suggested the NDA had been lifted. If so, I'm wondering if you can say whether the aug system in DoN provides means by which players in their 50s can work toward getting the augs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">also wondering if theres an upgrade to anger3 there, or even an upgrade to ykesha, if so, i wont bother grinding out more LDoNs to replace my current ykesha aug until DoN...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately I have no idea what level you can start doing DoN or how the points scale.  I believe that it does adjust the difficulty of mobs based on your level like LDoN though.<br />
<br />
Yes there are upgrades to A3 and Ykesha there.</div></div><hr />

I don't have to grind out more LDoN's!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Exactly, now you have to start a whole new system of missions in DoN to gain shards ...   :rolleyes:   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard for the best gear from mission vendors you only have to win 7-10 missions, not 50 billion like LDoN required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are these missions the 2-3 group ones they were wanting us to focus on the past week? I&quot;m in Beta, but never could find a guild, and only once managed to find a group even.  Seems no one I know from my own server is in Beta so I spent most of my time so far exploring via invis or playing with the tradeskill armors..<br />
<br />
And does anyone know the min. # of people to get these missions?  If it requires at least 9 people or soemthing, those of us in the shrinking family guilds are probably going to be out of luck.  ( I can't imagine donig an LDON equivalent with 3x the number of pickup people  :o )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The missions are 1-group.  The one I did in beta we did with 4 people (War, Clr, Ench, Bst) and took about 2 hours (6 hour time limit).  With a couple DPS people it would have been much faster.   I am thinking it's gonna take around 10 wins to get a piece of gear but who knows where they will finally set it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jearom</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a level range requirement like LDoN for the missions?<br />
<br />
Edit: According to Rashere there is going to be a 10 level limit.  Details can be found here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=59777&amp;jump=true).</div></div><hr />
