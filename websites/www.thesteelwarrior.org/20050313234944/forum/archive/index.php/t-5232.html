<br />
I'm looking for greatest bang for the buck here and I'm basically clueless as to what is out there in LDON.<br />
<br />
I've got loot that is indicative of where my guild used to be before I left... working our way up to Quarm, I think we were at VZ the day I stopped playing.<br />
<br />
Should I look for an anger proc for my BoW first thing? More HP/ATK?<br />
<br />
Looking for both general tips on augment efficacy, and also locations I should concentrate getting adventures in with the killer augments there.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot,</div></div><hr />

3 Things:   <br />
<br />
1. You had the best magelo background in EQ, put it back.<br />
<br />
2. 40hp augs on Boots/Chest/Arms/Legs is a pretty easy upgrade.  10AC slots are easy to get from MM dungeon as well, and go nicely on face/back for time being.<br />
<br />
3. Your guild's P1 loot is probably rotting so you can prolly score a ring/gorget/earring pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it was the one with two chicks kissing...that was indeed the best one. :D <br />
<br />
Anyway, the 40hp augments are probably the most bang for your buck considering a non augmented BoW is still a grand agro weapon. Another alternative is augmenting the BoW with Ykesha; it's cheaper than anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found upgrading my BoW was one of the best things I'd done. I'd suggest running through Miraguls (Marble Sphere of Ire, 1150 points) or Guk missions (Slimestone Fragment of Dread,<br />
760 points), choose one and augment that BoW. More aggro &gt; less aggro, always. <br />
<br />
  While you're working on that, I'd suggest Mistmoore Catacombs until you have enough for the 10ac augment (Brilliant Blood Ruby of Prowess, 510 points) for your shoulders and cloak. Next in line is definitely Ruj missions for 40hp augments (Solid Coal of Prowess, 1150 points) for, well, everything else. <br />
<br />
  Here's a good searchable database for LDoN augments: http://www.squidbox.com/ldon</div></div><hr />

If you are going to try and hold aggro vs. other BoW'ed (or equiv) warriors, the anger proc might be needed, otherwise hp/ac imho.<br />
<br />
Really looking forward to what type of +endurance they are going to add to existing items, and if they will be putting in endurance focus augs... might want to bank up some points and spend em after the next patch (that's what I'm doing w/ AAs and APs anyway).<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

fixed the magelo background</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only other thing id say is consider your CHA.  either plan to get some of the time drops which have decent CHA like bert boots, armguards of the brute etc, or plump for some of the +10 CHA augments from ldon. cant remember which camp it is though.</div></div><hr />
