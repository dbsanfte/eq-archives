Yes I have bugged, petitioned and feed back. Last night I finally called EQ tech support and he suggested that I get as many as possible to submit the bug. <br />
<br />
What is the bug you ask...the Royal Attendant Helmet of Sand. For all other races the helmet is not visible. For barbarians it is. One of the reasons I got the helmet first was so that I would have a helmetless look. :/ And yes if I pop an illusion the helmet disappears.<br />
<br />
Its a small thing, but very easy to fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're saying that players that care about character look in EQ, played with barbie dolls? Players have different goals and criteria for fun in EQ. Since EQ isn't about player skill, you have to focus on things like item collection, level grinding, character looks, kill X boss, and so on. Every player have their own definition of game objectives and fun.</div></div><hr />

It also works for gear progresion (as its my haste item, and I got almost as much raw AC in the upgrade from the SS helm to that as I would have from SS BP to Sand's BP) looks were a small factor in the consideration. One of the strong points of the new models are their faces--and I wanted that to be seen.</div></div><hr />
