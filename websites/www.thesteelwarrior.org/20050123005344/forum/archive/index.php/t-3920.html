<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestions-<br />
<br />
Replace both bracers with Bracers of Benevolence.  (Hey, they're free!)<br />
Get skyshrine gauntlets, vambracers and greaves.  (65s resist the AEs much more often, in my experience.)<br />
As for the ears, I'd get a solstice or bloodmetals.  Or, since you say you camp in CT often, camp a pair of mosquito leg earrings.  While you are at it, bang out ND3 and PD3, and the rest of your defensive AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your legs are decent - not awesome but they've got 27ac, 45hp, and plenty of saves.  Your ear has zero pure hp.  So your most immediate upgrade needs are:<br />
<br />
Ear:  Something with hp.  The BEoE is a huge, huge upgrade over what you have.  No other single slot upgrade is going to yield over 70hp pure hp at the price you can get that earring for.<br />
<br />
Arms:  Again, no hp.  This should be your next upgrade after your ear.<br />
<br />
So yes, eventually you'll want more SS gear.  But to upgrade your Champions BP to a Myrmidon BP but not touch your earring doesn't make much sense.  <br />
<br />
Buy the Earring.  If you have access to SS gear, get the gauntlets.  They're 90hp.  Then get the Arms.  That'll give you a boost of 145hp total.  Your suggested SS gear above yield a hp boost of only 20hp over what you already have.</div></div><hr />

Killed about 100000000000000000 rages bud. No CoF ever.  <br />
<br />
I've killed only one, and he dropped one.<br />
<br />
I've also seen Ixiblat Fer drop a Cloak of Flames 2 out of the 6 times I've killed him.</div></div><hr />

Teh new version of Rage (the spawnable one) doesnt drop CoF anymore.. he was when they first made the change but they squashed that pretty quick.  <br />
<br />
Oh that sucks :(  Didn't know that.  The one time I killed him that I talked about above was pre-triggerable.  I saw the CoF drop off the old Ragefire that spawned in Skyfire (never fought him when he spawned in SolB).<br />
<br />
I guess it makes sense though.</div></div><hr />
