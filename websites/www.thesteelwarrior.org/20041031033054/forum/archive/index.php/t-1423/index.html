<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jazmyn637</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I was wondering if someone could tell me if this has any aggro at all: Silver Whip of Rage (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7023).<br />
<br />
I know its old school ToV, but I never thought about it in the past.<br />
<br />
I noticed that the new runic and rune weapons have a lot of aggro, and this proc is kind of similar.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have experience with this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's ok aggro, not wonderful but a good weapon overall<br />
<br />
!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jazmyn637</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG Iskandar!!!<br />
<br />
Hmmm, so its ok aggro?  Like what range would you put it in if you had to put a number of hate points on it?<br />
<br />
What are you doing here?  Hey are you gonna play SWG?  You only selectively respond to my messages :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say the proc is like 100-200 hate. It's a solid weapon for its era, good raw DPS + a decent proc. Vyemm does drop a better weapon though (Gaudralek).<br />
<br />
&lt; mod here<br />
<br />
not gonna play SWG, it would kill my computer =) you still just thinking about getting it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jazmyn637</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Iskandar is a moderator?  What is the world coming to? :eek: <br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the info on the silver whip of rage!  I was wondering, are you guys thinking of ever putting the weapons under the bunker aggro compendium in order or giving an estimate of hate on each weapon...  Its hard for me to tell sometimes how much aggro the weapons are actually holding with the SK hate line.<br />
<br />
Oh no, I'm gonna turn this into another which combo is best thread... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I trust you above many others, so can I get your opinion on this?  Which combo of the following would be best in terms of pure aggro: Ishinaear Xiall, Silver Whip of Rage, Greatblade of Storms, or Trident of the Deep Sea.  I am dual wielding this with a SoD in mainhand.  On paper the GBoS looks the best, but I've heard that it doesn't have high aggro?<br />
<br />
Based on what you told me I guess the hate factor for these would be Ish (50)? Silver whip (100-200)?  Trident (200)?  Greatblade of storms (200)? Or would a two hand greatstaff of thunder have higher aggro than any combo out of these?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'm debating on getting SWG.  This game destroyed my life enough already without needing another game that will take up another several years of my life... On the flip side, I just picked up a new top of the line desktop a week ago, so I am thinking of giving it a shot (or maybe I can actually now play EQ with some models on and clip plane above 10):D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They are in a rough order. It's hard to calculate exact aggro values for procs aside from Enraging Blow and the like, so putting values in an official list without empirical testing is dodgy at best.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps and lures are really low aggro, Ishinear Xiall's proc probably isn't even 50 hate. Either the Silver Whip or GBoS in the offhand would rock. A GSoT is a very good weapon, I'd grab one in addition to whatever offhander you grab just to have a good aggro 2h.<br />
<br />
Glad to hear you got a new comp! From what I hear SWG is more for the casual player so it may not dominate your free time. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GBoS is an incredible agro weapon for the difficulty of attaining it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ishinaear Xiall, Silver Whip of Rage, Greatblade of Storms, or Trident of the Deep Sea <br />
<br />
<br />
IX I do not have , no idea about that one,The whip was always looted by rangers =P<br />
<br />
I do however havea Greatblade of storms and it is incredible aggro and hasa great proc rate,Tirdent of the deep sea is ok Proc is almost always resisted though it does give some aggro.<br />
<br />
Like Iksander said,If yo doing Vyemm Go For Gaudralek,Even with Boc and Gbos I still use Gaud in most XP groups ,and I have used it while Maing Aow and similar mobs..it is a very very Decent Aggro wep and one of the best looking weps in game ot boot.</div></div><hr />
