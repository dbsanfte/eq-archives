We all know one of the primary issues with regard to balance is the aggro thing, and it is centered around the ability of hybrids (be they knights, rangers or beastlords) to use their spells to enable them to obtain aggro lock.<br />
<br />
What would happen if they drastically reduced spell aggro across the boards instead of coming up with a new gimick for us? <br />
<br />
I know the initial response of a lot of people is going to be something along the lines of &quot;wtf??? that would break it and give casters more impunity to chain cast!!!&quot; or &quot;it will break raid encounters&quot;, but really what would it do, aside from give us a better chance to maintain aggro? <br />

Over the last couple expansions, EQ has already seen a large switch from &quot;old school expertise&quot; to &quot;ease of play&quot; to enable new players to adapt and advance easier. The days of downtime for med breaks for chain casters are largely history. The chain casters can already chain cast: they just need KEI (available for a nominal donation if you don't have a chanter in group)and a paladin or SK to tank for them. For raids, even with warriors tanking, we already have things like AETaunt and debuff-then-camp strategies for handling some bosses. Casting aggro is at the point now where all it does is contribute to the marginalization and obsolescence of warriors. Reduce it, and really what else does it affect? Pet aggro may need to be adjusted to ensure the owner still runs some risk of soloing with their pet tanking and hybrid tanks get a bit of a backhanded nerf, in that they are no longer the only game in town, although they still have all the tools for aggro that warriors do in addition to their tuned down spell aggro.<br />

Just an idea but what do you guys think about it?</div></div><hr />

You're right, that will be the initial response, and logically so. And you are hitting the nail on the head on the response you expected. Break the game, by reducing aggro on all spells, to fix one class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes but think beyond that a bit: its already broken. Spell aggro was in place to provide an element of risk to nukers and healers. With the current way things are set up, the only time they are at risk is when a warrior (or in those rarer occasions a monk) is the tank. Hybrid aggro lock has reduced spell aggro risk to ZERO which is one of the reasons we are in this state today. And its not just in experience groups, although it is most prevalent there.<br />
<br />
SOE/VI has shown a great willingness to help newbies but not to implement any changes in the higher end game. Maybe something like this, which may be easier for them to tweak and implement (and possibly more &quot;friendly to the masses&quot;) can help us out. I don't think its the ideal fix either but it won't break things any worse that they already are...</div></div><hr />
