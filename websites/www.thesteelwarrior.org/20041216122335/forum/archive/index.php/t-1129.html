<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akila</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you are down the pit, there are 2 big archs (doors, whatever you call it) :<br />
<br />
-left one will lead you near Stables where Glykus is (silk pattern, rune and stuff, including splitblade of destruction)<br />
<br />
-btw both there is the room with the Diaku Overseer (drop chain mold, rune and stuff)<br />
<br />
-right one is the path to follow to reach Tagrin Maldric.You keep going forward all the time and you will reach a big door , inside is the forge of Tactics.<br />
<br />
Inside this forge, you have 7mobs to kill (4 wraiths and 3 diaku elite guards who hits harder than the mobs you met on the way).Then there is a door where Tagrin is along with another Diaku and Eriac who is indiff (he is the mob you need to hail in order to get the blood to forge RZ bane).<br />
Tagrin is KoS and you need to kill all the kos mobs of the forge area before engaging him (otherwise, they will add during fight, and you really dont want that).He AErampages, hits for about 800ish I'd say (long time didnt do it), has an ae fire based (not hard one) and his specificity is that he &quot;procs&quot; some pets named &quot;decorin blade&quot; (which drops another component for RZ bane) often, so you need to have some mezzers.They hit for 200 or 300.<br />
We did it before with 15 people and i am sure you can do it with less, but keep in mind that they can have around 6 pets or so to mez.He is slowable btw.<br />
<br />
We killed him about 12 times to get some plate bp mold, items and runes (and we made few RZ bane, which is not really necessary for RZ fight tho I'd say).<br />
<br />
Hope it helped.</div></div><hr />

When Tagrin is aggro'd 5 swords spawn in set locations.  If you kill one while Tagrin is still alive it will instantly respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking at single grouping this guy. Looks like he is about the same difficulty as Glykus (except Tagrin's AE is easily resistable) with the same add issues. <br />
<br />
Can the animated swords here be aggrod/kited like the piggies at the Glykus camp? <br />
<br />
Do the swords all spawn at once, and do they spawn close together or are they separated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd have to be really really REALLY good to single group him, kinda.  Getting him cornered helps.  The swords are like level 55 (?) and flagged as summoned.  This means enchanters, bards, and magicians can charm them.  You just have to watch to make sure that the AE rampage doesn't eat them up otherwise you're going to get a fresh spawn sword.  Swords can be aggro kited, but with the above information, they're much better used as dps.  Swords don't spawn all at once.  There's maybe a 5-10 second interval, and they don't aggro until Tagrin has aggro. ie; pull with a FD/fade class, pull Tagrin outside of the room, then lose aggro.  Swords will stay up for awhile.  You can get a couple of them CC'd right away.  We've done him with 9 non-elemental folks~</div></div><hr />
