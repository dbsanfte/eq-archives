Visit his website here (http://www.eqwindows.com) to get the latest version.  There are some gamma issues at the beginning, but hiting alt + enter fixed it for me (while staying windowed).</div></div><hr />

Someone said I need to Copy my EQ dirctory and rename it and load the second from there. I have never had to do that before. Can anyone confirm?</div></div><hr />

Regardless of this issue, you should run your second instance from a separate directory.  You will get a dramatic increase in performance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the past I've run one EQW &amp; the normal EQ client.  Are you saying it is better to run two seperate EQWs from two different directories?<br />
<br />
Two EQWs in different directoryes &gt; than one EQW &amp; EQ client?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The native EQ windowing mode does not play well with others, basically. EQW does a significantly better job of sharing video resources, which means it's superior for running just about anything that's not mostly text at the same time as EQ. Most importantly, 2 shots of EQW play together /much/ better than 2 shots of natively windowed EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQW isnt needed though if you use EQ Play Nice, if you run that before you load up your EQ's then it runs just the same if not better then if your running 2 instances of EQW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One reason I still use it, is that with the eq's windowed version, if you release the mouse, you can not control your char in game.  Though with EQW you can.  Also, if you run many programs, you can use ctrl alt s to switch back to EQ immediately, and not have to go through many programs with alt tab.  JSD also just introduced a few more good features, which you can find on his site.  And my link went to the main page, not sure how you got 2.35 and not 2.4 at first from that =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">regular eq so much easer then eqw.<br />
<br />
first rightclick toolbar and properties click the always on top box<br />
second in eq alt+o then go to the keyborad thing and set mouse relese to one key like &quot;r&quot; for release or &quot;m&quot; for mouse on all your accounts.<br />
third adjust windowede mod resolutions to your needs.<br />
<br />
you will prolly have to adjust chatboxes ect to compensate for the toolbar being on top all the time.<br />
<br />
in action press one key to relese mouse the click the window you want to do stuff in.</div></div><hr />

Other than skipping the file check at the beginning, I really don't see why people still use it.Native windowed mode in eq is complete garbage, eqw is like night / day in terms of usability and comfort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or, just not have your mouse connected to the eq mouse, and be able to control just as well while being able to click any other program.  I rarely have my mouse connected to eq mouse, which does not work at all on eqs version.</div></div><hr />

I am running Windows XP and when I am using eqw, sometimes my entire keyboard mapping will go wacky and it's almost like shift is being held down, because when I type everything is in caps.  Also, if I try to use &quot;/&quot; it comes up with a &quot;?&quot; instead.  From there I have to ctrl + alt + delete in order to get of the game and log back in.  It's very annoying.  Does anybody know a way around this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That has happened to me before, often I will press the up arrow (opens chat line), and just camp to fix.  I've heard of similar happening to non EQW users, so I'm not sure it's fixable via EQW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xexe xexe</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's nothing to do with eqw, it's something to do with Windows XP.  I have searched the web and still haven't found any useful information on how to fix this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also am running xp pro, and get the same issue. It's really easy to fix though.... just be sure you dont have a chat/text line open, and press the shift key. It releases EQ from shift mode or whatever, and you can go back to normal. This happens often when spamming /corpse or /loc, or anything using the Shift+UpArrow command. <br />
<br />
For example, if you're running around, talking to people, and then suddenly when you push the up key to run forward, all it does is do a pageup of your chat window, just push shift, and it should stop.</div></div><hr />

Switched to it recently as EQ's built in windowing has just gone st00pid on us lately - browser windows showing thru the window in full-screen, crashing on alt tab, and such.   Tho I prefer a true *fullscreen*, and I get a little video banding in EQW, performance as advertised has no substitue.  Why SOE can't get their windowing code right (did they rebuild the engine, or just dump it onto DX9?) is beyond my comprehension.<br />

I don't think this is an EQW issue or an XP issue, as we get this and similar craptastics with or without EQW running, on a Win2K platform.  Sometimes, mashing all the *invisible keys* (Shift, Ctrl, etc.) works.</div></div><hr />
