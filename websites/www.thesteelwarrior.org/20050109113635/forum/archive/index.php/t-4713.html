The value of the innate hp gap between warriors and knights is already low to non-existant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the mitigation bonus, you will (likely) get more milage out of the same HP as a knight. You'll have 10k warriors tanking like 10.5k knights. Right amount? No one knows yet, but the upshot of doing it this way means that a 7.5k cheal -also- benefits the warrior more than the knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO, Mitigation should be more of a focus than HP.  HP is still important but the thing that should set heavy armor away from cloth is simply negating damage.<br />
<br />
Any class should be able to stack on HP to make themselves more survivable.  But not every class should be able to actually face melee damage easily.  It seems that any class can break 7K HP.  This shouldn't mean they can tank but in EQ's HP centric view of things it means they have a good start at trying.  That is very wrong and should be addressed first before trying to figure out what are good levels of HP for any class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. <br />
500 hp. I'm shocked and awed. No Really. 500 &quot;effective&quot; hp is definitely worth giving up FD, LoH, HT, snare, paci, heals, Gather Shadows, stuns, and/or 3K crits.<br />
<br />
Are you a warrior, sk, or pally?<br />
<br />
I'm a warrior. I have about 3K naked, about 6K geared, and 8600something buffed. A similarly geared SK, I'm going to guesstimate (Going on mostly remembered numbers from the last time I did this) at about 2500 naked, 5500 with similar gear, and 8K buffed.<br />
<br />
500 is a much bigger difference when talking about 3K instead of 8K.<br />
<br />
With the plethora of 100HP (All tanks) gear out there- even before LDON- and the numbers involved in the buffs like Virtue, Focus, BSS, etc... A very significant portion of tank HP is now coming from the gear/buffs load out, not your level/class. Sorry I've been making noises about this since Lucy put up the test info on PoP buffs...<br />
<br />
Anyway, back on track, 500 hp when dealing with grind mobs that hit for 750-990 doesn't really curl my toes... 500 hp gap + 500hp &quot;mitigation effect&quot; still doesn't put wind in my sail. <br />
<br />
Trading All that utility for 1000 effective hp is not balanced.<br />
<br />
And that's before you get into the agro lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You brought up how hp centric EQ is... Mitigation plays some role, but not very much at all.<br />
<br />
The primary components for effective tanking are:<br />
<br />
Enough HP to live 10 seconds or more.<br />
<br />
Maximizing the time between CH's<br />
<br />
Agro Generation<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it.  Anyone with enough hp CAN tank.  But when talking about effective tanking, meaning Warriors and Knights- its going to come down to agro and CH Efficiency.  For warriors to be balanced their CH efficiency has to offset their agro shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Say in the RoK Era, that 500 (Which wasn't really 500 because knights had fewer items to compete with warriors for pure hp gear) point HP difference (approx 3000 hp for a midrange warrior) is about 16% CH efficiency difference.<br />
<br />
It stayed about the same in Velious<br />
<br />
Now we can hit SoL, and we can call it 5K for a midrange... now the efficiency is dropping to about 10%.<br />
<br />
Hitting PoP, and 8K tanks, 500 hp is 6%.  That's right. Our Innate HP gap now is so small efficiency wise, I worry it could be wiped out by the RNG.<br />
<br />
Shall we look at it a different way?<br />
<br />
Level 60 tank in RoK... 500 hp gap.  Krups were hitting for 110?  5 swings... at least 2, maybe 3 rounds if things went in the crapper.  Now?  Less than 1 swing, let alone a damned round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Aeka and Heimdall-RN, balancing from now on should be done in mitigation instead of in HP - That way we can still let spellcasters get some more HP's without ending up with TankMage syndrome. And they will be happy to survive a combat round too. :p<br />
<br />
Also, on the note of Plate Armor ... Clerics are a plate armor class, but seem to go down almost as fast as pure casters ... that's annoying for both the Clerics and the group. But, what I wanted to mention with Clerics, is basically that they are what we are without the mitigation.<br />
<br />
So plate armor alone definately do not cut it, which means a real lot of our mitigation lies in our defense skill ... which haven't been raised since Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I wasn't saying it should be in our mitigation.  I'm saying some of it could be... but you can't mitigate AE.  We should have a strong HP and mitigation advantage.  Just to give y'all an evil thought trying to make it plate, or AC for mitigation...  Pallies have Plate, and a Shield for more AC, and can crit undead for 3500.  If you base it on plate, or AC, there's no way we can compete with that.  Or their agro lock stuns, gate prevention...etc etc.<br />
<br />
Hey I'd have been all in favor of half the HP gain we got in PoP for everyone, and increased AC/ATK/Mitigation values in the combat system, but that would take an entire revamp of the game.  EQ is hp focused.  EQ will remain HP focused- therefore, Warriors need the HP gap to offset and balance out their total lack of utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i hate to tell you but time tankign is 90% ac and 10% hps since most mobs can one shot you or have a delay under 12 which is in essence a one shot since it will land 2 rounds between cheals on a no pause rot.  The fact that knights can effectively have more ac than warriors is more of an issue than the hps.  In fact if you look at knights and assume they should have 75% of our hps and ac they would be left at 7200 hps and 1600 ac roughly as calculated from the 9528 max hp pop magelo.  Guess fucking what, chain classes have that many fucking hps and ac unbuffed, thats how perfusely underpowered warriors are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">honestly, at the elemental level, warriors should have 2500 AC and 12000 hp.  This is what it would take to restore the balance of hps and AC between the tank class and the bastard-child tank classes.<br />
<br />
However, refer to my previous comments regarding knights and fellatio.  I'm not joking, its the only reaon I can think of to explain the absurd knight gear in game for the last 3 expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if Knights have 75% of our AC and HP at 7200 hps and 1600 AC, then they'd be utterly incapable of tanking anything that hits slightly than yard trash in phase 3.  Sure it looks nice on paper, you're looking at 9000ish HPs buffed and probably 1800 AC, and any heavy melee Time God will slap you into a crater in the ground before you know it.   That's why the balance is not at 75/75 it's more like around 85/85 to 90/90 that'd produce reasonable tanking abilty for Knights, who ARE supposed to tank.<br />
<br />
To put it simply you don't deserve 12000 HP and 2500 AC.  If you think you do, you're fooling yourself.  Maybe the Knights do not deserve 98/105 of our tanking ability but this doesn't mean you're entitled to somehow be immune to melee damage, which is what 12000/2500 AC is for all practical purposes.  I think 5% straight damage reduction is more useful than 5% more AC so this tips the balance in the right direction.  Now get rid of the Knight's ability to use a shield for free and you're probably looking at 95/95, which is actually needed to just be viable in tanking when stuff starts hitting for 3k+.</div></div><hr />

Hp is meaningless compared to mitigation, and the mitigation change means that we have the inherent advantage without having to retool EQ in terms of HP.  It was a streamlined and elegant way to adjust the gear issue, one which will always go a long way..</div></div><hr />

<br />
AC for sure has an effect.  The problem is it seems to work favors long fights.  For the skirmishing I see all over EQ that is an unusable bonus.<br />
<br />
I too often see situations at the elemental where an Enchanter dies in a blink.  But I die in 5 seconds without heals.  Both of us, with out heals, seem to die in the same time frame.  No more than a speed bump on the way to the next target.  Explain to me the bonus of plate again?  Complaining about the HP gap is squabbling over half seconds.</div></div><hr />

Even though it decreases the chance of it happening, you still have to heal for the worst. If ac had some sort of effect on max hit, it'd be much more significant. I personally give ac a pretty high rating when choosing gear, but the worst case scenario stays the same. As it is, hp is the only thing that matters for raid mobs, to a point, then ac is just a bonus for mobs that won't kill you instantly. Perhaps one solution would just be ac decreasing max and min hits by some small amount every X ac increase beyond some point. So there would be an increase in survivability for choosing ac over hp.</div></div><hr />

Holy fuck only 9k hps and 1800 ac?  Try about 1850 ac and 10k hps with paladin self buff but shit i guess a 10k tank with 1850 ac cant off tank anything can they?  In fact we cleared all of time the first time through, which took a few weeks but at the end of the clear i had 10100 hps and 2k ac.  And that was everything including quarm.  But no knights cant tank yard trash in tier one or tier 3 with that can they?  In fact they would be utterly useless right?...well wouldnt they?  I hope you realize you are full of shit and you just proved that at 75% knights would be more than effective at off tanking, and no we dont use any knights to tank time gods, so that battle is over before you even start it.</div></div><hr />

Have you set foot in plane of fire?  Firetail, the first elemental dropper is quad 3500 rofl.  I hate to tell you but no tank in eq has 14k hps raid buffed so what do you rely on?  I wont even get started into talking about time until you tank something that hits for some damage and get a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">75% of our HP isn't 7200 unbuffed.  That'd mean warriors have 9600 unbuffed and that'd put them at about 12K buffed.  That's about 75% of a warrior with all LDoN upgrades, but certainly not 75% of a PoP warrior.<br />
<br />
If you first cleared Time with 10K warriors their unbuffed HP would be probably around 8K.  75% of that is 6000, that'd be about 8200 or so factoring in the difference between AoC + Virtue versus P9 + Kazad.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to see anyone tank any Time god with 8200 HP and win reliably.  <br />
<br />
My point still stands, 75% of Warrior HP for the expansion we're designed for isn't remotely close enough to be viable tanking.  Warriors were hitting around 11K with PoTime gear so add another 1K HP, that still leaves you 9200 HP which is not something you'd do PoTime comfortable with.  You can win if you try at it long enough but it's just downright silly to do something like that.  You say that you can clear Time with 10K Warriors and that's about 90% of the HPs of a top end Time warrior.  So, like I said, you need to have about 90% HP/AC to even tank reliably.  75% just won't cut it, unless you're talking about 75% of someone who can trivially tank the content.<br />
<br />
In response to the other post about how AC isn't useful... let me know where I can find another 5000 HP so I have zero possiblity of getting one-rounded by Quarm.  Do you think when people tank Quarm they just hope they'll get lucky long enough to win against a mob that can potentially do 16000 damage in one round?</div></div><hr />

<br />
now that we got out of the way...<br />
<br />
Warriors are getting a LOT with the melee changes, I Personally think its bordering on too much, but overall it seems pretty good... <br />
<br />
If you improve (or nerf others) every single conceren about a class, it will make them overbalacned compared to other class's (remember how knights got powerful in first place? Few were concerne at a bunch of small changes over a long period of time, asking for even more changes now is not only a bad idea in terms of game balance. (if you change too many variables in an &quot;experiment&quot; it is hard to gauge what caused the differences, or event predict the outcome) but also - I think too much, and will just shift places, which is not what is best, balance is good, not well we sucked shit so now you have too too bullshit.... (remember that Warriors got into current posistion not by nerfing of own class - but (knigh}itemizatin and improvements of others w/o improvement of their own...<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating big changes for knights - or any at all - atm with these current changes (to warriors  I think we're (knights) still  pretty balanced. Just pointing out that if every single concern or perceived imbalance is fixxed, the total sum of the changes is more then what is needed.<br />
<br />
oh cool noticed this is warroom so hopefully people wont be too harsh &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't matter who you stick in front of these; if it isn't a Warrior doing defensive they will be dead in seconds. Once again, what is the advantage of plate AC if Reparm kills me, the Enchanter, and a Ranger in a little more than 1 strike?</div></div><hr />

It's not a chnace at getting maybe hit a little less. It affects every single hit a mob lands on the warrior. Therefore it is a critical change because it stacks with defensive making a warrior effectiveness when tanking substancialy better than a knight's.<br />
<br />
And spell mitigation is called &quot;spell shield&quot; but I can't comment from memory alone on the availablity of spell shield items for warriors vs knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that's being a little ridiculous.    Plate tanks are simply put... better than non-late tanks because they mitigate better and have more HP for the most part.   What this means is that you raise the bar at which the 1-rounding occurs.   Just because it can happen to anyone when he gets lucky, his window of &quot;luck&quot; is much smaller with a plate tank tanking than with a non-plate tank tanking... trust me</div></div><hr />

There is no decernable effect against experiance mobs at your level.<br />
<br />
In addition, against mobs like Quarm (remember 'twas a Paladin tanking Quarm that started a lot of this hubbub bub) that do most of their damage from spells it does 0, zilch, nada.<br />
<br />
DI=19 might be more useful as MT against raid mobs, but maximum HP's have usefulness too, especially as Warriors don't always MT and AE damge can hurt ya's too.<br />

Doesn't Survivability = avoidance + mitigation + maximum HP's??<br />

He melees for 3850.  It's not as much as it appears since he's slowable but I can guarnteed you 99% of the time when a tank dies from him it has absolutely nothing to do with the spells he's casting.  <br />
<br />
As for xp mobs, taking one DI of damage is one DI of damage anywhere.  If it is somehow 'insignificant' that only implies you were already doing fine anyway.</div></div><hr />

My recollection was he put out a big unresistable DD and a very nasty DoT neither of which could be mitigated. The few times he hit me, I wasn't all that shocked by the damage. Maybe I was real lucky (Eeep you mean he might try to hurt me??!)<br />
<br />
My point is that AE Damage, targeted DD, etc. is very common with boss mobs. D=19 is greater survivability vs. melee, but not the kind of universal survivability found in a big HP pool and sufficient time to re-fill it.<br />

I suppose if you get unlucky you can take a 3K DD right after a fairly bad round but with good resists the chance of that happening is pretty low.  His dots are powerful but it's nothing that can kill you when you've a CH chain behind you.</div></div><hr />

Actually one of the top Pallies on my server has about 8200hp and 2124 AC.  Pre Buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a warrior is mobs target, and DI is rolled a 20, make it 19,<br />
<br />
or is it If a warrior is a mobs target subract one DI, except if DI = 1, then keep one (or is it 0-19, i have yet to see anyone state this but i might have missed it)<br />
<br />
Seeing a histogram of DI VS warrior on Production VS Test would be pretty interesting if someone had it, of cousre you'd have to have similiar equipped and AA'd warrior - and target.<br />
<br />
Anyways One reason I think they are reluctant to change HP formulas too much, is a personal beleif that most mobs have a  HP threshold, that once passed, they become signicetly easier to tank. (IE many people say once you get 11K tanks TZ becomes signicently Easier to Tank) IF you made a universal upward shift of HP, it would make many encounters easier, and reduce the amount needed to farm (Yes technically as you can tnak mobs pretty easily given a perfect CH chain, but at least in my experience, a perfect CH chain is fairly rare, between human error, lag, etc etc, two, or three rounds of damage taken is not a horribly rare occurance) (The HP threshold that i previous stated is the point where you can semi reliably survive those mistakes in chain, or where it reduces the overDamage (damage past the tanks HP) to a point where DI can trigger more reliability.<br />
<br />
If I had the game was being designed from the ground up again, I would definatly advocate a larger gap in both AC, and HP between Warriors and Knights, however imo  the problem is far too built into the game to change at this point.</div></div><hr />

Argue about the numbers all you like - personally, i think adding a flat 10% hp bonus to warriors is the simplest solution - but the fact remains:<br />
<br />
the tankability gap, the purpose for which our class existed, is gone. <br />
<br />
and all the toys in the world wont change that - only HP will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I signed up for this class specifically because I wanted to be the undisputed best at one thing - tanking.  I didnt want utility, I didnt want options, I didnt want dps.  I wanted to be the hands down most sturdy motherfucker ever to stand in front of the mob.  I wanted to take hits so well that healers did a double take and asked &quot;Is that mob even hitting you?!&quot;  I wanted to laugh at trains because I had serious doubts that they could reduce my HP to zero before we did the same to all of them.<br />
<br />
(My previous characters, a druid and chanter, started before kunark, had both focused on avoiding taking hits.  Now I wanted to focus on relishing those hits, eating them up and laughing).<br />
<br />
And early in velious, when I started this char, that was a pretty damn good description of my class.  People would say things like &quot;Paladin? hell no, get us a REAL tank! (warrior)&quot;<br />
<br />
In short... One-Trick Pony is exactly what I wanted.  I didnt ask to be an endurance-using hybrid, I didnt ask for dps, I didnt ask for utility.<br />

I Just.. Want.. My .. Hps.. Back.</div></div><hr />

I guess I'm frustrated with the simplistic view of defense in the game.  You prop something up out there and spam heals at it at the appropriate moments.  There comes a point with this simplistic scheme that you can prop anyone (or anything!) out there reguardless if their class was meant stand in the face of melee combat or not.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is supposed to be as course effect as Avoidance.  As the days go on I am never surprised to hear about what classes are tanking harder material because HP and Avoidance clearly work while Mitigation only so-so.  So what is the value of Mitigation defense if it offers no real tangable value unlike Avoidance or just plainly avoiding melee contact all together?</div></div><hr />

It's not just Reparm. Many bosses do unresistable procs, DD, DoTs, etc. DI=19 is a narrow survivability advantage that does nothing against equal level experiance mobs and nothing against unresistable caster-like damage.<br />
<br />
There is only one way of giving Warriors an across the board survivability advantage. They need a significant innate HP advantage and Clerics need a bigger CH.<br />
<br />
The advantage to a Warrior inate HP advantage is that as the game progressed and as Knights gained enough HP's they could MT mobs that once required Warriors. I think this is extremely desireable. It does mean however that the Warrior innate HP advantage has to be approximately the number of HP's a Paladin can gain from the best equipment in the previous expansion to the best in this expansion. 400 HP's is clearly not enough.<br />

Battleblade I think you're right about the Innate HP gap needing to scale up from expansion to expansion, but I think more than just the Knight upgrades need to be factored into that scale'ing.  We're where we're at now because they did just what you said.  <br />
<br />
We have kept the same numerical gap since Kunark.  But the ratio of Gap to Total, and Gap to DPS received hasn't scaled.  We had a 500ish lead in Kunark, and we still have a 500ish lead.  PRoblem is that went from a 15% gap to a 5% gap.  It went from 2 rounds of combat to one swing.</div></div><hr />

Mitigation is &gt; hitpoints, I dont' know how I can be any more clear, precisely because it scales, and will always be there regardless of equipment, and it deducts from the percentage based on the mob you're fighting.</div></div><hr />

If in several of the most &quot;brutal battles&quot; in the game boss mobs use unresistable procs, DD, and DoTs (and they do) and these can't be mitigated or avoided then a meaningful hitpoint advantage is required if Warriors are to retain a suvivability advantage.<br />

When you can take more damage in a round than what CH can heal for, it's more important to reduce the damage taken each round, not have more HPs.  <br />
<br />
It semes like a lot of people are still stuck in the Luclin mentality.  Mitgation is better than HPs now by far, and from what I understand it's 5% reduction on hits across the board.  The developers said defensive went from -45% to -50% to account for the new warrior innate bonus.  Last time I checked defensive doesn't drop a mob's damage to DI 1 to 10, it just divides DI by 2 and you take the normal distribution from 1 to 20.  So assuming that this 5% mitigation works the same way as defensive, seeing that 5% was added to defensive, it'd seem to suggest that we just have we have new DI = DI * 0.95 and take our usual DI = 1 to 20 distribution.  Ignoring DB to simplify calculations, this is a straight 5% reduction on damage taken, which translates to at least 5% more HPs versus melee.  With DB factored in I'm guessing it's somewhere between 2 to 4% damage reduction based on your AC and mob DB/DI (more AC the less effective mitigation helps, and higher DB/DI means less damage kmitigated).</div></div><hr />

<br />
There isn't really a mob that I'm aware of that has a nasty spell based damage that doesn't ALSO come with big melee.   This means that when tanking, we'll STILL have the hitpoint advantage due to mitigation (i.e. the melee damage that we save without having a 20 on the DI roll will allow us to survive the procs better than anyone else).  If you can point me to some mobs that does 100% of their DPS output (i.e. no melee), I'd be interested in seeing it, otherwise, the mitigation advantage still stands as a clear advantage.</div></div><hr />

Quorm and Grieg. If you'll wait awhile, I'll list 10 boss mobs. If you are not the MT the melee damage you receive is quite minor. Warrior survivability advantage is not applicable only when you MT.<br />
<br />
I think there's a lack of communication going on.<br />
<br />
Currently I have a 5% Hit Point advantage and a 0% mitigation advantage.<br />
<br />
SoE will be changing this to a 5% Hit Point advantage and a 4% mitigation advantage against raid-level mobs excluding certain types of damage in order to balance us.<br />
<br />
Frodilin states that the 4% mitigation improvement although limited is better in the long run than simple hitpoints (correct me if I'm wrong).<br />
<br />
I believe it's not a case of either or. A 4% limited mitigation adjustment does not put us where we should be and does not even give us a 4% survivability advantage against existing raid mobs.<br />
<br />
Now that 4% limited mitigation advantage might well be SoE's best offer and Frodlin may prefer that Warriors were happy with it instead of seeming ungrateful.<br />

I hope I didn't misinterpret any of this and I'm surely not intending insult. But frankly, that's how I see it.<br />

I agree that's what he's saying.  I just don't agree I should be happy with that.  I can understand his thoughts that hp doesn't matter anymore.  Facing a quad 3500 mob I might too, but I'm not there yet.  I'm more interested in more of the main stream balance rather than the high end balance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason mitigation is not a good replacement for HPs is very, very simple:  mitigation scales up on big, hard hitting raid mobs, but it scales DOWN on exp mobs.<br />
<br />
In other words - 5% mitigation boost will help enormously against Reparm, but will do NOTHING against exp mobs.<br />
<br />
Conversely, a 1000 hp boost does something against reparm (although this is almost negligable, given the fact that we are already, both knights and warriors, well above the CH cap)... However, thats fully an extra MINUTE you could survive against exp mobs/trash mobs, at minimum.<br />
<br />
To summarize: %-based mitigation will help greatly in raids, and not at all in exp groups.  Raw HP would help little on raids, but IMMENSELY in exp groups/trash mobs.<br />
<br />
If we are to be the best tank in the game, we need BOTH.  Not one or the other - BOTH.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, we are not supposed to be the best tank in the game... well, in that case the Developers are clearly fucking retarded, since that is the entire reason for our existence, and talking sense into them would be impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's a 4% mitigation advantage for a 10K Warrior? 400HP's. Now add that to our supposed 400HP advantage (whee! another 4%!) and the good news is against high level raid mobs that that hit for 2-3k a very well equipped warrior has a 1/3 of a hit safety buffer.<br />
<br />
Now if you enjoyed watching Knights MT Quarm, you'll love this part. Except DI=19 does not help against unresistable DD's, DoT's and Procs. So for mobs like Quarm, the  DI=19 mitigation advantage doesn't apply to a big chunk of damage. Your 8%  survival advantage heads toward your maximum HP advantage at the speed of light.<br />
<br />
So if the Knight next to you has a couple of upgrades that you don't, he might as well tank Quarm.<br />
<br />
Quarm may be a particularly egregious example because the DI=19 survivability advantage is eroded on top of the effects of itemization, but itemization affects all MTing.<br />
<br />
That's why that guild (forgot the name, sorry) had Paladins, Shadow Knights, and Monks tank PoTime mobs. Because the Warrior survivability advantage is immaterial when itemization closes the gap and your CH Rotation, Vie, and curing mean everything.<br />
<br />
And given Ornate molds are tradable, there no reason this wouldn't apply to pre-PoTime boss mobs as well.<br />
<br />
Now here we have a suggestion that a Warrior limited 4% mitigation improvement (remember to discount for unresistable DD's, DoTs, etc.) is the long term solution to the lack of a significant Warrior survivability advantage.<br />
<br />
You liked seeing non-Warriors MT new content boss mobs? Get used to it. 'Cause this is not a sufficient upgrade to overcome the the factors that allowed that to hapen.<br />
<br />
We'll only barely mention poor Timmy the Warrior who never raids and will never see a 4% mitigation advantage from DI=19. Sorry Timmy - you don't count.<br />
<br />
Now it's possible I'm over reacting a lot. But I tell you true - the knightimization problem as discussed by Furor and Frodlin for 6 months or more and underlined in capital letters when Knights started tanking PoTime gods is not solvable by DI=19 alone.<br />

You got to be kidding if you think Quarm does most of his damage via spells.  He melees for 3850.  It's not as much as it appears since he's slowable but I can guarnteed you 99% of the time when a tank dies from him it has absolutely nothing to do with the spells he's casting.    <br />
<br />
You are dead wrong here.  Quarm is 3800 max wo shielding, with raex bp he is 3770.  With turgurs his delay is 51 so you need somewhere around a pause 35 rot to heal his melee.  He has fairly high attack but he will not one shot you ever.  I have never, not once been one shotted by him because with vie he simply isnt powerful enough.  When i do die it is because i eat a large round and get unlucky on a 3k ae.  Do you think quarm is hard because of his melee? no he is hard because his aes rape dps and make it a long fight.  <br />
<br />
Anyway on to my original point, knights are so used to having a large amount of hps and ac they are delusional and dont realize that they can easily do the same job that they do now with properly scaled hps and ac.  And yes if you saw the 75% numbers as i said were off of the 9528 max pop hp magelo, pre ldon so you are correct in your assumption.</div></div><hr />

I may be wrong, but I am very sure that Reparms proc IS resistable with 500 FR. I have seen myself resist a spell when tanking him. And I know no other spells he casts. Also Spell shield and Bulwark of Alendar, also can cut down alot on the damage from the proc.<br />

The only thing that ever kills any of our tanks, besiudes the clerics, on Reparm is a double tap proc in one round... And we do not have 10k+ tanks..</div></div><hr />

I shouldn't have mentioned named raid monsters.  They always follow different rules than stock monsters.  I should have stuck to just exp groups.  I am concerned seeing Shamans running around getting away with tactics I would use.  I see Rangers tanking things I wonder why there isn't more of a penalty.  A combination of things have conspired to muck up a the system to the point I wonder if there is any real bonus to use low damage deal, heavy armor classes at all.  The Justice Executioner trial you would rather use a Ranger than a Warrior.  How long will be before this spreads?<br />
<br />
The reason why I meantioned mitigation increases is that it makes each point of HP you have now that much more valuable.  Theoretically...after all with the spell spewing monsters that are running around against xp groups it once again seems to fall back to slathering on the HP reguardless of class.  As much as some of you resent Knight tanking I turn around and classes right behind me nearly accomplishing the same thing with higher DPS.  A few hundred HP more won't fix anything.  Maybe a increase to actual plate mitigation will.</div></div><hr />

I can live with eating a 3K DD even if I can't resist at all (and I can, not to mention I also have 9% spelshield) if I don't have to eat any riposte at all.  At worse I take 3K extra damage every 30 seconds or so.  I'm certain I get riposted a lot more than mere 3K in a 30 second period while tanking.

Mitigation doesn't somehow scale down just because things are easier.  If they're hitting you for so few DIs on average that you can't notice the effect of additional mitigation than that just means the content is trivial, i.e. LDoN normal.  Of course you shouldn't expect much improvement on tanking things that are trivial, and of course you shouldn't expect other classes somehow suddenly unable to content trivial content, since that's what trivial means.

I think you're totally mising the point.... it's an advantage that scales up and down with the danger of the mob and it's completely independent of level of the game.   As a matter of fact, this change will do far more to help undergeared raiders than anything else that could be done because it is completely independent of gear or difficuly to attain, it's inherent.  It has the SAME impact regardless of gear.   Also, it's FAR more than &quot;having 400hp&quot;.<br />

But BB, the DI=19 DOES apply to a significant chunk of the mob's DPS.   I simply dont' know what the hell more you want, every mob that I know of that does a big chunk of spell damage ALSo does a big chunk of melee damage, and if you're asking for an across the board spell guard 4 AND a mitigation upgrade... or some smattering of hitpoints, I'm afraid you're asking in the wrong direction.<br />
<br />
So if the Knight next to you has a couple of upgrades that you don't, he might as well tank Quarm.<br />
<br />
Why should he?  Give me a reason why to choose a knight post-changes.   Just because he can?  The aggro &quot;advantage&quot; will have been pretty minimized, and warriors for the most part have pretty good sustained aggro, and frankly, they have very good sustained aggro by the time they've gotten to Quarm if you're talking about having farmed enough to have a Knight tank.   With the combination of the provoke line and the mitigation change, there is no longer any real reason to choose a knight for tanking bosses, and THAT is why they put it in the game.<br />

Quarm may be a particularly egregious example because the DI=19 survivability advantage is eroded on top of the effects of itemization, but itemization affects all MTing.<br />
<br />
That's why that guild (forgot the name, sorry) had Paladins, Shadow Knights, and Monks tank PoTime mobs. Because the Warrior survivability advantage is immaterial when itemization closes the gap and your CH Rotation, Vie, and curing mean everything.<br />
<br />
THAT is why they're changing mitigation<br />
<br />
And given Ornate molds are tradable, there no reason this wouldn't apply to pre-PoTime boss mobs as well.<br />
<br />
Now here we have a suggestion that a Warrior limited 4% mitigation improvement (remember to discount for unresistable DD's, DoTs, etc.) is the long term solution to the lack of a significant Warrior survivability advantage.<br />
<br />
Who said this?   Who?   Certianly not me.   Dont' make my arguments for me, I can make them perfectly well on my own.   My argument is that.... the mitigation change, coupled WITh the aggro change coupled WITH the taunt failure message coupled WITH openings coupled WITH unlinked discs will go a lot further than you think.   <br />
<br />
You liked seeing non-Warriors MT new content boss mobs? Get used to it. 'Cause this is not a sufficient upgrade to overcome the the factors that allowed that to hapen.<br />
<br />
I am speechless.... viewing ALL of the upcoming changes, how can you possibly say that warriors dont' have an advantage tanking bosses?   HOW?   What POSSIBLE benefit will there be to a knight tanking a boss?  The answer is there won't be any, and THAT is why the changes are being made.   Isolating one change and declaring it worthless on it's own and not viewed in the context of everything else is obfuscation, intentionally ignoring the facts so you can keep whining.<br />
<br />
We'll only barely mention poor Timmy the Warrior who never raids and will never see a 4% mitigation advantage from DI=19. Sorry Timmy - you don't count.<br />
<br />
Timmy will have an on demand aggro generation superior to Enraging blow thanks, starting at level 20.   <br />
<br />
Now it's possible I'm over reacting a lot. But I tell you true - the knightimization problem as discussed by Furor and Frodlin for 6 months or more and underlined in capital letters when Knights started tanking PoTime gods is not solvable by DI=19 alone.<br />
<br />
And it's NOT being solved by DI=19 alone, but I for one think it's simply wrong to put such a wide gap between warriors and knights in tankability AND close the gap between knight and warrior aggro significantly so as to put knights out of business.    That's WRONG and it's not balanced, it's vindictive, and I'm not interested in vindictiveness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe Warriors should have a modest HP% increase (6% of base HP's?) beyond that already provided by Alternate Advancement in addition to DI=19 to insure that survivability restoration takes place and the effects of knightimization are repaired in all environments and facing all mobs.<br />
<br />
Changes to survivabilty, aggro, and utility should be examined on their own merits. Warriors did not approach SoE and ask them for hybridization in exchange for giving up long standing survivability advantage or accepting inadequate aggro control.<br />
<br />
After a previous change we were once re-assured:<br />
<br />
After all of these changes, hybrids will not be able to deal out the damage of a pure melee class, with the possible exception of rangers, who might be able to get close. The warrior, monk and rogue will still out damage hybrids, and by a noticeable margin. That difference is in part what hybrids lose for the power of their spells.<br />
<br />
Also, warriors will always have the broadest selection of weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Warriors will still have a significantly larger amount of hit points.<br />
<br />
Their role as primary tank will not be endangered. - Absor 10/01<br />
Also, it's FAR more than &quot;having 400hp&quot;. <br />
Does the DI=19 change grant all Warriors at a minimum a 4% [4% of 10000HP = 400HP] reduction to all damage (excepting fall damage, death touch) or overall damage directed at them by all blue con and higher mobs?<br />
<br />
I ask this since for those mobs that output appreciable damage that is unaffected by DI=19 the reason to select a Warrior over another class to MT becomes based more on Avoidance and maximum HP's than mitigated damage that begins to become more equal.<br />
<br />
Also I believe Warriors should have a meaningful survivability advantage when MTing in an experiance group in any environment.<br />
<br />
Since you have stated:<br />
THAT [non-Warriors tanking current content boss mobs] is why they're changing mitigation.<br />
<br />
Will you go on record that after the DI=19 change either:<br />
1. Arch Overseers (or any other guild) will not be able to have non-Warriors tank any current content (PoTime) boss mob.<br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
2. SoE has assured you that itemization and the type of damage output of high-level boss mobs in future expansions will not allow other tanks to be interchangable with Warriors when tanking [then] current content high-level boss mobs.<br />
<br />
I want to make it clear, I'm not raising these issues because I'm vindictive. Now neither you nor SoE has to satisfy me or anyone else that DI=19 is the survivability restoration Warriors have requested. But, so long as I think Warriors should still have hard questions, I'm going to ask them if no one else will.<br />
<br />
However, if you (or anyone else) answers my questions without hedging, dismissive arbitrary responces, or tactics like refering to aggro control when discussing survivability, I do not believe further debate about this issue from me will be productive.<br />

<br />
No, I will not go on racord as saying either, because that was neither the goal NOR should it have been.   There was an interesting dichotomy which occurred during the AO tanking dilemma.   <br />
<br />
Monks tanked some bosses<br />
Paladins tanked some bosses<br />
Sk's tanked some bosses<br />
<br />
For the most part warriors were far less concerned about the monks tanking than they were about the Paladins and SK's tanking.   This struck many paladins in particular as an extremely odd type of hypocracy, but was entirely logical in my mind and the minds of many warriors.   The reason for this is that monks were no threat to &quot;replace' warriors tanking high end bosses because there wasn't an actual advantage which would cause the sudden ability to survive to be considered a &quot;superior&quot; tank to warriors.   On the other hand, knights did have something which did represent a threat to warriors in this department, and that something was stellar aggro generation, so much above warriors that once the threshhold of doable was crossed, it became *automatically* better done by Knights.   <br />
<br />
This is why none of these changes can be judged in an isolated fashion, because balance doesn't exist by isolating parts and comparing them against one another.   <br />
<br />
I dont' think the goal should have ever been, nor was it, to place warriors at a survivability threshhold that no one else was remotely able to cross because in reality, this has never really been the case in EQ, with 1 exception, when the Avatar of War was current.   No other mob in EQ &quot;couldn't&quot; have been tanked by a Knight when it was current.  Hell, all of Luclin could've easily been tanked by knights throughout the expansion, just no one did it, all of Velious with the exception of AoW.<br />
<br />
What you're in essence asking for is the AOWization of EQ.   Nothing outside of forced defensive rotations and tank switches will give warriors a &quot;sole survivor&quot; type of role, and I for one don't want that.    Maybe a mob or two where it exists is ok, but for the most part, I'd prefer a &quot;The warrior package is &gt; the Knight package for tanking the boss mob, not because the knight would instantly explode like a rotten blueberry underfoot, but because there's enough advantages for a warrior to offset the advantages of the Knight, who has their own roles on this raid&quot;.<br />
<br />
The totality of the package, including the unlinked discs and new aggro generation skills, alongside the mitigation advantage and the taunt failure message AND the openings give warriors back that &quot;He's the best choice&quot; thing without crippling Knights into oblivion, or turning every mob in EQ into a defensive rotation AOW style encounter.<br />
<br />
However, if you (or anyone else) answers my questions without hedging, dismissive arbitrary responces, or tactics like refering to aggro control when discussing survivability, I do not believe further debate about this issue from me will be productive.<br />
<br />
I will not allow you to parcel out parts of this and comparing each part as &quot;balancing or unbalancing yay/nay&quot; alone.    This really is about the big picture and it really is about the whole package.    I get every bit as frustrated at paladins who do this same thing with &quot;I dont' always use my spells, therefore you cant' discuss them in relation to balancing&quot;, and if you want to continue that as a basis for continuing discussion, then your choice to end the discussion by not being able to dictate terms is fine, but I'm not going to let off.    No single skill or skillset exists in a vaccuum, nor does the balancing of classes.  <br />
<br />
You cannot say &quot;This this this this and this skill are no damn good because none of them alone compensates for the troubles we've had, and I won't look at the big picture if it refutes what I'm saying about the little pictures&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK a Militis max'es for 583 is all I've found.  Assume a minimum hit of 100 since I can't find one of those anywhere and am at work again on a Saturday :(  Again.  :(  483/19= ~26  So.  Assuming a DB of 100, and a DI of 26 is a max hit of 620.  Not quite but pretty close.<br />
<br />
So 100+ (18*26)= 568<br />
<br />
620-568=52<br />
<br />
Now, lets not have our hypothetically guesstimated Militis proc anything, and assume he ALWAYS rolls the max DI every time, and always triples, every 3.0 seconds.<br />
<br />
52*3=156.<br />
<br />
We save 156 hit points per round.<br />
<br />
A Militis has what, 30-35K or so in HP?  We'll assume a full party can put out 600 DPS.  Obviously clerics and enchanters not using charm put out less, but Beastlords, rogues and so forth put out more.  I know one BST who says he can put out 200 on his own if he wants to go full out.  Ya know what.. lets just drop that to 450.<br />
<br />
35K/450DPS = 77.7777R seconds.  Call it 78.<br />
<br />
78/3= 26.<br />
<br />
<br />
26*152= 4056.<br />
<br />
A Shadowknight can sustain a 400 point life tap every 14 or so seconds, MANA PERMITTING.<br />
<br />
78/14= 5.5 or 5.  Rounding always against the knight's favor.<br />
<br />
So life tap damage UNMODIFIED, is 2K, and 2K in heals.  Assuming they ONLY go for straight life taps, and not their group taps, snares etc.<br />
<br />
4056-2000= 2056.<br />
<br />
Is 2056 hp over a 1.3ish minute fight worth it?<br />
<br />
Lets come back to that.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of 2 life taps lets toss in 2 Zevfeer's Bite. It has a 60 second recast according to CRgaming/Lucy, so in a fight lasting just over a minute they should be able to cast it twice.  That drops the Damage healed and dealt by 400 total.<br />
<br />
4056-1600= 2456<br />
<br />
However that also includes a 200 mana gain.  Again according to CRgaming/Lucy<br />
<br />
That's half of the CH 400 mana cost.  That's 3750 hit points per fight.<br />
<br />
4056-1600-3750=-1294.  That translates to a 1294 hp CH efficiency advantage for SK's.<br />
<br />
Before anyone wants to get into it over the numbers please Remember a few things:<br />
<br />
They're made up.<br />
Whever possible they were made up in the SK's favor.<br />
<br />
All rounding was done in the SK's favor.<br />
<br />
I know an SK won't be able to maintain that mana output forever.<br />
The mana gained from the Bite spells DOES relate to CH efficiency.(And it also hits your overall efficiency with mana for nukers, etc.)<br />
<br />
Again, they're made up, if you want to post the real DB and DI, and the real DPS of a full group we can work that in.  If you want to take a REAL SK's mana pool, regen, and FT and figure out what his sustained output in taps would be, be my guest.</div></div><hr />

Hold on a sec...<br />
<br />
The mitigation change isn't live yet, it's one of the many upcoming changes.   <br />
<br />
For some reason I think you're stuck in a warp of thinking that the only thing warriors are getting ont he 16th is openings.   This is not the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit:  I'm not even talking about the styles system.  I think its extraneous to any balancing, and I'd even be surprised to see it go live the same time as the mitigation and agro changes.  I fully expect it to arrive after those changes.  I even hope it does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets compare a warrior and a pally.<br />
<br />
Same mob, same numbers... 156 hp every 3 seconds is our mitigation edge.<br />
<br />
Pallys get a heal 1150 hit points, castable every 8 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
That's 9 casts.<br />
<br />
9*1150=10350<br />
<br />
4056-10350= -6294.<br />
 <br />
<br />
A 6294 point hp advantage to the pally.<br />
<br />
Same things... he can't put that out every fight, etc etc, mana costs, etc etc.<br />
<br />
But my point is being made.  1 step of DI isn't enough to balance even ONE COMBAT spell they have, let alone the rest of their utility that you can't ignore when considering balance because its part of the whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It may not be meaningful in relation to all experience environments, like LDoN normal, where when certain relatively low thresholds of mitigation are hit, not much more is needed. That's a generalized issue with mudflation. The space between warriors and knights will be sufficiently large. But the space between tanks in general and non-tanks should be larger, so that the environment isn't trivialized as fast, and rangers and beastlords don't end up being preferred tanks in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Non-tanks should never have gotten LR and ID in particular.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the change might not compensate for a paladin chain-casting his best combat heal -- but that's a pretty pointless comparison since no paladin is going to be chain-casting his best combat heal. If you're going to do that, why not compare the mitigation of a warrior in /defensive with the chain-casting paladin? That would be more fair.<br />
<br />
I mean, you even say paladins can't do this for long, but then seem to think you've made some point. You haven't. Knights *should* have pretty good discretionary power like that. The fact the all the warrior has to do is sit there to enjoy his mitigation advantage is worth something, too.</div></div><hr />

I think you and possibly SoE underestimate the importance Warriors place on HP bragging rights and &quot;unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I believe absolutely other classes should be able to tank boss mobs, I believe it should happen because one of their distinquishing characteristics make them the best choice not because knightimization powered them past Warriors.<br />
<br />
For Warriors, I believe those should be &quot;unmatched&quot; survivability and aggro control without using spells<br />
<br />
For Paladins, sustained aggro control without having to attack and wave healing<br />
<br />
For SK's the greatest ability to directly manipulate aggro (the biggest reason the Provoke line is wrong) and high DPS.<br />
<br />
You support the hybridization of Warriors and the end of their traditional advantages in both raids and in experiance groups vs. blue con mobs<br />
<br />
I have consistantly wanted the traditional advantages restored and to receive up to standard aggro control.<br />

<br />
Yeah the paladin example wasn't an example, just exaggeration.  <br />
<br />
I'm trying to decide if I really want to get into it enough to figure out how much the SK example- made a little more realistic by taking mana expenditures into account.<br />
<br />
How much does an SK regen on mana for the group.  How many fights will the SK have to Zev's Bite, how often, compared to how much DPS the mob puts out compared to how many fights our new mitigation will take to equal a &quot;free&quot; fight as determined by the clerics mana costs in a given fight.</div></div><hr />

In Brodda's parse, a knight and a warrior with similar AC both fought the same mobs -- and the warrior took 10% less dps. The cleric parse, when controlled for skill differences, showed much the same result. We do actually presently enjoy a small advantage, which will now be enhanced further, as it should be.<br />
<br />
BB, once the changes are live, there's absolutely no question warriors will be &quot;unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battle&quot;. I think the chief concern will actually be, are warriors overpowered?</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, so our hypothetical Militis hits 3 times for 620 on knights, and 568 on warriors.  We'll give him a kick solely on his DB, with a 0 interger.<br />
<br />
So one 3 second round is <br />
<br />
1860+100=1960 for knights<br />
and<br />
1704+100=1804 for warriors.<br />
<br />
His DPS is <br />
653.3R for knights <br />
and<br />
601.3R for warriors.<br />
<br />
78 second fight.<br />
50934 for knights<br />
and<br />
46878 for warriors<br />
<br />
Can we agree on a single round number for the CH to hit for?  Similarly equipped warriors and Knights having about the same HP?  Say 7200??<br />
7.07 CH's per fight for knights.<br />
6.51 for warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes 13 fights for our mitigation to earn 7 Free CH's- The number of CH's non mitigation would need.<br />
<br />
It takes 4 Zev's Bite to pay mana for 1 CH, and we were assuming 2 per fight.  So it takes 2 fights for an SK to earn a Free CH, 14 to earn 7 or a free fight.  However 48 Zev's Bite is also 3600 hp, half a CH.  So 28 SK fights is 2 and 1/7 Fights.  196 Fights = 15 Free fights.<br />
<br />
196 Warrior fights- at 13 per Freebie= 15.07 Free fights.<br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
Lets string out hte numbers here.<br />
19600 fights gets a warrior 7 Free fights, so for our mitigation to earn us a free fight, just 19600/7=2800 fights and.. Yup.  I'm wrong.  That mitigation on grind mobs just piles up fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you misunderstand the significance of our melee damage model. It describes the range of possible values, but not the relative frequencies of those values. We already know things like skill caps, AC, etc, affect those frequencies without affecting max hit. Warriors appear to get a relative bonus here, as the parses pretty clear suggest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Similarly equipped knights and warriors dont' have about the same HP, warriors have a natural 568hp advantage in identical gear, and they generally dont' use identical gear, it's most likely around a 700hp difference *after* mitigation</div></div><hr />

If you want the formula for max hp a knight can keep healed per fight, check out the PoN boards, I think my program should still be linked there somewhere...<br />
<br />
calculated max efficiency of any heal spell with any level of mana regen and and base size mana pool. (never got specilization checks for wis casters working, basically because of the randomness)</div></div><hr />

The problem being the way CH's are built adding to the warrior side doesn't do a whole lot of good except on raids, where it would be overpowered to add to it.  That leaves nerfing every class except warriors in order to balance it and I mean every single class, caster HP's are way too high as well.  While I actually think its a good idea I just don't see SOE doing it.<br />
<br />
The only other way to fix it is to completely rework itemization and/or AA which won't happen either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is an excellent point.  I was exping the other day and the group was yapping it up about what they were saving for and would like to see drop.<br />
<br />
Every person there, druids, clerics, monks, etc only mentioned hitpoints.    I thought &quot;Man, that's fucking stupid that this game has gotten to the point where hitpoints are the only thing of value even to druids and clerics, that there's not something else which they are interested in seeking after, that they'd get a 'trophy prize' like hitpoints&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the number I've heard was an innate 582HP advantage at level 65 with all AA's used not taking into account AoTC.<br />
<br />
And Frodlin, yer right about HP's being how everybody seems to keep score. Almost every time something drops the person recieving it if he makes an comment it's invaribly about HP's. It is somewhat amusing to hear an Enchanter proclaim, &quot;Woot!! 6916 HP's!!&quot; after a loot award<br />
<br />
Look at Magelo's sometime in high-level guilds. Rarely do you see a Paladin with FT15, maxed Wis, and Mana Preservation. Nope, ya see a 1H weapon and a shield cause that bumps up yer HP's.<br />
<br />
It is the universal tanking currency now that aggro is going to be no longer a factor.<br />
<br />
You like mitigation. Well, take a look at Warrior Magelos. Not a lot of +Parry or +Dodge or maxed resists. But a whole lot of HP and AC (we know that's mitigation against melee damage by another name but since it's Warriorly armor it's OK).<br />
<br />
Since Warriors really have only about a 300HP innate advantage after buffing, we can expect Paladins to focus strongly on HP's. With the DI=19 change it's going to seem necessary for those that want to MT. I imagine Paladins will generally exceed Warrior HP's in the near future. For what it's worth, those are pretty impressive bragging rights.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One small question here..<br />
<br />
I keep hearing that the 5% mitigation bonus wont be noticed outside of hard hitter raid mobs.<br />
<br />
Now, correct me if I am wrong here, but wont lowering the DI one level be MORE noticeable the more often the MOB hits you for lighter damage?<br />
<br />
NO matter what DI the MOB rolls, you reduce the damage by the same amount, so if he hits you for somewhere in his low end, the reduction is a greater percentage of the total. Or am I high? =)<br />
<br />
When I read about the 5% mitigation bonus, 2 things popped to my head...<br />
<br />
Yay for tanking dangerous 1 rounder mobs, and Yay for tanking non-trivial but also non-asspounding XP or trash MOBs.<br />
<br />
Just seems when tanking your high blue or even MOBs you would notice the heal savings more.<br />
<br />
(Obviously trivial mobs make the bonus useless, for multiple reasons =p  )<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the best question I've ever seen on these boards.<br />
<br />
I don't know that we have been told specifically what is being done.<br />
<br />
The normal formulas used to determine mob melee damage are:<br />
mob melee damage = DB + ((RND(20)) * DI)<br />
min hit = DB + DI<br />
max hit = DB + 20*DI.<br />
<br />
---- Skip to the ****'s to avoid a red herring ----<br />
Note: this section has to be wrong. In essence, DI-1 lowers the maximum hit by 20  not matter what DI is. I foolishly did the math without grasping what DI-1 meant ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Since Defensive works by dividing DI by 2:<br />
mob melee damage = DB + ((RND(20)) * (DI/2))<br />
<br />
If the change manipulated DI as well, by subtracting 1 from it.<br />
<br />
Using Lord Yelinak as an example:<br />
DB=100,DI=25<br />
<br />
The normal formula will give us<br />
min hit = 125<br />
max hit = 600<br />
<br />
The new Warrior formula gives us<br />
min hit = 124<br />
max hit = 580<br />
<br />
So, the max hit is reduced by ~5%<br />
but the min hit is reduced by ~1%<br />
<br />
The higher the value for DI is, the more a mob is characterisized as a heavy hitter (because DI is multiplied by 20 when calculating the max hit) since the dfference between its min and max hit is large.<br />
<br />
Low level mobs have smaller values for DI and high level hard hitting mobs have a greater value for DI.<br />
<br />
So let's take a look at Gimp Yelinak:<br />
DB=50,DI=2<br />
<br />
The normal formula will give us<br />
min hit = 52<br />
max hit = 90<br />
<br />
The new Warrior formula gives us<br />
min hit = 51<br />
max hit = 70<br />
<br />
While the max hit reduction is ~20% it's still only 20HP's - the same hp reduction as for the real heavy hitting Lord Y!!<br />
<br />
In fact, the higher DI is (and heavy hitting mobs have greater DI's) the lower the reduction% becomes.<br />
<br />
---- **** ----<br />
<br />
So, I can't believe this is what's being done. Instead, what I believe (hope really) is what is being manipulated is RND(20), which I'll call the RM (Random Multiplier).<br />
<br />
If they are changing the 20 to 19 so that the formula becomes:<br />
mob melee damage = DB + ((RND(19)) * DI)<br />
<br />
This has the effect of changing a mob's maximum hit from:<br />
max hit = DB + 20 * DI<br />
<br />
To:<br />
max hit = DB + 19 * DI<br />
<br />
Since there are usually 20 possible damage values returned, this has the effect of reducing the max hit of any mob by 4%<br />
<br />
Back to our examples.<br />
<br />
min hit = DB + DI<br />
max hit = DB + 20*DI.<br />
<br />
Lord Yelinak:<br />
DB=100,DI=25<br />
<br />
The normal formula will give us<br />
min hit = 125<br />
max hit = 600<br />
<br />
The new Warrior formula gives us<br />
min hit = 125<br />
max hit = 575<br />
<br />
So, the max hit is reduced by ~4%<br />
but the min hit is reduced by 0%<br />
<br />
Gimp Yelinak:<br />
DB=50,DI=2<br />
<br />
min hit = DB + DI<br />
max hit = DB + 20*DI.<br />
<br />
The normal formula will give us<br />
min hit = 52<br />
max hit = 90<br />
<br />
The new Warrior formula gives us<br />
min hit = 52<br />
max hit = 88<br />
<br />
And weak mobs exhibit barely a reduction at all.<br />
<br />
This is probably the answer. What it does is reduce the maximum hit that can be taken by a Warrior by DI. The higher DI is, the greater the HP reducion and the closer the reduction% comes to 5%.<br />
<br />
It's worth noting also that the melee damage formula is linear and DI acts as the slope. The higher the value for DI, the steeper the slope and the greater the difference between the minimum and maximum hit. Mobs with a high DI produce &quot;damage spikes&quot; where a maximum hit stands out from the background of median hit. This change slightly reduces the amplitude of those spikes.<br />
<br />
It's possible to have a mob that hits for 3000's and has a low DI. For such a mob, the damage spike would be quit small as well as the damage &quot;mitigated&quot; by this change.<br />
<br />
Please note that nothing I have seen indicates any reduction vs. DD, DoT or procs. Since these are pretty common in high-level boss mobs and make up the majority of the damage a non-MT Warrior would take, it inaccurate to state that Warriors are getting 5% mitigation vs. high-level mobs.<br />
<br />
In the case of a 3000HP high DI mob this is like having another 500HP's in your maximum HP's. In the case of a mob that does appreciable damage with DD, DoTs, or Procs it's far less. For lower level blue con experiance mobs in LDoN Easy (for example) it's not going to amount to much.<br />
<br />
In fact, given a choice, I'd prefer something like giving Warriors a 7% additional HP bonus based on unbuffed HP's but including STA effects. This would not only do the same job against high-level mobs but would work vs. all damage and against all mobs. I would see it as restoring the Warrior survivability advantage to where it should be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the developer said that defensive/stonewall has -50% mitigation instead of -45% to account for the new innate mitigation warrior bonus get.  Since Defensive has always worked by dividing DI by 1/2 and then you take the normal distribution, I'd assume that since they just tack on our 5% mitigation to defensive, it must work the same way as defensive.  So, you'd take a mob's DI, reduce it by 5%, and then take whatever you normally get hit for at that DI.  So if mob was going to hit you for 10 DI of damage, you get hit for 0.95 * 10 DI of damage instead.  This would suggest that our mitigation bonus gets worse the more AC you actually have, since if you get hit for min (0 DI) you don't get any further bonus.  This is just my guess based on how our mitigation bonus interacts with defensive.  It could very well be something totally different but this seems pretty reasonable interpretion of 5% mitigation.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if 5% works by subtract one DI from all hits outright then it'd actually be better the more you can mitigate.  I.e. dropping damage by one more DI when you get hit for min is a bigger reduction of damage (in terms of %) versus dropping damage by 1 DI when you get for max.  The latter would be more powerful than the former in all cases since the former will never mitigate more than 1 DI of damage (and only 1 DI when you get hit for max).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron<br />
<br />
Thanks to the insight and good work of the player who provided us the mob melee damage formula, we ought to be able to determine if either of the modifications I looked at fit.<br />
<br />
If new values turn up as min hits for Warriors, then DI-1 is what is being done.<br />
<br />
Note: It can't possibly be DI-1 since this would merely reduce the max hit by 20 no matter what the DI was.<br />
<br />
If a mob's min hit on a Warrior fits the known DB and DI, then the RND(20) may have been changed to RND(19).<br />
<br />
(BTW, I'm well aware that actual implimentation may use a table and the formula &quot;fits&quot; the layout and values. Translation between the two is pretty simple)<br />
<br />
Alternately DI could simply be subtracted from every damage value before if is returned.<br />
<br />
More important than puzzling out what they did, are the game consequences.<br />

FT15 is actually Less than what many casters walk around with in mana-regen ... Look at KEI, VoQ, Bo9, SD, then look at things like necros, mod rods, canni... Mana is in most instances of good groups/raids much more trivial than hps.<br />
<br />
What disappoints me, is that it seems thatI see a lot more 100+ hp items that are caster/priest coming out all the time. 100+hps and 100+ mana on the same item has alway been a BAD idea... i wish the devs played melee classes more, so that they could see this..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is true, but it's more like &quot;nothing else will help them survive&quot;.<br />
<br />
There was a heated debate on TDG about HP vs Mana. All the raiders picked HP, with the common argument &quot;what good is your big manapool when you're getting hit with a 2k AE?&quot;. Not to mention the fact that USING a big manapool is impossible due to aggro.<br />
<br />
But yeah, it's retarded when I bid on WIS/Mana, and more experienced Druids call me a noob. I wish they were wrong, but I play the game I'm given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Paladin of all, made an excellent observation in another post, I'll quote it here :<br />
<br />
You know what was the biggest nerf to warriors since the beginning from EQ ?<br />
<br />
THE WINNER IS -&gt; Limited complete heal<br />
<br />
It got this effect bevor the nerf. <br />
Warrior hps 6000 -&gt; Knight 5000.<br />
Warrior got 5000dmg -&gt; Knight got 4000dmg. <br />
(Knight need a heal earlier then warriors).<br />
Warrior at 1000hps -&gt; Knight at 1000hps<br />
Complete heal incoming<br />
Warrior healed for 5000hps -&gt; Knight healed for 4000hps.<br />
Warrior at 6000hps -&gt; knight at 5000<br />
(Warrior again need longer for 2. complete heal.)<br />
<br />
New complet heal is this<br />
Warrior 10000hps -&gt; Knight 9000hps<br />
Warrior get 9000dmg -&gt; Knight get 8000hps<br />
(Paladin again take first heal earlier)<br />
Warrior 1000hps -&gt; Knight 1000hps<br />
Complete heal incoming both get healed for 7500hps<br />
Warrior 8500hps -&gt; Knight 8500hps<br />
<br />
Both are the same tanks now.<br />
<br />
The only difference is at the start that the knight need the first heal a little ealier. As more classes reach the 9000hps range as more effective they tank because complete heal not heal the full hps and both classes are at the same hps after the heal. This will sooner or later create a big problem between light and heavy tankclasses because as more hps we get as smaller the difference in tanking will be between the classes.<br />
<br />
That they upgrade warrior migration and dont look at this problem show me that they are clueless about the problems from the tankclasses and so in the future, the tankclasses are in trouble because every class can tank effecitv the moment they get over 9500hps and a ranger/monk/roque/mage etc. will allways give the group more then a tankclasses because they are designed to make other stuff then tanking.<br />
<br />
Arbosch Bloodforge<br />
Dwarf Crusader<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it's a very interesting observation and one that should be considered.<br />
Personally, I think a large part between tanks lies in mitigation, as it should be.<br />
But there's definately also a point in how effective heals are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">while it is a valid arguement it forgets Two things...<br />
<br />
#1) Modded Heals, by time you get to 9-10k Tanks your healers are gunna have focus and or AA., modded CH's are something like 9k or something or maybe a little more at best...<br />
<br />
#2) At least in my experience, the vast majority of CH's that land -land at 30-40% because of the combination of pop damage being spiky so want to prepare for the spike, and that well CH is just dirt cheap now, many clerics arnt effeciency whores like they used to be on it...<br />
<br />
still a valid arguement tho</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point was - That adding hitpoints without increasing the amount healed per heal cast, will effectively result in no improvement in raid situations, which is what wou will be doing once you are at those amounts of HP.<br />
<br />
Thus mitigation becomes important again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is the point.  Squabbling over a few hundred HP doesn't make a bit of difference.   None.  Its stistical white noise.  Asking for more HP without changing anything else is silly.  That is unless anyone thinks EQ is better served by having 15K HP Warriors against POP exp monsters.<br />
<br />
That is the reason I keep wanting to get Plate Mitigiation fixed.  Right now everyone views us as pools of HP as oppose to plate tanks that can take melee damage better.  A Ranger with 9K HP tanks just as well as any level Warrior.  No amount of HP on that Warrior fixes this.  However getitng mitigation to return real and noticible damage negation will.<br />
<br />
This isn't just a Warrior problem.  Its an SK and Paladin problem too.  I keep mention that we are all on the verge of obscelence due to caster power and the rise of Beastlords and Rangers.   As long as tanking is HP centric instead of balanced HP/AC we are all just steps away from being replaced with classes who can achieve enough but less HP levels yet dish more effective effects.  We should all be pressing SOE to make AC have real value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior may like the new status quo.<br />
<br />
However you make a good point about plate armor providing mitigation. Here on TSW, we've observed how Plate/ALL armor and items invariably have HPs, WIS/INT, mana, and even focus effects allowing Knights for example to get more benefit from the same armor than Warriors get - this would be the infamous knightimization effect. Until now no one has suggested a good way to compensate for it.<br />
<br />
In the Warrior Class Description SoE mentions a Warrior's &quot;heavy armor&quot; as being a factor in our unmatched ability to survive, but we've never gotten this benefit.<br />
<br />
As I see things perhaps Knights should get the same DI-1 change Warriors have just gotten for wearing light armor. Add DI+1 to all mobs from PoP onward so this just diferentiates them from Chain Wearers and doesn't make more mobs Knight tankable, give Warriors -1 from our current value to match the Knight change and another -1 to compensate for Knightimization and the Heavy Armor benefit we never received.<br />
<br />
So in short, including the latest mitigation change Warriors should get DI-3, Knight's DI-1, and PoP mobs and beyond should get a DI+1 change so as to not accidently make more High DI mobs Knight MTable.<br />
<br />
Nice suggestion Aeka. SoE should pick up on it<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC already takes care of a large portion of this.  Chain AC, at least in current itemization, does not come close to plate AC.<br />
<br />
As for Knights vs Warriors, that's quite a bit more complicated.  I think we'll have to see Gates of Discord to see where the game's headed before we can make meaningful discussions.  If next expansion features normal bosses that hit for 6K and up, the balance should swing back in Warrior's favor.  As for XP groups, I think we'll have to see how the opening system works before it's meaningful to make further suggestions regarding that aspect.</div></div><hr />

Still, smoetimes you have to scratch your head and wonder what they were thinking about when they designed Velius expansion :<br />
<br />
Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings (leather, monk only)<br />
60 AC<br />
<br />
Raex's Greaves of Destruction (Plate, warrior only)<br />
70 AC<br />
<br />
So, since Velius warriors have gotten a pair or heavy plate armor pants, that have 10 AC more than a pair of leather pants ?<br />
Unless someone know about another pair of greaves with more AC than Raex ?</div></div><hr />

I'd also like to point out that with the AoW pants 60AC- Big deal.  Monks had their mitigation nerf to deal with that.  It was stupid to put the AC on them, but those pants are in their entirety stupid.  100HP and 60 AC.... its just another example of the knightimization crap that's been going on since Velious.</div></div><hr />
