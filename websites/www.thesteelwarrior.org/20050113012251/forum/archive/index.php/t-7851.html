<br />
Every other warrior on the server is wielding those and i HATE looking cookie cutter. The main reason i made this warrior was to be different when i started playing (female troll warrior).<br />
<br />
This is not my main...my Main is a 65 bard BUT this warrior is on another server. I have some decent gear i can sell off for maybe 20ish K and she only realy comes out to play when my guild feels like busting up Naggy/Vox<br />
<br />
Soo any suggestions would be great!<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. I was toying with the idea of just going with 2 SSoY for old skool sakes since she only tanks Naggy/Vox anyway  :D <br />

Because for agro weapons pre elem, they are the best there is. just my 2cents.</div></div><hr />

Get what works best and for that you're doing CHoS/SotB is the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if u want a different option, i used to use wavecrasher/frostbringer . <br />
<br />
theres also the smithed ykesha weps which proc the yak stun i think. <br />
<br />
another decent option is the silken whip of ensnaring.</div></div><hr />

Actually your Stonebladed Axe of Dismay is berelly as good aggro as the SSoY combo for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus an easy step to improove your aggro is just to aug your actual 2Hander with something you like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or if you really want somthing better go for a dual Honed Blade of the Ykesha (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15803) made by Troll smith (oh that's good you are a troll, will be easy to get one. Too bad you are Agno because the RZ deity version is the best.), basically their are the old SSoY but with a better ratio. you can try to augment them alike.<br />
<br />
augment possible:<br />
Glowing Permafrost (Req lvl 40, 100 Adv.Pts. in Mir.) : 75 DD Cold<br />
Cobalt Crystal of Affliction (Req lvl 50, 510 Adv.Pts. in Raj.) : 75 DD poison<br />
Warm Emerald Shard (Req lvl 30, 40 Adv.Pts. in Tak.) : 50 DD fire<br />
Cracked Slimestone of Guarding (Req lvl 45, 340 Adv.Pts. in Guk) : Guard I<br />
Rejuvenating Bone Fragment (Req lvl 55 !! , 340 Adv.Pts. in Mmc.) : 50 lifetap<br />
Jagged Permafrost Chunk (Req lvl 55 !! , 150 Adv.Pts. in Mir.) : 100 DD cold<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you,<br />

The last time I tanked Vox I was using a Veno and a bloodguard wand of whatever.<br />
I've never thought that holding aggro was that big a deal against Vox and Naggy, although a lot depends on the level of gear used by other melee in the raid.<br />
Presumably this is obvious to you, but make sure that whatever you twink yourself with will in fact proc at lvl 52 and that the recommended level fix didn't nerf the weapon at your level.</div></div><hr />
