<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2670">Changing role</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I talk with... a few of my war friends about hating the knight classes,  but I talk with more of them about changing the role of the warrior class.   <br />
<br />
I started playing a warrior because I liked the class for being the best tank,  now we aren't,  and it makes me mad,  not because we aren't the best tank,  but because in addition to being the worst tank,  we are also the worst DPS class.  <br />
<br />
I'd be more than happy to let SoE  bring paladin / sk up to warrior level of tanking skills,  if they would for crying out loud improve us at being a DPS class,  let's see,  the highest HP DPS class that can tank if need be.  <br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying anything about raids,  unless SoE decides to make 100's of warriors quit the game by actually giving paladin's and SK's defensive/evasive discs,  I'm not hugely worried about that.  <br />
<br />
In an every day exp group though,  I woulden't mind having my role changed for that of the tank to a DPS class.  <br />
<br />
And here is my question,  what does everyone else think about that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think this is a War Room thread.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sir I think you're nuts.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to do goddamn DPS, I would've rolled a ranger/rogue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">or perhaps even a beastlord ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hitting 'A' in a group setting bores the life out of me already heh :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">or perhaps even a beastlord ?<br />
<br />
Nah didn't pick a beastlord for DPS. I picked mine for the utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually agree with him.<br />
I would like to see a change in all the melee classes with regards to DPS and have variety in roles.<br />
Why not have warriors do the Most damage per second? Seems to me a class called &quot;warrior&quot; should be the most skilled in dealing damage to a foe. Knight classes should be the best skilled in defensive capabilities, they do use a shield afterall.<br />
Why do rangers outdamage warriors? They should have other skills instead (such as snare to prevent the mob running).<br />
I basically see the classes differently than the game designers. A warrior should be doing feats of strength in weapon swings doing huge amounts of damage swinging an axe that a Knight cant even lift. A Knight should be skilled at avoiding that hit from the mob or blocking it entirely with the shield (defensive skill?). This would let groups and raids have more choices in which type of toon to use in each given scenario. Got a mob that hits fast and lots of damage? You could use the defensive capabilities of the Knights to try to avoid the damage entirely. Got a mob that doesnt hit as hard but has a Billion hit points? Use that warrior to cut down that damage quicker! Get the idea?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For Sorguran:  As others have mentioned, if I wanted to play a DPS class, I would roll one.  I wanted to play a tank, so I rolled one.  Please stop trying to make warriors into something else, if you do not like our role, then go find another class to play.<br />
<br />
For Naralli_VoLS:  If you make knights better able to absorb damage than warriors, you will have driven the last coffin nail into our class.  The one thing we do better than anyone else is absrb damage, please do not fuck with that.  Also see my reply to Sorguran as to why tunring warriors into a DPS classs is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Or play a different game.<br />
:)<br />
<br />
I have always felt the idea of the &quot;barbarian&quot; in Diablo2 best encompasses the term &quot;warrior&quot;. Executing high damage manuevers and feats requiring Physicality.<br />
Not that I want to see EQ follow the path of Diablo2 as I hated that game in the end.<br />
:)<br />
Redhenna:<br />
No i am not saying we should make the changes I mentioned. I agree with you in saying if they take away our ability to take damage we have lost all that we are. I was merely looking for a solution to our class that doesnt involve making sure we have &quot;Weapon of Enraging Blow_01&quot;. I think scaling up our DPS solves that problem. In the above post I was just wishing the game developers thought out the roles of characters better from the start is all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I misunderstood then, sorry.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with us getting a small DPS increase(we have to be behind monks and rogues for the most part, so that sets a definate limit).  This would help us generate agro a little, and would help mobs die faster(aways a good thing).  I am very much against changing warriors roles in EQ tho, as I play a warrior because I like the role we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't know if I agree with you entirely on having to be behind monks and rogues Red.  They already have a DPS advantage because they're  behind the mob, and we are not. (we hope)  :)<br />
Maybe if they leveled the melee DPS playing field so that we were really, really close to rogue/monk DPS from the back of the mob, without going over it, that would be enough, since mob parry/riposte/blocks would still cut our DPS down some when we were tanking.  I don't want to nudge the other melees out of their niche, but  perhaps if our non-tanking DPS was bumped up to very nearly (if not exactly) what monk/rogue DPS is now, and then they were bumped up a bit too, it would accomplish the old &quot;melee versus caster balance is being looked at&quot; thing too.  But I've only slept about 10 hours this week, so I could be mistaken......... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by Sorguran <br />
we are also the worst DPS class.  <br />
<br />
Cleric Paladin... and where does enchanter rank ?</div></div><hr />

Enc pets do more damage than me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Are you talking about their Animations or Charmed/Dire Charmed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would like a charm item with (100 hp)*(level/65) regen per tick and plus (300 ATK)*(level/65) that would only activate when I was ungrouped.  These effects would not stack with any other regen or ATK spell buffs but would stack with worn effects. <br />
<br />
When I am in a group the same charm could just add (15 percent)*(level/65) more agro to weapon strikes.  This effect would stack with all other agro buffs.<br />
<br />
This would let me solo low dark blue mobs when I can not get a group and help me hold agro better when I am in a group.  If I am not the MT then I could take off the charm and replace it with my PoP charm.  This charm could be quested at around level 45 and would scale up as the warrior levels.<br />
<br />
Something like this seems like it would be easy to do and would help solve a lot of problems.</div></div><hr />

You aren't the brightest candle in the chandelier are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;You aren't the brightest candle in the chandelier are you?&quot;--Ninjaburger<br />
<br />
So why do you think its a bad idea?  I assume you are refering to my post since this was right after it but its hard to tell.  My idea would help out with 2 different problems (inability to solo and weak agro holding) and would be easy to implement.  Perhaps the numbers would have to be tweaked a bit but it doesn't break the game and it is not extremely far off from what a lot of people have suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How about because it would be nearly impossible to code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It wouldn't be impossible to code.  Charms are already self modifying based on group make up.  Specifying one effect turns on if you are ungrouped and turns off if you are grouped is simple to do.  I have done some programming and this would just require a few if statements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You're not only talking group if/else statements, you're talking class, level, group status statements. On top of that, you want one of two effects in play at all times and those effects have limitations/special abilities on them based on your buffs (limiting atk buffs based on the charm; adding hate to weapon hits).<br />
<br />
I've done some XML programming and while this is not impossible, to get the code to a reasonable size so that it can be justifiably put it in the &quot;everything&quot; file would be extremely difficult. Any single one of the effects would be hard to justify, but all of them? No way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Without going into specifics and  wasting more time on this, here is some very rough psuedo code for what I am suggesting that would not take up much room:<br />
<br />
If playerGrouped()<br />
   then <br />
      {effectOne = True<br />
        effectTwo = False}<br />
   else<br />
      {effectOne = False<br />
        effectTwo = True}<br />
<br />
Sub function playerGrouped() returns True if a player is grouped and False if the player isn't grouped.  EQ uses smething like this already although I don't know what its called since I don't have the source code.  Send a tell to your group when not in one and the game tells you you aren't in one.<br />
<br />
As far as testing the players level, there is already code to do this and it is used on recommended level items all the time.  Class of player is tested every time you equip an item so that isn't an issue either. <br />
<br />
I don't know the specifics of XML well enough to argue about the size aspect but I would imagine the entire subroutine would take less than a half dozen lines if preexisting objects are used and this was done in C++ or a similar language.<br />
<br />
Nothing I have suggested would require any new code and arguing against it on coding issues is kind of besides the point.  I was just trying to put out a helpful idea and all I get is insulted and told it won't work based on coding.<br />
<br />
Anyway, arguing is pointless since you have already convinced yourself this won't work.  Have fun getting anyone to take you seriously on this board I guess.  I won't be posting here anymore and I can see how come Sony doesn't bother to take what is said on this board seriously.</div></div><hr />
