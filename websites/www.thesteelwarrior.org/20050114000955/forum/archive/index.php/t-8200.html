<br />
I'm a long time reader, first time poster, yadda yadda...<br />
<br />
lvl 44 war, Rallos Zek<br />
<br />
First of all sorry that I don't have a magelo yet, but I'm at work.<br />
I was wondering what kind of advice you could give me on some upgrades.<br />
I've got SCHW for haste and I was wondering what you guys would recommend switching these to ornate gloves.  However, since the ornate gloves haste comes from a clicky and wouldn't stack with enc or shm haste (or as I was led to believe), I wonder if this would be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
I've got about 30k to spend, should I instead get some kind of belt haste and get Fierce Heraldic gloves?<br />
<br />
BTW I realize that ornate gloves can't be worn till 55, this is sort of long term planning.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, magelo inc.</div></div><hr />

Ornate gauntlets are nice when there isnt a hasting class available but really more of a luxury.  You will be better off getting a good haste item such as a soulscream belt, spiked seahorse belt or rune branded girdle and then picking up some cheaper armour upgrades - RZ cultural is the best bang for buck armour available in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

That being said I don't think I'd spend 30k on an item that you can't use yet when you could probably get a few items that will amount to more hp/ac and you will be able to use before and well after 55.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Figure 40k to spend.<br />
<br />
Thanks I really appreciate it!</div></div><hr />

You need to get rid of the SCHW... those are taking up a good slot where you could put some FH Gauntlets, or better which will give you a big boost to both your AC and HP.  Selling those should get you to about 45k, and you can spend 6-8k on the gauntlets then.<br />
<br />
Use some of the other money to buy some haste back.  I'm not sure what the good haste items are now, but Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt would do you well, and you could sell the girdle.  If you're using tribute haste this is a different story.<br />
<br />
Another slot to replace would be your neck.  An Amulet of Mummy Wrappings would be decent, for maybe 1k.  I'm not sure what else there is out there.  I would hit up your guild trade-skillers for some Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement.  Those would be a good upgrade to both of your ears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmmm, little confused, you say you're lvl 44 but your Magelo says 65, which is it. Also, are you really fully outfitted in FH?  <br />
<br />
If so, finish it off with the gaunts, sell the SCHW and get a soulscream belt/runebranded girdle etc.  The last thing I would do is replace that Shiny Gold Earring with a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement, might have to save a little more depending on server prices.<br />
<br />
After that it looks like it's time to start saving for the overpriced stuff and another Bloodmetal Earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BaggytheWar</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I updated my magelo with a few items that I've purchased.  Can you guys please look this over and comment!  I've only got about 8k left after these upgrades. Thanks guys!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">everything seams ok.<br />
save pp for the next step post lvl 50-55 when you will replace FH by ornate/LoDN armor (your best choice for helm is helmet of RZ).<br />
<br />
<br />
so go on in lvling and saving pp and AP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Yoda. In fact, you are pretty well geared for a level 60 warrior, let alone a level 46.<br />
Go fight.<br />
If you want to go shopping, get a stack of halas 10-pound meat pies, Grobb liquised meat, and some zone-specific gate potions (they are shaman made, but cheaper than gate-to-bind-point potions). Use the stat food whenever you fight, but the gate potions only when you get yourself in somewhere you can't get out of, heh.</div></div><hr />
