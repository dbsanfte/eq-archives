<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thrakkorzzog</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a Froglok Warrior on the first Day of LOY, and he is getting close to the levels where I need to start getting quest armor. Which quest armor is best to go for? Shyshrine or Thurg. I know Skyshrine armor is better, but is it worth the trouble to get the faction for Skyshrine when Im almost ally with Thurg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skyshrine is much better and definately worth it.  But on that note, it's also difficult to get below 55, and it will be very difficult if your gear is far below Thurg.  Of course if you're buying MQ's, then get SS as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunt bank area of Kael, get ally with Thurg and SS, Sell the drops you get in kael to support your SS quest armor.  and you can get some exp there (keyword is some)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend getting the warrior smithed armor. As frogs we can wear elven (Full Mithril) and I think its Dwarven? Luminescent? Gotta find a mith marr smith if u want the imbued version, BUT as warriors we don't need the wis so the Full Mithril works just great :) The Full Mithril nonimbued is better than Thurg and better than 2 of the SS pieces. The helm, boots, BP, gloves, and maybe arms are all upgrades but not terribly huge.<br />
<br />
You can peek at a full suit of Full Mithril on my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=620383</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgirm</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snag a Thurg Helm because it has 5 more sta on it and the same raw hp.  Only the bracers are really an upgrade on the Cultural suits.  The sta and hp together from SS will be worth the time and effort.</div></div><hr />

I really miss &quot;The Tick&quot; cartoon on comedy central. :)<br />

<br />
Kahomn, is that the blue epic in secondary hand in your signature? I don't know why it bothers me but I didn't think the epics were versitle like that, heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can put both epic blades in whatever hand without having to use the other, Just not many people use the blue one by itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robok</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunatly the red epic is really only good for one proc.. useing the blue in the off hand and a nice aggro in the main after that first proc is often the better way to go depending on what stats you need more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can't knock the +15 stamina on the red blade if you're a light weight race either.<br />
<br />
I go blue blade off hand when I dont want to draw agro and red blade off hand (or more often these days 2hander) when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thrakkorzzog</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only problem I see with that armor Roma is that theres no +Str on it. How much do you weigh with all your gear on? I own a Reaver and it weighs 25! It would kill me to have only 122 str like you, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meety Da'Shield</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SS definently just hunt in Kael and maybe get some drops to do thurgy armor or MQ for cash to get you the SS MQ.<br />
<br />
SS blows SS away although i would get Kael BP and Greaves and rest SS. But that is just me. Good Luck and you can get ally to both Coldain and Claws of Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Red gives nice Hp upgrade, Blue gives dex,  I switch out alot as to the situation till I can upgrade them completely. Guild I tank for is farming North wing so the chances of upgrades at this point are few, So I use blue blade to get the first 2-3 procs off and hotswap in red or one of my otherweapons. Like mentioned in alot of posts alot of weapons are situational and if you have high agro members or people who know how to hunt with warriors where our job is easier..</div></div><hr />

Reminds me of the Bob Dylan song...<br />
