<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sheck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My main is currenlty a 66 shaman that I've been playing for about a year now.  However, I have a warrior that I created some time ago as an alternative to play when I can't get groups.  I started playing him again and I've managed to put a couple levels on him the last few days and got him to 43.  I was wondering if I could get some recomendations on gear.  My magello is here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1014713).  I also have a CHoS in the bank that I picked up in Droga some time ago.  Most of the gear is stuff I've picked up along the way with my shaman main, however, some of it is probobly starting to get out of date for his level.<br />
<br />
I don't want to spend a whole hell of a lot at the moment, maybe 30K on Stromm.<br />
<br />
I've always had fun with this toon, and may even make him my main if I can manage to get him into the 60's.  I've really enjoyed the ease of getting groups in comparison to my shaman.  Also, I'm getting kinda tired of never actually seeing half the mobs my guild takes on in raids, because I'm usually scrunched up in a corner with the rest of the casters/healers.<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot to add that my main is in a raiding guild currently preparing to hit VT shortly then onto the planes.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're set for weapons, it looks like, for a good long time.<br />
BP is good.<br />
In a few levels you'll want more haste. There are a lot more haste options now than there used to be, and you might be able to use your shaman to get some of them. There's a thread on warrior haste items in the library, but look around at your options.<br />
I really don't know MM cultural armor options for frogs. Might not be any. the gothic stuff is what you should look at changing out first, I think. If you just want to upgrade enough for a few levels (as opposed to stuf that will take the warior to 60-65) you could look at <br />
<br />
Barbed ringmail (from Velks; e.g. legs:AC: +25 Str: +3 Sta: +7 ), <br />
steel wrapped (drops in Nadox; e.g. legs: AC: +27 Fire Resist: +4 Disease Resist: +4 Cold Resist: +4 Magic Resist: +4 Poison Resist: +4 HP: +45 Mana: +30), <br />
<br />
These would in the 2k plat range each, I think. they are wearable by frogs, and woudl certainly be upgrades to gothic. Odd bits like cobalt are around too, though depending on the piece would cost more.<br />
Kylong darkmail stuff is around too, but it's (no drop?) out of Veksar, so would be tough for your frog to get at the moment, I think. <br />
Other kylong stuff is dropable. The kylong shinguards (AC: +35 Sta: +4 Wis: +6 Int: +6 Agi: +8 HP: +45) are pretty good. Haven't priced 'em, but would guess in the 5K range.<br />
<br />
Something in there might be a place to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sheck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the advice.  I'll take a look into that stuff next time I'm on.  I've been taking a look at the luminant heraldic stuff and it looks pretty nice too.  Expensive tho, about 10K per slot.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when you pick up enough of that gear tho; you can hunt in bigger and badder zones and get the chance for more coin by either /split or drops to bazaar.<br />
best bet is find yourself a smithy and go collect the items..usually tradeskillers will do combines for minimal cost ( sometimes just even for the chance of a skillup )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sheck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice.  I did some lurking in the bazaar and got some upgrades.  I went a bit over budget and spent about 60K, instead of the 30K I originally intended.  However, I should be able to make that up by doing some farming with my shammy.  What's kinda sad is that my 44 war has better ac and almost as many hp as my 66 shm...<br />
