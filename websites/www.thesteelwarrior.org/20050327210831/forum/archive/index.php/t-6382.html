<br />
<br />
Recently acquired a Shielding 2% aug but I am not sure what its worth in AC or HP. <br />
<br />
Generally I go with 1 AC = 5 hp, but I am not sure how to rank shielding. Any info would be appreciated and any links to parses of shielding and w/o shielding  would greatly help.<br />
<br />

HP is there to keep you up longer as the damage makes it through the mitigation (and avoidance but.. yanno..).<br />
<br />
Shielding is defined, constant, definite mitigation.  Shielding aug = 2% less melee damage. How much AC do you need to add to compensate for 2% mitigation? <br />
<br />
And HP... well... you'd have to look at how hard each mob you tank hits to really value it vs shielding. 100 hp vs 2% shielding on a mob that hits 2k? Each 2k hit turns into 1960 with 2% shielding, so get hit 3 times like that and you've already done better than a +100 HP aug. I'd be hard presed to find a situation where any HP aug &gt; shielding aug.<br />
<br />
Hard to put numbers to it, but I think it'd be crazy not to take one of those augs once you get the opportunity to. :)<br />

<br />
example: take a mob that hit for 3000<br />
<br />
his dmg formula is 2000+1000dmg bonus (so, he wont hit less than 1200)<br />
<br />
the 2% mitigate only the 2000. so, you will be hit between 40 and 4 hp less each hit<br />
<br />
how much hp/ac it is, well....dunno hehe<br />
<br />
maybe 200hp / 20ac?<br />
<br />
any Time warrior can confirm ? :P<br />
<br />
EDIT- some spelling (you have gotten better at EngRish (23)!)</div></div><hr />

[B]if i have understood well, shielding mitigate base dmg <br />
<br />
example: take a mob that hit for 3000<br />
<br />
his dmg formula is 2000+1000dmg bonus (so, he wont hit less than 1200)<br />
<br />
the 2% mitigate only the 2000. so, you will be hit between 40 and 4 hp less each hit<br />
 <br />
<br />
It's 2% of the 1000 in your example (the damage bonus), meaning again in that example, every hit would be for 20 less damage.<br />
<br />
That doesn't sound like a lot but it adds up.  10% total shielding would equate to 100 less damage per swing, etc.<br />
<br />
As far as it's usefulness, it varies from mob to mob, on some 2% shielding may reduce damage by 1, or it might reduce damage by 25 per hit, it all depends.<br />
<br />
Generally though, I would put 2% shielding ahead of most of the ac/hp augs out there, since you have like 20 slots to put things in and I doubt you have great things in each augment slot.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I can't think of any proc i rather have HP since most mobs that proc terrible stuff also hit for a good amount.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sythrak</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Semi easy obtainable spellshield gear (If your a Time geared guild) :<br />
<br />
1.) Glyphed Prayer Ring - 5% (1 group obtainable)<br />
2.) Fleshbound Shroud of Aggression - 5%  (2 group or less obtainable)<br />
<br />
Raid spellshield obtainable :<br />
<br />
1.) Armguards of the Brute - 4% <br />
2.) Prismatic Ring of Resistance - 6% <br />
3.) Belt of Temporal Bindings - 5%<br />
4.) Blood Glazed Helm - 4%<br />
5.) Tactician's Shield - 5%<br />
6.) Various spell shielding augs from Ldon or Yxtta - 2-3%<br />
<br />
On average if you've been doing GoD and Time for awhile, you can get around 10% spellshielding in items.  Helps alot if you have to tank the mobs with the nasty high damage chaining procs.  Much more usefull than shielding.  But of course that's only situational, as I can only think of a few mobs you'd go with spell shielding over normal shielding.  Mix and matching them to get whatever you can for both effects though makes for a more versatile tank.<br />
<br />
Edit :  Didn't mean to derail this.   Always have shielding augs over 20 hp augs or whatever.  Shielding gives small returns depending on the mob but it adds up as you get more.</div></div><hr />

This seems to imply shield stacks with itself? And spell shield as well? Haven't been able to find hard information on this, so please confirm if it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spellshield and shielding definitely stacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anlas</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's great. So shielding +4% and shielding +2% stack, adding up to shielding +6%?<br />
<br />
Excuse me for asking, just want to make sure you don't mean shielding and spell shielding stacking :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gromlok</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, shielding effects stack</div></div><hr />

I'M familiar with that (besides them dropping in augment form too) but who would get a bertox belt or or prismatic ring and BAG them as &quot;spellshield gear&quot;?</div></div><hr />

When your guild has been farming Time for 9+ months, just about everything starts going to twinks, apps, and carry it in a bag gear.</div></div><hr />
