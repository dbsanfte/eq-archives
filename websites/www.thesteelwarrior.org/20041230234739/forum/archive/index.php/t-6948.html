The changes to warrior disciplines a few months back was a much celibrated event. I ran to EC tunnel and bought all the tomes that were available. Loaded them up and was ready to go. I had my hot key #3 set to engage my discipline. My hot key #2 was a combination of taunt/slam/disarm. During melee, I am almost constantly pressing 2 (wanna get all the taunts, kicks, and disarms in that i can). With the new changes to the disciplines, I noticed that my defensive was going off on its own. There was nothing I could do to figure out how to turn it off. All my web searching on the subjected ended up fruitless. I thought that maybe I was accidentally hitting 3 (my defensive macro key) so I moved the macro to 9. Unfortunately that didn't fix my problem. <br />
<br />
What was this poor ogre to do? The main feature that makes a warrior more desireable to tank the boss mobs and I seemed to have no control over when it would go off.<br />
<br />
Well, this past weekend, I finally figured out what was going on. While tanking mobs, I do a lot of little movements to keep the mobs in the correct position/direction. Some of these movements are straifing (Control + left or right arrow keys). It seems my problem is that my left hand didn't know what my right hand was doing (literally). I would be pressing my 2 key to taunt with my left hand while my right hand was pressing the control key to straif. And surprise surprise, the control keys are hotkeys to the discipline buttons and right there in slot number 2 was my defensive discipilne. So anytime I tried to taunt while straiffing would yield defesive.</div></div><hr />

I play EQ with the same keys i used to play quake / CS. The draback is, while tanking i hold my right mouse button around 2/3 of the time. However i really got used to that and do it kinda mechanically. WASD + mouse = total movement control, helps especially when MTing mobs in open areas or tanking multiple mobs at once in ldon / teh exp grind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chain taunting is a bad idea as noted above, also disarm does all of jack shit for aggro imo, I'd just stick to kicking seperately unless your trying to work the skills up still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragan</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had that problem myself initially, I was firing disciplines left and right when strafing. I ended up rebinding my discipline keys to use the ALT key instead of CTRL, so ie I have to do ALT + 2 to get defensive now. That seemed to solve it and it's not like I am going to be casting spells from the spellbar anytime soon anyways, which is what the ALT key is usually used for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Control + # activates whatever you've put in your combat abilities window.  So for example if defensive is on the upper left corner, Control + 1 will activate defensive.<br />
<br />
The best way to avoid doing that is just not have any discs on that combat window.  Shouldn't need more than 2 hotkeys for discs anyway, and the rest you can type as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Disarm is a useless skill.  It builds initial aggro only, but very little (if not no) actual aggro.  Don't bother with it unless you're trying to disarm a person in pvp, or you're fighting the efreeti in poa (or some other mob that dual wields fine steel...if it even exists)<br />
2) Don't map taunt and disarm together.  Keep them separate.  If you are taunting the mob when you dont need to, as Hussar said, its a waste.  Kick when it pops, but only taunt when the mob isn't facing you.<br />
3) Move your defensive discipline to a different hotkey so that you won't mistakenly ctrl+# it.  Pick a number you rarely hit...or, like suggested by Phantron, just don't have anything in the window.  Make a hotkey page with Healing Will, Aggressive, Defensive, and Fortitude (so you can see if they're up or not without typing /disc &lt;name&gt;), have a hotkey for Defensive/Fortitude, and just manually type out the rest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Also, disarm does not increase aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I have long thought this was incorrect. I have had plenty of mobs turn to me off disarm when they ignored my taunt (no proc either). Equal to or even more then the times I've gotten them to turn to me off nailing taunt. I've had no proof though and often wondered if it was just a delay sync from my hitting taunt to the mob accepting it. Until yesterday afternoon, When I failed taunt, no proc, hit disarm and the mob left the chanter and turned to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had this same problem though luckily it was spirit of rage I was nailing. What I did was removed the hotkeys in the console from slot 2 and 3 (my taunt and kick hotkeys). Now I don't miskey and use a disc while strafing. Most of our discs are useless, Incite can be put into normal hotkeys leaving you only needed room for Furious, Def, Stone, Evas, and fort. I keep healin will up too just for those times in GoD where I grab aggro on my way to zone and want to heal up a bit before running thru the next zone and getting seen by another see invis~<br />
<br />
You can also swap the hotkeys from ctrl + num to something else.</div></div><hr />
