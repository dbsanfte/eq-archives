Im not really sure about alot of things in game but I just hit 51 last night and was wondering what I should be looking forward too and what kind of gear I will need, because I plan to get really involved in raiding and what not. Take a look at my Magelo account and thats what Im working with at the moment, any suggestions whould be great as what I should do for weap/armor wise. Thank you for the help. <br />

The LDON gear is very nice if you can not get ele gear or better.</div></div><hr />

The fungus mask is likely to be the cheaper of the two.<br />
<br />
It also looks like you forgot to put your arms slot in. :)</div></div><hr />

If you guys can kill in Plane of Growth (old school!) some of the berzerker's (warrior armor, not the stupid class) armor there is half way decent.  Its pretty much the same as Thurg quest gear, just its dropped as it, no need to turn in.<br />
<br />
Or, if you're going to grind out the LDoN rout, the MM warrior gear, the 750ish stuff, is very solid.  And would server you well as you could aquire pieces.  As far as your weaker slots, check out the bazaar, or a LDoN sorting script to see whats going to put AC, raw HP and Stamina in those slots.<br />
<br />
Good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1ac = 6hp = 1sta until sta is capped. Live by that formula and your gear choices should be very clear. Str doesn't matter. Dex doesn't matter. Agi doesn't matter. Wis and int don't matter either... see the trend? Resists don't matter either! Attack matters a little bit, but not more than a little bit of hp/ac. Same with regen. Better haste would be cool, but not immediately vital. <br />
<br />
  Your weapons are solid. Stay with them.<br />
<br />
  Oh, and were the arms Ry'gorr?</div></div><hr />
