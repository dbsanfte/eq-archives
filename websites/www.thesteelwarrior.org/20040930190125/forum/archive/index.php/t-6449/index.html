<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gakmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to kill some fabled mobs to twink some alts =)<br />
I wonder if it is possible to clear Ishva in Splitpaw with  EP geared warrior wizard  sk and [non-ep equip]shammy? <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.  You can invis all the way down there, and Ishiva is a pushover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ishva spends so much time casting that you can melee him down before he starts whacking you for 1400 :D<br />
<br />
Ghoul lord hits for 1132 and single target rampages<br />
froglok kings hits for 1132 and single target rampages<br />
ghoul assassin hits for 888 and flurries<br />
ghoul executioner hits for 1399 and flurries<br />
don't remember what ghoul cavalier hits for<br />
king tranix hits for 1920<br />
warlord skarlon hits for same I think?<br />
not sure what solusek champ, priest, and king hit for<br />
efreeti hits for 1800 I think?<br />
<br />
Most have around 32-64k hp<br />
<br />
A solid group can take any of them down.<br />
<br />
The rest of the fabled mobs in the game are greenies and can be soloed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Efreeti hits for 1800, procs an ae 2.5k fire 1 buff dispell/dd. Drops nice boots though so worth killing.<br />
<br />
the royals all hit for 500-1300 range.  fabled mith bp seems to be the best item comming out of these fabled camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killed Fabled Grimfeather in NK last nite.  Was rather funny due to our guild leader just got back into EQ from being sent away for well over a year in Iraq, and is in desperate need of armor upgrades.  I asked one of our trackers to go see if he's up.  The tracker (Druid) charges on out there and is yelling for us to get it off of him cuz he couldn't land snare or root on it.  By the time we found him Grimfeather made him into a tasty snack.<br />
<br />
Max dmg Grim was hitting me for was 327 damage with Defensive up.  Enrages at low health, and doesn't run from the fight.  Dropped Fabled Crafted Vambraces.  Pretty nice item, and was very cool to get em for our leader.  Considering he left for Iraq just before PoP went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gakmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If Ishva hits for 1400, you think I can keep myself healed if I chain quintessance/the 1300 hp heal? Ill try toonight, i hope we'll have enough dps to kill it fast heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, np, as the Ishva only rarely melees, and instead spends most time trying to cast, which is mostly resisted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The Fabled Estrella I think her name is, is so easy.  I could probably solo her killed her with 2 groups the other day.  The 1 time she did melee me in the 3 minute fight was around 1150 I think.  She also enrages but I think it's fake because I was still attacking her while facing and didn't get hit back.  Drop was some pretty nice Cleric,Druid,Shaman Shoulders.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hey, nobody ever answered how hard is Drelzna?<br />
<br />
I went to Lower Guk a few times this past weekend and there was literally two people in the zone.  I was hoping that there would be a list with people helping so I could try to get my hands on a FFBSS or Fab Exec Axe as my friends and I are not high enough to take the camp ourselves, but no one was there.   :( <br />
<br />
So looks like I am SoL for the Fabled items from Lower Guk, but am wondering if a group of mid 50's could take Drelzna...  maybe I could at least get some Fabled JBoots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">lower guk is perma killed on Prexus :D Usually 20 ppl at frenzy pulling the entire zone and AE'ing.<br />
<br />
I could probably solo her killed her with 2 groups the other day<br />
<br />
You can't say 'solo' followed by '2 groups'. Solo means you killed without any help whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Fabled drelzna is easy and soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, what is up with Stromm that there was like 2 people in Lower Guk on a Thurs and Fri night?  I was expecting there to be a ton of people with a list going....  and I had Thurs and Fri off so I figured hey I've got the time, then no one in the zone!  Yeesh.<br />
<br />
Drelzna soloable by a 55 war with 4000hps and around 1150 ac unbuffed?  I'm thinking no.   :)   I have friends to bring along, so it sounds like we can do it, hopefully it will be available.</div></div><hr />
