<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenswar Keelmore</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all I have been trying to find a couple strats for Vindi...I would like to help my guild finally take this big bastage down. We have had a couple not so good attempts at it...from what I saw it was a timing issues as far as CH rot went and the pull. Mainly just trying to find as much info as possible so I can point us in the right direction. Thanks for any info that can be provided.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the exact strats you've been trying?<br />
<br />
Have you been trying to get vindi solo, but his guards keep adding?<br />
Have the guards been tearing through your raid because you can't get them killed fast enough?<br />
Can your main tank not hold agro?<br />
Do casters start debuffing/nuking too soon?<br />
What's the delay on your CH rotation? 2 sec, 4 sec, 6 sec?<br />
Do you have issues with re-pops around the arena?<br />
Where are you fighting Vindi?<br />
<br />
The more info the better. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there was a thread about vindi strats not too long ago... try a search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or do what Gulug said ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jenswar Keelmore</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I will do both. The CH Rot was 5 sec. We tried to get the guards first, if I remeber correctly it was 3 guards. We tried, once we got guards taken care of, corner tanking Vindi and yes nukers blasted WAY to soon IMHO. Our guilds main tank is level 65 with all defensive AA's and about 8k HP buffed with about 1400ac so that was not a problem. Once he went down due to the CH rotation goofing up, I took agro with no trouble getting his attention and holding long enough to see one CH land. I think we just need more practice at it because we did get him down to 57% health before the wipe. I think maybe we had one arena add near the top of the ramp. That's abot all I remeber about the fight. We have tried a couple more times since then with no success yet. Once I was MT, and again the CH rotation goofed because on the pull the first cleric had an emergency AFK&lt;someone was knocking on her door&gt; and the last time they let a Paladin try to MT...he lasted about three rounds at level 56. Anyway I am gonna go do that search now and see what comes up. Thanks for reading my rambling! I LOVE THE STEEL WARRIOR BOARDS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you got Vindi to 57% then he is as good as dead.<br />
<br />
Bad strats will get you dead way faster than that.<br />
<br />
The best things to do....<br />
<br />
Use a shaman potion.<br />
<br />
Call assist 15 seconds in if people cant hold agro. Wait for some good agro procs etc.<br />
<br />
Use Mana regen on clerics.<br />
<br />
Make sure people turn off attack completely during a tank switch.<br />
<br />
Use AE taunt to switch.<br />
<br />
Use Paladins to LoH if the MA gets low/Cheal is missed.<br />
<br />
Assign a Rampage tank, and a dedicated healer to heal them.<br />
<br />
Make sure the Rampage tank is the first person to touch Vindi other than MA. This includes bard songs.<br />
<br />
5 Seconds is fine while defensive with that tank. <br />
<br />
Use Divine Intervention in case the MA misses a heal again. He should not die any sooner than 3 minutes into the fight.</div></div><hr />

get max shrink and corner him.<br />
before raid, set up your clerics and casters at max ch range. <br />
i kinda drew a map in the last post, so hope you can dig that up.<br />
STACK those DSs. bard song, mage DS, potion DS...</div></div><hr />
