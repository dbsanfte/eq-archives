<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niluvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for suggestions which would be the most efficient disc to use here out of EVAVSIVE or DEFENSIVE.  Once AD is slowed his melee dps is not to bad, but its the proc even with 500MR that can still get through due to bard being feared.  <br />
<br />
Thanks, Niluvani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it all depends on your gear chief. which leaves me to ask..<br />
what's your setup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niluvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, Im doing some research into which would be best for the MT in the guild.  Heres the link to his magelo <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=796631<br />
<br />
Also one last question, can AD proc on a miss?.  If so this would totally defeat the purpose we are trying to gain, which would be avoiding the proc, it seems to get the MT even through 500 MR.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again, Niluvani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AFAIK Mobs generally cannot proc on a miss.  Unless Aerin'Dar gets his proc from a weapon, I would assume he cannot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">your best bet is tossing the beefiest tank you got at it and just pray. the proc shouldn't go off if it's a miss but, well, this is EQ and wierder things have happened.<br />
<br />
we've killed him a few times and even with seemingly the 'exact' same strat and setup/people; we've either blown through AD like a wet paper bag or got totally beat down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Niluvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mininum is the MT for the guild, so based off his current HP would you go DEF or EVA?.  We managed to get AD down to 40% with 18 people, 2 grps on AD, 2 clerics on MT and 1 druid on RT, and then one grp dealing with the adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say get more than 3 groups and you will have her/him/it with no problem that's your problem I bet lack of dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Niluvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A guild can only work within the boundaries that have been set, i.e. people/classes, the guild I am in have 24 people average on raids, yet we still kill Saryn, VZ, carprin script etc.  DPS is not the really the problem with 4 charmed SoV'ed pets they do enough DPS so that we can keep up with the add pops.  Still can anyone answer the main question please, which disc would be most efficient? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well your MT has 4700 (so 7500ish buffed?) and lacks full def aa...I'd advise DEF.  If he had more hps/aa I'd advocate EVA as it might reduce procs.</div></div><hr />

Jakle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would recommend furious.  Actually with AD his melee dps is weak.  The big thing will be fear and stuff.  Just go defensive and hope you dont get feared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If a mob has a big proc use evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">im just wondering how an MA with 4.7 unbuffed gets through carprin, vindor and raex give me nighmares and im at 7</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Niluvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Carprin script is very easy with the correct classes, and grp set up, a bard with MT making MR 500 will easily be enough to resist all lifetap procs, is then just a case of blast healing the MT, Raex is very tough yes as he doesnt slow but with good healers it aint so bad.  Also thanks all for the responses highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Nuluvani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">p.s. Raex's Taps are harder to resist than AD's ae's :)<br />
<br />
Your same bard and tank can sit on Aerin Dar's head and donkey punch him all day long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Niluvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Im not sure what was happening with AD, but with MAX MR(500) I was still getting feared, Raex on the other hand didnt even get a lifetap through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you're killing saryn, et al. with 3-4 groups and your MT only at maybe 7500 hps fully buffed? /boggle HOW?   <br />
<br />
And as for using charmed pets, I thought that wasn't viable anymore because the charmer gets the aggro if more than 3 people are on the mob's hate list.<br />
<br />
also wondering about how you deal with carprin's mem blur. my guild will be looking at that cycle soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Niluvani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Theres a few tricks to the saryn fight to allow it to be done with these numbers, obviously I wont state them here as your guild will have to figure them out, thats the best part of the game forming strategies and then putting them to use with the lowest possible numbers.  But basically a bard, and  four good clerics can chain CH, 6 secs while defense and 4 secs when off for ever.  The only trouble happens is when sorrowsong pops and you need to get it agroed and slowed asap.<br />
<br />
Charmed pets are still working ok as far as I know, and having these pets is what allows us to do things with low numbers, we have killed all BoT towers with as little as 6-9 people with pets :)<br />
<br />
Also Im not sure the real Carprin does a mem blur, the MT has no trouble in keeping agro, if you get all your tanks with a good bard, then they all should have 500 MR which is key to resisting his lifetap.  Carprin has no HP so just burn him down, have 3 clerics on 5 second CH cycle and then just blast heal the MT with remaining clerics and druids.  The only real trouble with the carprin cycle we had was with Raex.<br />
<br />
Also on a last note MT HP does not really matter to us, as long as the tank does not get one rounded then we can keep him alive, we have good healers that are sharp and have adapted to the low number raids, everyone is operating at 100% at all times which may not occur on 70 man raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Props for taking hard raids with such low numbers.<br />
<br />
On a different note, jeers to Sony for continuing to make charming so damned overpowered in PoP though.  It's still absurd.  No class should be that powerful.  Ever.  Especially a class that's already very powerful without being a high dps class.  Nerf this crap already.</div></div><hr />
