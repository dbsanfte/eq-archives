2# When age is brought up as representing maturity. Age has has nothing to to do with the actual maturity level of a person. A person grows up by being legal age, and a person grows up by experience. The age don't matter, why do people have to shove it around?  <br />

3# When race/sex is used &quot;You have a problem with me just because I am a man/woman, The fact that a person may be a certain race or sex isn't even part of topic, but said person feels that they need to bring it up and use it as a excuse. <br />

<br />
I agree that age is not necessarily a reliable indicator of maturity.  I've met some 15 year olds who were quite mature and I've met some 30 year olds who were extemely immature.  But age is an indication of experience.  And with experience often comes, but not always, greater maturity.<br />
<br />
People use the phrase, &quot;you're behaving like a child&quot; for a reason.  Children tend to behave differently than adults, do they not?  So while I will agree it may be somewhat unfair to assume that just because someone is young that they're also immature, but it's much more likely to be true than the reverse, that just because someone is young they're mature.<br />
<br />
I personally try to take people as individuals but when someone is being immature with me and I know their age, if their young I'll say it's just because they're young and immature.  But if they're an adult, I'll say it's because they're an ass.  Youth actually gets you more benefit of the doubt sometimes. :D</div></div><hr />

Yep who says that the day of december 25th this year i will be so different from december 26(my b.day to turn 18)? Age is just a number and numbers are pointless.<br />
<br />

<br />
Race and sex...this has been an issue in the United states for how long? but is it still? The only difference from men and women now is front line fighting, everyone is equal. same with race everyone is equal but Do you know what is in effect, say at a college? If a white man and a black woman apply at the same college with the same everything they will take the woman, why? because there is laws now. So people that mention race sex need to shut up just like the age people...<br />
<br />
Touchy topic and supposdly when you &quot;offened&quot; someone about it they have every right in the &quot;Rule book&quot; to go postal on you and you have to take it, but they fail to realize that if supposdly you are doing the wrong and judging and discriminating on these they are being supposdly just as low as you...</div></div><hr />
