<br />
I'm sure you're wondering why I say they need more, as they already have tons. The reasoning behind this is because I think their migation skills should be nerfed to that of a bard.<br />
<br />
Let's see how their aggro lock saves them then! Hah</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no, it wont do.<br />

Knights should be able able to tank things without beeing mana sponges. remember Kunark ?<br />
I think actual mitigation for knights is correct. an elemental knight should be able to tank there np. as for lower geared knight, they have to tank, its their main purpose.<br />
Aggro lock for knight may be a little excessive, the problem is not here but with warriors. our agro generation is total bullshit : we need to use a few selection of weapons (with specific procs) to gain and keep aggro. every tiny bit of aggro, we try to get it, with beg, disarm, proximity, etc... this is not correct We should be able to aggro things without praying the proc god. The &quot;bandaid&quot; SOE used for high end (EB weapons) is not enough now there's so many high level everywhere nuking and critting for more and more.<br />
The second problem is : itemisation. While I agree some good things where done (recommanded and required level, new focus effects), there is a problem with warrior gear. warriors used to have the top armor, crafted, soldier, cobalt, thurg, SS or Kael... it's no longer true with LDoN. now with LDoN a casual knight can buy an armor better than his ornate and same as warrior ornate, with mana and int/wis... the warrior ac and hp superiority came mainly from gear, but no longer. I think the main problem is that there is too much gear choice today :D.<br />
The third problem : If you can choose a warrior that can tank np in your xp group or trivial raid (backflaging, farming, etc...), or a paladin that can tank np in the same situation, wich one will you take ? the only that can tank, or the one that can tank + back heal, pull, root, snare, etc... ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course when I play those problems are not always here. in xp groups I lose aggro sometimes... I dont control it. I have AE taunt and shield it help a bit... my gear is not so bad, except I should not look at the magelo of some paladins in my guild that have more hp/ac than me (with slightly better gear). The problems aren't decisive things like SWG class bugs, but because nothing move, where everyone everywhere KNOW we need some lovin, this is why there is so much rant.<br />
<br />
so : reduce knight mitigation is not the way. SOE must add something to warriors to make them tank better without mitigate more. new ability, unlink disciplines with added restrictions... I dont know, everything was proposed many times here.</div></div><hr />
