<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello again, its been a while since ive posted here... Lately Ive been stationed in Okinawa and it seems to be a virus paradise.  Every time I log off of EQ I run my nortons anti virus scan and allways find a few.  After running the scan I click fix selected problems but in every occasion I have a few left and am given the option to either exclude or skip, and no matter which i choose I get the message I have this many at risk files left..  I dont know what to do, Im really at a loss.  Normally I run my spybot and adaware, but lately Ive been getting this german virus that deletes a dll from my spybot forcing me to uninstall it and then restart and reinstall it to make it work properly.. If you have any suggestions please let me know..Its getting rough over here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get stinger off the mcaffee site...do a google search.  its a good idea to run stinger and norton to check for viruses, they each find stuff that the other program doesnt.  and as for spyware protection, go for PestPatrol if you can.  I ran it the other day after running both Spybot S&amp;D and Adaware, and PestPatrol found 90 bots that the other 2 didnt</div></div><hr />
