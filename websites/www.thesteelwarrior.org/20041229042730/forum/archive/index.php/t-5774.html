Anyone think something is wrong with this?

R/P/D typically accounts for ~10% of all misses so that means the mob here missed only 3% of the time.<br />

What's next, a mob that always hits for max?</div></div><hr />

Hey atleast his DPS would be constant.</div></div><hr />

I have tanked a number of named archers on a warrior, and they do have very high hit%s, but only about 70% hit rate while misses make up 15% and the rest are defensive skills.<br />
<br />
For instance, flesh hunters have a 70% hit rate with defensive.  I tried one with evasive and the hit rate dropped to 62%.  I took 650dps during the fight compared to 770dps for the other three times I used defensive.<br />
<br />
I haven't tanked the named archers in Kodtaz itself, but i have played my monk killing them, and they certainly are nasty.  I can't find any logs for them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems like only archers have high hit rate.  I didn't get the full log (half of the text scrolled off) but the named Archer basically never missed the whole time.  I am sure P/D/R accounted for more avoidance than the misses on them, even with evasive.<br />
<br />
I guess if it's just one type of mob I can live with it.  Still, evasive is already not quite useful due to the one group nature of the trials (you might mitigate more damage, but you will die on the round you fail to evade any hits).  I guess that is the point, since evasive is lower level than Defensive/Stonewall.  I'm really starting to appreciate Stonewall in the trials because you need every bit of DPS you can to drop the named as fast as possible and the extra damage of Stonewall versus Defensive does help.</div></div><hr />

I haven't spent a lot of time with it, but I felt like I was more spikey with defensive.  What I really need is something to display spike dps over variable amounts of time.</div></div><hr />

Ikkinz Trials:<br />
<br />
No 6 man event should REQUIRE 4-5 certain classes to effectively complete it. After a while, you begin doing these events to flag 2 people; and often just the one person.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hi welcome to PoP justice trials when they first came out.<br />
<br />
Thank you come again</div></div><hr />

They are not comparable for many reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly people were doing Justice trials at lvl 60, with a shit ton of AA's to get. What do you get in GoD? No noticable power increases, as of yet.<br />
<br />
If you don't know what you're talking about, it's usually best to refrain from posting. But hey, whatever floats your boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do know what im talking about. <br />
Do you?<br />
<br />
They are in the same vein of 6 man trials that have to be defeated.<br />
They where both a bitch to get through when their expansions came out. Both G.oD. and PoP had AA increases to recieve albeit PoP had 5 more levels.<br />
I have gone through the first trial, its just as hard as execution albeit in a diffrent way, Yet how come I am not bitching about it?<br />
<br />
Care to explain how they are both diffrent if I dont know? <br />
Im just stating what I believe to be the case. As when PoP first came out there was certain core classes one would take to &quot;Guarentee&quot; success when the expansion was brand new.<br />
<br />
So tell me. how am I wrong?<br />
How is this diffrent ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainian</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">recieve albeit PoP had 5 more levels <br />
<br />
PoP had LR5, ID5, Planar Durability, Planar Power, and host of other excellent offensive abilities ONTOP of 5 extra levels that triviliazed execution trial.<br />
<br />
GoD has sturdiness. That's it. The only ability, thus far, that helps you tank.<br />
<br />
There is a masive increase in power while exp'ing up to &quot;Execution Trial lvl&quot;, while GoD has no increase, until you PASS the trials.<br />
<br />
Where, exactly, am I/others going to get the same shudden shift in power that was available in PoP, PRIOR to the Ikkinz trials? Nowhere? You'd be right!<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

How is this diffrent ?  <br />
<br />
Do the KT trials  and you'll know what he's talking about.  It'll take Decade about 8 -12 months to get you and your guildmates equipped to pass one of these trials so you can witness it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been messing around more with various Archers in Ikkinz.  While eyeballing is by no means an accurate way to parse it does seem like arrow guys have a higher hit %, but none has the nearly no-miss accuracy I encountered earlier.  It almost makes me feel like evasive was doing the opposite of what it's supposed to do on that one named Archer.<br />
<br />
I don't mind certain mobs have better accuracy, but a mob that basically didn't miss while evasive seems kind of buggy, which is why I posted here.  If that's intended, that's fine.</div></div><hr />

This made me lol.  <br />

Get KT flagged and try those trials.. They are far from Execution trials when PoP came out...<br />
<br />
As far as the archers go.  i'll check my log files, it seemed the yellow con archers have a viscous attack rating.  They pumped out a damn nice amount of dps.</div></div><hr />

Well, there is a mob in one of the Ikkinz raids that is created solely to paste warriors who hit Defensive/Stonewall by reflex, it seems.<br />
<br />
Damage Bonus:  1400<br />
Damage Index:  5</div></div><hr />

Mobs with high hit % = use furious + massive damage shield.  :) Probably built-in strikethru; if it was just ATK regular melee debuffs would put a dent in em.<br />

<br />
If you notice when they get to a certian health (kind of like enrage at 9 %, but seems more variable on its timing and some never do it) they will emote something to the effect of 'a kyv eyegouger fires a volley of arrows!&quot;  this is some kind of flurry or super haste effect from what I can tell.  The yellow con ones were especially nasty.</div></div><hr />

They will use 5-6 dots at random targets (can be the same one).  This ability can also recycle since I've seen archers do it more than once.</div></div><hr />
