<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>genorif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello all, i have a 24 warrior that has been sitting naked for quite some time. i am getting bored with my main, so i wanted to try somethin different. i have no money at all to twink with, so basically im gonna have to do this re-equipping with a naked 24 warrior only. does anyone have any suggestions on ways to either raise money or get items? i was planning on doing the halas newbie warrior quests to get a little bit of armor, but after that i have no idea what to do. any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The newbie quests are a colossal drag, and at 24 the armor will be near worthless to you in most slots.  You should be able to get some half decent weapons and armor dirt cheap in the bazaar.  Siphon about 300pp off your main and buy a mith 2hander and the cheapest armor you can find in the bazaar that's actually decent. (you'll sometimes see crafted, crusty, rygorr and other decent armors dirt cheap)  Get a group in Netherbian lair and get one of the ac 20 breastplates that drop off the Netherbian swarm leader.   Once you have decent enough kit to solo all the bandit camps in west karana without getting too low health to heal back up before they respawn, collect bandit sashes and turn them in to Chesgard the Paladin at the Temple of Thunder in South Qeynos.  He'll give you a bronze weapon for each of them, which you can sell to the merchant that stands next to him.  You can make about 400pp in a few hours there.  Take that to the bazaar and you can probably buy a GSoT at the rate the price has been dropping.  Keep doing that until you're satisified with your gear.  If you can get yourself in full bronze and a mith 2h you'll be better off than I was at lvl 24, and the bandits are how I made money back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jonnas Povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1) this post is in the wrong area<br />
<br />
2) GSoT is required lvl 55<br />
<br />
3) farm plat with your main to twink the dude if you actually want good equip, don't use the guy.  If you can track with your main, i'd suggest the good ol' hill giants, or if they can't, try dulak or highkeep.  That is, of course, if your main's high enough....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Farming plat with his main would definitely be the way to go, but he asked how to do it with his lvl 24 char so I gave him a workable answer.  This is how I made money back in the day.  And I'm not saying he should buy a GSoT yet, just giving an example of how easy it is to buy good gear these days (and honestly I never really noticed the level restriction on mine, I never read much further in the item description than the ratio and the proc).    :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Beo, that Bandit Sash thing was how I made a bunch of my money. And yeah.. if you can get past leather and a giant militia longsword at 24.. your definatly doing better than I was 3 1/2 years ago :p so easy to get good gear nowdays, you can practically get a weighty polearm for free, Rec lvl about 30ish(?) Another way I made cash, is find a guy that likes tradeskilling, but is lazy to collect the stuff he needs. Good example is selling silks/pelts to the tailorers. Good Luck! Dont forget to go on a couple vox/naggy raids before you level up all the way, that was my most favorite part of the game ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarevok Gibran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">go to highkeep with your main, kill guards drop 2-6pp per corpse and ALWAYS drop a fs short sword which sells for 5-6pp (depending on cha) to vendors, there is an erudite merchant downstairs name Tarn Visiln (sp) who is indiff to all and the banker will even serve you when she is scowling just stay far enough back because she will attack if u get to close (not a problem she is level 30) this i found is an awesome way to make money i can usually get about 500pp-1k an hour or so depending on how fast i go, try and get rygorr and crafted, orc fang earrings, rings 6ac and 65hp pretty cheap and then just get a decent weapon, there are many good ratio 1hs or 2hs that are dirt cheap, hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally found the newbie quests to be a lot of fun and still had the newbie gear in a few slots at 20-24.  So it's not a bad start...  and if you enjoy questing then I would do them.  I did them I think at level 10-12 and I think it took me 3-4 hours to get every single piece.  So that's 3-4 hours for a complete set of armor.  Of course I had a guide who knew where to get everything....<br />
<br />
Not everyone likes to plat farm and buy all their gear in the bazaar.  :p  Although that is surely the best way to gear up and get the best gear as fast as possible....<br />
<br />
For weapons the weighty polearm is a good cheap weapon.  I think the actual rec level is 50ish, but stats are decent starting mid-20's.<br />
<br />
As for other pieces...  Gothic armor is pretty good and cheap.  Or resold crafted, or like was said crusty or ry'gorr.  Netherbian chitin is also a good bp.  For plat I actually killed greens in warrens for bronze weapons and bamboo armor.  Sounds like the other suggestions below will yield money quite a bit faster though....</div></div><hr />
