<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">24 points, spent only in CLASS AAs, like Area Taunt, Rampage and Flurry.<br />
<br />
In fact, Physical Enhancement, Area Taunt, Ambidexterity and Rampage would get you your marshall title.</div></div><hr />

You could be a monk, looking at trying to get Sensei title and still justify the existence of things like Return Kick and Acrobatics.<br />
<br />
At least warriors have a way to get marshall title cheap ... which involves two AAs they absolutely have to have (PE and AE Taunt) and one that used to be a must have pre-PoP (Ambidex).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could argue that you wasted your points on combat fury instead of maxing your defensive AA's first, but I won't.<br />
<br />
Different strokes for different folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By far the best class title, IMO that they could come up with for a warrior.<br />
<br />
Marshal : 1: the highest rank of military officer in some countries, 2: A high official in a royal court, aiding the soverign in military matters</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaZZy</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Etymology: Middle English, from Old French mareschal, of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German marahscalc marshal, from marah horse + scalc servant<br />
Date: 13th century<br />
<br />
horse + servant...<br />
<br />
Hmm...<br />
<br />
And since when is it a warrior's job to command armed forces? His job is to be in the heart of battle, killing and maiming his opponents, not to be some commander who stays in a tent and commands others.<br />
<br />
Next...<br />
<br />
Baron: a man of great power or influence in some field of activity<br />
<br />
Veteran sounds cool.<br />
<br />
I still think they should change the last AA title for warriors.<br />
Overlord or Berserker or Slayer, or something to that degree.</div></div><hr />

Where's our Paly/SK horse?  How many Marshall's are supposed to walk to battle?  Yeah, we can shell out the plat for a horse, but its not the same...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't argue that.  Warriors are TANKS first and foremost.  We're not there to do damage, we're here to take damage.  <br />
<br />
People spend AA's how they choose, and no choice is more or less &quot;Stupid.&quot;  If I want to get marshall first, that's fine.  If I wanna go defensive first, that's my choice.  if you wanna go CF and see almost zero return for your points, then that's fine by me.<br />
<br />
The point isn't about how you spent your aa points, the point is that I disagreed with how you said it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass - Ok Marshall.<br />

<br />
I'm 3 bubs from CF3 and I've yet to see any DPS increase at all compared to before I started Combat Fury.  I did however add a boatload of DPS getting CA/CS/PE and having my shaman be able to heal me less and use Bane of Nife more.<br />
<br />
So  ya, you keep laughing about how you gain AA's faster with a &quot;supposed&quot; increase in crit rate, because it's quite amusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Berserker sounds nice<br />
Just Warlord would be cool, or Overlord<br />
Victor perhaps??? That would be kind of cool.</div></div><hr />

No one does anything til I say to...  and when I say to back up or flip it or whatever, everyone does so.  Sounds like leadership to me.<br />

Marshall Qris<br />
65 Overlord<br />
