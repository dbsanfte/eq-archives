<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ldon is something you should really look into further.  See quite a few things you could improve with LDON's.  I suggest Tak armor but i see you have already went the EF armor for your  legs.  <br />
<br />
If you are interested in doing quests.<br />
Shoulders.  Look into Strength of the elements- 100hp<br />
Spirit Wrack Cords-  wrist, shoulders, arms (this will also give you an 85hp ring)- 100hp<br />
Dain ring- faction work and final war a pain- 100hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I would suggest hitting Hard Ldon advs and upgrading all the slots that can take LDoN drops (Neck, Back, Gloves, Feet Wrist...etc..) As far as buying something, I strongly suggest the Heavy Rubicite Girdle (25 AC, 4 sta, 80 hps). <br />
<br />
As far as what to get first...Get rid of those boots.  Anything with more AC is preferable, even if you lose some hps.<br />
<br />
Then I would upgrade the neck piece and the Gloves.<br />
 <br />
Look into the Steel Mask that drops in SG. I forget the name.  Its 20 ac and 55 hps or so.<br />
<br />
Redleaf Thunderblade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weldilar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im max dorf faction and have 8th ring but am all too lazy to quest anything these days. and chardok faction is pita<br />
btw im solro and ep capable but not fire.<br />
and i do do ldons as much as possible but i tend to rack up points slowly so i go for ef armor over tak to get better overall upgrades</div></div><hr />
