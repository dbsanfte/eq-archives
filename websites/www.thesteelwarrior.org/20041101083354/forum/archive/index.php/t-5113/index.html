<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not sure how to put my question at this point.  Seems more like a jumble... things I know (assume) and things I don't quite understand.<br />
<br />
Here is where I am at.<br />
<br />
I started a warrior on a new server and have currently gotten to level 11.  I went to the bazaar with like 25 plat that I had accumulated, and found a &quot;Icetooth's Claw&quot; (stats below) for 10 plat, it looked better than the sword that I started with so I bought it... plus it looked better than some of the other stuff that had the same delay and lower damage.  There were some stats on other items but I didn't think 1 or 2 pts here or there would matter that much at this point in time.<br />
<br />
I ended up purchasing a full suit of leather armor and then someone reminded me of the quest armor... so I did that and I have all of the quest peices, and the fill-ins are the leather armor.<br />
<br />
Now the things I think I know are...<br />
<br />
To find out if a weapon is better than another one for DPS the basic formula would be:<br />
<br />
Damage / Delay<br />
<br />
To find out the max hit of the weapon (assuming no caps):<br />
<br />
((strength+weapon skill)/100)*base damage + damage bonus <br />
<br />
which is pretty much all I know... <br />
<br />
What is confusing me is everyone says you must have good taunting ability and the weapon is a factor.  So do you carry a DPS weapon when you don't want to taunt?  and something else (fast) that creates additional &quot;taunt&quot; when you do?<br />
<br />
So I stated to look at 2 handed swords figuring I needed to work on the skill today.  and using the DPS formula above I was finding stuff that was 0.60+ which I could afford (50plat now), but the 1 handed swords were... well the best I found was that Icetooth (.379)... which means you would always use the 2 handed swords.... but I realize dual welding comes into play and how often you hit the mob also creates &quot;taunt&quot; ... reason the twig was so well liked, even though it had a 3 damage (I think).<br />
<br />
I guess the question(s) are:<br />
<br />
1) do you carry more that 1 weapon based on the situation?  becasue you are a main tank and have to keep the &quot;taunt&quot; and another weapon when someone else get to be the main tank.<br />
<br />
2) What makes a weapon better than other?  I know stats are a factor in the weapons as well and the value can't be calculated/factored in to a formula... but I am just trying to figure out the basics at this point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, I certainly have several different weapons for different roles. I have a pair of dual wield agro weapons, a 2H agro weapon, a DPS 2H weapon, a slow weapon, a snare weapon, and a lifetap weapon.  <br />
<br />
For determining what weapon is better, I go by if it improves my current weapon setup for a specific role.  Since agro is the hardest to quantify, I look at both the agro potential of the damage/delay, as well as the agro potential of the proc.  For example, if I was looking at a 11/20 weapon with no proc vs. a 12/22 weapon with a debuff proc, I'd choose the proc weapon for agro.   For most of my weapons, stats are an added bonus, but not necessarily the main reason I choose one over another.  It's not an exact science though, and personal judgement comes into play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best thing I think you can do in your early levels is to work on all of your weapon skills, 2HS, 1HS, 1HB, 2HB, and piercing.  At earlier levels I don't think procs are much of an option.  I remember the first aggro weapon I got was a blackhand berserkers axe, which procs pique which is a great aggro proc.  Lots of people say at earlier levels venomous axe of the velium brood is great for aggro procs and is fairly inexpensive, although either of those weapons will be out of reach for you for a little while.  For now I would get the fastest weapons you can find, of course ratio is also important, but at your level faster weapons will equal faster skill raises and better aggro.  Go with the 2HS or 2HB with no proc when you don't want aggro.  My point I guess is to get a weapon of every type....  or at least of say 3 types.<br />
<br />
As to specifically address your questions, yes I carry different weapons for different roles, as listed above.  There are a great variety of weapons with a great variety of different procs and ratios for different situations.<br />
<br />
I would say the most important aspect of a weapon depends on what you want to use it for.  If for aggro, then you want speed and you want a proc that draws aggro (hate, stun, dd, slow, snare, dot, etc).  If for just dps without aggro you want ratio, and preferably a 2H.  It just depends.  Stats are important, but it is a weapon after all, and the ratio and procs are more important than stats.  As you get better weapons they generally tend to get better stats, but I personally would not choose a weapon with stats over a weapon with a better ratio.</div></div><hr />
