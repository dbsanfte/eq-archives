<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got one last night, but I have BF and GBOS atm as my aggro set up. Any thoughts on which i should use? Currently in a VT pre elemental guild btw if that helps. And tanking Inny was fun if you havn't done it yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BF and GBoS will blow Anathema away for agro and probably be comparable dps.  Anathema doesnt have the ratio that a BoW does to create strong agro.  The lack of AC on Anathema hurts to.  My hategiver/boc out agro'd my anathema.  The only benefit Anathema will give is lower riposte damage; you could try swapping to it on hard hitters after they've been slowed and you have strong agro established.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Anathema is actually one of his three weaker drops that he has on his loot table.  =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
We killed Inny even before going into VT, dropped some Anathemas (5-6, maybe more). Going to Warrs or knights, i never seen one of them being used (except for lil testing during 2 days after attrib, and before bagged).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krauth Isuber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I honestly don't see how people can dis the Anathema.  I got one about 9 months ago and LOVE the damn thing.  I have stolen aggro from many people with it (oops) and have tanked a lot of Ele mobs with it.  I put an Anger 2 aug on it because a lot of people dissed it, but I still can get an insane aggro lock with it.  A 36/30 ratio / 125hp / 15 sv. fire / cold / magic really isn't that bad either.<br />

I do agree that it needs some AC though.</div></div><hr />

I would personally love an Anathema.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, its because we were responding to the person that posted this topic; he already has BF and GBoS, which is a superior combination for agro, hp and ac.

Nobody said the &quot;dissing&quot; happened in THIS thread.  I never said my response was to anyone other than Krauth.  Maybe you shouldn't take my response out of context either.</div></div><hr />

I think it is agood to have a good solid 2 hander aggro for him to have, which is the whole point of his post.   Since he is in a elemental+vt guild; with a  BF + GBOS combo, which I do admit is better aggro, he definitely will be susceptible to ripstoles due to the ratio of dual wield.  From looking at his weapon accesories, I am kinda torn between bloodied berzerker blade vs the arathema(fogive me for mispelling).  One has better aggro proc, the other has better stat.<br />

Ripostes aren't as bad as everyone leads them out to be.  His DW setup can last him a long ass ways into time.  Bf / Gbos &gt; anything pre time far as aggro goes.  I'd hold onto that setup for a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well technically BF/HG or BoC would be better than the GBoS but even with a fine steel sword the BF is gonna be great aggro.<br />
<br />
and as far as ripostes go i havent seen much of a difference since i got the BoW, im positive there would be some times in EP where a riposte for 2k on dual wield, which would happen more often, can come at an unlikely time and kill you whereas its less likely with 2 hander</div></div><hr />
