<br />
I had enough of comparisons and endless debate based on unequal bases. I took myself and a paladin and went to HoH.<br />
I located a Valorian Guard (you know, 'the one') and proceeded to get beat upon for close<br />
to an hour and a half. Logged it and ran it down through parser.<br />

There, I'm done.<br />
<br />
Draw any conclusions you'd like.<br />
<br />
My conclusion is that 1.5hour parse is no where NEAR enough to determine<br />
decimals in percentage 'tanking advantages' or the like.<br />
I'm quite convinced next time I run this (and I will) I'll get a different result too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Given these numbers, I honestly cannot see how anyone could claim to be able to perceive the difference between a Warrior and a Paladin tanking.  The numbers are so close to identical that it seems to fall within a reasonable margin of error.  The Paladin seems to be taking what, 11 more points of damage per hit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Magelo's please. The Paladin appears to be better equipped than the warrior.<br />
<br />
Buffed or not?<br />
<br />
And with the hit/miss percentage factored in<br />
<br />
Warrior average damage taken per swing with avoidance: 115<br />
Paladin average damage per swing with avoidance: 125.2<br />
<br />
Bout a 10% difference, considering it appears the Paladin has better gear. Paladins almost NEVER have better AC than a warrior unless the gear is that much better. That's why the Magelos are needed.<br />
<br />
Different parse, still the same old advantage... just maybe a percent lower, this parse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like DI=22 and the Warrior's &quot;-1 DI&quot; advantage amounts to about a 3% reduction in damage overall and accounting for much of the damage taken difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh in case anyone is incapable of the math, warrior mitigated about 5% more then the paladin, right on line with the dev idea that wars should mitigate 5% higher.  Seems the devs know how to get thier objectives on tanking differences at least = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Paladin took 109% the damage of a Warrior after you considered the fact that the Paladin has more shielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here's a quick question.  If let's say a Ranger took 109% of the damage of a similarly geared Paladin, would the Paladins feel that the Ranger was taking effectively the identical damage of the Paladin?  Or would they feel that the Ranger was enough behind their tanking margin that the Ranger needed an improvement?<br />
<br />
What I would expect the answer to be is that the Paladin would curse and shout that the Ranger was tanking far to closely to the Paladin and that it was effectively identical.  Yet for some reason when we're talking a 9% (or even 12% as some would argue, or 15% as others would argue) difference between Paladin and Warrior, it's too large a difference.  Why is that exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You also have to combine that with the fact that Warriors have more HPs, and also that guilds tend to gear up Warriors first before Knights.  The overall effectiveness is probably somewhere around 15-20%, and that's before discs.  While it doesn't matter on easy stuff, that's because it's easy.  A time ranger can easily tank PoP trash mobs but that does not intrude on the tank's role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh I see dae, post here because you can't post in the thread riddled with your innane observations because they've been proven wrong. here you're comparing the damage per hit and saying about 10% when earlier you were saying 12% (and this is closer to 9% not 10) <br />
<br />
9 is SOOOOO far away from 12.5. <br />
<br />
Find something else to argue about you two, this is fucking retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Average hit warrior = 230<br />
DB 102, DI 21<br />
Average hit 6.1 DI<br />
<br />
Average hit paladin = 241<br />
DB 102, DI 22.1<br />
Average hit 6.3 DI<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
An average of roughly 5 * DI is probably about as low as you are going to get in terms of damage mitigation. So at roughly 6 DI, the warrior tanks about 9% better in this parse, assuming the difference in average DI is valid and not an artifact of too small of a parse. As the DI portion becomes more and more of total damage, that percentage savings goes up. It will never be a dramatic difference, but will go up *slightly* as average hit goes up. It isn't a static advantage.<br />
<br />
The absolute lowest the difference would be (assuming the same hit %) is: <br />
<br />
 ([trunc(1*DI)+DB] * 52)/(trunc[(1*DI*0.95)+DB] * 50)<br />
 [trunc(22.1+102) * 52]/[trunc(21+102) * 50]  =<br />
 (6448/6150) = 5%<br />
<br />
<br />
and the maximum it would ever be is:<br />
<br />
 (trunc[(20*DI)+DB] * 52)/(trunc[(20*DI*0.95)+DB] * 50)<br />
 [trunc(442+102) * 52]/[trunc(420+102) * 50] = <br />
 (28288/26100) = 8%<br />
<br />
That of course assumes the warrior and the knight get hit for the same multiple of DI on average AND that the hit rate listed in the parse is pretty accurate. (hit rate is pretty easy to get close since it is a binary set) So against this mobs at this AC level, we can guess that a warrior will at best about a 8% advantage and at worst a 5% advantage, assuming the exact same mitigation table. Not really earthshaking, but there are a couple of assumptions in there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont even want to try and compare against scaling relative DIs (6.3/6.1). ;) Firstly, the parse isn't really long enough to give us any confidence in that small of a margin (some statistics guys would have to pipe up on this one, I don't know how to judge confidence in numbers or a standard deviation). Secondly, we have no way of knowing if the average DI for the warrior and knight would stay constant relative to each other. <br />
<br />
Would be interesting to see a 1300-1400 AC warrior and knight do this exact same parse. It would also be interesting to see a parse against a mob with a higher DI relative to DB as is common in newer content. <br />
<br />
It's alot more complex than saying warriors have a 9% bonus, which this parse seems to indicate. That bonus is going to scale across several factors and can be both smaller and larger than this parse would indicate. I know this parse was not meant to be an authoritative answer to the question of &quot;what is the difference between a warrior and a knight&quot; and I hope it isn't taken that way either and we end up seeing &quot;9% difference!&quot; plastered all over threads for the next 6 months. The 12.5% difference argument is already stupid enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd like to see a comparative parse done on some red con kyv's in kod`taz or qvic.  Think that would be an interesting parse to see :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, the one thing we should have taken from this is that stating absolutes even based on parses is iffy business at best. What we do know is that Warriors recieved a &quot;-1 DI&quot; improvement and at the very most its less than a 5% reduction in total melee damage taken.<br />
<br />
I'm of the opinion that at level 65 players wear a variety of equipment and we can't say that a level 65 Knight can't tank any mob where Defensive is not a decisive advantage.<br />
<br />
Which leads me to the torturious conclusion that Warirors owe their greater opprotunity to MT to their disciplines. Everything else CAN be matched.<br />
<br />
It is for this reason many Warriors are leary of Knights getting a Defensive-like discipline. Combine that with say stuns effective to level 70 mobs or improved healing and Warirors could easily be /lfg (looking for a game).<br />
<br />
It would be nice if someone would compare Paladin healing with Shaman healing when not using canni. I'm rapidly getting the impression that Knights are adequate Tanks and that Paladins have other powerful tools like Root and heals which in fact do assure them of an add tanking raid role.<br />
<br />
With SoE looking at these issues, material misrepresentations are going to be swept away. In the process, it would be a shame if actual deficiencies got overlooked and Knights did not get improvements actually needed to make them viable in the raid roles they have had for 4 years.<br />

Bullshit, they haven't been proven wrong at all. Not a single nay sayer has come up with a single shred of proof to prove me wrong, it's all claims. Even after completed invitations to show proof.<br />
And what I'm comparing here, is the same number that Brodda's parse called average damage per round.<br />
<br />
Come on dae be consistant!  Before you through gear advantages out the window and now you are demanding they be factored in!<br />
I'm asking for gear to be considered if the tanks are inequally geared. They were not in Brodda Thepp's parse by any large amount( I calculated average AC differences in several guilds at the level and came up with the same kind of differences), whereas they could be here. More bullshit coming from you with an eye to show how I'm &quot;talking out of my ass&quot;, which you've made very clear is your whole mission in life here, so I'm not surprised.<br />
<br />
You're asking about gear and buffs when it never crossed your mind when it comes to the parses you want to site.<br />
Haha... I haven't been proven wrong again. You're just talking out of your ass some more. Typical for you. I didn't ask for buffs in the other parse because noone could answer the question. As for gear, that very topic came up in that thread, so gee look, you're talking out of your ass.... again... that gear never crossed my mind.<br />
<br />
Keep spouting off the bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Graal et al, you're talking about mitigation like that's the whole story... it's not.<br />
<br />
You also have to look at avoidance, which is another portion of the warrior advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You also have to look at avoidance, which is another portion of the warrior advantage.<br />
<br />
If the number of landed hits on the Warrior is 50% and the number on a Paladin is 52% as these figures indicate, then the avoidance difference, while there, isn't particularly large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If the number of landed hits on the Warrior is 50% and the number on a Paladin is 52% as these figures indicate, then the avoidance difference, while there, isn't particularly large.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but it makes a bigger difference than you'd think.<br />
<br />
Warrior average damage taken per swing with avoidance: 115<br />
Paladin average damage per swing with avoidance: 125.3<br />
<br />
With both at 52% hit rate:<br />
<br />
119.6<br />
125.3<br />
<br />
As you can see, TWO percent takes the difference down from 10.3 to 5.7, a 4.6 change in abolute terms, or, almost cuts the advantage in HALF.<br />
<br />
I was startled to see the difference was more than i'd thought when I first found that out, myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When you're talking in a relative term comparing one class with another you need to compare thier raw differences with a base number like dmg per hit AND dps.  <br />
<br />
Saying a whatever is a percent better at x then a whatsnot is dumb<br />
<br />
Try this daem since you want to play math professor.<br />
<br />
a warrior mitigates x% of damage overall<br />
a paladin mitigates x% of damage overall<br />
<br />
Don't sit there and say advantage increases by 2% 18% or 1000quadruple %<br />
those are meaningless on thier own and do nothing to help anything.  if a warrior mitigates 2% of all damage and a knightdoes 1% you'll say he has a 100% advantage?  probably not because that does little because they are so close to each other.<br />
<br />
If a paladin mitigats 98% of all damage and a warrior 99% a warrior only has a very very small advantage even though the base difference is the same.<br />
<br />
Your flaw is trying to bring advantages in mitigation relative to each class and not relative to the damage which is the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I donno, it seems to me that in absolute terms the Paladin tanks far closer to the Warrior than the Warrior buffs compared to the Paladin.  *shrug*  Seriously, to make it any closer would make it identical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I find it strange/puzzling that warrior, a class solely dedicated to tanking, has to use a 3 minute disc to tank noticably better than the hybrid counterparts. It's not like warrior's are given any other abilitys anywhere near as useful as a spellbook is to the hybrid tanks.<br />
<br />
In other words, /agree Glatius<br />
<br />
I don't see druids or shamans healing as close to clerics as knights tank compared to warriors. You don't see any other class' nukes coming that close to wizard nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I assumed the 241 number was the average hit, and added 6 to it because more shielding in the Paladin's case resulted every hit reduced by 6 damage.  <br />
<br />
It's funny that people don't notice we get missed 2% more but they complain Paladins have Aura of the Crusader which gives them an extra 300 HP, which is what, 3% more HP on a top Paladin?  <br />
<br />
Tanking is the sum total of hp, avoidance, and mitigation.  Since we are better in all 3 categories it'd be strange if we have a significant advantage in any one category.  Also people tend to ignore the fact that a small increase in tanking ability drastically increases chance of survival when mobs start getting difficult.  Today best tanks have what, twice the HP and maybe take half the damage compare to the best warriors back when AoW was uber?  But a today's top tank tanking AoW, the chance of death is for all practical purposes 0%, as opposed to whatever it was back when 6K HP 1300 AC was the top of the line, divided by 4.  Small tanking increases makes much bigger gains on difficult content, before even worrying about discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It's funny that people don't notice we get missed 2% more but they complain Paladins have Aura of the Crusader which gives them an extra 300 HP, which is what, 3% more HP on a top Paladin? <br />
<br />
I don't complain that they have it.  I complain that they attempt to play it off as if it has no value.  They constantly point to the Warrior HP advantage, as an example, but then refuse to factor in things like Aura of the Crusader as being in any way a mitigating consideration.  They point to the Warrior AC advantage, which is relatively small given similar gear selections, yet want to insist that stun has no value.<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly okay with evaluating all the Warrior strengths and comparing them to the Paladin's weaknesses, just so long as all the Paladin's strengths when compared to the Warrior's weaknesses are also evaluated and added into the formula.  But frenquently it's a one sided comparison that is insisted on because spells are worthless and never used.  Hell we've even had Paladins attempting to claim that a 1 second cast time heal couldn't be used if they were tanking. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There's no doubt in my mind that AoTC is a mistake and unfairly bridges the gap that exists.  I mean if Paladins are meant to be that close in tanking why don't SKs get a similar line of buff too?  Paladins aren't supposed to tank better than SKs, the difference is supposed to be that Paladin can heal (and heal quite well) but SK can do more damage.  But to ignore warrior getting hit less 2% (which is ~4% less DPS taken) is doing the same things as the Paladins.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice any significant AC advantage.  If anything most of the difference in tanking was from the -1 DI.  This seems to be the result of shields though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">But to ignore warrior getting hit less 2% (which is ~4% less DPS taken) is doing the same things as the Paladins<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say I ignore it.  I would say that I find it extremely close and not anything justifiying any kind of Paladin &quot;upgrade&quot; in the tanking department.  We're supposed to have a slight edge, or even a little better than slight.  Yet people try to blow it up into this huge tanking gap that has to be bridged because Warriors have a horribly unfair advantage.  And I'm not seeing that.  I'm seeing a perfectly reasonable edge that is probably as small as it could possibly get and still be considered an &quot;edge&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The problem is the definition of 'slight edge' varies depends too many things, and most notably what you're fighting.  Ignoring discs for now, it'd take a much bigger tanking 'slight edge' for Warriors to beat a Knight's versatility fighting things that almost can't kill you (LDoN normal, XP grind in most PoP zones).  But on the other hand, even 5% better tanking means a lot when you're dealing things that can potentially one-round anybody and dishes out 2000 DPS over time (or 1K DPS for one group, such as Pixtt Annihilator).  <br />
<br />
Given that players are adverse to take risks, Warrior edge in tanking needs to be significantly greater at the lower end than the higher end, but this is very hard to actually implement.  Incite line is in the right direction, though.  Minimally useful for the high end, but extremely helpful for lower end warriors that do not have access to multiple procs, good procs, right click procs, and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Why are warriors supposed to have &quot;just&quot; a slight edge? Other pure classes don't have a slight edge, it's very noticable. All the time and not for just 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Not being contrary, I just wish to understand how we got to the point where warriors think that they don't deserve to have an &quot;always on&quot; advantage that is clearly noticable. I've mentioned this in other thread, but I've yet to see a responce. I find it hard to believe no one else considers this apropriate.</div></div><hr />

Our advantage in mitigation/hp should be obvious to the eye it's why i rolled a warrior.They can argue casually arrived at numbers all day,but, I see the differance most everyday I raid.It's just now about adequete imo.I've seen pallies fight content a little below them like in sol ro for example and take almost no damage.One of my wife groups...pally didn't need any heals was ridiculous hehe.<br />

Atm in EP's with no disc our strongest pally takes damage a little faster to the eye than I do and I ma.She could still tank most our targets with a little more healing imo.I prefer her to ma trash when she's on because in places like pow her distance aggro lock is a huge bonus.Our knights are at least as valuable as our warriors in raiding ep's closing the tanking gap would unbalance this for us.</div></div><hr />

What part of &quot;I agree&quot; and &quot;adequete&quot; was mislayed there.When I started I hated the idea of the defensive disc for a long time.I wanted an innate worthwhile mitigation advantage.Imo it's what defines the warrior class.The disc is deeply embedded into the game now with tactics and balancing and I think should remain.I certainly don't think the gap between knights and warrior's should be closed.I think the differance is FINE now.<br />
<br />
&quot;hear me roar&quot; wth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Sorry I must have read that last part wrong. In any case, I have to remember that sarcasm doesn't translate into humor very well on a message board.<br />
<br />
In any case, I believe the misalignment came because I believe the gap isn't noticable enough (undisc'd), which, if I'm reading correctly, you think it is. Therein lies our disconnect. Maybe at your level of the game the difference is noticable. However, due to the fact that knights have access to the same exact gear that warriors do, and the lack of a noticable innate tanking advantage, I have a hard time seeing the difference between a warrior and a knight except that knights have zero agro issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The hit/miss percentages were included just to show that warrior r/p/d does help avoid some hits. Its already included in the damage numbers stated.<br />
<br />
125/116 is a tad below 8% advantage. Not 9, not 10 or anything else that might have been mentioned.<br />
<br />
As for the 'magelo' and 'gear' references,<br />
the warrior is me, obviously, as that's what I wrote. And before anyone nitpicks, I did remove my RZ cloak to not have the 10 avoidance skew the parse numbers. Just as the paladin used his Vrex totem instead of VZ orb.<br />
The paladin is at a progression point exactly equal to me, with quite the same level of gear.<br />
As for the buffs etc, it's totally irrelevant, since this is a test investigating game mechanics. We're not interested in the dps output differential of a HoH mob at 2400 ac and 2600 ac. We're interested in the tanking differential between warrior and paladin, given the same circumstances.<br />
<br />
The paladin is not better geared. There is only 1 item I want more out of PoTime (ear ) and I believe he is missing 2 (ear and belt). Neither of us have Qvic access as of yet. I have 10 PoTime loot in this test, paladin has 11. On the whole scale we are pretty damn exactly the same geared, both of us concentrating on tanking.<br />
<br />
I know the paladin somewhat, and unlike many, he is acutely aware of his tanking performance and values it. He tanks a lot better than many warriors, and you know why? He buffs to around 2600ac, thats why.<br />
<br />
There is no tanking disparity regarding damage intake while the warrior remains undisced. You can not eyeball it in game. There is a parseable difference, and over time it will pan out to the warrior's advantage.<br />
When the warrior discs, he wins, hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Very few things are eyeballable in this game.  If I'm just eyeballing it, it certainly doesn't look like SK outdamages a Warrior (even though they ought to if using up considerable mana), and it doesn't look like Warriors outdamages a Paladin (even though we do).  <br />
<br />
Did the Paladin number take acount into the fact that the Paladin takes 6 damage less from every hit due to higher shielding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yes, the damage intake numbers for both are adjusted to reflect zero shielding.</div></div><hr />

Knights do have some obvious superiority based on versatility. While Rooting/stunning/healing or FD/snaring/DD are undeniably powerful often that power isn't needed. Warriors have more HP's and ~3% better mitigation due to &quot;-1 DI&quot;, but often this isn't needed either.<br />
<br />
When neither veratility or meat is a significant advantage (normal experiance groups/normal raid adds) all tanks are equally acceptable. This is how it should be.<br />
<br />
Only when SoE messes thing up by having group mobs or raid adds hit like Mack trucks, rendering Knights less capable than they should be, and requiring mob adjustment<br />
<br />
OR when players change their playstyle and party member no longer feel obligated to maintain aggro control and allow Wariors to build up aggro - requiring a class change<br />
<br />
does this tenuous balance become disturbed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">When you're talking in a relative term comparing one class with another you need to compare thier raw differences with a base number like dmg per hit AND dps.  <br />
<br />
Saying a whatever is a percent better at x then a whatsnot is dumb<br />
<br />
Try this daem since you want to play math professor.<br />
<br />
a warrior mitigates x% of damage overall<br />
a paladin mitigates x% of damage overall<br />
<br />
Don't sit there and say advantage increases by 2% 18% or 1000quadruple %<br />
those are meaningless on thier own and do nothing to help anything.  if a warrior mitigates 2% of all damage and a knightdoes 1% you'll say he has a 100% advantage?  probably not because that does little because they are so close to each other.<br />
<br />
If a paladin mitigats 98% of all damage and a warrior 99% a warrior only has a very very small advantage even though the base difference is the same.<br />
<br />
Your flaw is trying to bring advantages in mitigation relative to each class and not relative to the damage which is the point.<br />
<br />
No, pumilio, i'm comparing the two to each other, with avoidance AND mitigation, to get a true picture.<br />
<br />
As for my doing mitigation relative to each class and to each hit, that's not the right way to do it for two different differences, one being by just looking at mitigation, you can't calculate accurately avoidance differences, and number two, noone else does that either.<br />
<br />
Enough with your obsession of trying to pick apart everything I post any way you can.<br />
<br />
Glatius: I agree with you on the mitigation a bit too close, bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Okay, Igneous, you answered my question.<br />
<br />
This is a parse done after the crap has been farmed out of time, it's at that point where the gear difference closes.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Well Crystal ,keeping in mind overall class balance I think the tanking gap is pretty fair atm.It's a subjective opinion of course and relates only to my experience with pre-time/god content.It's not perfect by any stretch and not what I had ideally envisioned when I started playing.<br />
<br />
When I read the class descriptions starting out in eq I wanted to play a simple tough class to begin with.The idea of a dwarf warrior with a shield and axe/hammer was an appealing role play character for me.I assumed from the descriptions he would be a defensive monster significantly better able to absorb damage than the non- warriors around him.By significant I mean obvious to the eye.Clerics are obviously the most  powerful healers and wizards obviously exert the greatest burst dps.I wanted to do one thing well obviously -mitigate damage.For this I expected to be a narrowly focused specialist like clerics and wizards.I certainly didn't expect to compete with hybrids in any field except perhaps straight melee dps.I assumed when choosing thier role has a hybrid they opted for a lot of extra abilities forsaking thier purely physical characterisics.Of course i discovered then that there was little differance in the damage absorbtion abilities of a knight and a warrior.Groups didnt seem to think of them differantly for the majority of my pre- raid experience.The only factor that mattered was warrior aggro used to absolutely suck unless you were uber wielding eb weapons and the like.I found out one day I could get defensive and then for 3 minutes I could tank significantly better...this revelation sucked.What was supposed to be an innate advantage was something I was going to be able to press a magic button for once in awhile..It ran contrary to the simplistic warrior ideal.<br />
<br />
Anyways,out of my attraction to the ideal of playing a warrior I made another one at the behest of my guild...an ogre.The dwarf was 52 already so yeh it was silly,but, we didnt know that.The ogre was new mt and I got him to 53 in 10 days or so and soon after the guild died.Then Stromm opened and my wife had decided to play so we started fresh there.Had to make a warrior again hehe.Aggro on raids was hell till those droga weapons came out,they totally changed the game for me.There were no decent aggro holding weapons available to me till i camped those at 60 with some friends right after they came out.<br />
<br />
Sooo, fast forward with recent changes and things have greatly improved.I'm sure aggro is still tough when you're young and broke,but,better than before.Defensive has become so much a part of Gunnar and what he does I don't think about it anymore.The small mitigation bonus for warriors is not the ideal .However ,it does help to seperate warriors from knights when tanking.All of our warriors and knights who are anywhere near similar in raidtime and aa's tank the same stuff for groups everyday.They're pretty much interchangeable in our guild.A few warriors have a hp advantage(including GOD aa) the knights have superior aggro and extra abilities.I do seem to notice a reasonable differance now between knight and war mitigation on raids.It's not large undisc'd and easily made up for by a little more healing.I'm MA and I doubt there are many raid mobs we do that our strongest pally couldn't.I quite often tank without disc especially in POF when we're pulling nameds fast.The knights are always busy they contribute in lots of ways on raids.The only time the heaviest warriors get pref in a group is to tank somehing unusally hard that we're not used to.My groups like that often have knights in them/shrug.That is supposed to be our role as I understand it.<br />
<br />
Numbers are great for developers ,but, they mean nothing if they don't translate significantly in the game world.So yeh,maybe eq would have been a better place without ch,charm,defensive and warriors having better innate mitigation by far;but it's late in the day for that.Knights without regular groups need to tank to get picked up and encounters have been built with the expectation of defensive being used.Besides most warriors who have been playing for a long time have grown accustomed to defensive and that is at least as great as a new warriors dislike for the disc.<br />
<br />
So knights got to be happy too.Ours seem to be/shrug.It's better balanced for tanks than it has been for a long time I think ,so I'm happy.</div></div><hr />
