<br />
Saw the movie at midnight since it wasnt sold out and I was bored. <br />
<br />
I am wondering what others thought of the movie?<br />
<br />
While the visual effects and fight scenes were amazing I thought the movie left many many many questions un-answered, and I left the movie theatre even more confused then when I came. <br />
<br />
Did anyone else find the movie as &quot;unfulfilling&quot; and confusing as I did?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boofus</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I saw it also, I'd love to talk about it but I don't wanna spoil it for anyone else =)<br />
<br />
But it was definitly, definitly, intense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Saying that, they tried damn hard to top it. Best movie I have seen in a long time.<br />
<br />
Confused? hell, I walked out last night thinking I was half retarded, I couldn't even put a coherant sentence together for a good 20 mins after.<br />
<br />
So, yeah its pretty good.</div></div><hr />

Not gonna say anything further..  everyone needs a night away from eq for something else :) and im not gonna ruin it</div></div><hr />

I liked what they did, but it wasn't what i was expecting.  Definetly need to see it again.  And that ending made me wanna slay the warchouski (sp?) brothers.  Atleast its only august before the last one comes out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last 15 minutes was like flash backs/forwards/whatever<br />
<br />
And damn Neo, get your tongue out of her mouth for just a couple scenes , let the girl breathe.<br />
<br />
The plot.. WOW, kinda blew everything you thought you believed from the first one and shoved it out the door.<br />
<br />
Don't want to talk to much, spoilers can suck.  Maybe in a week or so we can discuss the plot and talk about spoilers :P<br />
<br />
I believe this movie to be one of the first sequels to be an independant film, you dont really need to have seen the first one since is disproves everyhting from it anyways.  Odd movie.<br />

I had heard a lot of bad mouth about it, so I went in with zero expecations, can came out happy to have paid my $5 a ticket for it.  I had a good time, was very intense.  I can't wait to see the final one =)<br />
<br />
I just wish the ending hadn't hit you so damn quickly.  Thought my nose was bleeding as I left the theatre.  Hopefully some more of the cool things will be explained next movie.  Like the wierd Dred lock guys, I know who they are, but what was their &quot;purpose&quot; as the film states?<br />
<br />
Any way, I enjoyed it.  For me it get 4.5 out of 5 Mango's =)</div></div><hr />

Supposedly this year anyway.  It also said that Matrix2 can be pretty confusing until you see Matrix3 which is supposed to pull it all together.  What do you think...wait til Matrix3 comes out then go check out Matrix2 at the dollar theatre, then go see Matrix3?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I wasn't that impressed with it.  I didn't have a lot of expectations going in since I do know it's hard to top an original idea like the Matrix.... but seriously.  Yeah, the fight scenes were cool.  Yeah, the special effects rocked, but honestly... give any person $300 million and he'd be able to hire folks to put on great special effects.  Money = special effects.  Story = what makes a director good.  The money was there, the story was not, so in conclusion I was very disappointed with the Wachouski brothers.<br />
<br />
Is it worth the money?  Yes.  Does it have really cool fight scenes?  Yes.  Is there any point to the fight scenes (relevance in the story)?  Not really.  Is there any &quot;story&quot; to really speak about, aside from the fight scenes?  Not really.  Was it a movie worthy of any of the attention it is getting?  Not really.<br />
<br />
I guess I was also kind of put off by Time magazine devoting 8 pages to the movie and video game.  It's cool for a magazine to devote that to a movie, but not a movie that is owned by the same company as Time magazine (Time Warner Communications).... there should be laws against that kind of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I thought they did a great job of extending the story.  Will definitely have to watch it a couple  more times to get all the details.  <br />
<br />
I don't think expectations could have possibly been any higher for the action scenes and special effects, and they delivered in a big way.<br />
<br />
Two thumbs up from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awsome fight scenes!  I go for the fight scenes.<br />
<br />
Story was good, kinda confusing.  Think they went too fast and/or was trying to confuse folks.  <br />
<br />
Btw, did anyone stay till after the credits?  Theres a preview of Matrix 3 after all the credits have rolled.  The credits run for like 5 mins too :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reso</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you thought there was no story maybe you should pay closer attention. <br />
There was a lot there and maybe some of you didn't quite pick it up the first time around. <br />
<br />
I didn't really like it when I first saw it but now I realize what happen - I think I need to see it again =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone of my friends who told me they get the movie had trouble explaining it, and I call b.s. on them hehe. <br />
<br />
Let's face it. The movie was riddled with issues on philosophy, existence and &quot;choice&quot;, and in my opinion turned a cool idea like the matrix into a boring 2 hours. Fight scenes were cool, but I think they tried to merge intense action with a story and in turn made a bloody boring movie. Nobody imo cares about Neo's love story with Trinity, or the underlying principles of the matrix'es design by the architect, or psycho mind bable from the oracle. <br />
<br />
Cool frickin fight scenes, intense action, and a fresh original idea were what made the first movie amazing. The second one offers no new interesting concepts. <br />
<br />
The Matrix went from WOW COOL (the original) to HUH? I DONT GET IT (the sequeal).<br />
<br />
If I wanted to be confused about the meaning of life, existence, choice and all that other philosophical crap I would have gone to church. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and whats up with that rave scene thing in Zion? No wonder machines conquered humanity, yall' are a bunch of tree huggin dancing hippies. Instead of dancing around like fewls bash some agents in the face with lead pipes!<br />
<br />
Oh yea one more other thing. Neo flying around like Superman = mega gay.</div></div><hr />

If they do with 3 what I think they're doing then it should tie in great. I went to see this with four other people and they were all going huh? as well when walking out :p It's a movie that screws with your thought process, making you think about how you think, if that makes any sense ;p<br />
<br />
We never stayed for the credits to end, guess i'll have to see it again :p<br />

<br />
They seemed to enjoy trying to confuse people, rather than telling a story.  You talk about all this philosophical stuff that they talk about; how much of it will actually be explained?  and how much is just pseudo-intelligent talk?<br />
<br />
The plot is intentionally confusing, yes, and leaves plenty of room for interpretation.  The idea is that we'll all guess about what is actually happening, for the next few months till the next one comes out.<br />
<br />
(btw, yes I'm caught up in this too, just tryin to be devil's advocate.  I have plenty of guesses as to what is going on, just tryin to point out there were holes).</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the story, I wish they had been a little more straight foreward.  Too many riddles.  Over all, I liked the different directions (sub plots are fun!).  Editing wise, I think things could have been streamlined a bit.</div></div><hr />

I don't think so.  If they had still been in the matrix, Neo could have seen the code, and knocking out a bunch of robots wouldn't have incapacitated him.  I don't know why he was able to stop them though.  I imagine it will be explained in the 3rd movie.</div></div><hr />

The thing that confused me the most was Agent Smith, in the first movie he wanted to be &quot;free&quot; and now he is. However, he admits to Neo that Neo destroyed him, and he is no longer an agent but he is still after Neo ? /Boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was kinda torn when I saw it.  On the one hand, the effects were totally sweet, some of the things they did with the story were cool, and they finally let carrie ann moss grow some hair.  On the other hand, I was really disappointed in that matrix2 didn't seem as well made as the original. (lots of pointless scenes).  The movie would have been just as effective IMO if they'd skipped going to zion and skipped the whole thing with the marovingion's (sp?) wife, along with a couple other scenes.  Aside from that, and the relatively cheesy dialogue, and the fact that laurence fishburne sucked in comparison to the first movie, I thought it was great.<br />

<br />
I heard there was a rumor floating around about a matrix within the matrix before the release of the 2nd one.<br />
<br />
Also, how would the architect and the oracle know what Neo is going to do if he isn't hard wired to the matrix?<br />
<br />
In the first one the oracle says “you aren't the one - maybe in another life&quot;. Then Agent Smith proceeds to put seven .50 bullets into Neo, killing him. If he wasn't in the 2nd level of the matrix wouldn't he have died? <br />
<br />
So much to think about! If you have any thoughts please post them hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The movie WAS NOT confusing.  The plot was extremely rich and full of tying together loose ends from the first moving, but unravelling some ends for the final movie.<br />
<br />
I walked out feeling totally invigorated by the well scripted, well designed plot (I was a Literature major btw and am highly critical of poor plotlines).  Philosophy, Ethics, Technology, ... if there had been ZERO special effects in the movie, if all those scenes happened off stage, the movie still would have been extremely wonderful.<br />
<br />
Right after the movie as I was walking out, the two people in front of my group were saying, &quot;that was horrible... none of it made sense... the first one was good, but that...&quot;<br />
<br />
If you didn't enjoy Matrix Reloaded, I suggest watching the first again, then immediately going and seeing the second again and focus very heavily on the dialogue.<br />
<br />
One of the best sci-fi ever...</div></div><hr />

OK i like resos way of putting it. Think of it like this the 99% never care but the 1% have enough power to ruin it for the other part of humanity. So all they do is give them the illusion of freedom with actually getting it. Still inside the actual matrix tube we saw neo in from the first one, but thinking they had got out and where moving around outside of the matrix. Which is why they destroy zion every once and awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Hulanta - fight scenes were nice but not needed. The technodance thing was kind of bazaar. But the story moved along nicely and had nice twists and answered some questions the first one brought up while introducing more. The special effects were not needed.<br />
<br />
We assume that they answer these questions in the next movie. I have my ideas where they story is going now but it seems that while matrix one was a movie with a beginning, building of action, climax, and conclusion - this stops halfway in the action - so we all have some idea how its going to proceed.<br />
<br />
We'll see who is right - Im not going to think of it much until then though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rich to the point of exuberance Hulanta :D.<br />
Maybe in book-form it would have been more clear in the directions the Matrix was in, what state it was in, and what point of refrence it was at ( first, second, inside, outside )...<br />
The dialogue maybe was enough to the point; but the audience was so overwhelmed in it at points ( like when Neo meets the Architecht ) that it was just lost.<br />
<br />
I'm no Literary Genius ( far from one ); but to be bombarded with as much technological philosophical mumbo-jumbo in the timeframe the scenes were in made it confusing to the &quot;average bear&quot;.<br />
<br />
Definately a &quot;watch at home a thousand times&quot; DVD. It's just too much :D</div></div><hr />
