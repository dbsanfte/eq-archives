Im gunna start off a new, fresh warrior, for one reason only.  To prove to people that warriors are the ultimate class.  And to prove more people wrong, im going to make him a wood elf.  Which stats would be the best to put into a wood elf warrior.  <br />
<br />
how much should i put into Dex, STA, AGI, and STR for my starting stats?<br />
<br />
<br />
This warrior will prove that warriors own it up :D<br />
<br />
Peace guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caeden</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ALL STA, possibly a few points into STR, because they are not the strongest race by any means, but STR is so easy to raise, so I'd do all STA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors, as everyone who reads these boards will agree, are about the player - stats can be maxxed, but at the end of the day how good you are is determined by you, not your race :)<br />
<br />
I love being a wood elf - wouldn't go back, ever. I am nothing more than a dead average warrior as far as gear goes - but I contribute to my guild, I help out on raids and with quests and I do my best to keep the robes alive :)<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nikka</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I choose wood elf for much the same reason you did, to be different, and because I didn't believe race mattered much at all. I've been playing her a year and a half now and wouldn't give her up for anything.<br />
<br />
As far as stats, it really depends on the quality of gear you'll end up with. It's very easy even as a wood elf to max stamina with raid level gear. Still, until you get to that point a little extra stamina will help. If I could go back and change my stats I'd put all the points in charisma, because it's the useful stat (for DI) not maxed unbuffed. However I'd have to agree with most and suggest stamina.<br />

Even with my gear, I can easily max my sta by many many points over.  My agi though....not so much.  Since AC is very important now, any bit you add will help.  I have friend who insist that agi helps with your avoidance too.  Maybe one day I can test that out...<br />
<br />
Cha is pretty simple.  Divine Intervention.  The higher YOUR charisma is, the better the chances of getting fully CH'ed when it fires off.  Unfailing divinity helps, but it's not the end all be all.  The more cha you have, the better your chances of survival.<br />
<br />
That being said, there is a TON of gear out there that will max your stats, some say your sta/str are really important, some say agi/cha.  If I had to go back and change, I'd make a RZ wood elf, and split points between agi/cha because I am a raid tank, and DI is very useful for me.</div></div><hr />

Back in my XP hunting days (before you could port yourself to anywhere in the game by clicking on a stone), I used to go days and days without seeing a town because forage always kept me fed.<br />
<br />
And I've lost count of the amount of times innate hide has saved me, or made life a lot easier (in the middle of a zone with no healer around and mobs all around you?  Go into hide and bind wound or sit and regen :) ).</div></div><hr />

Way back in the day (1999), I figured I'd always have a proccing weapon or two (go go SSoY!) and the common belief back then was that dex affected the proc rate.  It was an uphill struggle getting stamina over 100 way back then, but it was doable. Now, post 60, I don't have to worry about it so much any more (gear).<br />
<br />
Well, I haven't regretted it.  I think it all depends on how YOU play your character.  Your play style and skill equate to more than stats in most situations.</div></div><hr />

Wood Elf Warriors do rock though! I know I got picked on a bit as a little Elf but I could care less now. :)</div></div><hr />

i did 130sta/130str with mine. gess woodys dont get tat much to start with but if you could break 115-120sta i'd say race not as important *shrug* but base hps are base hps, and the fattys will always have more. in fact, with only ND3, my base hps at 64 still beat my guilds normal main tank, who is a barbarian. marignally, but they do. Wood elfs are cool though, be what you wanna be and be happy with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So long as you enjoy the race and can kick your share of arse, go for what makes ya happy!  I personally wouldn't want to put points into agi at creation, tho.  Wood elf wars already start with 100 base agi.  I've been a wood elf war for over 3 years, and enjoy it.  :D</div></div><hr />

I agree pick the race that you love.  Gnomes rule.  I put all my points into sta and I am happy with it.  I dont so much worry about cha but I play mostly in a one group setting with my cleric twoboxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who you listen to in this thread depends on what your plans for your warrior are.  If you plan to power to 65 and join a raiding guild, then CHA is probably a reasonable choice.  If you are going to level normally, and expect to spend most of your character's life in exp groups or low-end raids, then CHA will do absolutely nothing for you and STR/STA would be much more useful.  CHA is only useful for tanking very high-end PoP mobs, which the majority of warriors won't be doing.  <br />
<br />
When it comes down to it though, starting stats are not at all important at any level of the game, so don't sweat it.</div></div><hr />

I picked him because I didn't see too many on my server at all and I wanted to be different.  Yes, I get mistaken with a ranger all the time too.<br />
<br />
Now, though, I've recently joined a guild and the three highest level warriors are WEs.  LOL, go figure. :p</div></div><hr />

I would not put points in charisma as DI works well enough at present and is rarely necessary at all.  Then again, I'm doing high-end content but not end-game content like elemental planes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wood Elfs are cool though; I just wish there were more people on Test to hunt with :D Throw a majority of your points into Stamina, and throw some into strength since they're so low on strength to begin with ( being encumbered from wearing your own gear + bags of weapon=bad :D.<br />
<br />
And don't pick Karana as previously mentioned. My halfy worships karana and the day we rescued Karana from Agnarr I wanted to send my JBoW sideways up Karana's candy ass for being the loser he is</div></div><hr />

We also have hide, the highest base Int of all the other warriors, and innate ULTRAVISION (what is simply uber, cause it owns infravision; it is still possible to get it through itemisation or spells, but innate ultravision is something very, very valuable).  And we have also the most sucky base stats of all the other warriors (even a bit worse than gnomes !), but, on the other side, it gives some more challenge. And we are MEAN :D. I think I made a mistake by putting all my points into dex / agi when I created my war, and a bigger one by choosing to be agnostic (besides that I cannot wear Fierce Heraldic, I have to admint that being agnostic while being a Dark Elf helps a lot when you travel), but at the end game it is not that bad, I'm still far from being maxed in sta / str, but it can be done. If I had to do it over again, I would put 10 into str, 15 into sta and choose to worship RZ but well, it wouldn't have changed much in the end anyway.</div></div><hr />
