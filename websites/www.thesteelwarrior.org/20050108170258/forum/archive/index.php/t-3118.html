Well my guild is on the point to start grinding on RZtW's boot till he falls.<br />
Gonna take a lot of tries but we'll get there.<br />
My question is should i go for a BoW or keep DW'ing? (Actually i got BoC and CHSD and GBoS in bag).<br />
I see people post about how adding a stun to their BoW gives a noticable aggro boost... At one point if you had a BoW you were the king but now people seem to seek a little extra aggro ??<br />
I'd like to be set on weapons and stop thinking about which to try to get etc.<br />
So is BoW the way to go or should i try to be lucky and get a BF when it decides to drop for us?</div></div><hr />

Personally I'll be oh so happy to turn mine in when I get my BoW. Blade of War is DEFINATELY an upgrade for you, so grab it if you can. You will not find a better weapon till you kill Rallos Zek in time and see a Darkblade of the Warlord (which would probably go well with the Rathe 1HS weapon).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read the few thraids about this in this forum, you'll see that most people with BoW use it most of the time and that DW is only situational.<br />
<br />
BoW will outaggro/outdomage most DW combo, and you'll be less riposted than with DW (wich can help with mobs hiting for 3k in elemental planes).</div></div><hr />

Go for teh BoW. 2 Warriors in my guild have them now and they swear by them :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here, I'm banking my DKP for a BoW (and working on my Deepest Guk points for Force of Ykesha).  My dual wield weapons are BoC and GBoS atm (bank/destroy the CHSD, GBoS is at least as good for agro), but I'd gladly turn my BoC over to the guild when I get my BoW.   BoC has never really impressed me, though it holds agro for me better than pre-EB.  We all know that's not saying a lot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Hategiver, CHSD, Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled ( procs like mad ) and a Blackout in my bag but for 99.x % of the Time I am using my BoW for the aggroparts.<br />
<br />
But like all the above weapons also a BoW has a random generated Proc so the addition of an Ykesha proc would raise the chance of a proc early in fight for better aggro. I think you can't have enough chances for fast and steady aggro.</div></div><hr />
