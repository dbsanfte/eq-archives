<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I have picked up a frostreaver yesterday.  My question is, is frostreaver (plus an anger 3) a viable aggro option?  I have also added a bunch of mini question on the bottom for everyone to get back to me on.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4687<br />
<br />
1)I know there are tons of other 2hander options out there i can aug with anger 3, for pure aggro purposes is it better to anger 3 aug a 2 hander that either has innate stun proc or taunting/enraging blow proc in the weapon?  &lt;-- Example will frostreaver with anger 3 outaggro bloodied berserker sword with anger 3 or the sword of ssra?(judgement of ice(125ddstun proc) vs rune3 vs serpend bite) <br />
<br />
2)I also have a greatstaff of thunder in my bag, is that better than the frostreaver interms of aggro?  is planar stun resistable at level 55+<br />
<br />
3) lastly, when looking at a 2 hand aggro weapon, what is more important? combination of life/AC/ratio or innate proc?<br />
<br />
Sorry to bombard everyone with so many questions, I do plan on anger3 auging a 2 hander when find the right one.  I just want to make sure the aug will not be wasted.  I hope you all can help me to decide wheather if i should anger aug or dd aug my frostreaver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can`t answer all, but greatstaff of thunder is nice agro for it`s price. I`d say it`s better then frostreaver and a similar type weapon duel wielded. And as for the stunn landing on lvl55+, stunn is good agro if the mob resists it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use frostreaver quite often for aggro and it works already really fine with an ykhesha augment in it. So not bad at all<br />
<br />
but the greatstaff of thunder + anger 3 should out aggro it. the lower dly makes it better for hit/miss aggro although the stun doesn't have dmg in it ( well, maybe you lose ~90 hate on proc compared to Frostreaver ).<br />
<br />
Well having them both. I have to admit I only use frostreaver when going for 2h..</div></div><hr />
