<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have a good link to a custom ui thats good for warriors? Sorta getting bored with the default one I have so any suggestions to a new one would be better, i've looked around and can only find ones giving examples of their spell book effects and how they can open and close on their own in that ui! heh. So if ya got a screenshot of yours, or a link to one - post it here and try to help me find something other then the default (hopefully this post will serve well for others who are tired of the default ui)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take your pick :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you want something different (and everyone and their brother uses SARS for some reason I can't fathom, personally), go to eqinterface and take a look at the KeizUI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sars 4 is fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't been real impressed with alot of the UIs I've seen.  Most of them take up too much screen (I want to see the game, not my buttons).  The only mod I have is a Hotkey bank mod that puts a couple bag slots and inventory slots on mine for clickys and weapon swapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Here's a screenshot of the UI I have constructed from various pieces at eqinterface.com (many of them have been modified by myself).  I like it because I also like to see as much of the game as possible, and all my windows are transparent or translucent.<br />

<br />
 Awesome!!!!!!! :D <br />
<br />
 Two thumbs up for the music selection, Mazzarek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like Tablets UI but that is just me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i dunno; SARS is just so simple to fuss with; even if i can't change the xml to move clickies round</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i guess i tried most of the UIs on eqinterface.com ^^ (plus some i've built)<br />
<br />
i'm now playing with the good ol' Quartz UI 1.6</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still like Kaori, even though it doesn't always get updated (but eventually it does!). I know there are better for specific classes out there, but if you have a lot of characters from all classes (like I do: 3 accounts), a middle-of-the-road, does-everything-okay UI like Kaori may be the way to go.<br />
<br />
I've tried SARS, and it's okay, but not my cup of tea. But then again, the reason why so many UI's exist is because there are so many different preferences out there. ;)<br />
<br />
Just go to www.eqinterface.com and pick the one you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i downloaded a mp3 compnent thing, unzipped it and dont know why it doesnt' work and not sure where to move it, have copied into the ui folder, the everquest folder and a few other places =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i use vert as a base with rex icons and tking buff windows across the top and i forget what spell slots. if you need more room alot have  different size windoes for different resolutions. just drop a resolution size and you may find it the right size.<br />
<br />
i also run at 0 transparency except on compas and hotbox so i can see the spells refresh in the hotbox and tell were im headed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used a modified version of the Lazareth UI. He doesn't play anymore so when patches break it I have to either ask for help or fix it myself.<br />
