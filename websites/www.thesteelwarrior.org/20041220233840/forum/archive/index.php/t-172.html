The SBoL is an 11/19 for me atm and the frosty is a 12/22 /w proc.  Which wep should I put in my primary hand for better aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell off your SBoL, its a nice ratio, but nothin else. There are a million posts just like this, check some of them out. BBoT and Frosty should be a decent aggro combo, but dont expect much dps from the bbot. They are both DD+Debuff making it decent aggro for the price. 46 is a good level to have aggro type procs on both of your weapons if you can afford. i dont think the dps aggro of sbol can beat the proc aggro of bbot, your going to have to test it out for yourself. A quest you can look into is the Praetor Blade of Debility quest in Seru. Its not good dps wise but the proc is very good from what ive heard. a Frosty + Bbot/PBoD would probly be your best bet for aggro unless you have a lot more cash. <br />

<br />
Sell the SBoL, pick up another decent aggro 1hander.  Something like a Wavecrasher, BBoT, or even the BCA (barnacle coverd Axe), you wont regret it.<br />
<br />
Aggro procs are your friend, the more you have, the better off you will be.</div></div><hr />

Or put SBoL in main and Frostbringer in offhand.  It really shouldn't make much difference at lvl 46.  Those weapons are far above what is needed to hold aggro at that level.  For pure aggro though Frosty main for more proc's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep your shortblade of lightning. Enjoy it at level 46. It's seriously good and should be able to hold aggro quite well over what most other level 46 types have.<br />
<br />
Mainhand Frosty when you're sure you want a lot of PROCS to get aggro. <br />
<br />
Pick up a black blade of tormenting or a barnacle covered axe CHEAP in bazaar when you can save some extra plat, and then if you EVER find yourself in a position to REALLY need a ton of proccage swap in the other proc weapon.<br />
<br />
But until you start using Defensive and Evasive a lot, your reliance on procs shouldn't be too pronounced.<br />
<br />
If you're having trouble with aggro, it's not YOU. It's your group. Talk with them. <br />
<br />
Make sure they're not standing on the mob's toes. Make sure they're evading or feigning death or NOT chain stunning. Make sure they're not casting snare before the mob gets into the camp. Make sure they're not trying  to cast slow 5 times after taking 5 tries to debuff the mob. Make sure they're not chain casting nukes and not even bothering with concussion.<br />
<br />
AND, above all else, don't get too frustrated with bouncing aggro in the planes. It happens. A lot.<br />
<br />
AND, remember that if you're grouped at level 46 with a bunch of level 55+ toons, yeah, aggro is going to be HARD to hold. Levels and level-based DPS contribute a lot to that.<br />
<br />
IMO, your weapons are just fine right now. So play some and ENJOY them. I wish SBoL existed when I was your level.</div></div><hr />
