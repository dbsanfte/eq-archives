I find typically that if I go in against a group of three whites or a yellow and a white that semi-frequently I'll end the fight with relatively low health, the scrapper just can't take damage like a tanker.  Yet his damage output, while greater than the tanker, doesn't seem to be hugely greater than the tanker's.  And he doesn't have the ability to avoid the majority of the damage like a blaster or a controller.  So, obviously I'm missing something in the finesse department involved in playing a scrapper, any ideas as to what that might be?

Not knowing anything about your build's specifics, I'll let you know that your power problems become a thing of the past as soon as you ding 12 and can slot DO's for the first time. 11's a tough level, though, I'm expecting 21 to be the same.<br />
<br />
Defensive upgrades you can look for if you don't have them already are Stealth and/or Combat Jumping. Hopefully you'll have multiple slots in Focused Fighting and you haven't taken Agile.</div></div><hr />

I have stealth, but not combat jumping.  I have four slots in focused fighting, and I did take agile which I assume was a mistake?</div></div><hr />

<br />
most of the soloing scrappers i know are regen scrappers, not super reflexes.  and arguably the flame tanker is the best large group soloer in the game, so its hard to compare apples to oranges.<br />
<br />
post your build sir :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Regen seems to be the ticket with scrappers.. personally i'm on a katana/dark powers scrapper skill tree and i'm seeing now ( only level 10 though so YMMV ) ... my soloing power is slowly diminishing.<br />
<br />
situational at best I can solo really well ( pure melee fights of any number I can rip through like butter ); but against mobs like Circle of Thorns i'm humbled quite quickly.<br />
<br />
Quite a few friends I hunt with have most of their DO enhancements now and it is like night and day to them ( they say ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shikarii<br />
<br />
Look me up in game.  I'd enjoy duoing (or added to a group) I could use my fire/emp controller - should be a fairly effective combo.<br />
<br />
Playtimes are usually 8-12 central time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also Glatius; scrappers are pure evil towards their endurance bar ( i'm sure you've noticed that too :D ). later on when you can get to the stamina skill ( forgot the line it's on ) .. i've heard it helps TONS ( although it comes near 16th level ) towards using more skills especially if you've gone for offensive abilities.<br />
<br />
Comparing D'Orazio to my Tanker Bullitooth Tony; Tony has quite the offensive set going plus defensive power ( Invul ) and the fights he plows through is awesome...he can now ( at level 7 ) can take on trio's of orange cons whereas my scrapper can also take on a comparable level/number of mobs but needing at least 2 catch a breath's to not dry out the bar plus a health clicky to be not left in the orange ( got nasty once in Perez; fookin CoT dudes hiding out in the bushes ganked me after tearing up some clocks )</div></div><hr />

EDIT:  At level 11 he's doing better than he was at level 10, but so far I'm still not impressed with his ability to solo.  I would hazard the guess that a blaster would do better and I feel like my SS tanker did better at that level and my fire tanker does better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stamina is in fitnes, and its avalible at 20 (provided you have taken 2 other fitness powers). <br />
<br />
And actually I have fewer fitness problems with Kailyn than I do with Hot Pepper. Then again K has all of 3 attacks, HP has 3 ranged and 3 AE ranged.</div></div><hr />

 I personally don't consider any power you take at this moment to be a 'mistake', as such, because there's going to be rebalancing going on as time goes by, and what was underpowered may become powerful.<br />
<br />
 That said, ranged damage is about 1/3 or 1/4th of melee damage - so to me it was much more important to take care of melee damage, since the AI on the mobs doesn't do real well at shoot and scoot tactics. I took Agile, but I didn't add any slots to it.<br />
<br />
 I've personally (just dinged 15) slotted mine like this:<br />
<br />
 Storm Kick - 4 slots<br />
 Thunder Kick - 4 slots<br />
 Crane Kick - 3 slots<br />
 Focus Chi - 2 slots<br />
<br />
 Focused Fighting - 3 slots<br />
 Agile - 1 slot<br />
 Practiced Brawler - 1 slot<br />
<br />
 Jump Kick - 2 slots (Yeah, I'm obviously not a min/maxer.  :p  )<br />
 Stealth - 3 slots<br />
<br />
 Brawl/PPS/Sprint/Rest - 1 slot each</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but I was thinking that since I tend to take on groups that are range damage heavy over melee damage, when I can find them, it would be useful to avoid as much of the damage from buckshots and gunners as possible.  I probably won't be increasing it any further, and stealth is my next big slot target.</div></div><hr />
