<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not trying to challenge anything, I'm just looking for the information.  It's well known among shaman and (hopefully) warriors that the benefit of high agility is very very low.  There are a few members in my guild who swear that agility makes a huge difference, and I'd like to have some parses to show them.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I've searched high and low on the Shaman board, and the Warrior boards (both this and the old one) for the actual parses.  Can't find it, although I find many statements about them.  I think this information needs to be found and put into the library or something.  Can anyone give me a hand looking for this information?<br />
<br />
And before anyone asks, I seem to be inept when it comes to setting parsers, and I do not have the resources (read: characters) to test and parse it myself.</div></div><hr />
