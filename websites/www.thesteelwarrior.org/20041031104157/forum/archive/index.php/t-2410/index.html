<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I only currently carry 6 weps, 1 of which is a bow (I tend to pull alot)  Lately, I have had to justify having all of them considering all my armour needs.  So what do you consider to be the essentials that every warrior should carry and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Truncheon of Doom......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">High aggro setup, preferably 2h in PoP<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Are you looking for types of weapons or specific weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Slow<br />
Snare<br />
embalmers/bandage summoner<br />
bow (traded with a kicken range stat item if you prefer it for tanking)<br />
aggro setup<br />
dps setup<br />
<br />
I have carried them with my all my career, and never regretted the loss of a full bag of space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I had a ToD I would carry at, and I am frequently tempted to go out and buy another snare whip which I would carry too if I ever get round to it.<br />
<br />
The essentials tho is a set of weapons for taunt and a set of weapons for DPS, doesnt matter if they are 2 handers or 1 handers, just whatever the best you can come up with for each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">-Aggro Weps<br />
-Low Aggro DPS<br />
-Snare Whip<br />
-ToD<br />
-Bandaid Knife<br />
-Bow<br />
<br />
I also carry 2 Blood Points and a Runed Blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigrr7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't forget a tash stick, and OT hammer ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">- A weapon combo for DPS<br />
- A weapon combo for Agro<br />
- A bow for pulling<br />
<br />
Then if u have<br />
- A weapon to slow (ghetto)<br />
- A weapon to snare (ghetto)<br />
<br />
The rest are not weapons, they are utility stuff in the form of a weapon<br />
(see OT hammer, bandage knife)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Earthshaker! Fun for those raids where you use AE :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I second the Earthshaker vote. Great for Corinav and Pere ring. Also huge fun if you pop back to VT for shits and giggles and train 20 quas and zols. Gotta love breaking 20 mezzes at once!<br />
<br />
Worker's Sledgemallet - Saved my ass several times, and it's only a 30 second run to the PoK book now<br />
<br />
Gnoll Hide Lariat - For Rathe Event (not as needed now they gimped it by upping the regen)<br />
<br />
Some decent ratio procless 2hander, preferably with good resists.<br />
<br />
A high AC shield, for those rare times you prepare for /shielding<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow weap, Snare weap, Primal if you aren't atk capped, bandage procer, long distance bow (or ragefire bracer)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Uhrlik, more types than specifics.   I've got a limited budget, which has put my weapons pretty far down on the list.  I pretty much only have what I've picked up here and there except for the GSoT which I got at the bargain price of 3kpp.  I'm just trying to figure out what set up I need to keep for OT/DPS really, since I have the GSoT for when I MT.  I've been in alot of situations recently where I've been OT with another warrior who has a GSoT, so I can't equip it without getting ping pong aggro.  But my DPS weps really suck when I'm trying to pull an add off of a caster.  I have a couple of procing 1HS.  I thought might try those cause the MTs GSoT would probably out aggro them.  Also I'm trying to figure out my best DPS with the weps I have.  Finally I just want to know what other warriors feel is essential, like the snare whip. Means I've got to come up with more pp though /sigh.<br />
<br />
P.S. Oh yeah, and I've mentioned this before, but I took over a year and a half off when I had my daughter, so treat me like a newb when it comes to specifics, like primal, what is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am a greedy bastard and hance I am trying to have the following set up:<br />
<br />
Dual Wielding DPS<br />
Dual Wielding Agro<br />
2 Hander DPS<br />
2 Hander Agro<br />
Slow Weapon<br />
Snare Weapon<br />
Bandaid Weapon<br />
Tash Weapon<br />
<br />
Bout 10 Weapons! hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Primal = any number of weapons that dropped in Sleeper's Tomb. If the Sleeper has been awakened on your server, Prismatic weapons drop in lieu of Primal. Prismatic weapon = Primal weapon with minor statistical differences and new graphics. Primal weapons proc Avatar which = +100 ATK/STR/DEX/AGI.<br />
<br />
You need a key to get into Sleeper's Tomb. Key components drop off of Yelinak (Skyshrine), Sontalak (Western Wastes), Klandicar (also WW), Zlandicar (Dragon Necropolis), and Lendinaria (west Temple of Veeshan). Also I think Vindicator (Kael) drops a key component. Component goes to Jaled Dar's shade in Dragon Necro for a ST key.<br />
<br />
Ya need a raid to get Prismatic weapons unless you're very well equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ones I carry that I think are essential:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I carry my aggro weapons, my primal, Rocksmasher for when I absolutely don't want aggro, my ToD for ghetto slow (almost never used), and my Epic for parades :)</div></div><hr />
