The guild that I am currently in is gearing up for Emp and VT, but we don't have the numbers keyed as of yet to kill Emp or raid VT.<br />
<br />
Yes, my magelo is correct and I am time flagged as I was a twink at one time in the top end guild on our server, but now I am in a lower end guild where I can have some fun.<br />
<br />
So anyways, any suggestions would be helpful.</div></div><hr />

Shoulders are a tough slot to get something decent in IMHO; especially at the level you're at now. Those pauldrons ain't that bad overall and will last you until you're getting sick of going to VT. PoP wise; the choices are, well, kinda bleh until Elementals.<br />
Plus; doing the Strength of the Elements quest is about, well, a lateral move in gear.</div></div><hr />

You say, 'I wish to undertake the test of protection.' <br />
<br />
Telkorenar says 'My fire will protect you if you are strong enough to endure this test. A ruby tear like my flames, an emerald tear, like a forest ready to burn, an emerald symbol and a platinum symbol are what I seek. With these I will forge pauldrons unlike any you have ever seen mortal. Go now and seek out what I desire. <br />

Easy to get, and well worth the effort. Tears drop from Dozekar the Cursed (7 day pop I think) and symbols drop from mini's located in various locations throughout east wing of ToV from mini named. All of them are easily doable by a single group of 65's with a warrior a slower and a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could camp the chest room in Plane of Mischief for Grand Pauldrons of Study (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62353) and then slap a 10 AC aug from BBM in there.  <br />
<br />
That would effectively double your AC  and add 3 more resist types for the cost of 4 STR and a small unbuffed decrease in HP from trading 12 STA for 55 raw HP. And really the Raw HP will leave you better off when you consider that your probably still hitting your stamina cap when buffed.</div></div><hr />

Problem with doing Doze is it's killed within 5 minutes of popping on Lanys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As for Doze, collect the other 3 pieces.  You can always try to buy a MQ for the pauldrons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Barbed Rubicite Pauldrons (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27943) is another alternative, though I've never been too fond of them myself.  The -10svd is a big turn off for me, and the price for these is usually ridiculously high.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another choice you might have is Yttrium Studded Mantle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=30551) if you can talk some people into farming him for stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seru is a great option if you can find someone on the downlow with a key. With your gear and AAs you could probably tank him with 6ish clerics and bring him down with 3 groups. <br />
<br />
Just make sure those six clerics+bard+C5+beastlord buffs for mana regen can handle an hour long 3-4 second(based on your magelo) CH rotation. The trouble with Seru is, much like Dozekar, he is killed within a few huors of spawning. <br />
<br />
I have killed Dozekar with 3 1/2 people (boxed cleric) and Seru with 7 people (2  hour fight). Both mobs are hard to catch up, but worth the effort IMO.</div></div><hr />

25 AC, 70 HP...I think, think seriously about throwing another 510 AP into it and adding 10 ac, that is what I am looking into as an upgrade over my Grand Pauldron of Study.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My shoulders drop from some of the first mobs you will see in VT. They are ok, and you will probably see em a lot.  If you think you will be in VT a lot, there are a few nicer shoulders that drop you might want to wait for. <br />
<br />
Also, /agree about the ferubi trash mob shoulders. Have seen em drop three times, all from just regular trash mobs. Twice in raid clearing to Zun`Muram Votal, and once in a 10 person goof around. Up side to this is not having to spend any DKP or merit to get em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kept an eye on him and got him 4 spawns in a row and finally got a set, slapped on a 10AC aug and I am a happy little camper.<br />

<br />
Prior to the shoulders I am wearing now, I wore Strength of the elements shoulds.  They are 100hp and pretty easy to quest.  I think we used 1-2 groups for only one portion of the group.  Well worth it IMO, might wanna check out the quest.</div></div><hr />
