<br />
I did Sturdyness first because I felt my aggro was good and I'd rather have 500HP's right away. WA4 and Sturdyness5 atm, so obviously the correct answer is both - chop chop slacker.<br />

<br />
Anyway, if you are doing much in GoD, the extra HP would probably be more beneficial. If you have agro problems, then WA. Considering you have level 3 of each, I would probably go with Sturd5 just to get it out of the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WA is more bang for your buck IMO.  At the very most do sturdiness 4 before WA.  Personally I did Sturdiness 2, then WA4.  Not sure where I&quot;m going from here since I still have a lot of pre-GoD stuff to get.<br />
<br />
For a time-geared tank Sturdiness 5 is an upgrade of less than 1% hps for 20 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakaris</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did WA5 when I got GoD, had 30 saved! Huge increase on procs. And I figured I can get 60 in no time and before I start to raid high end GoD, where I need the 500hp. Just sucks I slack a bit and got Sturdy4 atm!<br />
<br />
But I defo would recommend doing WA5 and then sturdiness... but then again it depends on where you raid and how good your gear is.</div></div><hr />

I sort of agree, yet I don't.. my choice was based more on what was the more painful to accomplish, I decided to get Sturdiness out of the way.</div></div><hr />

More than one tank on my server has been pleased as punch with WA4, and then bought WA5 only to watch the benefits vanish entirely, putting their procrate back where it was before they bought the first level.  Is this common?<br />
<br />
The only other thing they have in common that I can recall is lack of any Combat Effects gear.</div></div><hr />

10 bucks says they didn't parse it before or after and their impressions are pretty much worthless.  Don't mean to be harsh, but 90% of the things people say about procrate are wrong because they are trying to get a feel for it by looking at their chatbox instead of parsing, which is impossible with something that is as variable as procrate from fight to fight.</div></div><hr />

I'll give ya that, and if you're grinding hard, you can make a pretty good argument that the order you buy your AAs is pretty much irrelevent because you will have them all eventually.  If you're getting both skills the order you do them in isn't too important.  I still go for cheap stuff before expensive stuff unless one is dramatically more useful than another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.  I parsed mine to gauge the dps difference of SEWS vs Cudgel with new procrates taken into account for WA4 (2.43 ppm, now).  I dont have the infoz for any of them, so I cant do the parses for 'em, or I'd have a solid answer one way or the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you already have a good agro setup and dont feel you really &quot;need&quot; more agro then get sturdiness 5.<br />
<br />
If you are having trouble getting or keeping agro, then get WA5 first.<br />
<br />
Personally I will finish sturd5 first. Got no problems with agro, but have a problem with running out of HP occasionally :p</div></div><hr />

I have no problems with that...  I consider that the Ablative shields while the loop gets stabilized after a tank dies...</div></div><hr />

<br />
if youre a guilds MA, even without aggro problems i would reccomend weapons affinity first, the aggro increase and thus the dps increase by everyone else is pretty big</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love em both, but WA 5 kicks ass. Last night we were doing Rallos, the pull was kinda eh, two clerics died immediately due to AE Rampage. Seeing as how we had 6 clerics, this was a little skery. But you gotta keep on keeping on, and I fired disc and tried to pretend it was all good. About 50% in a couple kiters were dead and I started to get worried about disc falling, so I switched to a shield in offhand for the extra AC/HP. At the same time I had everyone go all out on discs/etc. At 20% my DI fired and I started to get really worried, there were no clerics with time to cast a new one. So at that point I turned off attack completely and just tanked with taunt and incite.<br />
<br />
I never lost agro.<br />
<br />
My magelo is to the left, but summary of agro generation was:<br />
<br />
1) GBoS with Anger 3 + innate Stun<br />
2) BoC with Anger 3 + innate EB<br />
3) Call of Sky (stun on both weapons)<br />
<br />
The better geared warriors in my guild proc so damn much now we don't even bother putting them on the boss mobs, they wait for their turn in rotation to come up, otherwise you can easily have 4-5 procs in 10s and get yourself killed.<br />
<br />
I did Sturdiness 3, WA 3, Sturdiness 4/5, WA 4/5. In hindsight the last two points of Affinity is probably more useful than the last two points of Sturdiness.</div></div><hr />
