<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A Pally friend taunted me recently so I decided to go smack him upside the head in baz arena. <br />
<br />
Desite his gear being a little inferior to mine, I was expecting to get my ass handed to me; I run in, he tries to blind, root, stun, pimp slap me with a smoked kipper etc. Nothing landed during the whole fight xcept 2 stuns. I wasn t buffed but had optimized MR to 150; it proved enough: He died with me at 80 % hp. Ok, next pally, same story.<br />
<br />
After that I thought this was getting fun so I tried an epic wizard friend. Remembering how quickly I have been pummeled into the ground by wizards previousely, I wasn t expecting to go anywhere with this 1. Of course he tries to snare as we enter, then shadowsteps like a madman; nothing would stick and I just ended up chasing him all over the arena untill he died with me at full hp :p Didn t even get a lure fired off. <br />
<br />
Now it has been a while since I duelled anyone (largely due to dying to everyone I tried it with horribly; except monks of course), but it seems with 150 MR you can really start beating the snot out of some of those snooty casters/hybrids :p GEAR! I may even try a SK next...........(Loading... pls wait)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fools_Errend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why would a pally try to DD you to death?<br />
<br />
Just joust and he will ALWAYS win once both of you are about the same in skill.  It take some real bad mistakes for a pally to lose.<br />
<br />
It is not that a pally is a god here, but they have TONS of hps self buffed and healed. (with a semi decent FT)<br />

Cuch</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Indeed if you tried than on a Zek, you'd get laughed off the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I made a ranger on the beta server and went to the arena and found out how much I didn't know about rangers hehe.  Hybrids own melees in PVP, but they have to know what they're doing.  Casting stun, snare, root, blind, etc on a high level melee with good resists is a waste of time.  Paladin DD?  LOL.  But if the paladin just concentrates on meleeing you and healing himself, you don't stand a chance.  You'ld have to kill him 3 times, especially if he has LoH up :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ChrystianVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In PvP, wars/roags/monks get the short end of the stick.  On a pvp server, you need to have at least 200mr unbuffed to hope to resist roots/snares.  <br />
<br />
A pure melee can't usually kill a Pally or SK unless they really suck.  Pallies have thier quick heals that you can't interupt and SKs don't even have to melee you to kill you.  Getting chain tapped and then DT'd is the most annoying thing.  Playing a war on a pvp server can piss you off more than anything, but I still love the class.  You actually need skill to pvp.<br />
<br />
Pure melee fight are always the most fun.  Fighting necros, shammies and SKs are the least =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">comparing this to PvP isnt really fair - he did mention these fights actually started at full health, unlike on SZ where the only fights meet at least one of the following criteria:<br />
<br />
1.  10+ lvl differential (i.e. lvl 65 vs. lvl 55)<br />
2.  fighting more than one mob at the time<br />
3.  below 20% health<br />
4.  afk<br />
<br />
<br />
... thats &quot;real&quot; PvP.  Duels are a much better test of which class does better , since PvP is all about who can exploit an unfair advantage the most quickly.</div></div><hr />
