I am using BoC + Primal 1hb and I hold the aggro quite fine after slow yet when I push (slam and hits ) mob out of my melee range, the mob instead of runing to me, it just hit other melee who still attacking it. When i get close in mob melee range, it hit me again. I am 100 % sure mob is not rooted. Am i do somehting wrong or this is normal?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's an age old practice from back in the wee early days of EQ to basically stand as close you possibly can to a mob when tanking it, due to proximity aggro and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
But after this many expansions and changes to all sorts of different things about monsters, you end up with not every monster being consistent in its behavior.<br />
<br />
Thus ... the question ... which monsters ya talking about?</div></div><hr />

That usually brings the mob to me (or I get summoned hehehe). Pets will interefere with this, so if you have pets in your group make a little hotkey with something like &quot;Backing mob up, please take your damned little pets and back em off&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
It could also be because the other people are right on your tail in terms of agro, but with your weapons I pretty much doubt that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure somebody's pet isn't taunting if you move and the mob doesn't follow you even though you have solid agro built up.   I was tanking in an exerience group a few days ago in HoHa and the mobs acted like they were rooted when I tried to move them off the wall and it turned out it was a pet taunting.  When the guy had his pet stop taunting I could move and the mob would follow me again.  I think the problem was that the pet was taunting off me and getting just a bit higher on the agro list than me. When I tried to move the mob, it would just attack the next nearest player when I moved away even though I was higher in the agro list than the other player.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It takes more than being at the top of hate list to get a mob to chase you.  A mob will give up and try for another target in melee range with highest aggro if your aggro isn't enough.  Whenever you walk back in melee range, the mob will switch back to you though (assuming the aggro list hasn't changed).</div></div><hr />
