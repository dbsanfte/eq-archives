<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">06-02-2005, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got in a huge argument in hillsbrad yesterday.  There was a 60 mage maxed out on gear that plays there all the time.  He is constantly giving orders on general chat and no one listens to him.  So he gripes about and says everyone else will suck in battlegrounds.  <br />
<br />
This irritated me to no end.  He is never in the raid group and apparently moves in a 5 man group.  I told him plain and simple that of course no one will listen to him and its because he is not providing any leadership.  I got a little long winded, but jesus, quit complaining about people not following your orders if you are not going to step up and be a LEADER.  Being a leader is more than telling peoplpe what to do.  You have to recruit and organize them.  You have to gain their respect which requires you respect them too.  You have to give them guidance and let them realize that you have their interests in mind too, not just your own.  <br />
<br />
Guess what, that is not going to happen in a 5 man group.  Only the people in your 5 man group will listen to you.  It does not matter how much you know about what to do, people will not listen to you unless you do the previous things.  Guess what that means, giving up some of your own glory and playing ability to do those things.  Yes you can get more CP in a 5 man group that plays together than in the raid.  But if you want your side to play well, you have to lead them.  It means gettign in the raid, helping organize it, ie make sure every party has a healer, that complimentary classes are in same party, give some instruction on tactics, create subordinate leaders in te groups so yu can focus on bigger picture, and they can lead their groups the same way you do an in instance.<br />
<br />
It takes some effort and means not always being able to be in the middle of the action.  People will follow you though if you show them your are interested in helping them instead of just using them.<br />
<br />
Needless to say the argument got heated and he called me a jarhead (i am the army infantry, not the marines) and told me to go back to Iraq (he did later apologize), and I attempted to remain as civil as possible, in the hopes that others reading would take some of these lessons and learn a little.  Yes its a game, and you are more than welcome to play it however you like, but if you want the cooperation of others, you have to make some sacrifices.  <br />
<br />
This is not directed at anyone here, as I just needed to get it off my shoulders.  Please don;t complain about people not following orders if you are not willing to step up and be a leader though.  Remember, just ecause what you are telling people is the right thing to do, doesn;t mean they will do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">06-02-2005, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but tastless on my part, but I was trying to be civil from the beginning.  It ended on decent terms though, he was just frustrated and lashing out.  Insulting people never helps and it was working against him and our side.  Do Horde ever have problems like this.  They seem to work together so much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rexa</div><div class="date">06-02-2005, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are people like that on every server including the server I am on. You get to hear these two people spamming the sh*t out of /shout with their raid philosophy and whining how people should listen to them when they aren't even in the raid. But instead, they are in their own little 5-man group? It's the same two people every day too! People like that don't make sense to me but  it's where the /ignore function does wonders, trust me.</div></div><hr />

Back when I spent time in hillsbard, it would annoy me to no end to see dumbasses run in and agro the TM guards.<br />
<br />
It would happen every day. The horde would wait for it, then slaughter us as we tried to regroup from the ass-rape that is Hillsbrad Guards (note : I didn't say TM or SS).<br />
<br />
You try to be nice about it (because even if you are going solo, or in a 5 man group... it effects you). People continue to agro the guards.  I mean, they don't kill the guards they agro, they just run away and train them on other Alliance.<br />
<br />
You try to be nice about it a bit more. The stupidity continues.<br />
<br />
Then you just lash out. You start calling people idiots, insulting their mothers, fathers, and grandparents,  all out of frustration. Something so simple is rather hard for people to grasp apparantly.<br />
<br />
That's what pissed me off the most. Everyone is so caught up on getting Cont.Points that they do whatever it takes to get that kill, even if it means running into TM or SS and agroing 20k guards. People need to learn restraint (myself included so I don't lash out after a while), and know when to let that kill get away.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the single thing that pissed me off about Hillsbrad. It wasn't the 4 man rogue groups that seemed to always be out to get me, or the one guy that seems to have an AFK healer bot following him all the time, It was the morons that couldn't stay out of the towns.</div></div><hr />
