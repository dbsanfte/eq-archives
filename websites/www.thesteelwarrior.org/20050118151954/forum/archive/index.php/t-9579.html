I have the components for the helm but not the faction, not sure to replace it when I do get it? The wrists, hands, sleeves and boots are no brainers as I'm wearing ornate.<br />

<br />
In my opinion you should keep the HoRZ.... 55 ac i think is better opposed to 20 more hp, and less stats as well on Armsmasters..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakokorin</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True.  Not sure about your STA situation (maxxed or not), but you lose 7 STA with the AM helm, so that could very well negate that 20 extra raw HP.  Unless you have another see invis item, the Truesight is very nice as well, especially if you dont have infra/ultra vision naturally (although, that is a much smaller selling point than the AC/HP difference).</div></div><hr />

I'd say it's pretty close between the 2 of them. The RZ helm obviously has a little more ac and sta that may or may not matter. The arms master helm has the 10 more hps, a little more total resist and the ds/regen. Since you already have the components and are going to do faction for the other peices I'd say go for the arms master helm. The RZ should still sell pretty well and you can use that money to upgrade other areas to make up for the ac and sta loss on the new helm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, this is probably the only reason to switch HoRZ for Armsmasters. Since they are essentially equal (HoRZ is probably slightly better), the only reason to switch out HoRZ is if you can use the plat to pick up some upgrades elsewhere. <br />
<br />
I guess it also matters what you are tanking. If you are exping in a fairly trivial area, then Armsmaster will boost your DPS with the DS which would be nice, while RZ is gonna be beefier when every ounce of tankability matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8ac &gt; 20hps<br />
<br />
But then again, you could sell the HoRZ to upgrade the 8ac elsewhere pretty easily.  I'd hold on to the parts and start factioning ... you'll need it for the other pieces anyways.  with as much attuneable stuff as there is out there today, an extra 250k in your pocket could go a long way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Apolyon said, get the armmaster helm, sell the HoRZ while you can (assuming people still pay outrageous prices for them) and buy the rest of the Armaster equipment (at least the tradeable parts) as well as the large number of great attuntable gear out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im in the exact same boat that you are Mcast, and I plan on getting the Armsmasters Helm and using the proceeds from HoRZ towards a pair of Charged Magnetic Legs. It is highly unlikely i will ever get the drop from Pyrique for the Armsmasters legs, so I'm figuring it will be worth it for me. And who knows, by the time i have my faction for the Armsmasters turn-ins there might be some other nice attunable around to use the plat on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-No level requirement/reccomendation<br />
-Highest ac/hp by a long shot for warriors buyable<br />
-Best Helmet till EP's<br />
-Droppable therefore always sellable at a later date.<br />
<br />
My guess is the HoRZ price will hover around 250k till servers close in 37 years  :p</div></div><hr />

Sell HoRZ and use the money to buy other upgrades in more vital areas.</div></div><hr />

I could definitely see the HoRZ starting to drop in price soon. Granted it's still a great peice for something from half a billion expantions ago but it's no longer what it used to be. Before OoW there really wasn't anything readily availble that even came close to it. <br />
<br />
The quested helm is pretty comparable and even a magnetic helm is much closer than anything else was previously and goes for next to nothing. With magnetic helms going for dirt cheap I just think people will find a harder time justifying the cost. Also people will keep killing RZ so the supply will keep going up and the demand will keep going down. This will of corse cause the price to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It drops off of the Avatar of War, not RZ. It's been dropping since Velious, and the price hasn't really gone down all that much... It's going to be a solid price still for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest selling point ( in more ways than one ) with the HoRZ is that it is tradable and no req level.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt to see it drop under 200k+ unless under rare occasions. liek the BoC; it's longetivity in usage goes from level 1 to 70. <br />
<br />
And to follow the others here in agreeing with keeping the HoRZ. The thing is just so nifty until you get time++ geared and even than Quarm won't mock you for wearing it while busting his kneecaps.</div></div><hr />

Looking at your magelo there are quite a few things you could buy now that OoW is out w/ attunable gear/augments.  Then again, it would probably be just as easy and fun to camp them yourself ...  ;)</div></div><hr />

The elemental helm is super (faerune) and the time helm is awesome as well; but in terms of bang for the buck, HoRZ is gonna last me till Qvic unless I pick one up on a junk bid of like 1 or something</div></div><hr />

One is in bazaar for 87k, another for 88 k.  Just  a few weeks ago, 135k was a bargain.   I think the price will bounce back up.  I have noticed a sudden drop, then a slight bounce upward in other bazaar stuff too.</div></div><hr />

For that reason alone (exept if you like the looks) everyone should get rid of it.</div></div><hr />
