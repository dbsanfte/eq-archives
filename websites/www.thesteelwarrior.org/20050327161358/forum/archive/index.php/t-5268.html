<br />
How many warriors with Earthshaker + Rampage would it take to say... drop the entire series of named mobs (IE. Tormax + AoW + Other Shit). Basically how big of a train does it have to be for the procs to off them.<br />
<br />
We'll assume the 'yard trash' has a HP of 32k and thus they're only gathered to increase the proc-damage since they'll be dead quickly.<br />
<br />
Nice Alegebra question here for you math wizzes out there... Probably shows up on graph as a bell-curve.<br />
<br />
X = How Many Warriors<br />
Y = How Many Mobs<br />
<br />
And is there any server out there suicidal enough to try such a thing ;) consider it a test of theory sorta like the all mages tests others have done (against Seru and PoA 7th island, ect...) to prove it possible :)</div></div><hr />

by how many warriors?</div></div><hr />

It gives you something to do during AE groups, not much more.  You're never gonna round up enough warriors to drop a fuckin 250khp mob with rampage.<br />
<br />
Fun? Sure.  Useful? Maybe once in awhile.  But you're not gonna go pulling off shit like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why I wanna know how many warriors got Tunare to 92 percent. May not be a way to kill gods with just warriors, BUT it might be a fast way to clear to her. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since there are probably several hundred mobs in PoG when Tunare summons them (assuming they just ran straight up to her) then I would imagine that a lot of the low hp ones died on the first rampage and there were not enough left for an effective second rampage.  <br />
<br />
Also, she is in a bad place to use earthshaker since she is permanently rooted in the open and not by any corners that would help prevent the knockback from scattering the mobs out of range.  I used earthshaker in PC to kill like 150 mobs and when I was in a corner, it works great but if I am in the open and surrounded, I am pushed all over the place by mob hits and then the actual attack scatters them all over the place because I am not centered at the moment I attack.  This wouldn't be so bad in Kael as in PoG since KT, Vindi, etc. are not permanently rooted like Tunare is.<br />
<br />
Basically the main reason why you will never kill KT and Vindi, with your idea is that even if you had 10 or 20 warriors with rampage and earthshakers, the other mobs don't have enough hit points to survive long enough to generate enough procs to kill them.  If the average number of hitpoints of the mobs was around what KT and Vindi have then you could do it given enough warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are several casters in my guild that would want Tunare loots; however, I as a guild leader am not willing to waste guild raid time clearing the plane to get to her. <br />
<br />
I know several people with shakers, including myself, that would be willing to clear the zone this way. I know when you aggro her she summons everything in the zone to her. Sounds like a new and easy way to clear to her at the least. =)</div></div><hr />
