<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">10-16-2004, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried IE and Netscape since they were already on my pc.  IE isn't even displaying magelo's front page.  Netscape gets as far as the aa page where it only displays the question of how many unspent aa I have.  So I went ahead and tried Firefox.  Front page loaded fine, aa page loaded fine, but when I hit &quot;Update&quot; on the aa page I just get a box popping up informing me &quot;The document contains no data&quot;.  My only option is to click OK or close the box, either way my aa's don't update  :mad: I got the same box when I tried to reply to this thread using Firefox so using IE to reply.  Any help is much appreciated, damn magelo is driving me insane.</div></div><hr />

that was an issue they were having, they fixed it now, it was on the main page of the magelo site.</div></div><hr />

did you update all of your plugins?  like java, quicktime and flash?  cause updating my AAs worked fine for me.  It could also be that you are using the magelo update with the AA bug (if you are using MU).  but if youre updating your chars in the chars section of the magelo site, it is most likely a plugin problem.</div></div><hr />
