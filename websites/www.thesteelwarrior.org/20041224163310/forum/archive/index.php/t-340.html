<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawklar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick question here:<br />
<br />
I wanted to get some feedback regarding which setup is better, 2 SoDs, or a SoD/ BoC combo? <br />
<br />
I've met many a warrior who &quot;used&quot; to use two SoDs and I always wonder why they stopped (usual answer I get is that they needed the PP).<br />
<br />
Just curious as I have had two SoDs for a long time, usually passing on other weapons due to the duel SoDs holding agro very well, but I have the option of trading one SoD for a BoC...is it worth it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawklar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the Anarchy on two hands with a capped dex is adding like 2500 dmg on the average mob. On PoV mobs I tend to proc 6-8 times per fight while named raid style mobs I lose count, lol. Isn't the DD better then the EB proc if I tend to keep agro anyway? (Most of my guildmate warriors use Cord Hilted Pile Drivers and I do fine against the proc)<br />

<br />
Two weapons with different proc modifiers will differ but I do not believe SoD or BoC have any positive (or negative) modifiers to proc rate.<br />
<br />
Certainly, Blade of War and Primal Velium Claidhmore will proc the exact same number of times over a 8 hour period for instance. This is absolutely not the case comparing Bloodfrenzy versus Blade of Carnage (where the 'frenzy procs 50% more).</div></div><hr />

15/20 &lt; 12/18 DD288  dps wise, but i dont think by much.<br />
<br />
Are you happy with dual SoD ? if yes i see no reason to change that.<br />
<br />
The agro will probably be the same (BoC proc rate is crappy as hell).<br />
SoD/BoC will offer 50 more hp. But thats all. <br />
<br />
Remember that BoC drop a lot, while SoD range from rare to unique.<br />
<br />
If i were you, i would keep Dual SoD.<br />
Sooner or later you'll grab a BoC if you had access to SoDs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure about the BoC, but I'm sure that HG (I have a HG) will outdamage it.  And I've run hundreds of parses and tests that show that my SoD outdamages my HG.  That said, it would seem obvious that 2x SoD would outdamage a SoD/BoC combo.  Also with the SoD/BoC combo, putting the SoD in the primary hand will yield a higher DPS (as long as you aren't resisted 100% which is unlikely).<br />
<br />
The above isn't speculation, as I've said I've run hundreds of parses.  I would agree that a BF would be nice too ;)<br />
<br />
Personally I've found that SoD taunts better than HG and that Anarchy draws more aggro than EB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I would stick with the two SoDs... I've wielded both SoD and BoC at one time or another, but never at same time... and honestly I was much more impressed with SoD.  True, you aren't going to get quite as much agro, but honestly, if you have trouble with agro when you're dual wielding anarchy... something is wrong.  I have never wielded BF/Hategiver or any really incredibly high end weapons, nor have I experienced too much of the high end guild thing, but I tend to stick by the motto &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhm, not sure what point you're trying to make here, but it appears you have been deceived into thinking that a resisted proc produces no hate... which is definately not the case; even if Anarchy is resisted it still creates the same hate as if it hadn't been... you just miss the damage from the proc.</div></div><hr />

(at least for me in Fire)<br />
<br />
For shaman = resisted slow = INSANE AGRO<br />
For shaman = landed slow = normal agro<br />
<br />
As for the SoD ....<br />
I did notice some more agro when the proc &amp; stun would land.<br />
But even if resisted it draws attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I respect your opinion and everything, but do you have any way to prove this?  because this pretty much goes against the beliefs of most warriors I've talked to, where they say a resisted proc creates same amount of agro as a landing proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riaden D'Marr</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used 2 SoDs till I upgraded one to a BoC and Emilia is right.  Ask a pally they are best class to ask about stun agro. Resist or not its alot of agro.  If you want to test it yourself go to Kael mobs not stunnable but you proc and it pisses them off. <br />
<br />
Like I was saying tho I used 2 SoD changed to BoC/SoD proc rate wasnt that great on BoC so I changed to SoD/BoC.  Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled replaced my SoD after awhile being it procced alot more then SoD and it had same line of spell just lower lvl nuke.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go for the dual SoD's over a SoD/EB weapon combination. With an EB weapon, you just get the damage factor from that weapon, plus the hate build from the proc. W/ a SoD you  can gain extra damage from both weapons due to the proc. In some instances where your melee damage might be mitigated by a mob, the spell damage may still land for full every time. Giving you that advantage in the encounter.</div></div><hr />

Could be wrong<br />
<br />
Thats like 12-16 months ago, so i may remember wrong.<br />
About 4 months SoD/BBoE and 6 with BBoE/BoC<br />
And now 3 months with BoW<br />
<br />
I PLed myself in fire with full AA/elemental/20% nuke bonus ench.<br />
I used 1100DD &amp; 800DD+Stun and chained them.<br />
I didnt see any difference on between resist or landing agrowise.<br />
<br />
Just remember that a double SoD proc landing, was a head turner.<br />
While a double SoD proc totally resisted sometimes went un-noticed.</div></div><hr />
