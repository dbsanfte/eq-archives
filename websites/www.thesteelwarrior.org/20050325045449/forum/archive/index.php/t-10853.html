<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thengel</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard that 75% is the maximum damage reduction possible from AC.  Does anyone know if the 10% reduction gained from defensive stance counts toward this cap?  I'm nearing the 65% mark now, not sure if I should be going for more AC or starting to load up on some other stats.  I would think it does not count just because it's a separate factor added on top of AC only when in defensive stance (a 75% AC warrior would have no reason to switch to defensive other than to lose ATK)<br />
<br />
Anyone have any experience with this?</div></div><hr />

Are you the same Thengel from EQ(Mithaniel Marr) who was in Deadly Virtues for a time?</div></div><hr />

I would say no, but then again the 75% might be hardcoded and no amount of abilities could raise you above 75% (like Defensive Stance, Priest Shadowform, etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it was ( unless changed when they revamped the armor curve - you'd need some 26000 AF to get 75% so noone knows currently )<br />
<br />
It doesn't, the 10% is a separate 10% damage reduction, not 10% added mitigation.</div></div><hr />

The highest % reduction I've seen is 66.7%, and that was a druid with 11k-ish armor.</div></div><hr />

I'm not, sorry, I played Thengel on The Rathe (Frayed Knot)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.  Guess I won't bother trying to load up on AC above 10k anyhow if the curve really gets as steep as you say~</div></div><hr />
