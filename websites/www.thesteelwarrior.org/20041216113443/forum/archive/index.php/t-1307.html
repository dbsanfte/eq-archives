<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnarian</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm about to ding level 60 along with my wife who is a cleric.  We are gonna stop and try to farm some cash for a bit to help with some gear upgrades she needs plus we are broke after buying Aegolism and Blessing of Aegolism.  Would a 60 warrior and Cleric be able to handle Seb ok, I have only been in seb twice I think when I was lower level and it had alot of pp drops.  Anyone got any suggestions of a good camp to hold?  Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McMad</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, you'll do just fine in Seb and, you're right, the cash and drops there are nice. <br />

I two-box Seb fairly regularly with my 53 cleric bot, so you two should be more than able. Guard camp is good if you're just looking for cash. The bugs drop nice gems plus a chance for a rare named. You should be able to kill guardian as well, which gets you lammies to sell or the invis mask is good for both of yas. <br />
<br />
You could probably pull off jail camp, although it's a bit tougher. I generally just two-box guard, so not sure how much deeper you could make it as a pair, although I'm guessing there's a bit more you could do. The thought of doing a CR any deeper than guard there while trying to two-box my cleric gives me the willies though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one thing that is going to be a constant pain for you is the lack of snare.<br />
<br />
(Not to mention an inability to Gate out heh)<br />
<br />
Make sure that your wife roots the mobs and keeps her stuns up if root breaks. One mob running = 5 mobs on yah :)<br />
<br />
You might want to fight near zone out btw. Not having an evaccer in Seb = bad if the mobs arent trivial to you yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cervesa</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be fine, only thing to watch out for are runners or pulling adds.  Have the cleric root adds and just use  a snare whip or kunzar Kuj for dark, if you dont proc cleric can just root, should be no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gerili</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im guessing the &quot;guard&quot; camp is the same as the &quot;necro&quot; camp on my server.  Across from entrance to zone out is the scarabs, there are some frogs, and just before the locked door that leads to crypt, is a golem.  The golem has a small chance of dropping a lammetation.  That camp has very good cash, several times I have been there a few hours and received a 1k, /split.  At 60 you should be able to more or less single pull.  And again the only issue you will have is if they take off running.</div></div><hr />
