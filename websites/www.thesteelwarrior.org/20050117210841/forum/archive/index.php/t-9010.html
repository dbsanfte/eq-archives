<br />
Ancient Force of Jeron and Ancient Force of Chaos  on timer 5.<br />
Serene Command  and Quellious' Word of Serenity  on timer 6.<br />
Force of Piety and Force of Akilae on timer 4.<br />
<br />
A undead nuke pair on ID 7.  I couldn't find ID 1 to 3 in use.<br />
<br />
So basically they don't get massive new chunk of new stuns with OOW which worried me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesnt actually make any difference whatsoever except force us to use the worst 1sec stun we have (akera) for aggro purposes (3 stuns).<br />
<br />
At 70, theres right around 20% of one zone worth of mobs (that you even want to bother being in) thats stunnable by a level 65 stun, and those are still stunable by piety + either ancient.<br />
<br />
<br />
This change doesnt really make any sense, unless Soe is worried about us farming mobs that give almost 0 exp (65 doesnt even stun the better elemental mobs), which we can do anyway with the spells that arent linked.<br />
<br />
The one you should be thankful they linked are group heals, which make even less sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laedyana</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These changes are actually really silly and un-needed.<br />
<br />
Even without linked spell timers, paladins only really had one viable omens stun in exp groups (force of piety) that would land on level 66-70 mobs.<br />
<br />
The other stun (serene command) also works on 66-70 mobs, but has a huge knockback, and anyone who's been in a group with a pally tanking will tell you how much they hate knock back stuns - so much so that it isn't memmed all that often.<br />
<br />
The linked timers don't prevent paladins from casting Force of Piety or Serene Command back to back - both of which land on level 70 mobs.<br />
<br />
What they prevent is paladins casting Force of Piety (max level 70) back to back with Force of Akilae (max level 65).<br />
<br />
In theory this limits you from overstunning mobs that are level 65 and below. (potentially there would have been 4 stuns that would land on level 65 mobs)....<br />
<br />
In practice though most pallies only mem two stuns because there are not enough spell slots left to mem other things (2 heals, group heal, DA, root, cure etc....), and even with 2 stuns it's possible to stun lock a mob by co-ordinate with the togeher classes in the group that also have stuns.<br />
<br />
Pre-omens pallies would mem only the two force stuns previously (62/65 limits), and at level 65 had a total of 3 spells that would land on a level 62 mobs.<br />
<br />
Post omens pallies have to chose between memming the 62/70 stun combo or the 70/70 stun combo with the knockback.<br />
<br />
This means with the old combo that the level range of mobs that were only stunnable by one stun (from the Force of Akilae/Akera combo) was 3 levels, and the maximum level you could stun lock was level 62.<br />
<br />
In omens - pallies did not receive a force of Akera upgrade, so this gap would have widened to 5 levels even without linked spell timers. By introducing linked spell timers it has remained at 62.<br />
<br />
The worst part of this is the biggest impact to paladins here has not been on stunning ability, as stun locking is still possible with carefully co-ordinated stunning between cleric/enchanter/pally - it's been on the rest of the pally spell books:<br />
<br />
It's no longer possible to cast any of the following back to back<br />
<br />
Instant cast heals<br />
Undead nukes<br />
Group heals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think SOE is so much worried about using several classes to stun lock a mob...I believe they're only concerned with having one character be able to do so.  I'd have to check cleric stuns though.<br />
<br />
Their attitude may be:<br />
<br />
Multiple characters load up stuns and time it just right to stun lock = a tactic<br />
<br />
One character loads up several stuns to stun lock = a way to gimp stuff<br />
<br />
But I don't know.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yup, clerics have a timer set up the same way.  They're merely concerned with one character being able to stack stuns (or other spells) to create an imbalanced power.  For instance, SK's Bite line (does DD to mob, gives hp and mana to group) are also on timers.  They can only have 1 of the regular line and 1 Ancient line up at any time.</div></div><hr />

3 AA = extra spell slot in OoW.  Don't paladins get that AA?  So if they routinely had space for 2 stuns pre oow, they could easily have 3 up now.</div></div><hr />

I actually mem DA now and leave it memmed.</div></div><hr />
