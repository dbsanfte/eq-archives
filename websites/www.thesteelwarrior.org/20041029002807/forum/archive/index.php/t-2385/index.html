<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wandering for HoH flagging even though you can get in there at level 62. do you have to pass through PoV/PoS trials so you will be able to get HoH flag. heres what happened to me not justice trials flagged<br />
killed AD<br />
got checklist<br />
went down<br />
clicked on HoH zone<br />
went back to PoT<br />
no flag<br />
crying like a little baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoV/S trials - Aerin'Dar - HoH Trials - Mithaniel Marr are one flag chain.<br />
You cannot really get any of the follow up flags without PoV/S trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Senthiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think thats true anymore.  I have a regular group that hunts with me which includes a 57 rogue and a 59 monk. Neither of those two had passed trials.  <br />
<br />
I still had the box in the bank from when I did the HoH access quest myself way back when, so I collected the 3 souls again and did the hand in.  Of course, now days it flags a whole group. <br />
<br />
So.. the 5 people with me, with their new flags, proceeded to zone into HoH.  All 6 of us got in, fought for a little while and what not.  <br />
<br />
Those folks loved that thier charm upgraded, so we proceeded to do parts in PoStorms for access to BoT for those two since they weren't high enough to go in via level.  Then we broke and did trials to get them flag there also.<br />
<br />
Didn't get to zone into BoT before we finished trials to test it, but they were both able to zone into HoH just fine before they had completed the trials in PoJ.  <br />
<br />
Food for tought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dobbo is talking straight flag access and not side quests, Senthiele.  Yes, PoJ Trials then PoV dragon.  You were able to zone into PoV cause of the level limit but you still need plain progression from flagging (POJ Trial).</div></div><hr />
