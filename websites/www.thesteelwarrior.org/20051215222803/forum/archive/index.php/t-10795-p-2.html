<br />
I don't think talents have too much to do with survivability in duels.<br />
<br />
I mean, they can...but in general, most people playing this game are just fuckin tards.  One guy in my group on PvP stopped attacking people that were yellow to him because there's just no fucking challenge.  Only way we can get a halfway decent fight out of anyone is if they're significantly higher level than us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may be okay one on one, but that really isn't a judgement measure of your pvp prowess. Consider when it's 5 on 5, or 10 on 10,etc.. <br />
<br />
The only thing that really matters is dishing out as much damage // or // having the utility to distrupt the other side. Arms and to a lesser extent fury warriors have the damage spiking ability that counts in pvp, protection warriors due to three basic issues really don't have the gang-buster utility that is required.<br />
<br />
Diminishing returns and the lack of an instant stun greatly impact your distruption role. Given the fact that the best way to generate that initial rage is with a charge, and said charge is a 1.0second duration stun, any subsequent stun you use on that person is reduced 50% each application. Our stuns don't really last long anyway, and well, this just makes them very laclustre.<br />
<br />
Weapon chains (and the rare gauntlets) negate one of the most effective counters you could have for a melee class, disarm. You can have all the talents in the world to extend this to 10 minutes but the moment you face a smart melee whom doesn't care about some red demonslaying glow you're at a decided disadvantage. Now barring all of this, even still your disarm really doesn't ammount to much. Most classes will just run a bit or also use their utility means to negate your advantage untill such time as the effect fades.<br />
<br />
And the most important aspect of a protection warrior is also the most serious hampering issue you could have in pvp - taunt, or lack therof. The entire point in specing protection is to tank better then anyone else, but without an ability to focal that damage to yourself it doesn't really matter. Taunt, (perhalps just improved taunt) has to have some type of pvp utility even if it is just a 1~ish second forced target change from another to yourself. Without it, well you know the state of prot in pvp...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diminishing returns only affects stuns within 15 seconds of eachother. Honestly how hard do you think it is to pick a target out of 5 that hasnt been stunned in the last 15 seconds? I use conc blow just fine in instances when I have rogues and pali's stunning along side me, Im not sure why I wouldnt be able to use it well in pvp.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I've been kicking this idea around too, I think that there is a possibility of it working if they balance the target chance with a spin to face said target, and then, add an icon to the player to prevent him from being taunted again for a certain amount of time, kinda like recently bandaged.<br />

<br />
Here's your problem, once again.<br />
<br />
Anyone with any intelligence isn't hitting a fucking plate class over a less sturdy class.  That's the case, period, whether you're protection, arms, or fury.<br />
<br />
So, given that, why WOULDN'T you want the invulnerability granted by intelligence, and the ability to fuck people up hardcore?  I've PvP'd prot spec warriors.  They stand up for quite awhile...but you can basically ignore them because they pose no threat to you.  They're kinda like pallies, to an extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either shield spec or anticipation 5. (your call really, pros and cons to both).<br />
<br />
Then Toughness is a no brainer.<br />
<br />
Then Bloodrage, and last stand, and finally Iron Will if you're on PvP.<br />
<br />
You'll be 99% of the tank that a 31 prot tank is with 11 points.<br />
<br />
Does this mean you actually respecc'd haass?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently i'm straight arms.  After I finish up MS, cruelty 5, I'm gonna pick up anticipation and toughness and then after that, I dunno.  Toughness is really all you need outta that tree.  Revenge and concussion blow are just utter ass when you see how much faster you can generate rage with arms/fury, and see what the results that yields.  Plus Prot spec on PvP isn't a real bright idea anyway.</div></div><hr />

The moment they realize you're not an arms or fury derivitive you get 100% ignored. It works sometimes when I run up and start whailing away with my hammer but it doesn't take long to realise no deep wounds, no flurry message = protection spec'r. By then i'm usually only being hit by the random warlock imp, about the one thing I can kick the hell out of in pvp now days with 33 prot ;b</div></div><hr />

In my experience they stick to me like magnets being that Im 20+ levels below them. Hence Im the bait.</div></div><hr />

I will swithc back and fourth between the specs to keep him hamstringed and follow him everywhere - if he ignores me thats great..he is too slow to kill any of our priests etc and he cant run away from me either.. If he doesnt ignore me thats fine to i can tank him quite a while - while the dps givers in my team wreak havoc.<br />

Btw you never should waist points in tactical mastery - a skilled warrior can use all the rage and then switch ...get rage us it up..then switch again etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never invest in TM? A skilled warrior can dance through the stances, carrying their TM enabled rage and having 2x the options you do being hamstringed into one stance for your rage. The fact that you use charge (as everyone should be doing) as a prot warrior means you've just neutered all of your stuns on that target by 50% - right off the bat. Show me another class, even another ability that gets nailed like that before the fight even starts.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see you making him pay is if you're beating on someone 10 levels lower, else your measly hits will just make them laugh.</div></div><hr />

DW (Sword and Board if tanking a boss) to sunder/proc heal more often/generate more Overpowers then Switch to 2hander for Overpower/MS/WW/Cleaves. I plan on spending 15 points into protection focusing on Toughness/Bloodrage/Last Stand I definately feel having MS is more useful then having Cuncissive Blow thanks to diminishing returns/Stun immune Mobs and the fact that MS reduces healing effectiveness 50% and adds a good amount of dps. I recently switch my 2hander from a 3.8 speed 190ish dmg to a 170ish dmg 2.6 speed and the 1-2 second gap in between weapon switches has virtually gone away and I'm still able to overpower for over 300 dmg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just curious about your mechanics on switching weapons for an overpower.  I'm attempting to do thie same and the only way I can find to do it at the moment is to manually switch to my 2 hander, then overpwer, then manually switch back to dual wield.  So that's 3 key presses with a macro to switch to dual wield.  Is that about how you do it, or do you have a better way?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like you can use some advice on your skills too pal.<br />
<br />
In defensive stance, you're not making anyone pay for ignoring you.  You cripple your DPS and expect them to pay attention to you?  Good luck with that.<br />
<br />
And TM is pretty much as good as the talents get.  Some people either can't see it, don't see it, or refuse to see it, but that doens't make them right.</div></div><hr />
