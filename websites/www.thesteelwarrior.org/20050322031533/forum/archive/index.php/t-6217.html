I think we managed to get him to 90% before we got tore up.<br />
<br />
The worst thing was... the shiznit hit the fan so fast that we aren't positive what happened.  (We know that adds spawned and ganked us... but we didn't get an accurate count of how many, exactly where they came from, and exactly when they popped).<br />
<br />
Not looking for any spoilers here... learning a new encounter is always fun, and I'm looking forward to taking another crack at him (as soon as I regenerate the large chunk of my arse that is missing).  Just wanted to share the excitement and misery of trying something new and having your head handed to you on a silver platter :P</div></div><hr />

Good Luck to you</div></div><hr />
