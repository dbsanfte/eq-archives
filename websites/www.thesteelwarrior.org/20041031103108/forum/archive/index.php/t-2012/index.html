<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a Windblade for next to nothing (I think I traded a Snowchipper for it) back when they were dropping like candy.  On Povar, they are now selling for upwards of 40k.  Considering things like Mudflation and the onset of LDoN &amp; the possibility of better dropable weapons, would it make sense for me to get rid of it now and buy something comparable for a cheaper price?<br />
<br />
Right now, War Marshall's BS are selling for 25-30k.  I would be able to buy a WMBS and a ToD (5k or so) and still have some seed money left over.  My dual wield combo is pretty lackluster, currently swapping out a Bed Leg Club, Scimi Yak, Ice Ocean Club &amp; BCA.<br />
<br />
So, any suggestions?  Before Baadan chimes in :P  , I've seen 1 GSoT in the Bazaar in the last 2 weeks...and it was 100k.  Suffice it to say, that's not really an option.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the advice.<br />

and you can't really go wrong with owning a ToD. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes the bladed staff IS better, and it looks cool to boot imho.<br />
<br />
Sell the windblade, and guess what? You've made like a 35k bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lochr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll throw in a dissenting opinion. At level 55, the Windblade will almost certainly outdamage a WMBS. The WMBS just barely outdamages a Windblade at level 65, and that's because of the damage bonus. You're damage bonus isn't nearly as high as an overlord's, so the lesser delay isn't as useful to you as the better ratio of the windblade.<br />
<br />
If you group with an enchanter and/or a shaman most or all of the time, or are fighting in zones like Sebilis where slow isn't mandatory, you may not need a ToD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ToD saves lives, end of story  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing worse than having the enchanter LD or get resisted on slow and pummeled too fast for the cleric to save, and then having an unslowed mob (or maybe 2) in camp.  Saved my group on more than 1 occasion with that ungainly hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd rather swing an axe than a razor blade on a stick, but that's just my opinion.<br />
<br />
I also think the war marshalls staff has just become the new flavor of the month.  It's not really any different from a windblade..any damage disparity between the 2 is minimal at best.  There's also nothing quite like getting a couple 300+ hits, especially when you've got flurry.<br />
<br />
I guess my AA skills have changed things, but when you've got 9 points sunk into Flurry, the higher damage weapon is gonna win out every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I recently acquired a second account w/ a 48 Cleric.  So, I've been duoing for the past week or so.  If I had a weapon that could slow (like the ToD) it would open up more content where I could duo.  As far as looks, I'm a troll so aesthetics aren't really my thing.  <br />
<br />
I realize that there isn't going to be a huge difference in DPS, but if I can make 10-15k by selling the Windblade even after the purchase of the WMBS, then it's good for my broke ass.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the input, guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">swing whatever you want to swing if thats how you make your decisions.<br />
<br />
you could choose to parse them and see whats better.<br />
<br />
For me, WMBS &gt; WB, just ask eqcompanion<br />
<br />
Now if u r lvl 55 it might just be WB &gt; WMBS.<br />
<br />
and as an aside, weapons with DOT procs on them are just plain EBIL ! just say NO to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like my ToD, but it frequently procs after the mob is mostly dead, or sometimes not at all. It's nice to have, but if you have to rely on a proc from your ToD to get by, you're probably going to be in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally I would sell the WB, buy the staff, TOD, and a Frostbringer.  For level 55 your dual wield aggro set options are somewhat lacking and I think you could bag all three from the sounds of it on your server.<br />
<br />
I would also consider heavily if you want a 2 hander for everyday use as well.  You could pick up one of the 40/40 or 35/35 two handers dirt cheap these days.  Sure, you lose a lil DPS but Weapons lose value typically with new expansions, but PP doesn't.  Just something to consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gyzz, I've seen the Windblades for 40k ish in our Bazaar on Povar, but I also keep seeing it on the same traders, which leads me to believe that they are not selling at that price. I'd definately spring 5k for a ToD, only one I ever saw in our bazaar was 11k, and I thought that was overpriced so I didn't get it.</div></div><hr />

War Marshalls &gt; Windblade<br />
<br />
It holds better agro and the DPS is pretty much about the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Agro on WMBS is definitely better than on Windblade, at least in my experience, by a goodly margin. I'm amazed at the prices people still shell out for the WB (at least on emarr).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would have to agree with the WMBS &gt; WB. Used both and the WB was horrible for aggro. Swings too slow to maintain any sort of aggro lock when you have monks and rogues beating on a mob. DPS is also definitely higher with WMBS than with WB. Just thought I would add my 2cp. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You cannot buy top end agro weapons in bazaar.<br />
(Unless someone sells loot rights on one)<br />
That said out of the choices offered i'd take the wmbs for more dps and more swings.<br />
GoT is probably superior to it but as you said, prices are rather high if you ever find one being sold.<br />
<br />
Agro is always depending on your group. If you often do pickup groups you will at one time or another get members of the top tier guilds and you will have a hell of a time keeping agro against them with either wmbs or windblade.<br />
For some reason SoE loves putting high agro procs with stuns, lifetaps, dots on monk and rogue weapons.<br />
<br />
With a ToD you cannot go wrong, if you can afford it, get it.<br />
I never had issues getting procs with it, i cannot remember a single mob where it didnt proc before its down to 80 percent (but we talk about dual boxing scenarios here).<br />
Resists are another story though.<br />
But with 200+ unbuffed dex it might have a higher procrate, not to mention i try to keep avatar up, so dex is usual capped.</div></div><hr />

Fenring has a good point. You might want to watch the market a couple of weeks to see what happens. On my server, WMBS and GSoT suddenly become very common and cheap. WB still selling for 30-40k, but WMBS is down to 18k and GSoT is selling for around 20k. Go figure?!?!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Had to add this here, keep your eyes peeled in your bazaars. I have been looking for a GSoT for a long while now and have never seen one in bazaar at all till the other day .. 120k, one in /ooc for 60k couldn't believe my eyes but figured to heck with it I would wait a little longer and try to loot one myself, then last night went in and as usual did the search 4 of them lowest price was 38k highest was only 50k needless to say I now have no choice but to work my 2hb up to max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You cannot buy top end agro weapons in bazaar. <br />
<br />
Really? I had always thought BoC and SoD were classified in the 'high end aggro' weapons category.<br />
<br />
Although maybe not true 'high end', the GSoT and the new droga weapons (hammer and sword) are decent as well...all tradeable.<br />
<br />
And I'm assuming since BoT is being farmed like crazy lately is the reason the GSoT is more frequently in bazaar. On Povar last night I saw 6 for sale, the cheapest being 50k. I'm holding a bit before I trade in my WB....price will likely keep dropping.</div></div><hr />

I have 17 delay mainhand and primal offhand, there's no way the Shitstick comes close in DPS and I just don't want to rely on proc for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ah, Povar player here as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd definately spring 5k for a ToD, only one I ever saw in our bazaar was 11k, and I thought that was overpriced so I didn't get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've seen many a ToD for sale in bazaar over the past year. I bought mine for 3k, and thought that was about the normal price.<br />
<br />
Since then a lot of them I've seen were in the 3k to 5k range.<br />
<br />
11k is obscene for a Seb drop. Especially one that has been farmed as briskly as certain parts of Seb were on our server.<br />
<br />
In any event, Braeorn hit the nail on the head ...<br />
<br />
with the planes open, the BoT minis are being camped a LOT. By just about anyone who's grouping that area or find them up on track.<br />
<br />
Staff of Flowing Water ... Greatstaff of Thunder ... and ornate molds are trickling into the market.<br />
<br />
And in true Povar fashion, they're going to be very overpriced when considering supply has just increased to meet demand.<br />
<br />
But in a few months things will calm down and the stuff will be much more reasonably priced (think about how Mosquito Leg Earrings now go for around 20k ... and Bloodmetal Earrings are dropping a lot too).<br />
<br />
Then of course there's Transaxion, who would charge 100k for his used gymsocks if they'd sell.<br />

I hate to break the news to you Darkoan, but the 'Shitstick' beats your 1h combo away for DPS. Spend the 10k and parse it, you will be surprised at the results. You are going to need a lot better than 11/17 + 13/20 to beat a good 2h weapon for DPS.<br />
<br />
My shitstick consitently out damages my 13/19 and 12+3/20 combo even on mobs with very low MR (making the Disembowler more like 15/20). Keep the primal for the proc, but bag it for a shitstick if you want better DPS and agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goddamn you're so misinformed that it's painful.  I don't know where you get your ideas man, but you've got some seriously incorrect perceptions about this game.<br />
<br />
The epic 2h is NOT a Greatstaff of Thunder, and you WILL NOT get the aggro lock that a Greatsaff provides with your weapons, no matter how much DPS you're doing.  You WILL NOT hold aggro over a well equipped rogue or monk with DPS, it's not gonna happen.  Your job also IS NOT TO DO DAMAGE.  It's to TAKE DAMAGE.  How do you ensure you take damage?  You get weapons that lock aggro down.<br />
<br />
I never believed all the hype on this board on the greatstaff of thunder, because i've seen plenty of people spouting shit about plenty of different weapons.  I used one for a day before I got my SoD and it does indeed perform as advertised.  I procced it once on a pull, and slowed that mob immediately with the shaman...mob wasn't even at 98% when slow landed and it never moved from me.<br />
<br />
You can sit around getting thinking you're doing good enough DPS to get aggro with a pair of 1hs with no aggro proc, while mobs bounce around, or you can get something with a stun proc that ensures that mob is never going to move from you.  At the present time, warriors have no skills to ensure they can maintain aggro.  They can't do it thru DPS unless they seriously outclass the rest of their group, so that just leaves procs, and you're 1000 times better off with a proccing weapon that will put out similar DPS to your 1h combo.  The greatsaff of thunder fits all of those criteria.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Are you a rogue or a warrior?<br />
<br />
If you think your DPS contributes more to the death of mobs than being able to  hold aggro so that everyone else who is designed for DPS doesn't have to hold back, then you are sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
Having rogues turn off auto attack so they don't get mauled is unproductive.  Having monks spend half the fight on their back is unproductive.  Having wizards casting concussion 2 or 3 times between nukes is unproductive.  Having necros use only their slow DoT's is unproductive.  Get a greatstaff of thunder and you train everyone to notice the &quot;Struck by the force of Ykesha&quot; proc, and you tell them they can unload when they see it.  1 Envenomed bolt from a necro or shaman is going to outdamage any DPS difference you might be able to contribute.  <br />
<br />
Big picture.  Your DPS isn't as important as the ability to allow everyone else to do more DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dainin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Here here.<br />
<br />
You can't focus on yer own DSP. Other people (Every caster there is) has higher DSP then you, if they can't dump their mana in nukes it's a heluva lot slower fight. Faster = more exp after all :D You want a good 2hs for fightin in groups/raids to keep the aggro a warrior should have, listen to Haass here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Then why am I parsing low 80 dps with my current combo, while epic 2H parses at mid 40s?ummmm, because the epic is a piece of crap? I didn't say ANY 2h will beat 1h, I said a GOOD 2h will beat 1h. I am sure your combo does out DPS your 1h combo, but then a GSoT far outclasses the epic.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind, that while you don't have a ton of offensive AAs, the ones you do have are geared toward 1h DPS, get a couple 2h AAs and a GSoT and you should see a nice increase in your DPS.</div></div><hr />

I look at your Magelo and see nothing but DPS 1handers with NO proc and a spare Bladed Staff in your inv (also no proc).   While you are following the mantra: &quot;Natural Durability first, yess master, PE next, yesss master, how next do I max my hps master?&quot;.  You are still making my point with the weapons you wield.  So find another thread to poo-poo please.<br />

Thanks man, I appreciate your opinion without cramming it down my throat and speaking down to me.  The shitstick is still too expensive for me to take a chance on, and I'm just not thinking I should try it (even if I could afford) until I get my hands on a Avatar 2H for switch in.  Im just too lazy to switch (2) 1handers in for an Avatar proc every 3 min.<br />

Haass:  <br />
Man, why do you have such a hard-on for me?  I've told you before, and I'll tell you again.  90% of the time I 3-box with my own shammy and cleric.  That being the case, the only risky time of the engagement is the first ~20 seconds.  Once slowed, I do in fact EBolt with the Shamalamadingdong.  But in this 3 person group situation, I still am the main source of damage.  My situation is unique, and when I do group with others, I swear to you they always comment about my dps and control of the battle.  107 days played (zero bazaar time) I do know how to play a warrior and use the (somewhat) broken tools provided to us by the S.O.E. gods.  DPS plus /shield and taunt is do-able.  It is an option damnit!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then I guess that's your perogative, but let me tell ya something.  I duo with my shaman quite a bit too, and i'm also a main source of damage.  I got next to zero DPS increase with combat fury 3.  It sped up my XP rate by next to nothing.  Wanna know what increased the rate of my XP the most?  CA3, CS3 and PE.  Why?  Cuz I wasn't healing myself anywhere near as much as I used to, which gave me way more time to use Bane of Nife and Pox.  When I was using the windblade, I couldn't reliably use Blood of Saryn on every mob...I couldn't hold aggro.  The shammy would take hits, and I'd have to Q her, which pretty much negates the whole point.  Used a greatstaff of thunder for one (1) day, and I used Blood of Saryn anytime I wanted to after it procced, and I had zero issues.  That will not happen with 11/17, 13/20...not in your wildest dreams.<br />
<br />
It's all about efficiency man.  Being able to play your casters to their fullest extent FAR outweighs anything the warrior does while he's standing there with autoattack on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Haass:<br />
Ok man, I respect that.  I have a cleric in addition to the Shammy, so that kinda offsets any benefit I get from Defensive AA.  You will notice that I did do ND1, CA1 and CS1 and I am currently saving for PE before returning to Offensive AA.<br />
<br />
I still really have a hard time believeing the GoT would outdo my 1h combo in the DPS department.  You sure about that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>viiperan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Ok so after hearing all this great talk aboug the WMBS I went ahead and picked one up to compare it to my windblade.  My results were quite different from what others posted here.  My parses convered about 75 fights total in tactics against ogre's and a few gladiators.  I have a good amount of offensive aa (pb3 fer3) that may be giving the WB the edge.  Stats were maxed at 305 and FA was kept on me whole time.  Atk was about 1440ish.<br />
<br />
Avg dps with WMBS 102<br />
Avg dps with WB 120<br />
<br />
This was with me tanking the mobs, never fighting from behind.  These parses were taken while I was boxing my cleric and shaman so was not a good test of aggro control.  Later on that night some friends joined me playing a 65 enc, rng and sk.  In my opinion, the WB kept better aggro, esp of the sk who usually gives me problems with aggro.  Would have to fight much longer to really get an absolute feel on that, but once I saw the dps difference, the WMBS is probably headed back to the bazaar from whence it came....<br />
<br />
Or perhaps mob mitigation may be a big factor in this?  I may try this out on some easier / harder mobs to see the difference.  I would think that adding aa like double riposte would make the WB even better in comparison.<br />

I did 20 mobs with each weap.  I did start all fights with full stamina (not that that probably matters a whole lot).<br />
<br />
ME?   if I'm using 2hs, it's still windblade for me.<br />

just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

With the similar ratio to the WMBS, it should parse a little below, but certainly 90+ DPS.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I would bet that all of these combos would be dwarfed by ther 13/20+stun/DD and 12/19+stun/DD you can get easily out of Droga. While a Bloodsworn + copper hammer may lack in DPS compared to any of these 2hers, the procs would more than make up for DPS in pure agro. I suspect that the procs would make up a fair amount of the DPS as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Bosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">much agreed.   I've gotten the &quot;comparison&quot; bug now.  I'll do some different combos and post the dps results.<br />
<br />
for example, SBoD and SBoL verus SBoD and snare whip (an essential when there's no other snares around) etc.  I'll see what different combos I can come up with and port the results.<br />
<br />
unless someone has already done this and would like to save me a ton of time.   ;)</div></div><hr />

Yessir with GSOT and PB3 I see about 90-100dps (no ferocity and no flurry AA).</div></div><hr />

I gear myself the way I wanna gear me. I was refering to what Haass was saying on the DPS or aggro comment. I have no problems keepin aggro, or not getting it (If that be the way the groups doin it). I have more then just what I show on my Magelo file. What you see is only what I carry with me to most places, raids... That's a different story. I can't tell if yer bad mouthin the way I'm doin my AA's, or if yer just slightly off the norm, and need pills. But, which ever the case, I'm goin HP's on my AA's first, cause that's where I'm weakest ATM... If I were less with the sword arm I'd go Offensive, weak in the Defensive side I'd go Defensive etc.</div></div><hr />
