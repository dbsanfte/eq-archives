<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FatMumbo</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's up guys, i'm in some trouble here.  My everquest account was falsely banned over a year ago, and I just recently got it back (thanks SOE!). Anyway, since I got my account back, I updated all the newest expansions.  My equipment was top of the line for last year.  My warrior was only 58, so when I say &quot;top of the line&quot; I mean full complete set of fulvous, with spiked seahorse hide belt/pernicity/gallantry rings/bloodmetal earrings etc.  <br />
<br />
Taking my warrior to PoP had never been done before the ban.  So the game had changed tremendously.  When stepping into PoTranquility, and slapping on my LFG tag.  I found absolutely NO problem finding a group.  Took maybe 1 minute to get my first tell.  Then on the way to the camp I got 2 more tells. for Ldon's.  (this was NEVER happening before pop/ldon)<br />
<br />
The group I was invited to was in PoValor.  WC  camp.  Now these mobs are L60-63 I believe.  I'm fully buffed at 58 and have over 6khp's (ND1 max sta/str RUN3 REGEN3 Bandaid1) are the only advantage's i've got under my belt.<br />
<br />
And for 2 solid hours.  I tanked these guys with no problem whatsoever.  The only challenge.  Was the TAUNT.  I mean, Damn.... I had to be ON them using my taunt discs/taunt every possible moment + using wind-worn handblade/sword of the bloodsworn.  And I could get aggro, but it took a while to rip it off the slower.<br />
<br />
And every now and then, the mob would be &quot;ping-ponged&quot; around and i'd have to run my fat arse all over the WC just to keep aggro.  I dont remember ever having this much trouble holding aggro.  I'm doing soo much work to try and keep a mob hitting me, that nothing else in the game matters untill that mob is dead.<br />
<br />
After playing 3 weeks straight xp.  I've come to find out that THIS IS all that warriors do.  Taunt tank taunt tank 1  2 , 1  2  and every now and then critting for 1k, or crit procing for couple hundred... right clicking your gobby earring and your haste gaunts..<br />
<br />
Is this what i'm going to be expected to do all day everyday in EQ as a warrior?  Because it's no fun at all.<br />
<br />
There must be something that i'm missing from this class.  I dont want to have to play a different class, because I've been playing this warrior for almost 4 years with over 120+ days of playing time logged.<br />
<br />
What am I missing???</div></div><hr />

I find it exhilerating to be in the middle of the brawl, not standing on the fringe. It's about positioning the mob, when to switch targets (single pulls are boooooring), etc. That's all there is too it.<br />
<br />
BTW, you can't taunt anything that is equal or higher level to you until you are level 60. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Play a cleric. You'll have so much more fun, you'll forget why you ever wanted to be a melee in the first place.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: This sarcasm may be lost on those who think buffing hit points for large groups of people and counting off a set number of seconds to click one button in a rotation is actually fun.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
<br />
Play a rogue. You'll have so much more fun, you'll forget why you ever wanted to tank in the first place.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: This sarcasm may be lost on those who think strafing to stay behind a mob while 70 other people block your access to it's ass, just so you can mash one silly button everytime it ungreys, is actually fun.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Play a monk. You'll have so much more fun doing nothing, that you'll forget why you played everquest in the first place.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: This sarcasm may be lost on people like me, who still cling to the belief that I can pull well, and do good enough DPS that I'm still valuable to groups and raids.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Play a ranger. You'll have so much more fun dying really really fast, or not doing any damage because Z-axis gimps your archery, that you'll forget why you ever wanted to be a warrior.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: This sarcasm may be lost on people who like to die a lot and make their friends giggle with ranger down jokes.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Play a mage. You'll have so much more fun doing ... uh ... doing ... damn, mages were nerfed. I got nothing.<br />
<br />
Seriously though? What is it you actually WANT to do in everquest? If warrior's not fun for you anymore, feel free to switch. Find what IS fun for you. Just go in knowing EACH class has boring aspects to it. You may not lose interest so quick if you go in knowing that.</div></div><hr />

This is FALSE.<br />
<br />
This was FIXED in a patch ... gosh ... over a YEAR AGO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats news to me....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharrior</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's true.  I tank for groups well above my level frequently and can still taunt the yellows and reds.  I do seem to fail more frequently (75% instead of the normal 50%) than I do grouping at my level.  No idea if that's perception or reality.  I've never parsed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FatMumbo</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this is all good info and ideas.  But the question still remains.  &quot; What am I missing?&quot;  Is there anything that i'm not doing?  I mean, you could say , &quot; yeah , duh... join a fking guild and raid.  That's where all the fun is at!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm just like all the other seasoned warriors... I've seen my share of raids, i've ran my share.  and I seem to have more fun helping out friends lvl and doing the bazaar thing than I do going on raids.<br />
<br />
Is this all I can expect from a warrior?  I mean at L65 with 600 aa's What am I going to be able to do, that I can't already do now?<br />
<br />
AHH!  I just realized something that no one really talks about...  The VERY reason I dont enjoy my warrior.  Is because I dont raid with a guild.  The ONLY time I ever really enjoyed playing a warrior (to my rememberance) is when our guild took down a major target, and we got some *uber loots*.  Then you take those uber loots and go show them off to the single groups you join up with, and everyone in your group says, &quot;wow that's l337 where'd you get that!&quot;.  That.... that is what a warrior is.<br />
<br />
damn, took me long enough.  <br />
<br />
And posting this thread, actually helped me with this?  lol, cwazy<br />
<br />
Well I guess I can thank you guys for your info, and help.. Imma get my ogre arse into shape, and see about joinin a guild again.  *note: it HAS been over 12 months since my last guild*<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was changed to allow you to taunt a mob higher level than you while you are in your 50s.  I don't think they announced it, but I tested it shortly after a patch and I successfully taunted a yellow con while I was in my mid 50s (didn't have attack on or anything else to give me aggro, only taunt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand.  You played your warrior for 120 days but then in the last 3 weeks just noticed that it was boring?  Were you not paying attention for the rest of your warrior career?  As Wubao mentioned, most classes in a single-pull exp group can be reduced to one or two buttons.  Warriors taunt, rogues backstab, clerics heal, shamans slow, mages nuke.  I don't think there's a class that considers plane of valor all that exciting.  <br />
<br />
You're asking if you're missing something, is something different than when you played before?  If your warrior was level 15 this question would make more sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your boredom comes from your choice of activity (and location), rather than from your choice of class.<br />
<br />
Next time, try exploring a zone you haven't seen before.  I'm guessing you haven't been to Veksar for example.  Or push into the Crypt of Decay rat tunnels.  Or check out the revamped Hole, or work on the Plane of Tactics entry quest.  For real challenges, try XPing in a BOT tower, or measure yourself against a LDON hard, or see if you can get 1 group up to the untargetable Rallos Zek.  There is plenty to do these days, and most of it is far more interesting than a camp in POV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FatMumbo</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind Brutul, that I just recently got back to everquest.  And it's been over a year since I played a warrior.  During that time, I played a monk to L64.  On a seperate account, and I think that had a big impact on my thoughts towards warriors.<br />
<br />
And you've got a point about my location in PoV Sassinak, but I have also done 5 LDoN's and have taken a small group of people *8 of us* to droga, done a slaughter of Seb.  I haven't spent any time on any raids since PoP was released.<br />
<br />
And I think the #1 problem with warrior being my main, is the fact that they are VERY time consuming.  They are a group/raid class.  Most all warriors dont log on for an hour, solo a few mobs to get some loot, then log out.<br />
<br />
The warriors I know play for 8 hours at a time and raid elementals/time. Because being a warrior, they are dedicated to their guilds success and progression.<br />
<br />
I got married almost 2 years ago, I'm 20 years old.  This has also affected the choice of a warrior.  Because if i'm online, and the mrs. wants to ....   do something else?  I cant just /hide, or /gate and be able to get back to that exact place I was at without training a few zones on the way.<br />
<br />
For a while now i've thought about wizzy/druid.  And I think, if the guild thing doesn't work out, this is where I am going to go.</div></div><hr />

Got Berate (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4682&amp;source=Live) ?  The Provoke line made a world of difference to the fun factor for me.  Alts can help break up the pace, too, but  in the main it's good to realize that all the classes get repetitive eventually.  Personally, I haven't enjoyed XP'ing in PoP much, and have found it faster to level off the planes - tho the XP is faster up there, I've been finding groups faster in LDoN or higher off-PoP zones.  Which doesn't matter, cuz the peeps I enjoy grouping with are a bit lower than I ... and their company is more than worth the time I spend going where they need me to be.<br />

Sounds to me like you just outgrew Everquest. <br />
<br />
Its not uncommon for people that have had long breaks(1 year or more) to become bored soon after they return and then quit quickly again.<br />
<br />
I guess people return because of nostalgia and wanting the &quot;old&quot; magic back, but quickly find out why they stopped in the first place.<br />
<br />
IMO warriors have become more interesting the last year, not less. Especially the recent changes have made me a bit more happy with my class, and I think its right where it should be in the scheme of things.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't mean that EQ is less fun than it used to be, it just means you're bored with playing the same game for 5 years.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No kidding, xp grinding in PoV is boring as hell.  You sit in one place and fight the same mobs repeatedly and wonder why you are bored?  Go hit Droga, explore, move.  Go hit Veksar, explore, move.  Go hit some LoY zones, Nadox or Mines of Torigan, or Hate's Fury.  Do some LDoN dungeons.  Explore the caves in PoN, they are pretty cool and challenging.  Don't be so fixed on watching your xp bar move, the people that seem to be fixed on raising their xp as fast as possible seem to be those that are bored the most.  Because the best xp you are going to get is sitting at a camp in the same spot in PoV, which is boring.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps you just need a change.  I played a wizard for four years, and enjoyed it mostly, but suddenly just found it dreadfully dull.  I then started a warrior and all I use my wiz for now is to farm gear to make plat.</div></div><hr />

This is so true, back in the past you couldnt beat treking across Norrath to be encountered by Broon in EK or venturing to Kunark, hearing about sebilis and eventually going there and who could forget the dragons of velious, my god giants, dragons dwarves it was amazing.<br />
<br />
Fact is tho these things are long in the past and well the fun factor that remains is kinda thin, even with GoD out now i dont expect we will ever have another, omg look at this zone or that mob! Just farm and exp now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to wonder if i was getting bored playing a warrior until one event made me understand why i haven't stopped playing a warrior in 5 years.  My group set up consists of 2 clerics and 3 bots.  We were xping in Solro tower when my bot's ghetto exodus left my gf (one of the clerics) and myself behind.  So while waiting in boredom my gf had her mage bot give me the phantom armor and swords and whatever else she could summon and i set about trying to tank.  Well not only could i not hold aggro, but the 2nd cleric was tanking better than i was so i was stuck doing damage from behind.  At that point i realized how much playing any other class would suck (i have a wizard but it bores me to tears to play him alone).  At that point i realized that warrior is the best class to play as i get to be the star of the show (when im not wearing the crappy phanasmal plate lol).</div></div><hr />

it's in the patch notes from 2 years ago when they upped warrior taunt to 230@60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaos13</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i took a break from like december 10th till feb 11th.<br />
<br />
so i came back today spent around 45 minutes getting my UI set up my maps downloaded(did that on the way to GoD raid) and bought all my books. Get to GoD get in group and just go freakin crazy learning all the neat stuff to do with our abilities. so....<br />
<br />
take a break, not a permanent one best thing i can advise. if not from eq then another class. don't force yourself to play cause then you'll be burntout bad<br />
<br />
or you can try something new, purposly wipe a raid, forget taunt i dunno make the game interesting for yourself...</div></div><hr />
