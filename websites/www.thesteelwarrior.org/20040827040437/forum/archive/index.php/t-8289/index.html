<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mikemac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am new to EQ, playing for about 3 weeks (lvl 14 Barb War) on Morden Rasp.  I dutifully read a number of boards and was looking for a way to make some platinum.  Hailing from Halas (that sounds stupid) and having Everfrost at my doorstep made spiderling silk + low quality pelts = leather padding an attractive option.  I plugged away at the spiders, bears and wolves, built up my tailoring and went to work.  Even assuming that I would be producing 100s of these eventually, I put my first batch up at the Bazaar, thinking I could sell for 25 to 45pp each.  Nope, I did a search and found one guy with 400 at 25p, and some other ones between 20-24.  I just wanted to sell them, so I listed at 19p.  I left my guy on overnight - nothing.  The next day at work, nothing.  It took two-and-a-half days for them to sell.  I am almost sure that I was the lowest-priced seller the entire time, which to me means that no one bought these during that time.  So much for my cash cow.   From what I read, you normally can't keep these in stock.  What is going on?<br />
<br />
I do have a theory.  Because Morden Rasp is a new server (I think March 2004) there are not a lot of &quot;rich&quot; players that can buy the padding or, for that matter, the armor that is produced by using it.  I also assume that there are not a lot of 40+ level players who can throw the $ around.  What do you all think?  Will this change?  Am I just impatient?  I know know that, for the near future, I won't be selling padding for over 24p, until the 400 at 25p go.<br />
<br />
On a related note, some of the prices at the Bazaar are ridiculous.  Two examples -- I was looking to buy the Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword - checked the boards and saw that 125 to 150 would be fair.  Went to the board and saw about a couple listed.  They were priced at 300 and 425p.  I came back the next day and saw one listed for 250 - even though I thought it was too much, I was going to buy it.  After shutting down my trader, I went over to the guy and found that he had upped the price to 270!  I didn't buy it.  (The happy ending to the story is that I was able to pick it up in the POK for 100p -- great sword, although it looks a bit wimpy).<br />
<br />
Second (and worse) example:  I wanted a couple Orc Fang Earrings.  Checked some boards and saw that I would be lucky to get them for 30p each or 50p for the pair.  I WTB at the POK, no luck.  Went to the Bazaar, did my search and saw 10 traders selling about 40 earrings.  The highest was 450p, but the lowest was 200p, FOR ONE !   You must be kidding me.  The stat bonus is OK, not great.  I do not think I will wearing any stylish ear-wear any time soon.<br />
<br />
Is this typical for new servers?  Has there been EQ inflation?  Are there any other comparable earrings for a warrior?  (On a related note - from my mid teens to 30, what should I be trying to get?  I like the Newbie Quest Armor, but I should probably be looking to exchange it, right?).<br />
<br />
This board is terrific, and thanks in advance for your comments or help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What you cite is common for low pop servers. Things will likely get better assuming the server pop increases. Stromm is better I hear after it got alot of population. I would suggest you figure out (and its been so long that I had an actual non-pled low level character I wish I could remember some) where the good cash drops are. There are a lot of lowby mobs that drop 1-4pp in cash/items. The skunks in BBlock drop an item worth like 1.5pp that I remember I used to farm for money. I am sure there are likely better options. And for lower equipment you are likely gonna be better farming it with friends in some cases. And for the most part sell the materials not the finished goods (padding is exception), its usually not worth the effort<br />
<br />
Sorry cant be of more help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">now also mikemac remember now how the prices look and see what seems to sell out and/or is needed by the community.<br />
<br />
key is here ... Levels, Levels, Levels. LEvels = new hunting grounds and better items to make money from; either thorugh skills or flat-out NPC sales. See those orc fang earrings selling? Level up to 30+, get some friends, and go get some. EW drops are good for ya; and even going back to the other items like silks and pelts; East Karana you can net 100+ spider silks in under an hour easily in your mid 20's. Also take into consideation zones not too many people go to later on. Once you get into your 40's or so; Stonebrunt = more cat pelts than you know what to do with. <br />
<br />
With levels come opportunity; and with oportunities come ( usually :D ) .. Profit.<br />
<br />
Being a neb server can open the doors for you to making a good investment in the future; and learning skills others will need to later use your skills upon ( tailoring and smithing to the cultural levels ) .... ask some of the smiths and tailors here back when no one thought it was worthwhile  how much money they made :D<br />
<br />
You've got the right mindset; and with a little perseverence(sp?) you're going to make out rather well methinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also; as a reference; I play on Test server a bit and my only options fo rmaking $$$ ( due to it's low population ) is to farm up tradeskill items and farm zones that myself ( being level 39 ) can handle efficently; collect and run the drops to sell and/or tailor up. I estimate that with 500 plat I've successfully mastered ( 130+) skils in tailoring, baking, brewing, fletching, and pottery. some of the items are flops to make profits off of except for taioring; but the ivestment is worthwhile. It just takes time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mikemac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to post this follow up.  I started this thread and complained about the overpriced items at the Bazaar.  One of the examples was Orc Fang Earrings.  Given that the going rate was 200p each, I had resigned myself to being earringless for a while.  What happened next is one of the best example of the &quot;Luck of the Irish&quot; that I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
Being a new player, i was just traveling around using the POK ports, just to see what the various zones and cities looked like.  I am not exactly sure where I was (Freeport?? - the place with the docks), and I was just looking around.  I saw kind of an outdoor sales area ( I would call it a bazaar, but that would be confusing) where these 3 or 4 merchants where moving back and forth between a fire.  I checked each one and, lo and behold, one had an Orc Fang Earring!  I checked the price -- 24pp!  I pulled out my two Opal Encrusted Steins, the price drops to 20pp!  Snatch it up, do a little dance, wish I had someone I could tell -- and then had a thought.  If there is one, how about another?  I check them, nothing.  Then I decide I will try a few more merchants, just in case.  Ten minutes later, some obscure merchant in the top floor of some building has another.  Same price.  Woo-hoo !!<br />
<br />
So, for 40pp and change I have my two coveted (for a low level 14 war/bar) earrings.  This would have cost me at least 400pp at the Bazaar.  Not bad, not bad.  I guess this just proves that sometimes it is better to be lucky than good.<br />
<br />
As a complete aside, I picked up a Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword in POK the other day for 100pp.  Good deal ??<br />
<br />
Additionally, now I can sell my Aged Filthy Bastard Sword, how much should I put it up for?  Given my server's economy, I will just triple your suggestions.  JK.  (Or I may just give it to a newbie friend).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gratz on the lucky find! Somebody obviously was too lazy to set up a trader. Maybe you can find a few more like that and sell 'em in the bazaar yourself. I wore those ears into the 50's, so I imagine they'll serve you well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chuckles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I always sell my spider silks and spiderling silks for 4pp and 2pp respectively, I remember the pain that Tailoring was back when that was the normal price, don't think I'd every buy them with the prices they are at these days.  I just try to delude myself that they aren't being bought up by buylow-sellhigh folks, and actually going to people tradeskilling :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man, I remember when the game was fun like this. lol<br />
<br />
My honest advice (if you have alot of play time) is to make an enchanter. If you're on a truly new server enchanters will have more chances to make insane PP at higher lvls than anyone else. (Soloing tactics = $$$)<br />
<br />
If you're in love witht he Warrior way of life it's all about levels. Make your way into Seb, Lower Guk, Velks,  PoI(for the cloak of greater pernicity quests), and PoV (for Valorium Ring of Gallantry items) and you'll soon find yourself in money and items beyond your wildest EQ dreams.<br />
<br />
Also, join a guild asap. A solid group of friends you can associate, group, and raid with in the future &gt; all in EQ.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ooogaboogabooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi guys, <br />
<br />
One thing to remember about new servers is that supply will be very low.  Supply of not only items but money.  EveryQuest experiences an infinite amount of monetary inflation (since no or little money is destroyed) and an infinite amount of item inflation because there is no such thing as scarcity (except for mobs to kill), also known as mudflation.  The only way EverQuest introduces scarcity is by the simple difficulty of attaining items and no drop items.  As the server matures, better items are attained easier by the &quot;uber&quot; folks, and then farmers come in.  Then, everything of that type that is replaced by the new item(s) falls in price.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even after all the time Stromm has been up there are still some price issues.  People are greedy.  For example, Torpor for sale for 14k, only copy for a couple weeks, price doesn't change.  The rare research page pops up, 6k.  But I'm patient and won't be ripped off, picked up the rare research page for 95pp, I'm sure the seller didn't realize it was rare.<br />
<br />
I also picked up boots of the storm for 20k, they are worth 60k+, and 100K+ on Stromm.  Be patient, keep your eye out for good deals and you'll do fine, just don't give in and pay the prices those greedy bastards are asking.  If no one pays the overinflated prices then they'll have to come down, although those greedy bastards are patient also because they know you want their stuff.<br />
<br />
Resellers also are bad on Stromm which makes rare items extremely expensive.  If you put up a rare item for sale in the bazaar for a reasonable price expect a reseller to snatch it up and jack the price way  up, and since the item is rare they will wait figuring the odds are good another won't hit the market until they get their price.  But hey, that is business, I sell the gear I farm for reasonable prices and it's gone fast, and oftentimes to resellers.  But whenever someone sends me a tell asking for a deal I do a /who to see if they are the right class to use the gear and if they are I give them a deal, if they are a reseller I don't.   :)</div></div><hr />

Torpor ain't that great though.... =(<br />

Maybe if you didn't have access to quin, but Torpor drives me INSANE when it's casted on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">greed is all about whether you are the buyer or the seller. 200pp for a orc fang is very greedy when you are on the buying side but 20pp for a swatch is quite reasonable when you are on the selling side. i hope the irony isnt being lost on this comparison.<br />
<br />
in my days as a newbie we were lucky if any slot had anything besides standard vendor leather before level 20. i was in my 20s before i made more than a couple plat on anything whatsoever that i got off a mob. something like an orcfang was considered midgame armor not newbie armor. the key to making money in the bazaar has always been patience. the patient buy low and sell high. the impatient buy high and sell low. and yes if you check the vendors enough you will from time to time find items there that are worth quite a bit in the bazaar. its amazing how many pages and runes for example you can find on the vendors especially in pok or at the ldon maguses that sell for decent sums in the bazaar. the trick is knowing which ones are the good ones and that requires a little bit of price research in the bazaar. ... ok a lot of research more likely.</div></div><hr />
