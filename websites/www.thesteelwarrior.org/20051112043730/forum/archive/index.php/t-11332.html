Mograine's might is pretty damned rare.  Nice, but rare.</div></div><hr />

I can hit any ability and it takes my out of the whirlwind and does the ability.  I just can't move.  Hit an ability and the Channeling bar goes red and says failed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, actually from what I remember the 15 or 16 strength on the whirlwind weapons actually makes them outperform both Ravager and Mograine's Might in ACTUAL dps due to the huge attack rating boost the strength gives and the fact that neither Ravager or Mograine's Might have any strength at all.  I want to say the whirlwind weapons are aproximately equal to a 40dps 2hander that has no strength bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which Instance Does Mograins Might Drop In? Btw i have whirlwind sword and ravenger. if i compare them both, WhirlWind Surpasses it by a long shot, in speed bonus attributes and dps. and right when im about to do something important or im dying and need to heal i can't because that damned Spin move kicks in, :) <br />
<br />
Btw i have noticed that whirlwind axe is pretty damn good. Slow but good. when i duel or fight with my whirlwind sword with someone who has whirlwind axe its kinda a draw cause my speed helps me make up his dmg i get almost 2 hits for his one. and with instance moves i can hit more. personally i want to switch to these weapons at higher lvls, DoomSaw, Phantom Blade, Flurry Axes x2, A better Shield Than the one u get from SM ( forgot name lol) and maybe arcanite reaper, heard it owns.</div></div><hr />

It broke the channeling and let me do whatever I wanted (after the Sunder was applied).<br />
<br />
Mograine's Might drops from Mograine, the Scarlet Commander in Scarlet Monastary.<br />
<br />
I went with the Whirlwind Hammer.  Love it!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that because of STR loss? or cause of my spec? i've got the 5 points into axe mastery.. should i respec to maces? or will another 2h axe come along shortly to replace morgrains?</div></div><hr />

Axe or Pole spec. is prefered for MS builds usually.  In the near future you should be able to get your hands on a Gatorbite Axe (http://www.thotbott.com/?i=20324) from Mara.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I replaced my WW axe when i bought lord alexanders axe in the AH.<br />
<br />
I got the gatorbite shortly after, alexanders is better though, i could have saved myself 50g though by using gatorbite...</div></div><hr />

Nicely Done, But as me being a lvl 46 warrior i'm keeping my whirlwind sword for dmg and speed, then switch to shield and ripsaw and sometimes duelwield RipSaw+Sword Of Serenity or Vanquishers all depends on how u like ur weapon dmg and speeds! and at lvl 42 thier is only the beginning of choices, cant wait till lvl 60 where everything becomes avable to you or me hehe</div></div><hr />
