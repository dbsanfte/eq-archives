<br />
It looks like all it does is look at the zone description files stored on your computer and renders a zone based on those files.  It isn't actually logging into EQ and it doesn't look like it is modifying those files in any way so I wouldn't think Sony would really care about this any more than someone looking at a series of screenshots or movie of your character walking through these zones.  The mobs are not in the zones of course and all this is really good for is seeing the layout of zones you are curious about but have never seen before.  Since it doesn't tell you anything about mob locations, it seems very unlikely this could be considered a cheat program since it doesn't seem to give any unfair advantage to a player that uses it.  If they consider this a cheat program, than any spoiler site out there like Lucy that lists spell and item stats should be considered one also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decaillin</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would be fun if they opened up PoWar as a PvP zone. Give people a place to unwind, or just mess around between raids/exp groups. <br />
<br />
Bazaar arena is crippled by lag, and The Arena is just too damn far away :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoWar for PVP would be a good idea<br />
And correct, no mob placement info etc.Just reads the eq zone files on your pc<br />
Has absolutely nothing to do with the live game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you view the PoWar in the viewer?<br />
<br />
AFAIK, you got PoWar access on killing MB; and then some trials or whatever for Drunder..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you can view it, the zone files exist.Ive looked at it.Very cool zone,has a very large arena area in the front, and extensive cave system in the back.Would be cool if they could make the whole zone just open for PvP</div></div><hr />

Perfectly Legal. It shows no other things besides zones.</div></div><hr />
