I was under the impression that attack only delt with how often you hit for max/near max, but your hit% was based upon +accuracy and weapon skill alone.<br />

Hit% is based on your skills.  Hit distribution is affected by your ATK.  (Edited to be less wrong)<br />
 <br />
There was a well-known experiment made years ago by a monk who was quitting the game. He delevelled from 50 to 8 (if I recall correctly). He discovered that his combat skills remained high, and naked at level 8 he was able to slaughter level 30 mobs such as aviak avocets. That was the first time we learned of the real function of combat skills.</div></div><hr />

Hit% is based on the difference between your level and the mob's level. It is not based on skills.<br />

Hit distribution is affected by your ATK (and your skills that contribute to ATK).<br />

Incorrect.  Your weapon and offensive skill is what determines your hit rate.  Attack only shifts the average hit damage higher.  With ~ 250 skill in weapons and offense, you will hit a mob approx 59.5% of the time regardless of it's level.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the correction.  It is mobs whose hit rates are affected by level, not players.  Mob hit rate changes by close to 1% per level difference.</div></div><hr />

Or beastlords, who cap at 225 for 1hb/pierce/2hb, leaving them at 56% accuracy with those weapons versus 59% with h2h.</div></div><hr />
