<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have hesitated even bringing this up, because I know it is not high on the list of priorities for most warriors, especially at the higher end, and I don't want to deflect anything from the really essential changes, but... <br />
<br />
.. what about soloing for pure melees?  I happen to be someone who enjoys soloing (or did when it was still possible), but even for the bulk of warriors, it is a clear disadvantage that we are one of 3 classes that just can not solo effectively (without a boatload of special equipment) for aa's or exp during those frequent times when we can't find a group. <br />
<br />
The only solution I see would have something to do with regen - specifically a significant increase in hp regen for pure melee (or at least warriors).  This would actually also contribute a little bit to the problem of the hp 'gap' (or lack of it) between warriors and hybrids. Not a lot - but at least it wouldn't hurt. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking either a major increase in innate regen as you level, and/or addtional regen aa's.  Another possibility would be a 'disc solo'.  No time limit, but would preclude the use of other discs and could not be used in a group.  This would reduce your hp's and ac somewhat but would give you a big increase in regen while it was in effect (and possibly a haste boost as well). <br />
<br />
So I'm posting this for opinions.  I may observe the chat on the 24th but I have no intention of posting anything.  If there is concern that this might end up sending the devs in the wrong direction then I'd rather drop it, but I'd like to know what the general consensus of the community is on this subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suppose it might be possible  to 'power' an improved regen rate with the new Endurance pool. i'd expect balance difficulties though - the more hp's people bring to the table the harder hitting mobs have to be to 'reduce' the characters in a challenging manner - at some point it seems like we're gonna hit a ceiling on what's meaningful whilst being acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;at some point it seems like we're gonna hit a ceiling on what's meaningful whilst being acceptable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow.<br />
<br />
No. Just wow.<br />
<br />
That pretty much sums up the direction the game has gone, ya know?<br />
<br />
Like how challenging velious mobs used to be compared to kunark mobs. Then how you could solo a lot of them later.<br />
<br />
The mobs stayed static in what they could do. But you got far more powerful than the challenge they represented.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power is a bold statement towards how the game changed like that, with how the DPS of mobs you fought changed.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just wanted to say wow for making me think a bit.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To be honest in my really pessimistic moods, and after the POP experience,  i think we're probably kissing that ceiling already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh. The same thought has crossed my mind.<br />
<br />
I think back to what it was like when I got my FIRST stat boosting item, and how awesome I thought it was and how I coveted it (Wu's sleeves I believe it was, or maybe the slippers).<br />
<br />
I think back to how when I first started, the big rush was to get my melee stats up over 100. And how rocking that felt.<br />
<br />
And now I see magelos with 305's across the board.<br />
<br />
Yeah, definitely the ceiling is much closer than it used to be.<br />
<br />
:-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For all my dissatisfaction with the information thus far released that is one major benefit of the new melee system that I aknowledge wholeheartedly. Back in the LDoN thread a few months ago I said that i wasn't sure straight mitigation boosts cut the mustard anymore and that in order to help melee they might need to think outside the box, they appear to have done that at least even if I'm unsure they've committed to it with the enthusiasm required to make it really count. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually ir you check what a warrior's role is in EQ it specifically says NOT ment for soloing so ...... i dont really care about soloing all i care about is agro management aka snap agro and AC - HP boost and dmg mitigation IMO<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>znort_miasmic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've given up on warriors ever soloing a long time ago. We're obviously just going to have to accept that any caster can take a mob of their level and above and we're never going to be able to take a mob even 10 levels below us on our own.<br />
<br />
Somehow SOE has gotten this idea.. this &quot;vision&quot; of things being right this way. The vision of warriors being puny things that need to run for help at the nearest agro. And casters running around being the almighty soloers. I stopped expecting them to ever change this balance. To make casters only properly capable to take a creature about their level.. and to make warriors able to take the same creature of approximately their level solo. That would sound more like balance to me than what we're having.<br />
<br />
Imagine SOE actually making the true balance like that. Man I could've been level 65 with lots of AA by soloing in my LFG time like all the classes who actually can.<br />
<br />
But I've given up hope on that ever happening. For now I'm just hoping they will fix the taunt.. make warriors a tad bit more tactical.. and make warriors useful again as the main tank.. and not just a burden on any group making the entire group wish for a paladin all the time. If they fix that and make warriors at least have a bit of usefulness then I don't even care about the complete caster to melee imbalance in everquest so much anymore. Cause all that is is a dream that will never come true.<br />

<br />
<br />
No. <br />
<br />
That'd be a final nail.<br />
<br />
&quot;63 War LFG&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go solo you idiot...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;That'd be a final nail.&quot;<br />
<br />
We are already sitting in a coffin under an 11 ton pile of railroad spikes and you are worried about a final nail?  I heard 65 shamans were soloing red con mobs in plane of fire until recently (they made the mobs summon so this isn't possible now I guess) and that is the kind of thing that ruins balance.  Balance hasn't existed in this game in a long time.  I bet if Sony looked at AA experience gained divided by the time played for all level 65 players and plotted it vs. the player's classes, the soloing classes would average something like 2 times the AA that the non-soloing classes have.  The main reason for this is all the LFG time wasted with no option to do anything else.  I have known several druids and enchanters that soloed like 10 AA a day for weeks and weeks right after PoP came out before the charm nerf.  Thats just not right, considering I get to run from light blue con mobs.  This game is already broken.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be better to have the ability to solo while LFG?  As it is now, saying &quot;/ooc 65 war LFG&quot; every 5 minutes for 1 to 3 hours before you give up and play your boring alt is just humiliating.  Isn't &quot;sorry, we are looking for a palidan&quot; worse to hear than &quot;go solo&quot;?  The idea of a '/disc solo' that lasts until you turn it off and gives like 200 regen a tick or something like that is a great one.  As long as it dosn't work in groups or raids or when attacking a boss mob, it probably wouldn't be overpowering at all.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I saw a WoW faq entry somewhere that said all WoW classes will have the option to solo and that is looking far better than 3 hours LFG as far as I am concerned.  Grouping should make getting experience more efficient than soloing.  Grouping should not be required for some classes and not others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are 4 things in EQ that in my opinion are extremely broken and have caused the rise of the haves and have nots, so to speak...<br />
<br />
1.) SLOW - a 75 % slow reduces a mobs attacks to virtually none.<br />
<br />
2.) SNARE / SOW - These two spells combined allow virtual immunity from mobs.<br />
<br />
3.) ROOT - similar to above immunity, except when mobs summon.. but these mobs easy to avoid.<br />
<br />
4.) Spell Damage vs Melee damage - Explain this to me, melee use weapons, we can hit or miss, on exp mobs we are talking hitting say 50% of the time if we are doing well. Then we do damage, which varies greatly, but is generally on the average of 2x damage + Damage bonus. the odds of us actually doing MAX damage or even 50% of our Max damage are rare, and less than 20% of the time. Then look at casters, who fizzle/resist on exp mobs WAY LESS than 50% of the time, and do MAX damage WAY more than 50% of the time... Why this huge disparity?<br />
<br />
The game is completely melee adverse and caster friendly. Add in all the increased caster power with mob decreased hp's and you have generated a hugely imbalanced situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Everquest is a grouping game.<br />
<br />
Look at all the balance and modification SOE have  done : it's ALWAYS group friendly. Even the &quot;solo&quot; classes are encouraged to group and have group utility.<br />
<br />
I always found irrelevent the way people advocate than class should be balanced in &quot;solo, group and raid&quot;. It's false. Classes are only balanced in what they bring in groups and raids, NEVER in the solo game.<br />
<br />
Beside, why play a massive multiplayer game if you solo ? I prefer lfg 20 mins than have reply like druids 51-58 have &quot;but you can quad at CS !&quot;<br />
<br />
Soloing in EQ is just a derived use of group abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You already said it - boatload of special equipment. Look, everything a Warrior does takes equipment. Why would you think soloing should be different?<br />
<br />
Go to PoK and buy buffs. Get Regrowth and buy three backpacks full of bandages. Put on your Fungi Tunic. Go outside of KC and fear kite blues with ToD, snare whip (you should already have both of these) and Polished Obsidian Great Axe. If possible, bring a lifetap weapon from LDoN with a lifetap aug. Get someone to cast NDT on you when you arrive.<br />
<br />
You can do the same thing in Maiden's Eye even at level 65.<br />
<br />
You CAN solo. The experiance rate is baaaaaad and it takes equipment, but you can do it.<br />

same goes for starwars galaxies imo :p never appreciated EQ's &quot;enforced grouping&quot; more than after soling eternally :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's a dead issue, I think.  It appears that they are going to address the really important problems with the upcoming changes, so  I just don't think this is important, even though I'm the one that brought it up in the first place. <br />
<br />
I did give it a  try over the weekend in Burning Woods and Skyfire.  With BW over 201, Kizrak's gaunts, ToD and Silken Whip of ensnaring (though I didn't need to use the whip), it is fairly easy and safe.   A lot easier than it was when last I tried at level 52 with a fungi, but without the other stuff.  <br />
<br />
It is, however, very tedious and as Battleblade pointed out above, the rate of exp is REALLY bad. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I spent 2 hours lfg early Sunday morning in the planes and ended up with only 45 minutes to actually play (and weekend mornings are the bulk of my available playing time).<br />
<br />
I will continue to do it occasionally just for a change of pace, but I've abandoned the hope that it will get any better for warriors and will instead be grateful for the changes they are making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If everyone could solo, there would be no incentive to grouping aside from having artificial 'grouping bonus' xp.  EQ tried to avoid this for a long time but finally had to give in, but at least the amount is reasonable.  Have you seen say Diablo 2?  Add 35% XP for every person beyond the first one in the group, and I'd still rather solo 99% of the time (well, not having to share items is huge).  It's hard for me to imagine that without a grouping bonus, how can it ever be better to group instead of soloing.</div></div><hr />
