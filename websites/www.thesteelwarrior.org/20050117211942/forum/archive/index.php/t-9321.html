<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laiina</div><div class="date">10-10-2004, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently picked up Plaited Slave-hair Sash (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27108&amp;start=0). One of the effects is +12% Strikethrough.<br />
<br />
One of our mathematically inclined members did some figuring, and said that it will only add .18% damage (1/6 %) overall.  I cannot find any other figures on this, but if the damage increase is that low, why bother?<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here? Were the damage increase calculations wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">10-10-2004, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well im no mathematician, but consider the % of hits that are dodge/parry/riposte/blocked etc, that would require strikethrough, then consider an extra 12% of those going through...<br />
<br />
so theoretically, if you swing 1000 times, and dodge/riposte/parry/block stops maybe 100 of them (10% would be a rough estimate, some other warriors might know the real %s)<br />
<br />
According to my understanding, adding 12% strikethrough would make an extra 12 hits go through.  12 hits out of 1000 is a pretty small amount of increase.  <br />
<br />
Just off the cuff observations, im prolly wrong in the way this works</div></div><hr />

<br />
12% sounds like a big number, but in the overall scheme it seems like it actually adds very little. The most optimistic I could come up with was just under 1%.</div></div><hr />
