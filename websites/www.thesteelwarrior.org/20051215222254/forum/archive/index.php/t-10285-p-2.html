I'm currently waiting in a 623 person/54 minute Queue.  I'm not saying SoE never did a bad job, they were terrible on many circumstances..... but like Vigdis said, get this shit under control.</div></div><hr />

So fuck you all.  5 days total now...which is, ummm...5 days more than SoE ever gave you free.  Cram a twinkie in your pie hole and turn on the TV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haass, you may or may not understand this:  Shut The Fuck Up Fanboi.<br />
<br />
Never knew you to be an asskisser before but this is growing old.  Lemme tell you something; giving me five free days does NOT somehow make it better that every.fucking.night is a lagfest.  My lag meter is often in the red for extended periods (hours) at a time.  I can't find the fucking mob to hit it because lag is so bad the mob isn't actually standing where it's fucking standing on my screen.  I'm the primary healer for my group in every fucking encounter we face so I have to land HoTs all the goddamn time just to make sure the tank doesn't fucking croak on me with FULL FUCKING HEALTH on my screen.  Maybe some cash would be nice, but unlike your problems with the AH, I can't actually GET NEAR THE FUCKING THING without locking up my screen for five minute intervals.  As for searching it....are you fucking kidding me?  I'd rather stick a well-chewed toothpick into my left eyeball. <br />
<br />
Five days isn't going to fix any of that shit.  Five more days only means I get five.more.laggy.shitty days.  Only blizzard getting its goddamn act together will fix it.  And fanbois who like to insult us all for discussing a serious goddamn problem that should have been fixed last month only compound the problem. <br />
<br />
How do you like that twinkie, asshole.</div></div><hr />

48-Hour Free Time Extension - Block on 1/18/05<br />
In our effort to try to continually improve everyone's game experience, we recently updated some of our database hardware. This update required extended downtime for certain realms as we transferred some of our data from our launch servers to our new servers. The hardware update and data transfer was intended to split the load among multiple servers, which would in turn improve performance across the servers involved. <br />
Even though our updated hardware represents some of the best technology currently available, configuration of this hardware proved problematic in some cases. We're working through the challenges diligently, and we feel that resolving the issues that some players are experiencing is just a matter of time now. <br />
<br />
We do appreciate your patience and enthusiasm about playing World of Warcraft, and we regret that you faced periods of high traffic this past weekend that caused some of you to have a poor game experience. So, due to the extended nature of the server issues, we will be providing a free 48-hour extension of play time. As with previous extensions, this will show up as free extra time on your current billing period (or on your trial period, for those of you who purchased the game recently). We hope you'll bear with us as we continue to work hard on implementing changes for long-term stability. <br />
<br />
We've received many calls and emails from players telling us how much they're enjoying World of Warcraft and that they would just like to have a more consistent connection experience. In order to achieve this, we will continue our analysis, and we'll continue to take further measures as needed, such as occasional login queues. However, we will also continue putting every effort into consistently delivering more information about related technical issues. Again, we appreciate your ongoing patience; our ultimate goal is to provide the high-quality gaming experience that you expect from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I've already read that.  There hasn't been a noticeable change, at least not on Hellscream.  Last night I couldn't enter IF without locking up and I did Uldaman while in the red on the lag meter (at 11-12PM PST, hardly peak hours).   Maybe you should give posters more credit before getting all pompous?  <br />
<br />
To be clear, I'm not on a berzerker frenzy about the server stability issues in WoW.  It makes my play time less than the perfectly enjoyable experience it could be, but if you note my first post in this thread, I'm willing to deal with it for the most part.  What pisses me off is being insulted when I and others state our opinions that Blizzard ought to have it fixed pronto.  IMO a likely reason it has not been fixed is because doing so would require serious amounts of cash and Blizzard is in wait-and-see mode with respect to the 30-day free trials.  No reason to overhaul overpopulated servers if they expect X% of people to quit playing in 30 days.</div></div><hr />

No doubt, theyre working the issue.  I was impressed when a company actually decided to not sell anymore copies of their product until they could get things under control.  That, right there, showed they were serious about making it work.  However, Blizz does need to seriously step-up.  This has been going on for almost 2 months now.  <br />
<br />
Admittedly the rebates are nice, and not something long-time EQ'rs have ever seen but still that should not be expected to make-up for lost play time.  I dont know about you guys but I dont pay monthly fees to not play.  And, I dont play more than one game at a time, as I prefer to focus.<br />

I guess Im saying I can see both sides of the argument...<br />

My $.02 but with inflation probably worth much less.</div></div><hr />

well I think I'am getting too tired, I should just stop working now and get back home.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You fuckers are incredible.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
There was one server on EQ (I forget the name, it sure as fuck wasn't mine....Karana?  Bristlebane?  I don't fucking know) that was ALWAYS down.  They had severe hardware issues with that server to the point where it was down for DAYS AT A TIME.  MULTIPLE TIMES.<br />
<br />
What did you get from SoE?  A swift kick in the jimmy, that's what you fucking got.<br />
<br />
And yet everyone kept right on kissing their ass because they made the best game on the market.<br />
<br />
Blizzard COULD just pull the same crap, because it's clear that you tards will keep playing the game anyway.  They have the best game on the market right now, period.  It's been proven time and time again that you can abuse your playerbase to no end, and people will keep playing, keep buying expansions and keep their account active, even if they don't log in.<br />
<br />
I'm on fucking hellscream too, wench.  I have problems for MAYBE an hour each evening.  Is it the end of the goddamned world?  Not after the fucking bullshit I put up with in EQ for FIVE MOTHERFUCKING YEARS IT'S NOT. <br />
<br />
The fact that they're at least TRYING to do something, for the lame, no life bitches whose reality becomes unstable when they can't play a video game, when they clearly don't have to, speaks volumes to me.  It means that they realize that they're not providing the best service they can, and instead of telling you to fuck right the hell off, like is their right to, they actually value your time, your money and want to say &quot;Hey, look, sorry, it fucking happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
To quote all the dickheads who said this to me when I bitched about how much SoE doesn't give a flying fuck about us....shut up, or quit paying for it.  That's the standard response to this shit, right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After this latest patch plus half hour reboot of my server, I have found the situation greatly improved so far. After that first 16 hour patch, my server went from perfect to this laundry list of problems.<br />
<br />
1) Massive lag spikes<br />
2) random link deaths<br />
3) couldnt remove mail attachments.<br />
4) couldnt see people standing right in front of you but you sure could talk to them!<br />
5) Mobs vanishing but still able to attack you. (I mean that literally, every npc on the screen vanished but I was still under attack.)<br />
6) I personally got three seperate rollbacks, costing me a grand total of 25% of a level.<br />
<br />
All these I personally experienced at one point or another after that 16 hour patch. I wasnt the only one either if all the cursing going on in general was any indication.<br />
<br />
Since the latest patch I have gone ld once, thats it. No horrible lag, none of the other problems, nothing. Thats in either areas outside hunting, or in the middle of orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, never thought I would hear Haas argue that an hour a NIGHT of server downtime is acceptable service. <br />
<br />
It's not downtime tho.<br />
<br />
It's &quot;Problems,&quot; like standing around in an auctionhouse during prime time.  Well duh, of course you're gonna have issues in capital cities during prime time.<br />
<br />
Occasionally the server decides it's being a piece of shit, or the login server goes down, or what have you.  Big deal..it's over in an hour.  And besides...I don't play during prime time.  Guess I'm finally starting to get some payoff for not being able to do jack shit during EQ because you HAD to play primetime to do anything.  Now the shoe is on the other foot, and I get to be an asshole.<br />
<br />
And oh yeah...i'm gonna be an asshole.  1am to 10am prime time my time baby.</div></div><hr />
