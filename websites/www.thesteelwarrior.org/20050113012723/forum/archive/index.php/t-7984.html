I know augging it is purely situational by person, but I was wondering if there was any favored augs that warriors tend to stick on it.<br />

Any thoughts welcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit to add: End is nearly worthless at this time. Even SoE appears to have accepted that if you believe the summit reports. So do you consider 25 or 30 hp to be worth loosing the 10ac you can get from bbm aug? imo, it's not.</div></div><hr />

Because stamina is hard capped though, I'd definitely suggest you go with the augment that is simply going to last you forever, because that's what the shield will do. I'd take 10ac over 30hp in a heartbeat, and endurance doesn't even come into the equation.</div></div><hr />

10 ACs can go in face, neck, shoulder, back and waist<br />
40 HPs can go in chest, legs, feet, arms and head<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be worth it to put 40hp aug into BP and put the 15AC in the other 7 slots?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called the Peerless Sphere of Fortitude, is LORE, and fits in all augment slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Even with old world estimates of 1ac = 6hp, the 15ac would be twice as good as the 40hp. In PoP or GoD though, the AC is worth even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Granite, there are only 2 15 ac augments you can get, so the point is that it'd be better to put them in other slots, say bracers, where neither 40hp augments nor 10ac augments fit. If you could get an unlimited number of 15 ac augments, I'd agree with your statement.</div></div><hr />
