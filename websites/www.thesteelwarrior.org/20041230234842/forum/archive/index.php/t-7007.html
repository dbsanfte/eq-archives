<br />
I made an iskar warror yesterday, and I have a few questions....<br />
<br />
Should I bother training in bash to use a shield, when I'm just going to get dual weild?<br />
<br />
How many weapon forms should I train in? Can I get by with using 1 handed slash and dual weild?<br />
<br />
How hard is it to bring up 2h handed? It seems very very slow to me....<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems every lvl I'm strapped for skill points. SHould I just save them up and try to practice as much as possible, or should I be putting skill points into my skills that I use all the time. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the points just save em.  You can use em for other stuff down the road (at least that is what I did).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eventually you want all of your weapon/melee skills maxed.  Luckily, you have a big xp penalty as an Iksar so you'll have plenty of time to max the skills when you get higher level and the levels start to come slower and slower  (how's that for a positive spin? :p ).<br />
<br />
If you can, group with a shaman and get them to case stat buffs on you...this will make you get skillups faster.  (think it's dex and agi, but I'm not 100% certain)<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to pick a weapon skill you like (ex: 1hs) and max it each level, then work on the other skills after that one is maxed.  For me, I think I was 55 before I finally maxed everything.<br />
<br />
Don't spend points on meleee/weapon skills...they will go up over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The secret to getting your weapon skills (1hs, 1hb, 2hs, etc.) is ... more swings per minute.  That is to say, get a form of worn haste (item or tribute points) and have enchanter haste you.  Of course, if you are pl'ing the warrior, it's difficult to keep your skills maxed per level because you can level so fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the weapon you use most probably should never be trained. it will keep up on its own. maybe not for the first few levels but after that it will slowly start to catch up whether you train it or not. 2h skills level more slowly because of their longer delays so they are usually the higher priority for training. dont bother wasting trainer points on bash kick and archery. if they are still lagging behind at high level its not going to make a difference anyway. many warriors dont max archery until level 65 and when it finally gets maxed the damage we do with a bow is still insignificant. when in doubt save the points since you can always use them later. if at high level you suddenly pick up a weapon type youve never used and have a skill of (0) in it even training 50 points in it will make a world of difference in getting it caught up. there are times you will be able to practice weapon skills when your group wont even notice. for example if you are on a raid and you are clearing the yard trash on the way in and you are way overpowered for what you are fighting at the moment you can usually swap in a new weapon without anyone even caring or noticing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note what Cuthbadth said about the difficulty of keeping your skills maxed if you're being power-levelled. <br />
<br />
I would add another warning. You should be aware that when you're being PL'd, you can end up with a character whose level exceeds your ability to play that class well.  Power-levelling is cool because you get to jump up quickly into grouping range with your friends, but the stuff you do while power-levelling usually bears little resemblance to what your class is supposed to do in a real group.<br />
<br />
For example, I have a 33rd level cleric whose 1hb, defense, and offense are all maxed for his level. His meditation, however, is somewhere around 100. How did that happen? He stood around for 15 levels with melee attack on letting a damage shield do the killing. Now I have a 33rd level character that I'm learning how to play. (Fortunately the people I've pick-up grouped with seem to be even more clueless than I am about their classes, so it's all good .... )<br />
<br />
Anyway -- good luck with your warrior. They are the Love 'Em or Hate 'Em class of EQ. When you're in a group and tanking with style and efficiency, they are awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing you might want bash skill for is &quot;ghetto bash&quot; where you swap in a shield for second to stun a caster or runner.  Most people don't bother with this anymore since they made kick stun at level 55.<br />
<br />
How many weapon forms should I train in? Can I get by with using 1 handed slash and dual weild?<br />
<br />
You will eventually want to max them all, but probably won't be able to keep up in your early levels.  Try to get everything to at least 100ish and you will have time to catch them all up in your 40s.  Don't spend any points on melee skill, just let them go up on their own.  Put a single point into things like parry, riposte, dual wield, and double attack, but otherwise just save them for things like tradeskills or if you need to pump up a skill you have neglected to use a new leet weapon.<br />
<br />
How hard is it to bring up 2h handed? It seems very very slow to me....<br />
<br />
It is slower than 1-handers.  Try to use the lowest delay weapon you can get your hands on to get skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelindar</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my friend I can tell you this as a person who just did this, everyone is spot on.  I group with my wifes shaman and I have SCHW  what I have found is that if I take the time the first 4 levels or so to make sure all my weapon skills are maxxed  it has been little trouble to keep then all that way.I never did train bash, I asked a hgher level warrior and he said forget it.  i saved my points up for Dual wield and double attack  I didnt spend 1 point on any weapon skill, well 1 point into archery but that was it.  Don't underestimate a good bow you will get crit with bow as well, not as grand as a ranger can do at later levels but it is nice to see that crit mesage from a bow now and again when pulling.  1 way of getting more aggro as you are pulling back to camp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, it's important to work on all your skills, but for a long time most of your skills will not keep up. Work on the skills, but don't stress that they are not all maxxed. Even if you spend a lot of time soloing in the first 25 levels, you'll simply level faster than you can train all the types of weapons that a warrior can use.<br />
A significant percentage of the best weapons you will get will either accidentally fall into your hands, or will be weapons that you see and realize are extremely cheap for their quality. When that happens, it's nice to be able to do some damage with the weapon from the moment you pick it up. Also, new weapons are introduced into the game now and then, so it's difficult to predict ahead of time what skill will be &quot;best.&quot;<br />
Weapons do two things for warriors:<br />
1. They let you do damage.<br />
2. They help you keep aggro.<br />
<br />
Now two important things that you should know: first, your weapon skill is directly related to your ability to do damage with a given weapon type. So, if you have a maxxed 1HB skill, you will do the most damage possible within the potential of the 1HB you are using. If you have a skill of 1, you'll miss a lot with the weapon and not do so much damage.<br />
<br />
Second: some pretty careful tests have suggested that the amount of aggro you generate has nothing to do with the actual damage you do to the mob with a given weapon. That is, it appears to be the case that if you pick up a 1HB and swing it at the mob, the hate you generate with that weapon will be the same (or functionally the same) whether your skill is 10 or 100. The mob hates you based on the *potential* damage of the weapon. (This is sort of an oversimplification, because later you will use weapons that have a considerable portion of their hate coming from procs, but for some time you don't have to worry about that).<br />
<br />
On a practical level, what this means is that if you get a good weapon but have a low skill with that weapon, you can use that weapon safely for aggro purposes. You will not endanger your casters by using a weapon that you don't have a maxxed skill in. You will, however, do less actual damage with that weapon until your skill increases.<br />
<br />
The more often you swing a weapon, the more &quot;chances&quot; you get to improve your skill. That's why 1-hand weapon skills seem easier to raise than 2-hand skills: not only do 1-hand weapons tend to be faster than 2-hand weapons, but once you can use weapons in both hands, you'll be swinging two 1-handers at once. Another factor that helps you &quot;learn&quot; a weapon type is your dex. If you group with a shaman, for example, you can ask for a dex buff and it will help.<br />
<br />
Again, generally speaking, the more advanced your warrior gets, the more important it is that you are on the top of the mob's hate list (that is, that you generate more aggro than anyone else in your group) and the less important it is that you are doing damage. That's because other classes produce far more damage than you do, and the gap widens as you get higher in level. Early on, the damage you do can be pretty important to your group, but even as early as your 20s, you are far more valuable to your group for your ability to take damage than your ability to do damage.<br />
<br />
It will probably be the case that your best aggro set up will be to use two 1-hand weapons. Eventually, you might feel like switching to a two-hand weapon when you are main tank is bad, because it puts others in your group at greater risk of getting hit. I'd make two points about this: first, be on the lookout for times that you can use your 2-handers. Sometimes you'll be in a group and not be the main tank, for example. Every once in a while, you can ask your group if they would mind if you worked on your 2h (or whatever) skill. If you've been in a group for a while, and all is going well, and people know you're a good tank, they will seldom say no, in my experience. Anyway, you have the right to ask, certainly.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rookz</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am the self proclaimed skilling up champ... Got 6 new toons in the last year that I've gotten up to at least 45, and every one of them has all their weapon/combat skills maxed.  Here's some tricks pre-level 45 to get those skills capped:<br />
<br />
1. Dexterity governs your skillups, so if you have the extra plat, buy some dex items to swap out while your training up (there is a cheap +15 dex neclace, mushroom veil is like 12 dex... stuff like that).  Since your PLing, you don't have to worry about getting smoked with weaker gear, so swap these out at the beginning of each new level till you cap all your skills.<br />
<br />
2.  Go to a shaman and ask for Infusion of Spirit, and Dexterity (and altuna if you want the hps too).  Say &quot;NOT HoS&quot;.  HoS has a built in dex component, but the single target dexterity buff won't stack with it.  Infusion has the same built in dex component, and Dexterity will stack, giving you an extra 50 dex.  If you also grab altuna, you net a few more hps than HoS anyway.  Now mind you, IoS is the best kept secret in the game (Imho) so alot of shaman wont have it, and alot won't even know what it is...  just do a /who shaman in pok and start sending tells asking for it and dexterity, and offer to donate pp and come to them.  it's always worked for me =).  But make sure to call it by it's full name.  If you just say IoS, they'll think it was a typo and HoS ya... trust me I've had it done about 100 times, and I just don't bother with the abreviation any more.<br />
<br />
3.  Get a set of low delay weaps for all your weapon types.  Don't waste alot of money here getting good ratio weapons, Just get good delay.  These will only be used at the beginning of each level until you cap the skill, so don't fret about the DMG  (shovel for example is an excellent 2hb training weap.  only 27 delay for a 2hb, and usually only 100pp or so).<br />
<br />
4.  Find a training ground zone.  Example: After level 30 or so Magus Seru becomes terribly trivial, with the mobs barely hitting you... Yet the stonegrabbers stay Drk blue till 37-38.  This is a perfect place to go practice with your training weaps.  <br />
<br />
<br />
5.  Find a punching bag.  I can't remember his name off the top of my head, but there is a mob just outside the entrance to the warrens (painel side) that is a drk-blue con well into your 40's and he swings for a max of 19 dmg.  He also has tons of hps, making him perfect for practicing.  Only drawback is his 400hp HT he starts off with, but after that it's gravy, so no biggy.  Plus you're right by a zoneline, so even if you didn't have a healer, you could fight him till ya get low, zone, and bind up.  Zone back in and start again.  If he dies it's an 8 minute respawn (which isn't too bad) but you could easily avoid it by just zonning in and back (the zone to the warrens is actually a really fast load to) and go again once the insane regen is done healing him heh.<br />
<br />
6.  Find a good shaman friend.  This is really the best meathod, but not available to everyone.  If you duel a person, you can get skillups off their pet.  So, find your shaman buddy, have them whip out the appropriate level dog (their lvl 61 pet spell is still drk blue to a 65) and /duel.  There are several reasons you want to do this with a shaman.  One, their dog blows donkey nuts.  it doesn't innately duel wield, it misses about 10 times more often than it hits, it's standard hits are for half as much damage as any other pet of comparable level... it's just all around a sad thing to behold...  perfect for whooping on.  #2, the shaman can keep you set with Dex buffs to help the skillups come along.  #3, the shaman can haste you, increasing your swings, and in turn, increasing your skillups.  #4 if either you or the dog gets low on health the shaman can heal ya both, so you never have to stop to bind up, or to recast a pet.  Now some people suggest going to an arena with the shaman and doing it there, but I find the other people just make it annoying, so it's not worth it.  Your shaman can still group with you, heal you, and buff you while dueling (it's really stupid, but it's true)  so just go to any old zone that's safe and /duel.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope this all helps</div></div><hr />
