We have some difficulty soloing as well as everyone else for quests (High lvl mobs, or multi's.)  There is also difficulty frontloading damage to get the fast clean kills everyone likes in PvP.  Still, the class truely shines in instances whatever the spec.</div></div><hr />

if you are really burned change is allways good.</div></div><hr />

Its because a WoW warrior feels like a whole different class.  We have more utility and abilities than we ever did in EQ.  PvE, I think Wars do great.  Group wise we are probably one of the most needed classes, we tank several mobs at once great, and are just all around beasts.  Solo its no problem either if you play it right.  I had no problems all the way up to 60 soloing even con or 1 to 2 level higher mobs, and mobs that are lower or a couple of levels lower I just ripped through.  PvP.  Group PvP we're great too.  With some healing with my AC, HPs, and damage output (not great but pretty good too), I'm a terror.  One on one PvP we are not so great, this is where we are weakest.  Doesn't really bother me that much though, since all the PvP I do or will be doing is going to be groups mostly.  Maybe we need some tweaks, but I think WoW Warriors are great to play.</div></div><hr />

No more a joke, then when EQ was released...I was there.  Ill take WoW over EQ anyday.</div></div><hr />

WoW warriors are awesome.  WoW itself is an awesome game.  As long as you're not expecting to be coddled or treated like royalty by Blizzard cause you, gasp, pay a subscription fee to play the game, you'll love it if you enjoyed EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem isn't the actual raid content, it's the fact that my guild has two raid choices currently, and we can't do one of them because a bug that they can't/refuse to fix even though they've known about it for quite a while now. The worst part about it is that the bug chops numbers off our already mediocre attendance and there's a five day lockout before you can try again and pray that it works properly.<br />
<br />
Again, it's not necessarily lack of high end content until we beat Onyx/MC, but it's lack of working high end content.</div></div><hr />

I play really casual now (~2 hours a week due to time constraints) yet I can still do many things and feel like my time is worth something since I can actually be productive during that short amount of time...which is all I really wanted from EQ.<br />
<br />
Sure, at high end with all the instances I won't be able to do as much, but considering the time it will take for me to get to that point, I'd probably be able to play longer by then.</div></div><hr />

You're just pushing more buttons.  Now you can do stuff like snare that you can't in EQ but that's just because of WoW's model of taking a powerful CC tool (mez, snare) and then make it 1/3rd as powerful and give it to 3X the classes so while you don't have anyone who can drop an EQ snare which totally trivializes any non summoning mob, you end up having 3 guys who have 1/3rd of an EQ snare who can combine to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Actually when people say they have more options, they really mean you've the option to solo instead of waiting for a group (and indeed this is usually the preferred method).  You're not really doing more as a Warrior per se.  You're just pushing more buttons.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget adjusting your damage output for the situation, while managing aggro usually on multi's, typically while directing combat.  ^^  I find this class very entertaining.</div></div><hr />

All you really do is move up and down and back and forth until it's your turn again.  Hell, I tend to play with the monitor off and just listen to my hard drive chug at certain times and I know I lost a point.  As a matter of fact, soemtimes I just go in the back yard and toss the WoW CD around like a frisbee and I get even more of the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW Warriors can:<br />
Solo what would be a red con<br />
Solo what would be multiple blues<br />
Can snare (ability not proc)<br />
Can slow (ability not proc)<br />
Can DPS<br />
Can tank<br />
Can self heal via potions while in combat<br />
Fear when you get adds and snare the main mob and run!<br />
There is no KSing<br />
Dungeons are instanced<br />
<br />
You have options, you don't have to &quot;lfg&quot; for hours on end. You don't have to answer &quot;hps/AC please&quot; questions. You don't have to have no life and raid 6 days a week for 4-6 hours a night.<br />
<br />
Let me spell out what the beginning of EQ was:<br />
Mad KSing<br />
No groups because soloing was more efficient<br />
That ass Gordon telling us &quot;warriors are fine&quot; while druids were quading<br />
That ass Gordon telling us &quot;a 49 necromancer pet is fine, so a 50 warrior can't beat it without the necromancer even helping except handing it two fine steel daggers&quot;<br />
Greedy raid guilds hogging raid targets like Naggy/Vox<br />
Asshats telling you &quot;you suck cause your chars gear sucks&quot;<br />
Asshat necromancers saying &quot;every class sucks except necros&quot;<br />
Asshats in general in EQ, people have been much nicer I have met in WoW<br />
Expansion after expansion aimed at lifeless raider dweebs</div></div><hr />

This numbs my mind.</div></div><hr />

Ok, how is it we're just pushing more buttons again?<br />
<br />
Snaring the mob doesn't take skill.  If the mob runs and no one else is snaring, you snare.  Now if you mean there is skill in realizing that 5 different effects can snare and overwrite your snare so you need to pay attention, maybe, but I consider that more of a stacking issue (i.e. long snare shouldn't get removed by a 3 second chill).<br />
<br />
Debuffing mob attack power and AC is something you do automatically because Sunder Armor happens to be good aggro as well, and demo shout is usually viewed as a pretty good aggro versus many skill.  <br />
<br />
Slowing I'd assume you mean Thunderclap.  It has a negligble effect on DPS taken but can be viewed as an aggro versus many skill, but different people swear by different things (demo, whirlwind, whatever).<br />
<br />
Using Rend is about as complicated as using Kick.  It's your best DPS besides MS.  <br />
<br />
AE fear is a CC tool and it's rather obvious when you're supposed to use it (i.e. when you've a lot of mobs).  Now given that communication in WoW is nearly nonexistent it might take some skill to use it without having people break your fear or whatever, but that is more like dealing with stupidity as opposed to your own skill.<br />
<br />
If there is ever a situation where you want to not snare a mob, or not debuff AC, or not use Rend (besides mezzing), or not use fear when you get a pull that your group can't control, you might have a point about all those things you listed.  But you do not.  All these actions you do are automatic.  If you don't do them you are just a weaker person in general and if you do them you end up achieving the normal power level curve, which is simulated in EQ by hitting auto attack.<br />
<br />
Of course you can choose to gimp yourself by just using autoattack in WoW, but that's like trying to play a Knight in EQ without using any spells.  If you got 15 buttons you got to push in the same order everytime, then that's the same as having 1 button to push with the added bonus that it's easier to gimp yourself in the 15 buttons scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you think of all the WoW warrior abilities (AC Debuff,DoT, Snare, Stun, Fear, Shield Block, Silence, Intercept, Do AE dmg,Charge, DPS, Solo, Combat Heal, group attack buff, mob attack debuff) then compare those to the EQ Warrior (Auto Attack, Taunt, Position yourself, kick rinse and repeat) the WoW warriors is a ton more effective and active in a group/solo/PvP/PvE situation and far more then just a tank.<br />
<br />
And none of the tanks I've met in WoW push the same 15 buttons in the same order every fight..... You have three different stances to perform different tasks in.<br />
And each stance has tons of abilities. So to say it's easier to gimp yourself with 15 abilities is just plain ignorant considering the alternative is having none or just a handful of them and auto attacking.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can testify that at least until lvl 38 I have seen warriors do things such as control agro, solo, pvp, and deal with adds in more then one way. I think that there are very few situations that can only be dealt with in one way or with one button.<br />
<br />
Warriors have multiple options for rage generation: bloodrage, charge, taking damage, doing damage, rage potions in some situations. Bloodrage, charge and doing damage can all be improved with talents.<br />
<br />
Warriors have multiple options for dealing with agro on mobs: Sometimes I will taunt, shield block (to light revenge), and revenge, sometimes sunder and then taunt if still lacking agro. For multiple mobs we have demoralizing shout, challenging shout, sweeping strikes, cleave, and we can even stun or disarm a mob so that we dont have to hold agro on  it for 5-13 seconds. I stay in def stance for tanking but some people with TM will switch in and out.<br />
<br />
For adds we are not required to fear and run. Often you can battle it out with def stance+shield, shield wall, last stand, stuns, disarms, potions for healing. You could even use an oil of immolation, sweeping strikes, and cleave in an attempt to dps the adds.<br />
<br />
I'll stop there because I think Ive made my point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
note that this is for pure DPS and not for generally rocking ass. you can do more than an EQ warrior could, obviously.</div></div><hr />

Anybody with a little mmorpg experience can figure out what abilities are needed under what circumstances.<br />
<br />
I think the difference between a good tank and a bad one is simply based on how hard you work at it.  <br />
<br />
For example: I was farming mauradon with some lower level friends.  I had been there a dozen times and was kinda bored so I was watching TV as much as I was watching the game.  We were still moving along but it was chaotic with mobs running around all over the place and lots of downtime between fights.  I thought that this was getting embaressing and gave the game my full attention.  Had every mob stuck on me like glue.  The fights were faster and much more effiicent.<br />
<br />
This really isn't skill, just me getting off my lazy ass and putting some effort into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm never knew Auto Attack in EQ could reduce mobs dmg output/increase your dmg output/snare/DoT/Fear/Stun etc. Seems to me that whatever 15 buttons you choose to hit in a fightin WoW puts you over the tops of what Auto Attack in EQ ever gave you since you are also auto attacking while pushing them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would you rather your warrior executes all the abilities on its own? What you need is a bot!! No really, www.blizzhackers.com  .. have fun~<br />
<br />
Whenever I get EQ flashbacks, I behold a Firiona Vie lady only she looks like a devil and she's howling and mourning my new found freedom in WoW. &quot;Noooo don't use whirlwind it should be on a 30 min timer!!!!&quot;. All the pointless restraints in EQ, it now makes me feel kinda lucky to be playing this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron is a very binary man.<br />
<br />
In his world, there are only 1's and 0's.  And they are very fucking boring 1's and  0's at that.<br />
<br />
Almost everything in a MMORPG is founded upon the basis that there are only 1's and 0's.  The whole concept aggro rests entirely on the fact that aggro is completely deterministic.  That is, if I push 1 3 5 2 5 3 and it grabs aggro off these 3 mobs it will always get the aggro off the 3 mobs with the same same setup, ignoring some truly wild fluctuations in RNG (i.e. I miss with every ability I used).  When you drop a Sunder Armor it always gets you that much aggro if it lands.  You don't have to worry that maybe today Sunder Armor will produce 100 aggro and tomorrow it only produces 5 on the same mob, which is why it works.<br />
<br />
Once the sequence has been determined it is the same as autoattack, though since WoW isn't as thoroughly parsed/tested/played as EQ has been, it might take longer for people to figure out the optimal sequence.  But really, the sequence of buttons to push isn't nearly as complicated as people make it out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What if your step 3 misses and Someone pulls aggro and you have to go back to your step 1 to get it back then you dont enough rage for 5. OMG your outta sequence. There are hundreds of variables in a fight and no set sequence can account for them all. If you try to play this game that robotically then maybe you should go back to EQ since that game limits your options enough that you can just do 3 moves in the same order every time. Personally thats why I left EQ......</div></div><hr />

There is a phenomenal difference in tanking abilites between people who do and don't know what they're doing.  Good tanks take for granted that everyone is good, but the fact remains many are not.  Yes, a large part of it is effort. <br />
<br />
However if you're going to make the skill arguement you should apply it to a broader base, to something more like &quot;Nothing you do in a MMO takes skill.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm never knew Auto Attack in EQ could reduce mobs dmg output/increase your dmg output/snare/DoT/Fear/Stun etc. Seems to me that whatever 15 buttons you choose to hit in a fightin WoW puts you over the tops of what Auto Attack in EQ ever gave you since you are also auto attacking while pushing them.<br />
<br />
After you do all these fancy stuff you talked about, the mob's effective power level is the same in both games.<br />
<br />
In EQ a fairly optimal sequence of buttons to push looks like:<br />
<br />
1(auto attack)3(kick)33333333333333333333<br />
<br />
This sequence is quite reliable for about 95% of the stuff you kill in a group.<br />
<br />
In WoW we'll assume you pull 3 elite mobs and win fairly easily to simulate the equivalent generic 1 trash mob versus group deal in EQ.  <br />
<br />
Mobs come in, you charge(1), demo shout them (2), drop Sunder on some mobs (3), maybe taunt something (4), put a dot (5), maybe use some AE attack (6), snare runners (7).<br />
<br />
Without loss of generality we'll assume the combination 123334335673357337 works.  If you're not convinced you can always take an example where you've won such an encounter and change the #s appropriately (e.g. maybe your #6 is concussive blow, or whatever).<br />
<br />
Now we'll assume you're a good tank and your group won without anyone dying.  After all this is a pretty generic pull in the dungeons that you're expected to win.  Now you come across another set of 3 similar elite mobs.  Do you have any reason to believe the combination 123334335673357337 won't work this time?  No, because the game is deterministic.  You wouldn't want a game where what worked the first time suddenly didn't work under the same situation.  So it'd be pretty safe to assume that repeating what worked earlier should enjoy the same success (assuming of course everyone in the group is still doing the same thing as before of course), and you'd be wise to repeat the same thing that worked before rather than reinventing the wheel again.<br />
<br />
So in the end, the EQ sequence of 1333333333333 is same as the complicated sequence of 123334335673357337 once that sequence is known.  Both works 95% of the time and both are the sequence of choice for a vast majority of encounters.<br />
<br />
The same can be applied to soloing.  Go to any post where people talk about how great they solo.  I can guaranteed you they did mostly the same thing every time they solo.  For example the one that talks about how MS + Overpower works great on soloing would roughly look like:<br />
<br />
M12MM12MM12MM12M<br />
<br />
where M = macro to switch weapons, 1 = MS, 2 = Overpower<br />
<br />
Once the optimal sequence is known, you'd be stupid to do anything but repeating it over and over again, and that means no matter how complicated, it's exactly same as autoattack.  The best you can do in both game is done via repeating the same things over and over again, but WoW happens to require to push more buttons.  Before the optimal (or just winning is sufficient) sequence is discovered yes you have a lot of options to try, but once you find one that works, there's no reason not to stick with that one.</div></div><hr />

     I don't have time to find 3 or more and esp the stupidity of healer/slower/3 DPS/+tank and waste precious time I could be playing. I group on the fly in WoW, and enjoy it. But I enjoy soloing just as much.<br />
     There is 100 times the skill in playing a Warrior in WoW, anytime there is options, you can make mistakes. 1,2,3,3,3,3,3 is not a choice. Pulling 3 Elites equals one blue exp mob, well that makes my point exactly. 3 elite mobs are more fun to deal with then single pulling crappy exp mobs over and over. <br />
     I bet a standard key set would not work everytime in WoW if you are grouped with some that want to test your ability to hold aggro. A combo could be found eventually, but that takes skill beyond 1,2,3,3,3,3,3. Or pray taunt works.<br />
     1,2,3,3,3,3 is due to Verant/SOE dev laziness and the desire to make Warriors the gimp garbage class of EQ. Yea up-power the Warriors and buffs make them to powerful, well weaken the buffs maybe? <br />
     When you have classes quadding or kiting entire zones clean of mobs, and others not able to solo  you got problems. FIX THEM, don't deny they exist, don't cover them up, and get off the myopic &quot;vision&quot; only &quot;a&quot; class can solo and &quot;b&quot; can not.<br />
     Many also have a problem with the play 6 nights a week raid 4-6 hour lifeless dweeb mentality of EQ. If your life is so empty you have that much time to waste, I pity you.</div></div><hr />

Skill genearlly only comes into play when there are things you do with unpredictable effects.

You can't say well I hit this guy with a rocket last time and he died so this has to be the winning strat because the action produces unpredictable results.  EQ taunt is unpredictable.  That's why someone who is watching the game carefully plays better than they someone who does not.

Starcraft is another good example.  The SC opening game is completely non-skill based amongst experts because openings have been studied so much to the point that people actually know stuff like 'if I build a bunker he can't get more than 6 Dragoons which is what is needed to break this defense until 6:35 in the game, but by then I'll have a Siege Tank to counter&quot; and when you know stuff like that you can completely ignore skill and just repeatedly push buttons.  But once the game goes past the midgame the complexity quickly becomes far greater than the human mind can handle, and then the better player will usually win (assuming they didn't fall behind in the opening).  However, for this to work in MMORPG you'd have to have skills with uncertain results, which people hate to depend on (i.e. EQ Taunt).  It's one thing a fireball might do 500 or it might do 0 on a resist but just imagine Sunder Armor sometimes produces 1/5th the aggro it usually does (and not a miss either), that'd force you to pay attention but it certainly isn't what people want, I think.</div></div><hr />

I dont play with robots so their actions may (and often do) vary without warning or even logical purpose.  Makes it kinda fun sometimes ;)  They also dont assist me.  But yea, when every one follows the MA things flow smoother.  I dunno about you, but when things are going too smooth (more like boring) I pull more mobs. It worked in EQ =) Works in WoW too. Those virtuoso performances are fun as hell!  You gotta stop fighting greenies man.  Live a little.<br />

FPS games are a test of who has the best computer set up and best ping to the server.  Maybe a little bit of mouse aim and click timing.  May miss? May Hit? May kill your own guy?  Sounds like a suck ass player with a crappy comp.  FPS are so predictable its boring as hell an hour after you start playing em.  The cats who playem all day are deadly accurate.  Them being human is the only source of unpredictablity in a FPS games except perhaps lag.<br />
<br />
Not sure why you brought up beta taunt.  Blizzard also saw the infinite gayness that it was and took it out before they released the game.  They did make it a lil more like what you are used to.  Nifty thing about it though, we actually get to see when it fails (and why).  Took a loooooooong fucking time for that to happen in EQ.  Taunt in WoW can be counted on a little more than EQ taunt could, but it still gets resisted alot.  I cant remember if it misses or can be dodged, blocked, etc.  Either way, WoW taunt is not 100% predictable, except perhaps on the high end raid boss mobs where it works 0% of the time.<br />

<br />
Seriously, that uncertainty you are seeking comes in the form of Red, OJ, and sometimes Yellow con mobs in WoW. Its very much level based.  It affects everything you do against a foe. Hit/miss, resist, mitigation, mob defensive skills, they all are used to insure uncertainty, not just 1 single mystery skill.  You dont have to like it, but thats the way they did it.  It still works and the game of chance is still very fun.  I havent played the same game two nights in a row since I started last fall.</div></div><hr />

And the difference between a good warrior and a bad one in WoW is massive, partly because theres no dominating CC / pulling. In WoW instances the warrior calls the move, pulls the mobs, and is responsible for keeping the incoming cluster off the dress wearers. And unlike EQ you are not dependant on +aggro procs, LFG and raid gear to do your job.</div></div><hr />

That's just stupid. If you want to compare games, compare Kunark EQ with WoW. Compare a Kunark warrior with a WoW warrior, both level 60.

<br />
- Reduce enemy DPS : Disarm, Demo shout, concussion blow<br />
- Reduce enemy armor, with sunder armor<br />
- several RELIABLE abilities to interrupt casters<br />
- AE fear<br />
- Several AE-friendly abilities (cleave, thunderclap, whirlwind...)<br />
- Execute <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Without loss of generality we'll assume the combination 123334335673357337 works. If you're not convinced you can always take an example where you've won such an encounter and change the #s appropriately (e.g. maybe your #6 is concussive blow, or whatever).<br />
<br />
Now we'll assume you're a good tank and your group won without anyone dying. After all this is a pretty generic pull in the dungeons that you're expected to win. Now you come across another set of 3 similar elite mobs. Do you have any reason to believe the combination 123334335673357337 won't work this time? No, because the game is deterministic. You wouldn't want a game where what worked the first time suddenly didn't work under the same situation. So it'd be pretty safe to assume that repeating what worked earlier should enjoy the same success (assuming of course everyone in the group is still doing the same thing as before of course), and you'd be wise to repeat the same thing that worked before rather than reinventing the wheel again.<br />
<br />
So in the end, the EQ sequence of 1333333333333 is same as the complicated sequence of 123334335673357337 once that sequence is known. Both works 95% of the time and both are the sequence of choice for a vast majority of encounters.<br />
<br />
It's the same for every class. With my priest I heal exactly in the same way when I fight similar group of ennemies. Now you can apply your logic in every kind of game, like you said. The skill needed playing a warrior is the same you need for every class : Know the game, know what other classes can and must do, react and adapt quickly whatever happen. Just like EQ, in fact.<br />
<br />
Still, pressing 123333333 in EQ was boring. Here in warcraft our warriors have the potential to save the day in many more ways than the old &quot;three minutes of glory&quot; we had in Everquest.</div></div><hr />

The fact of the matter is that there is a vast difference between a good warrior, and someone who just presses buttons. I see it, everyone see's it.  You can refuse to admit there is a difference, but that's your perogative.  There was a huge difference between a kick spam monkey and a good warrior in EQ as well.<br />
<br />
Good warriors see problems and fix them.  WoW gives warriors far more options for fixing problems, hence, good warriors can fix even more problems than we could in EQ.<br />

Someone doing MC every week would almost certainly have better gear than someone named Istaborcs.  Even if they are doing the exact same thing it'd be very surprising if the former doesn't outperform the latter significantly and is therefore a completely irrelevant comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone with common sense ought to know what things you shouldn't be doing, but feel free to compare to those who does defy common sense.  I have seen Warriors who don't even push buttons, but those are not the people you should strive to beat.  In terms of how effective they are, the HS monkey you described is less than the EQ autoattack Warrior because autoattack is the best DPS skill and the best long term aggro generation skill an EQ Warrior possesses, while HS is not remotely close to optimal anything.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, WoW's considerable options give you far more opportunities to gimp yourself, and no doubt people do gimp themselves in spectcular ways.  But there is still only one correct path for 95% of the encounters that you're expected to win easily (i.e. the path that works for you should be the one you use everytime), and a good warrior strives to make the other 5% as easy as the 95%.  It's great that you can pull off a miraculous save for the 5% emergencies, but it'd be better if you know how to prevent the 5% from ever happening in the first place.  Now I suppose some people will say they want a challenge or whatever, but what is challenge that is simulated by deliberately playing poorly?  In EQ a normal pull can be challenging if I go and get 3 more mobs on purpose, but just because a group can win against such a pull doesn't mean this is what you should do.  And actually, if you want that kind of challenge, the random pickup group provides more than enough of such opportunities.<br />
<br />
In the end if you find yourself having a lot of things to do, that means your group isn't trying hard enough to break the game.  I play the game to win in the easily and safest possible way and it is expected to be very boring when I do win.  If I ever wanted a challenge, the pickup group covers that far more than anything the game can provide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err, the path of least resistance applies to more than being higher level than the stuff you're fighting.  The safest way to kill stuff that can't possibly kill you is still the safest way to kill stuff that can kill you.  You somehow have the feeling it changes when stuff gets harder.  It does not.  There is still a safest way, although it is quite likely now that the safest way does not guaranteed survival, but it is still the best option.  <br />
<br />
Now if you mean challenge in the sense of trying to aggro a mob that's &gt;4 since it will automatically resist most aggro abilities you may have, keep in mind that the game does not intend you to play it like this.  Even raid mobs top out at around 63 after the 500 mask as far as I know.  If you want challenge that way, the average pickup group will give you far more challenge than you ever need.</div></div><hr />

You are saying that the exact same thing that works on greenies and greys that cannot really hurt you will also work on yellow and OJ's who will definatly hurt you.  That might have held true in EQ (to an extent) but that's not the case in WoW.  For example, your rage generation sucks on OJ mobs compared to grey mobs.  That kinda throws a kink in what buttons to push when.  Wouldn't you agree?</div></div><hr />

That kinda throws a kink in what buttons to push when.  Wouldn't you agree?<br />
<br />
You sound like just because rage generation sucks you can't prioritize which buttons are better for aggro generation.  So let's say I give you some hypothetical 'tough' situation, whatever it may be.  Is your plan going to be:<br />
<br />
1.  If everyone does what they're supposed to (and this part can be arbitrarily complex), so that even if I only have 1/(whatever) rage of normal, we can still win.  <br />
<br />
2.  WoW is a complex game so obviously we can't count on any predetermined plan to work.  Instead we'll hope that RNG smiles on our favor so I can get enough rage and win.  <br />
<br />
It is generally accepted that using Bloodrage when you can't get much rage is a good idea.  Why is it a good idea?  Because now you just removed some of the uncertainity with rage generation.  It is possible you get lucky on a few hits and get some extra rage.  It is possible that you understand the game so throughly that with a mere 5 rage you can hold aggro on everything through some technical wizardry.  But why make it harder for yourself when you can click a button and remove the uncertainty?  Have you ever gave advice people on what to do as a Warrior?  If you do, it is certainly understood that if someone does what you say, it's supposed to work without relying on the RNG to be in your favor (otherwise they're not really good advice at all if it only works when you're lucky).  <br />
<br />
If you ever planned any kind of 'strat' whether it's a pull, a boss, or anything else, you're favoring repetition over skill, as you believe a set of actions that you devised will work reliably without requiring a leap of faith on the RNG. <br />
<br />
Now you can say there's stuff with targetting mobs, timing, switching targets, or whatever.  Yes, all these matter, but a good plan will try to minimize such issues.  If a plan requires you to be able to constantly switch between 25 mobs using 25 abilities to win, this plan would obviously fail most of the time because that is simply too hard for most people to pull off.  Let's say your plan calls for fearing an add to CC it.  Yes the fear can break or get resisted or whatever, and it'd be wise to have backup plans and people who can pick up the slack if the fear fails.  But, those are backup plans, not the main.  You still assume that a fairly easily repeatable action of fear (hitting the fear hotkey) is your primary form of defense.  When this plan works you'd have one guy hitting the fear hotkey over and over and you'd be satisfied that this plan works.  A good plan will inherently try to remove as much uncertainty as possible, because no one likes to depend on luck for win.<br />
<br />
I don't claim to know what is the optimal set of buttons to push, but since people do manage to 'win' in this game, it can be assumed that a set of actions that is sufficient for winning does exist and can be replicated (again, because no good strat relies on good luck alone for victory).  Once those actions are known, it's merely repetition.  It might take a while to figure it out, because there are far more possibilities in WoW due to the game engine, but it does exist.</div></div><hr />

I wont mention what you sound like.<br />
<br />
Priorties change with the situation.  So does my button sequence.  Rage generation is one example of something that changes between green/gray cons and yellow/oj cons.  Others I can think of off the top of my head would hit/miss ratio, melee defensive skills and mitigation, fight duration, and of course gear requirements.<br />

You always got Bloodrage up?  Its sure handy when you do.  But it aint always up.  As you pointed out, it does remove some of the uncertainty with rage generation.  You seem to disreguard the fact that there is still penty of uncertainty left to make things interesting.<br />
Have you ever gave advice people on what to do as a Warrior?  If you do, it is certainly understood that if someone does what you say, it's supposed to work without relying on the RNG to be in your favor (otherwise they're not really good advice at all if it only works when you're lucky). <br />
Yes, when asked I have.  I usually mention something about your luck in my answer.  You may believe the RNG can be eliminated as a factor in the equation, but I sure dont.  It will always be there, keeping us on our toes.<br />
<br />
If you ever planned any kind of 'strat' whether it's a pull, a boss, or anything else, you're favoring repetition over skill, as you believe a set of actions that you devised will work reliably without requiring a leap of faith on the RNG.<br />
If I'm planning a strat, I aint gonna forget that the RNG can lay waste to the best laid of plans.<br />
Now you can say there's stuff with targetting mobs, timing, switching targets, or whatever.  Yes, all these matter, but a good plan will try to minimize such issues.  If a plan requires you to be able to constantly switch between 25 mobs using 25 abilities to win, this plan would obviously fail most of the time because that is simply too hard for most people to pull off.  Let's say your plan calls for fearing an add to CC it.  Yes the fear can break or get resisted or whatever, and it'd be wise to have backup plans and people who can pick up the slack if the fear fails.  But, those are backup plans, not the main.  You still assume that a fairly easily repeatable action of fear (hitting the fear hotkey) is your primary form of defense.  When this plan works you'd have one guy hitting the fear hotkey over and over and you'd be satisfied that this plan works.  A good plan will inherently try to remove as much uncertainty as possible, because no one likes to depend on luck for win.<br />
just back ups?  More like the reason for the kill when things go wrong (the norm).  Of equal importance to a central game plan is each individual players ability to think on their feet and able to adjust to the situation in time.  Just like in life, things rarely go according to plan.<br />
I don't claim to know what is the optimal set of buttons to push, but since people do manage to 'win' in this game, it can be assumed that a set of actions that is sufficient for winning does exist and can be replicated (again, because no good strat relies on good luck alone for victory).  Once those actions are known, it's merely repetition.  It might take a while to figure it out, because there are far more possibilities in WoW due to the game engine, but it does exist.<br />
And this is different in any other game that ever was how?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a general plan that works pretty well for various groups of mobs, but nothing super technical like this. I repeat...and I thought I was methodical.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the WoW warrior is any more or less complicated than the EQ warrior.   And that is a compliment to both games.  An argument to the contrary, to the extent one exists in this thread, is silly.  Some people will push buttons.  The good players will push buttons strategically.</div></div><hr />
