<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krizl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started my computer over from scratch, too much junk on it  :p  After re installing everything and starting up EQ again my arrow keys didn't work right!  :mad:   :eek:  up would press shift+up so everytime I tried to walk around I would end up reading text that I had sent.  The worst part is..... ALT + TAB doesn't  work! Got out the good old recovery disks and started all over again, this time the arrow keys work but alt+tab and windows key are still having problems.  Any ideas on fixes?  The keys aren't messed up outside of EQ so its not the keyboard, any help would be appreciated ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you gotta Re-Bind all the keys you wanted; I think the default keys were fubar for ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope there is a fix for this, let me just ask you.<br />
<br />
Do you have a raedon card? then ATI hotpoller is the culprit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is the fix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krizl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't seem to find the hotpoller anywhere, do have an ATI card though 9600.  Have that file, but I don't know how to edit it / whatever else I have to do  :confused:  Any further instruction would be great  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krizl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After a bit of searching I finally found the stupid thing, disabled it and......my keys still don't work  :eek:  :mad:  :( have a few more things to try but if you can think of any other reasons that it has not to work, all input is very welcome ^_^  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ack, are you using a voice chat program in the backround such as ventrilo, teamspeak etc?<br />
<br />
there is something called direct input and everquest flips out if you run 2 programs that use it, and with a &quot;hold down&quot; or auto-run(or auto something else on a button press) uses direct input most of the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BTW, remap your number lock auto run to something else, the bug is almost always related to toggling number lock.<br />
<br />
to fix it with out leaving press both your enters a few times, then press ctrl alt shift a few times (left AND right)<br />
<br />
that should clear it up for a bit, GL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krizl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't have any voice recognition programs.  Only thing I run is EQ, arrow keys still don't work with num lock but i can live with that, usuall do the enter bug for auto run lol  :D   Went through last night and updated windows, radeon, and a complete file check of EQ again; still no uck  :mad:  Not being able to 2 box is really getting on my nerves.  Petitioning for the 3rd time today will let ya know if I ever find a fix *sighs*.  Thanks for the help  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you redid your drivers after you disabled that then it is back on, so you may wana try to disable it again</div></div><hr />
