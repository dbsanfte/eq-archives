<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do people deal with the mem blur on this guy?  That could cause major problems for your healers and make it very hard for your MT to hold aggro.  I assume he's not the only mob who mem blurs, so knowing how to deal with it would be helpful in other encounters, too.<br />
<br />
As for the 3500 pt lifetap, I hear if your resists are high enough you can resist it sometimes?  MR or something else?  I'm guessing that he hits hard enough there's probably not much point in trying to keep runes up on the tank.  Has anyone done it with chain runes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We killed him with a pickup raid very easily. Just spam heal the MT and burn him down. He has crap for hp so shouldn't last long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He mem blurs?  I've been in on numerous kills and that has yet to be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People think he mem blurs because when you kill his guards, he repops to a much lighter hp form.  If you try and kill him without killing his guards, he has assloads of hp.  If you kill his guards first, which is what you're supposed to do, he goes down in about 1 minute.<br />
<br />
500mr sir and you'll resist his lifetap every single time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah I dont think I have had a lifetap land on me when I had 500 MR, if they do it is very rare.  If your MT is having probs getting resists up, have a beastlord give them ferocity, it is like +65 to all resists I think and stacks with everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is a horrible event. The lifetaps make me cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If they dropped like halfway decent loot, they wouldn't be so bad.  Carprin, Raex, and Vindor can make BoT tower lords fall to their knees, but their loot is 10x better.<br />
<br />
Carprin script mobs just drop absolute, total shit.</div></div><hr />

When POP first released, and this was one of the very first raid type events a guild did (after killing Grummus, which was basically the first along with Terris), this was decent RvR, IMO. The real reward was progression, your Bertox key, something to do when you weren't in Ssra or VT. BoT wasn't open to all, and when you did quest your way in, Tower bosses dropped one piece of loot about every five kills if you were lucky, and sometimes maybe even a rune. Not two loots + a rune every single time like you see now.  It's towers RvR that became too sweet of a deal for players at that level, not Carprin cycle that's too poor.<br />
<br />
If you think of Carprin cycle as flagging for progression as it actually is, and BoT towers as a free handout as it actually is, maybe things won't seem so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I always wondered who I pissed off, when the raid leader would make me MT the carprin cycle.  I was so happy the first time I lived through a Raex/Vindor killing as it always hurt being the MT on those mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah living through raex and vindor is an accomplishment. i remember the first time we did the cycle vindor 1 rounded me and i was like 8.8 at the time. couple cycles later i completely disced on vindor (fortitude and defensive) and barely lived them somehow managed to live through raex discless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks guys... good info as usual.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Put a bard in with your main tank, rampage tank, and secondary tank.  Guard of druzzil, psalm of veeshan, and ferocity, if needed, should be sufficient magic resist to help reduce the spike DPS with the lifetaps.  Throw in a bulwark of alendar for added measure.</div></div><hr />
