<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Other than the BP, is there any Time armor that would really be worth spending merit to get over Vadd's? I am inclined to not go in for any armor that I can upgrade to Vadd's simply because the Time armor is in demand by more classes. It seems like the thing to do is fill non-visible slots and weapons with Time gear, then farm the crap out of Qvic for visible slots. We are a couple of weeks out of Qvic I would imagine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A lot depends on your attitude about your equipment I think.<br />
<br />
Boots of Dispair are pretty popular because of the taunt mod despite not having the best other stats. They might be preferable for this reason to even Qvic boots.<br />
<br />
Since QVic doesn't have legs, Greeves of Furious Might are often worn, but to my mind you might be better off skipping them and getting Jointed Scaled Greeves in GoD.<br />
<br />
You mention the PoTime BP and it's seriously good. However, Qvic gauntlets are very nice and have the same effect as the PoTime BP. I tend to think if you through some twist of fate have something like a Ceremonial Jade-Inlaid Cuirass or even a Chestguard of Enchanted Marble you could concievably skip the PoTime BP if you get the QVic gauntlets although like I said the PoTime BP is real real nice and you will have it for quite awhile.<br />
<br />
The helm is not an issue even as nice as Faerune is to have all the time, the QVic helm is awesome. With a Warlord's Crown, I'd try to skip the PoTime helm. I'd like to say you could do this and still cheat the system and get Armguards of the Brute and keep Faerune for awhile. However the truth is Vadd's Vambraces are enough of an improvement that you'll get them. However, don't dispair - it's my understanding that between existing AA abilities and new OoW abilities for less than 100 AA (I'm being sarcastic) you can still have the equivilent of Faerune.<br />
<br />
I'll leave it to you to figure out accessories, but I think one &quot;issue&quot; not given enough thought is where should you have your haste and do you concider 45% haste important. If 40% is fine, the Earring of Corporeal Essence is a good choice. If you want 45%, I suggest holding out for the Cord of Temporal Weavings. I advise against getting haste on your shoulders - in Inktu'Ta Whispering Amice with a Parry II mod drops and you'll want it.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some and is good advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno Wandor. We have very similar Magelos (the major difference being apparently RZ puts out on your server...) My opinion on the matter is no matter what there's oging to be stiff competetion for good plate drops on any raid, whether it's Elemental, Time, or Qvic. I'm a fan of knowing the ins and outs of your guild's point system and jumping on anything that's a bargain. <br />
<br />
For example, you're wearing Ornate arms. While the Qvic arms are the best thing out there atm for what you're guild's realistically looking at, Armguards of the Brute, or hell, even an Elemental Vam mold would be a huge upgrade. (Inventing a point system atm) So let's say the average plate class in your guild has 150 points atm, maybe your guild makes like 3 points an hour per raid. Figure the Qvic arms are going to go for 100-180 points depending on who's in attendance when they drop. If you can pick up the Armguards of the brute for say, 40 points, you could feasably get maybe an RZ and TZ ring at a bargain too, and you just blew away the upgrade that Qvic arms would have been, and you still have more points than you would have if you'd gone for the Vadd's arms.<br />
<br />
My point is it depends on how your guild does loot. My guild has a strict point policy to determine drops, and as the most gear dependant class in the game, and also most counted on single players in the raid, we have to be mindfull of drops and point management, so I was happy to pick up Armguards of the Brute for 30 points while the last Elemental Mold went for 70 or so because of the effect it affords clerics, bards, Paladins, etc.<br />
<br />
I don't care what warrior you look at, there's always a guy with a &quot;problem slot&quot;. maybe it was bad luck with the RNG, maybe it was bad point management in their guild's loot system. Either way, don't pass up on good values on any upgrades that come along, and I stress the word VALUEs. Because no matter what you pick up at this point in your raiding career, it blows those Kizrak's away. :b<br />
<br />
(I know he wasn't specifically asking about arms, but the idea fits for all slots)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember that there is no &quot;plate&quot; or &quot;silk&quot; or &quot;leather&quot; when you talk about Muramite armor, it's all/all.  In your example you talked about arms which are gonna be one of the most wanted pieces.. partly because of the healing focus that the priest classes get which owns.  Personally I've been passing on all the arms that have dropped making sure all our healers get them first(have Armguards of the Brute, they'll do for now.)  I'm in a merit guild.<br />
<br />
If your in a DKP guild this is what I would suggest, especially if you are in a position to be able to farm Qvic hard-core(like 2-3 times a day hard-core.)  Hold out.  Let everyone get the first drops out of the way, then start bidding when there are only 1 or 2 people at the raid that need X mold. ;)<br />
<br />
To answere your original question, the only armor piece from Time that I wouldn't replace with Vadd's is a Quarm bracer, like said above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is there a use for 45 percent haste versus 40 percent on raids?<br />
Like I said, a lot depends on your attitude toward your equipment. I do happen to solo a fair amount. I recognize that Whispering Amice is real nice and advise not getting shoulder haste.<br />
<br />
If 45% haste means nothing to you, (and since Kelekdrix isn't very far off if you're starting QVic) you might want to aim for Earring of Corporeal Essence, Whispering Amice, and Girdle of Intense Durability.<br />
<br />
My point is that haste and where you will slot it is worth thinking about and PoTime is the place to get haste.<br />
<br />
Depending on if you will have any competition in QVic, I'd assume you will get Vadd's in every slot possible. Since legs and the BP don't drop in QVic, that means Raex BP, Greeves of Furious Might or Jointed Scaled Greeves, and a Quarm Bracer - all else Vadd's. I reiterate that many players skip both Raex and Vadd's boots in favor of Boots of Dispair for the Taunt mod.<br />

Incorrect. A developer clearly stated that the 10% mod on the boots does work.. even for warriors.. he may have even said that taunt cap is 252.  I'll see if i can find the post/message.<br />

<br />
Another note is, Depends on your guild, for us Qvic Molds = Free, because its a trival event and spawns 4 times a day.<br />
<br />
Quarm bracer isn't that much better, costs dkp, Vadds might not, better to let it go to clerics, paladins, etc, someone who can use the focus. Plus Zun and Tacvi bracer is better. Vadds = Free, if your thinking ahead.<br />
<br />
Txe boots are pretty rare, depends if your going to farm it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We normally do an attendance based merit system for raid loots. We only officially raid twice a week, but there are enough people on to do minis every night. The guild is primarlily Aussie with a few insomniac Americans so I would imagine we coulde round up enoug people to do minis a couple times a day. I would imagine that Qvic loot will be merit free and we'll just /rand for the drops. So far, it sounds like the thing to do for me is hold out for Qvic for armor and keep trying for non-visible slots in Time.<br />
<br />
Incidently, I am not a fan of putting haste anywhere. If there is a better non-haste item for a slot, I would rather just use tribute haste. I have way over 100k tribute and it's not that hard to get more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Zun wrist shares the same focus though if you're worried about it though.  Debatable whether Zun bracer is better than Quarm, 35hp, somewhat better resists and 2% dot shielding for 11ac loss.  Worth looting Quarm bracer over Vadd's imo but I guess it depends on how your guilds dkp works.  Also I'd assume Zun bracer costs more than Quarm anyway if that was even a consideration.</div></div><hr />

This is the route i went, and the 2 % shielding on them are much more useful then the accuracy on the vadds boots.  These will last until you can get Txevu runt event boots.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember how the &quot;haste cap&quot; was arrived at originally, but I don't think this is true.  At least it is commonly assumed that a 36% haste item with VQ is just as good as a 41% haste item with VQ which is just as good as 45% haste item with VQ.   There doesn't need to be a &quot;cap&quot; for spell haste, because haste spells don't stack with each other, so the highest level haste spell percentage IS the cap.<br />
<br />
The common wisdom now is that the max haste you can get from a haste spell + a haste item is about 100%, with ver 3 bard haste stacking on top of that, so the only advantage of having a 45% haste item is a little added DPS when you don't have a haste buff.  As far as I know there hasn't been a recent test of this, and one would probably be worth doing, but as far as we know right now I believe the 100% + bard number is as good as you can do.<br />
<br />
I do know of a certain group of uberguild rogues that think 45% haste is very important, but I couldn't tell you if their opinion has any basis in reality.</div></div><hr />

I recall there being a point where you cannot lower the effective delay below a certain point because it breaks the game (like the moss covered twig fiasco), which is in effect a haste cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Visions of Grandeur - Increase Attack Speed by 58%<br />
58% + 36% = 94%<br />
58% + 41% = 99%<br />
58% + 45% = 103% or actually 100% unless the haste cap of item + spell = 100% is changed.<br />
<br />
But, in fact item haste of 45% &gt; 41% &gt; 36% if VoG is used as the haste buff.<br />
so the only advantage of having a 45% haste item is a little added DPS when you don't have a haste buff.<br />
See above. Also Belt of Marvelous Visions 30% + 45% item haste + 5% cap independent haste from Primal Guard gives you 80% all on your own when soloing or a haste caster in not currently available.<br />
....the 100% + bard number is as good as you can do.<br />
100% from item and spell buff haste + bard song overhaste + 5% Primal Guard is as good as you can do afaik.<br />
<br />
When soloing, I'm pretty happy with 80% haste on my own vs. 36% haste from using only Tribute haste.<br />
<br />
In my view, despite the fact Tribute haste exists, Silver Hoop of Endless Speed and Earring of Corporeal Essence are not only generally AC and HP upgrades alone justifying getting them, but the potential for 11% more haste compared to Tribute haste when buffed with VoG is a useful bonus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Cast slow is considered the same as haste in that if you have a slow on you haste spells are ignored and the slow modifer is used.<br />
<br />
So as an example from total swing rate not added swing rate compared to other item hastes in there spell haste group:<br />
<br />
Normal Hasted<br />
45 = 200 = 1.01% more swings than 40%<br />
41 = 199 = 0.51% more swings than 40%<br />
40 = 198<br />
<br />
Normal Not Hasted-<br />
45 = 145 = 3.57% more swings than 40%<br />
41 = 141 = 0.71% more swings than 40%<br />
40 = 140<br />
<br />
With 20% slow<br />
45 = 125 = 4.17% more swings than 40%<br />
41 = 121 = % more swings than 40%<br />
40 = 120<br />
<br />
With 50% slow<br />
45 = 95 = 5.56% more swings than 40%<br />
41 = 91 = 1.11% more swings than 40%<br />
40 = 90<br />
<br />
With 80% slow<br />
45 = 65 = 8.33% more swings than 40%<br />
41 = 61 = 1.67% more swings than 40%<br />
40 = 60<br />
<br />
<br />
It can be clearly be seen that at higher hasted rates it matters less but when you have 50% slow on you there is close to a 6% differance or about a third of the effect of Echo of Anger.</div></div><hr />

No matter how much worn haste you've you're the same speed when slowed.  But even if it doesn't, 40% haste with 80% slow would be 1.4 X 0.2 = 0.28, not 0.60.  If you want to verfy that slow is multiplied instead of subtracted, get a 2H weapon with a 90% slow.  If it's 1.4 - 0.9 = 0.5 then you'd swing at half the speed.  Find yourself a 90% slow (Caprin cycle, Warlord Gintolaken, or Agnarr script) to see the difference between 10 times as slow (10%) versus twice as slow (50%).</div></div><hr />

The only way over that is v3 haste ( primal guard OR Bard overhaste).<br />

v3 haste does not stack.<br />

There is no &quot;minimum delay&quot; on weapons. That was a old mistake that parses were making and was also figured out shortly thereafter. Think of haste as increasing the speed of your swing,not as decreasing the weapon delay.</div></div><hr />

If your enhanters like to use clicky haste tell them to pull out their epics and give you max haste and 12 ac instead of 20 atk. <br />

If you want to verfy that slow is multiplied instead of subtracted, get a 2H weapon with a 90% slow.  If it's 1.4 - 0.9 = 0.5 then you'd swing at half the speed.  Find yourself a 90% slow (Caprin cycle, Warlord Gintolaken, or Agnarr script) to see the difference between 10 times as slow (10%) versus twice as slow (50%).<br />

Only worn haste is over written by slow unless it has been changed.  So it would start at 140% of normal rate.<br />
<br />
though I see the error in my math now for the rest of it, but 45% haste when slowed by 80% remains much better to have.</div></div><hr />

Both are pretty darn slow if you ask me.  Yes 0.28 (roughly 1/4 the normal speed) is still 40% faster than 0.2 (1/5 normal speed) but at that speed it's really irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.4 x .2 = .28<br />
1.45 x .2 = .29<br />
<br />
Hardly a margin worth mentioning. If a haste item is the best item for the slot, then by all means wear it. But no point in sacrificing any AC/HP for haste.</div></div><hr />
