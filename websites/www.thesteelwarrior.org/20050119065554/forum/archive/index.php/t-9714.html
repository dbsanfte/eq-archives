<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joewho</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, i am in a casual guild, and have this 65 warrior, he is a pretty good warrior however he doesnt have nearly enough HP for a 65 warrior. I also have a 66 Necro so cash isnt too much of a problem, is there any suggestions anyone would have for more HP? Different AAs? Change of gear? preferrably something droppable, i also have about 1200 Nro Adv points (for royal attendant armour)<br />
Any help would be appreciated<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1086521 <br />
<br />
He is getting to the point where i am thinking about binning him and playing my necro full time, with these new expansions he just cannot keep up with the tanking needs, therefore not getting the good groups, and not getting the good gear...its a vicious circle<br />
<br />
Flame on...:)</div></div><hr />

-Ornate BP<br />
-Royal Sands Bracer<br />
-Malevolent Greaves (760 pts from EF)<br />
-Conqueror's Cape<br />
-Duskwalker's Sash or Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
-another Bloodmetal Earring, or that new Fiercly Hooked Claw<br />
-Barbed Rubicite Mantle<br />
-Ornate Helm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, i feel your pain. I'm in exactly the same boat you are, too bad your not on tribunal :) maybe we could help eachother. maybe im just depressed about it? one thing you can do right away to catch up a bit in the hp department is max studiness. 6110 hits wont be enough to tank mpg, but i had around 6129 probably with the release of oow, and i had no problems buffed up to 8.5k+ (read: proper buffs) tanking in WoS or RCoD. RCoD can be scarey but its doable. I know its quite an AA grind and I havnt even finished it yet as I just havnt had the time but I'd say other than defensive aa's HP aa's are second in the order of importance. Don't do much good to have nice agro if you cant take hits.<br />
<br />
And whadaya doin with the GSo4W up when you have a nice combo like that? i find the CHSD to be extremely good agro with an anger2 aug, and i'd imagine with a3+ it'd be pretty killer.  Most warriors mainhand the GBoS over the CHSD, and if you had those up instead of the staff, you'd gain about 35 hits and 12sta, and your endurance would stay the same.<br />
<br />
So basically for free you could be around 6150 hits (more than adequit to tank early pop and luclin, mebbe enuff to survive some GoD trials, certainly pleanty for sewers) and  you already have an excellent agro combo.<br />
<br />
You could do a few easy, if not boring quests for a few better rings:<br />
<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22185<br />
and<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12316<br />
<br />
Thats another 4+STA 3+AC and another 25 raw hits, again, basically for free.<br />
<br />
Since cash isnt a problem for you, look into some of the nice attunable gear floating around in Baz. On my server I snagged this for 9k, the next weekend it was down to 3k:<br />
<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30675<br />
<br />
Theres another 25 raw hits, 14+Sta, 5+Dex, and its pretty :) (lol)<br />
<br />
When you're done with those, go to WoS and get a group near portals, I got this off a random, no name trash mob:<br />
<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30485<br />
<br />
Thats a whopping 90+hps on what you currently wear, in addition to the nice effect (as  opposed to no effect), along with 3+AC, 3+Sta, and 12+Dex.<br />
<br />
Add these:<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31668<br />
<br />
and thats another 40 raw hits and 6 Sta, for the price of 4ac.<br />
<br />
All together those upgrades/swaps/aa's will get you another 615hps, 2AC (yawn, AC is AC),  39 Sta (at least another 100-ish hps, more perhaps), 25 Dex, and a few saves to boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know I'm forgetting a lot of stuff but I hope this helps ya mate. GL to ya :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Joewho</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice, about the weaps, i do normally use the GboS and CHSD combo, but I was setup for DPS non-agro when i Magelo updated :) But i will look into the other kit upgrades and look at getting a lot more AAs, especially sturdiness.<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">magnetic helm is relatively cheap, as are the legs, for great boosts to AC and HP for ya both.  <br />
<br />
Ornate BP like another suggested would be a great upgrade for your AC, or royal attendant BP also is super AC.  <br />
<br />
Steel Rings of Earthen Resilience would be great upgrades for your rings, add 7ac and 25hp per ring, and pretty cheap if you got a 66 nec to farm for ya.  <br />
<br />
heavy tooled Weapon belt or duskwalker sash would be solid upgrade for your waist slot, and there are several OOW cloaks available now that beat the werewolf cape... Conqueror's cape is 95hp (only 12ac tho), Shroud of Defender is 16ac like 80hp with a clicky AC boost, and Tainted cloak of Treachery is 20ac and 105 hp i think, maybe more.  <br />
<br />
My next earring upgrade would be a Rugged Earring of Infestation, its 10ac and i think 80 or 85hp... slightly better than bloodmetal and lots better than the shiny cog you're wearing.  <br />
<br />
those items will give you serious boosts to HP and AC, all bazaar buyable upgrades.  Dont despair, just go pharming...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple other items...(I know you mentioned hp, but I think it will help you a lot if you improve the AC and mitigation also)<br />
<br />
1.  Loyalist Shield for your back (50 AC...search on this site for the quest info...some people have bad luck on the main drop...I got mine in 20 minutes  :p )<br />
<br />
2.  Heavy Rubicite Girdle for the waist - 25 ac and good hp<br />
<br />
Also, I'd get CS3 and ID5 before more planar durability AA's - the extra 15% damage reduction from the mitigation AA's will be much more helpful then another hundred of so hp.</div></div><hr />
