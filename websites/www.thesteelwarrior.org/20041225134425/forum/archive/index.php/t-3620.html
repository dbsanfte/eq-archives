<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just out of curiosity has anyone parsed out how much of an increase in dps it is during the three minute period. I like to use it when I'm in experience groups and the mobs are doing such little damage that the cleric is getting bored and nuking. It definently increases the damage but I don't have a parser of my own nor the time to do a good study of it (Curse of the Raid Leader/Officer).<br />
<br />
PS - Hey Shik, is the resized sig okay or do I have to run it in the dryer on high again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard reports of approximately 30-50% based on RNG, but I've never been able to parse it myself, what with the whole not being a warrior thing. In an LDON situation it's a great way to mow thorugh a knot of critters, assuming you have another tank. The warrior in my nightly group uses it pretty exclusively as her /discipline of choice, since it's a pretty rare occurance for me to die while tanking. Still, when she gets hit under agressive she really gets railed, on the order of 40% more damage.<br />
<br />
While I can't check it myself, I expect that agressive is much like defensive, where the random component of all outgoing attacks gains a multiplier somewhere near 2, as does the DI of all incoming attacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A guildmate does around 160 DPS w/o, and has hit up to 240 DPS w/ aggressive and atk buffs.</div></div><hr />

Wishful thinking I know but would certainly make us more attractive to exp groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggressive range damage already steps onto Monk territory (especially non Time capable monks), possibly even rogue territory.  With aggressive your max hit goes by 30% so I'd estimate it's at least a 30% DPS increase but aggressive also seems to bump up your min hit (just feels like, haven't parsed) so I'd think it's probably more than 30% in practice.<br />
<br />
A shorter refresh timer on aggressive would probably be the best you can ever expect out of that disc, and even then, you're going to have a lot of DPS classes complain.  I don't really see how Warriors can get away with any DPS increase without stepping on pre Staff of Transcendence monks.</div></div><hr />

Shik has sig envy going on =p</div></div><hr />

Pretty hard to parse since you only get it for 3 mins at a time.  You'd probably have to make a hotkey that said something like &quot;AGGRESSIVE ON&quot; and &quot;AGGRESSIVE OFF&quot; and use those when you activate the discipline and when it fades.  Then edit your logs to remove everything outside of those quotes til you have a relatively large sample of combat with only aggressive on.<br />
<br />
My usual DPS is about 120 with BoC/Blackout and I've seen spikes up to 250 or so over a period of 2 or 3 mins but never more than 130 or so sustained.</div></div><hr />

He was dying way to slow so I tanked with aggressive from 50%. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup.<br />
I use this disc exclusivly in LDoN and hit it each time it refreshes.<br />
Helps alot for pickup groups too.<br />
People remember a tank that can also do high DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why tank if you're doing aggressive?  With the +100% damage you take (roughly), anyone else could've tanked better than you unless there's a gross gear mismatch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't take +100% damage, more like ~+30%, the same as your max hit increase. On Ldon mobs it really isn't an impairment of tanking ability, your healer might have to cast one extra heal over the 3 mins, depending on the healing style of the healer.<br />
<br />
I normally hit /aggro when I have 4-5 mobs close together, so I can switch to fresh mobs almost instantly.</div></div><hr />
