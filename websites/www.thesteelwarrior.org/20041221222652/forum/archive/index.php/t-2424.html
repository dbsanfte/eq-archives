<br />
I know they are important but I'm trying to explain to an SK why PD3 and PE are more important to me for the known quantity of HP's I get vs. CA/CS and the iffyness of them.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I usually RT or am DPS.  Don't MT often ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found the CA/LR5 and related topics.  What my belief / arguement is, would be:<br />
<br />
ND3<br />
PD3<br />
PE<br />
PP5<br />
<br />
Is a more important order to go in than ND3, CA3, LR5, CS3, ID5, PD3, PP5, PE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personaly I think <br />
ND3, PE, CA1, CS1, CA3, CS3 LR5, ID5, PD3, PP5<br />
<br />
Is the way to go. I personally don't see the big deal with PP5. I thought that stats really don't really have that much of an impact anyway compared to other abilities.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me that PP5 is really that much better than PP0 other than the reatively small ATK bonus from the STR? Does the extra DEX really make you proc that much more?</div></div><hr />

CA and CS do nothing against spells for example.  But if you are low on AAs and have some nice gear that gets you up into the 8500+ HP range then I'd say the CA/CS route might be more beneficial to do first.  I doubt many people are in that situation though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am planning basically the same thing as what Korinn said, with the addition of AE Taunt:<br />
<br />
ND3, AET, CA1, CS1, PE, CA3, CS3, LR5, ID5, PD3, PP5 <br />
<br />
PP5 is good if you can get STR/STA maxed. STR for the 25 ATK you get. ATK adds up and where else can you get an easy 25 ATK? STA of course for the HP. 25 STA should be worth over 100hp, and again - where else are you going to get an easy 100hp upgrade for just the cost of AA. Granted, PP5 is much more expensive when you consider HP/AA, but that is why it's at the end of the list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 points for maybe 100hp and 25 atk is bogus.  You can get far better returns putting 10 points in almost any other AA.  CA and CS should definitely come before planar power, because of the relative costs of each. 10 points for 100hp or 12 points for 10% avoidance or mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas-<br />
<br />
I'm actually a bit of a fan of PP, since it gives a lot of little increases that individually don't seem all that great, but actually add up.<br />
-STR more ATK/better dmg distribution<br />
-STA more hp<br />
-DEX more procs<br />
-AGI more AC<br />
<br />
Certainly debatable if those are worth 10aas, but even with moderate buffing all 4 should hit 305 easily w/ decent gear, which wouldn't be possible w/o.  Probably the biggest win is the extra ATK, since it's pretty easy to max out worn and buff ATK already.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Frod... ,,!,, :P<br />
<br />
To the rest, thanks for the input.<br />
<br />
My rationale for PP before CA/CS is:<br />
<br />
STR = 25ATK<br />
AGIL = 4+ AC<br />
DEX = bleh<br />
STA = (with aforementioned 17% bonus) about 175hps<br />
<br />
Now, unbuffed with only ND3 I have 5616 hps.  With PD3,PE,PP5 that total becomes 5948.  Now buffed with the addition of PP5 add another (6*25)*1.17=175.5 so 175 for an *effective* 6123 unbuffed (since I will hit 305 buffed).  That is 507 hps.  Granted it's quite a bit of AA (26 more than I have now).  Since the additional hps are a known quantity. Wouldn't that be better spending path than CA/CS since spells / AE's don't take those defensive MT'ing type skills into play?<br />
<br />
Note I mentioned I don't MT, occassionally RT / offtank and am mostly DPS / emergency tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is that the 1 sta = 6hp rule doesn't hold true past 255, so what you're basing getting PP off of is flawed.  The reality is that you'll gain much, much less from your stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with Korinn too. PP is way, way, way down on my list of AAs to get. <br />
<br />
I've gone<br />
<br />
run3, regen3, nd3, ae taunt, ca3, cs1, PE, cs3, lr5<br />
<br />
I'm now working for ID5. After that, I'll start on some offensive AAs probably. Maybe TM, I dunno. Maybe PD, but that seems pretty low reward too. Both my Droga weapons have DD procs with the stuns, so Ingenuity might be fun and pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my personal sense, unparsed, is that LR is huge. I really feel like I'm noticing a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much is it then?<br />
<br />
Although after looking at the benefits of PP vs CA/LR, I'm thinking CA3 &gt; PP...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maxing Planar Planar resulted in gaining 99 pure hp for me.  For some reason I think I lost 1 hp in rounding somewhere along the line, my stamina is maxed without buffs so your mileage may vary.  I decided to do PP after defensive not because I felt there was nothing better to do with the AA's but it meant breaking the 7k unbuffed goal I had set to do pre-elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is 25 Stamina extra * 3.6 hps per point if your stamina was maxed before.<br />
<br />
25*3.6 = 90 hps :)<br />
<br />
Oh yah, plus your Modifiers, ND, PE etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much is it then? <br />
<br />
Well, I don't have PP, but I can tell ya what I do know about this brokeass goddamned stamina number.  I cap out at 281 sta with Boar these days, which is limited to 280 by level 65.   So i'm sitting around in droga last nite with 7180hp with Boar on.  Boar gets dispelled and rather than redo it with mana, I just click my shaman's BP for Riotus Health.  I end up at 271 stamina, and my HP goes to 7150.<br />
<br />
So, 30hp = 9 stamina, and bear in mind that I have ND 3, PE  and PD 1.  That makes it 3.3hp/sta for me with those modifiers.  So would I spend 10 points on 80 some odd HP?  Probably not.  Spending 3 for 80 some odd HP on planar duribility was bad enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass is right about PP. <br />
<br />
However, PD = 80 hps for 6 hours work (max) is pretty darn good.<br />
<br />
80 hp item upgrades dont grow on trees (or 6 hours of work GUARANTEED)<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, if you ignore the fact that you can get upwards of 5 or 600 depending on gear from the 12 points you spent on ND.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is like the first girl who takes you to bed :)<br />

Special Offer, one time only!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Planar Power is only good if you want to move up a few spots on EQRanking.  At the rate of 1 AA for 10 HP, I think you can make a case that putting AAs into resists would have a better return (especially in heavy AE situations, like PoP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, PP will rarely raise you on EQrankings because most of us don't have maxed stats without buffs. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is that with as hard as the mobs hit in POP, those 80 HP will be useless when compared to the hitpoints gained from the 10% avoidance/mitigation.  <br />
<br />
Of course, that said, I did buy PP5 for the sole purpose of boosting my HP raid buffed as my guild does tend to examine such things for purposes of tank line-up.</div></div><hr />
