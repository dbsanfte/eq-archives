In PoEarth you can acquire the components for a Stonewood Compound Bow, Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance, etc. with a group.<br />
<br />
In starting in the EP's there's that PoTime/EP Warlord's armor.<br />
<br />
Because in QVic the armor drops like candy.<br />
<br />
Like Glatius says, it's a game - that means Free Loot Now(tm)!! It doesn't mean people win, lose, lead, lag, etc.<br />
<br />
Sure, there might be a non hardcore raiding progression path but even if the Free Loot Now(tm) crowd followed it, it would take time and effort and you have QVic armor - they are falling behind!!<br />
<br />
The &quot;casual players&quot; want the EP's opened up so they can get Stonewood Compound Bow, Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance, etc. They want Warlord's amror or something like it, after all why should only players that killed Quarm and beat PoTime have a Warlord's BP?<br />
<br />
Heck, unlock the path into QVic, why should only raid Warriors wear Vadd's?<br />
<br />
Like Glatius says, it's a game. Why should players that have duplicated your list of 50 Difficult Accomplishments have All The Fun(tm)?<br />
<br />
Free Loot Now(tm)! Free Loot Now(tm)! Free Loot Now(tm)!<br />
<br />
I pay mah $13!! Whar's mah Loot??!! Could ya put it on a Moss Snake pluhese? A Christmas Present is more exciting if ya get to unwrap it.<br />
<br />
I apologize for lumping all non hardcore players together. Some just want SoE to put a little more thought and effort into the non-hardcore raid progression path. When they log in they want new content and challanges in front of them. Raiding should not be the only way to progress. Maybe it isn't, but it could use a little work.<br />
<br />
Others however quit because they weren't willing to meet challanges and the only thing that will bring them back is Free Loot Now(tm) and it better be as good as what you had three months ago.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vicaire Delestacia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As I think SoE has stated, the majority of EQ players are not  in the very high end of the game.  Rather, high end hardcore raiders form a minority of the paying EQ population.  If the state of non hardrcore raiding players continues as it now, why would they want to continue playing the game rather than other games that are more geared toward them?  I very much doubt there are enough hardcore raiders playing EQ to keep the game going, from a financial standpoint,  if the majority of the population cancels thier accounts and leaves the game.  <br />
<br />
That this thread alone has had such popularity and such vehement posting proves there is an issue. Non raiding EQ players feel they are being locked out of content that thier money supports.  When they are done with the content they are allowed to see, what is going to keep them paying SoE?  Most likely those players will leave and all the hardcore raiding players can be satisfied that thier pristine hunting grounds have not been defiled by non raiders all the way until SoE decides running EQ is no longer profitable without all the non raiders paying for the game and shuts the game down.  <br />
<br />
In short, if non raiders don't get to see and play the game they are paying for, they will leave and EQ will be shutdown.  SoE is most definately here to make a profit and the small minority of elitist, hardcore raiders are not going to provide that.  <br />
<br />
Hardcore raiders should pe pushing for easing the access requirements of older zones they no longer use heavily.  This will keep the non raiders busy and satisfied and most importantly paying EQ.  If EQ is making profits, then EQ will continue to expand and hardcore raiders will be able to continue the lifestyle they enjoy.  Who loses in this situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And it's impossible for one to &quot;enjoy the game&quot; by levelling up in the content given to them?

<br />
Yes, we know this is your perception Mr. Uber Guild Made Warrior.  It's been acknowledged that you believe this to be true.  Yet, only a very small hand full of players who are actually of the &quot;non-raider&quot; variety seem to agree with you.  Strange that, isn't it?  That you should see things so clearly with your 10k+ HP and 2k+ AC while all the majority of players who actually have to try and acquire the things you perceive as so elementary to acquire don't seem to see it quite the same way.  Hard to believe really.<br />
<br />
And in response to BB, you sir are being an even bigger ass than you usually are in an attempt to make some kind of point that eludes me.  Well, enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1: Raex is a very  bad example of 'elemental gear' for comparison methods. It's well ahead of it's curve. There are minor upgrades to Raex in PoTime, and one or two specific items during the progression through GoD. The vast majority of warriors will still be wearing Raex pieces in Qvic/Inktuta/Txevu until they farm enough Vadd's. <br />
<br />
2: Raex is the WARRIOR only armor from Ele planes. LDoN armors are ALL PLATE. <br />
Warriors will need high HP and AC, clerics will need lots of mana and a casting focus, bards will need a song mod added, pal and SK will need something specific to them too. To have a single multiclass armor comparable to Raex for warriors, it'll be far superior to elemental for clerics and paladins for example. This could be somewhat acheived by augmenting differently, but there's a very real risk of an unbalanced stacked armor totally blowing it's elemental counterpart from the water.<br />
<br />
3: Put in something slightly better than the best tradeskilled armors when auged, but still slightly inferior to elemental class specifics. Add augments for these armors alone, with one line offering a class based focus: mana pres, shielding, atk etc. and make them class restricted:<br />
...stone of the warrior: Type9: shielding,  80hp, 30ac<br />
...stone of the paladin: Type9: stun resist, 50hp 50mana, 15ac<br />
...stone of the bard: type9: spellshield, 40hp 40mana 10ac<br />
...stone of the cleric: type9: dot resist, 40hp 80mana<br />
...stone of the sk: type9: strikethrough, 50hp 50mana 15ac<br />
...stone of the healer: type9: healing focus<br />
...stone of the arcane: type9: mana pres<br />
Numbers and effects are for illustration purposes only. You get the idea, don't get hung up on the specifics. Now people can tailor their gear.<br />
<br />
4: Add in a middle level LDoN and restructure rewards: normal=50, new=100, hard=175. With L70 coming out it may be that hard becomes the middle level and the a new harder level is added with increased points. Current hards are mostly useless for farming points unless they're trivial to you. There's just not enough points to justify the extra time and risk. If the new armor sets are targetted at say 10k points (current is 5k I believe) when fully auged, 'orc pawn farming' easies hour after hour becomes ineffective and people actually get rewarded for putting in more work.<br />
<br />
5: Dunno about the rest of you, but we (Txevu/Zun level guild) have replaced about a third of our raid base over the last 6 months. Very few competant/valuable players will be willing to leave any of the guilds close to our teir level, so we all have to pull new members from the wider 'non casual, non raid guild' pool. Having them in better gear can only be good news for us 'uber elite'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the majority of EQ players are not in the very high end of the game.<br />
On my server, 5 guilds are in or have been in PoTime. Another half dozen are working their way into the EP's. There's a VT rotation.<br />
<br />
Yesterday's uber hardcore raid mob is today's farm mob by low end guilds, PU raids, and high level groups.<br />
<br />
Do a who all 65 and you see dozens and dozens of guildtags. Guilds literally spring up overnight and move from nobodies to killing RZ in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
Do a /who all 48 56 and your screen will not fill up.<br />
<br />
On my server, it appears players are bunching up at level 65 and they are much more often than not in guilds - raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
The majority of content btw, is not in the very high end of the game. It's low/mid level content, and it's empty.<br />
<br />
Demorgoth,<br />
Having them in better gear can only be good news for us 'uber elite'<br />
True when you need to be focusing at cutting edge content you don't want to be farming up a large quantity of armor at the same time.<br />
<br />
But, we have a difference of opinion, and that's fine. But when someone applies to my guild, the last thing I want to see is a Warrior in Bazaar or LDoN purchased equipment. It's a heck of a lot easier to gear someone up than to deal with a player that doesn't &quot;raid&quot; properly because they didn't have players like Brom showing them the ropes three years ago in ToV. I'll deal with an undergeared raider every time. Shucks, I see a lot of LDoN, I don't really want to group with you much less raid with you.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You say 5 guilds are in or HAVE been in. How many are currently in?<br />
<br />
 But being charitable. Taking your figures, 11 different guilds at EP/Time raiding status. Say 100 different accounts in each one. 1100 toons on a server. We'll even be charitable and call each accounts a seperate individual. 43? 44? servers? Say max 48,000 seperate 'high end raiders' altogether in EQ. That's a lot.<br />
<br />
 Hell, that's almost 33% of the total subscription base. A CLEAR majority.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Partha, I think 3 are currently in PoTime and 2 post PoTime. That's a really good sign, that's how things should work, that's playing EQ.<br />
<br />
I'd put it at more like 8-10 guilds in the EP's or beyond. The significant figure IMO is 5 guilds having been in PoTime. Raiding is actually quite strong atm. I expect to see it continue. Level 70 should push some of the laggards through this content rather quickly.<br />
<br />
I expect to see 40-50 10K HP unbuffed Warriors on my server in 3 months. With level 70 in OoW, I think it could hit ~100-200.<br />
<br />
I optimisticly believe with level 70, perhaps 10 guilds on my server will be in or will have been in PoTime in 6 months.<br />
<br />
The truth is 4-6k HP unbuffed 65 Warriors are going to be a very rare thing indeed.<br />
<br />

<br />
BB<br />
<br />
hehe, I think we actually agree. The primary thing I look at on a potential invite is TIME COMMITMENT, alongside intelligence. We can equip them eventually once we settle into a farm mode (can't really do it while you're progressing through new content though), and provided they're smrt, they can learn our style of raiding and gain in skill. The one thing we can't effect however is their availability to raid.<br />
<br />
Problem is, especially for warriors, someone with 5khps, ineffective agro (against time+ raid dps) and double digit resists is gonna need a LOT of gearing up before they can tank even the most trivial of trash. They'll just be following us around, dying to AEs, for months. That's not good for them, nor is it good for us.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, I don't think this armor should be 'common' casual player fare. This is for the high playtime player who just doesn't happen to be in a big guild, through choice or whatever. It should be more attractive to get several pieces of Royal Attendant fully auged before starting on the first piece of this armor. But, once someone has drained LDoN of worthwhile upgrades, they do deserve a light on the horizon in terms of an upgrade path.<br />
<br />
The people who complain LDoN is boring and they can't be bothered to even get Royal Attendant won't/shouldn't see this armor. I'm not suggesting it  them. This is for the very real problem of the small amount of people who are 'past' LDoN but are unwilling/unable to make the jump to a raiding guild just to progress in terms of gear. Remove this subset of players with a valid gripe from the equation and most of the arguments will be shown for what they are - people who want something for nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Funny thing is, I don't agree. Raiding guilds have a certain quota of Warriors they're going to carry on the rosters. There will always be some who aren't in guilds but are still geared for guilds. However, even if we take your figures at face value, 50 to 60 10k+ geared tanks? Out of how many per server? It's a small figure, much smaller than it would appear if you're continuously playing at one level of the game.<br />
<br />
 Then also, there's still the crux of the matter: How many REALLY casual Warriors are there now at 7k? 6k? Below 6k? I suspect that even on your server, where Time+ is a-hoppin' (Brell, AFAIK, has two Time+GoD guilds, one solid Time guild, 3 or 4 knocking on the door EP guilds), the number of under 6k 65 Warriors is multiple times that of 'raid geared tanks', and will continue to be so as long as the upgrade path is stuck at Ornate/LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And why?  Because people who have quit the game, and never even went to the content say so?    I'm sorry, but I can get a pretty good feel as to what it takes, and I have a leg up on you... I have actually BEEN to the content, to EVERY SINGLE ZONE that's being referenced.   I know what Attack speed + max potential hit produces.   I've taken the logs, and analyzed them.   You on the other hand &quot;have heard it from someone&quot; after you left EQ, wouldn't even try the content and then complain about it.   <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, your credibility is about zilch on this issue.   You take a certain position and assume that it's correct because you can identify with the people taking it, you feel that the &quot;casual players&quot; have a legitimate complaint not because their complaints contain anything factual, but because their cause is in your eyes more honorable than if they were wrong.  That's called &quot;Plea to Sympathy&quot; and it's a complete fallacy.    <br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder:   Average DPS on me is... 95.22 (variety of non named mobs)<br />
KodTaz:  Average DPS on me is... 153.36<br />
LDoN Normal:  Average DPS on me is.... 41.03<br />
Ferubi:  Average DPS on me is 131.53<br />
Riwwi:  Average DPS on me is 88.71 (there are some variations because of Chaos Claws proc)<br />
Barindu:  Average DPS on me is 102.28 (also includes Chaos Claws proc)<br />
Uqua:  Average DPS on me is 337.71 (only Truslik zone trash)<br />
PoValor:  Average DPS on me is 84.04<br />
Qinimi:  Average DPS on me is 40.03<br />
PoJustice(Green Mile):  Average DPS on me is 43.89<br />
Pre-Revamp Veeshan's Peak:  Average DPS on me was 91.29<br />
Yxxta Primal Cave:  Average DPS on me is 230.84<br />
<br />
Now, this is the thing to remember, relative values will generally remain constant.   Generally speaking, the order goes like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Qimini<br />
LDoN normal<br />
Valor<br />
Riwwi<br />
BoT<br />
VP (pre-revamp, but it's still pretty darned easy post revamp)<br />
Barindu<br />
BoT upper towers<br />
Ferubi<br />
Earth<br />
Vxed<br />
Tipt<br />
KodTaz<br />
Yxxta<br />
Uqua<br />
<br />
Note:  I didn't put sewers in the lost since they vary so much, but they vary between an LDoN normal difficulty to just above BoT difficulty.<br />
<br />
What that means is that if you can handle BoT, then you can handle anything below it on the list.   Generally speaking, first floor BoT is a little too easy for most warriors.   A warrior who's in BoT could go to Barindu as an &quot;upgrade&quot; and flourish.   He could definitely do most sewers without much of an issue.   Ferubi/Tipt/Vxed may be a little harsh, but they should get what they need from the other zones first, then hit Ferubi/Tipt/Vxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only problem, Frod, once again, is that casuals stayed away from GoD in droves, and the folks who went aren't taking chances with 'undergeared' tanks, even if they're actually well geared enough for the content.<br />
<br />
 Perception in this case &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Those DPS numbers are misleading.  I'm guessing you included stuff that are casters.  Even a Bazaar warrior has a pretty good chance to tank a red Forgotten Martyr druid that does a melee round of 1400 X 4 every 2 minutes in between chain casting Engorging Roots.  There's no way a yellow+ melee mob in KT is only doing 150 DPS, even slowed.<br />
<br />
Gates is difficult because DPS varies so much.  It depends on mob type (Chaos Claw versus not), mob spells (haste or not), mob class type (caster or not), and so on.  On the average the damage you're taking might not be very high (Anueks, Ikaavs, and Trusiks are basically free kills) but the hasted warrior mobs you get once in a while is what kills you.  Take Yxtta, the Muramites mitigate slow significantly so they're much higher DPS compare to the stuff in caves.  Another good example is Ikaavs in Txevu suddenly go from Mage/Enchanter/Wizards NPCs to Warrior NPC that flurry which increase their DPS by about 10 times compare to Ikaavs in Qvic that may have similar max hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Partha, other than the flagging requirements, I see in a year PoTime being equivilant to NToV today. I could be wrong about how lazy people are. But I think if knocking off PoP progression flags is merely a matter of hitting them with 40-50 level 70 players in a pickup raid and saying &quot;Thanks for the flag.&quot;, players will make room in their busy LDoN farming schedules to do it - so long as LDoN equipment sucks by comparason.<br />
<br />
When players are level 70, do you really see getting into ToSoRo as a challange? RZ may not have a great drop rate on BoW's, but he's going to have a great dop rate so far as hitting the floor within 2 hours of becoming available henceforth.<br />
<br />
I prefer an inclusive Massively Muliplayer raiding game with the opprotunity to go off in a group and do something to unwind or work on someone's quest or if you truly hate to raid, a chance to putter about enjoying the atmosphere, killing a few mobs, and chatting with online friends.<br />
<br />
I think most of the ills EQ has experianced are because players are generally unwilling to grrrrrind out real progress and fail a bunch of times killing Cornav.<br />
<br />
Level 70 alone changes a lot of things.<br />

<br />
You know that's great Frodlin, here's a cookie.  You walked in with more HP and AC than I'll ever conceivably see and declare it as within my capabilities, if I'd just go out and do it.  Well and good, you're of course an expert on what it's like to be a 1350 AC 5200 HP unbuffed Warrior attempting to do GoD today.  How about we hear from someone with some credibility in that area.  Like some of the people on this board who don't actually break 8k HP fully buffed.  You know, the ones that in other threads are being told to get 7k or 8k unbuffed HP before even attempting GoD?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, your credibility is about zilch on this issue.<br />
<br />
And I'm sorry your credibility is about zilch on this issue as well, but for entirely different reasons.  If you're not willing to listen to someone who left the game soon after GoD came out, why on earth would &quot;non-raiders&quot; listen to you, the very definition of raider?  Like you know what it's like?  You've been in the trenches right along side them and sweated with them as they watched half their HP disappear in a single combat round and they prayed by that all that was holy that the Cleric please, please, please punch the spell button in time?  For a lot of these guys tanking in GoD is much like tanking a raid mob, but without the healer support.  Yet you're the expert on it, because you've marched through those zones with twice the capability they have in just gear alone, and have declared it easy!<br />
<br />
And I can already hear the responses, well then go back to LDoN and get some more gear!  Ha!  No thank you.   You didn't have to crank through LDoN to the degree a non-raider will.  You've had new content, new challenges, and new goals.  You claim that they're not handed to you on a silver platter, fine, I can see how you would see it that way, but the fact is raiders are handed content on a silver platter.  Who is expected to get all the flags for PoP and GoD?  Non-raiders?  Hell no.  Raiders are.  Why put the flags in then if non-raiders aren't expected to get them?  TO HAND EXCLUSIVE CONTENT, CHALLENGES, LOOT, AND OTHER REWARDS TO RAIDERS.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, they had to work for them, sure.  But they weren't put in the game with the idea that non-raiders would ever even conceivably overcome them.  They were specifcally designed so that they couldn't.  Obstacles were intentionally put in their way to keep them from it.  And then people like you want to look down on non-raiders and tell them they haven't worked hard enough!<br />
<br />
You know what Frodlin, keep your damn game.  Go ahead and keep pushing for the status quo.  I'd like to see EQ be better than it is.  I'd like to see the game actually return to being one where everyone can go out and enjoy new content.  But that isn't going to be possible with the raider player base kicking and screaming about it every step of the way.   So you can keep your status quo and those of us unwilling to accept the continual placing of obstacles in our way solely to give people like you the opportunity to stroke your egos about what hard working, dedicated, smart, savy, better than the average Joe player you are, simply because you've made a commitment to a certain play style that not everyone enjoys or can participate in, will just move on.<br />
<br />
I declare EverQuest to in fact be EverRaid, and those of us not willing or able to raid should just jump ship now.  Because you KNOW it isn't going to get any better, is it?  SoE is already back pedalling on some of the things said at the summit.  SoE is already trying to hock their next expansion as the &quot;fix&quot; to all our woes in EQ.  This, from the company that couldn't even stop people from being &quot;trapped&quot; in the terrain when they upgraded to DX9.  The same people who designed the boats in their new expansion so that they pathed right through the aggro radius of mobs and made ridding the boat suicide.  The very same people who released, and check this one out, an entire freaking expansion with the mob levels set too high because they &quot;forgot&quot; that they weren't including 5 new levels with the new expansion!  And not only that, it took them freaking months to admit it and actually fix it!   Yeah, these are the guys who are going to listen to their player base and actually make things better!  I can already see Brenlo tap dancing!  It's pretty clear what's going to happen, so take my advice and leave while you can.  Hanging around as a non-raider is just setting yourself up to be screwed blued and tattooed, AGAIN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Demorgoth,<br />
I agree with you. Morover I think that the new LDoN armor set should be of Top Luclin quality (that just fit between Raex and Ornate/EF/NRo/Farwater) when fully auged so it should use the class specific aug that you mention to flavor the armor to the job we will do with it.<br />
Doing so, it will decrease the necessary to augment the access of Ssraa/VT/Keal loot for the casual that want to progress and for the not ellit guild that want to enter EP and for the ellit guild that recruit.<br />
Thus it should not be done long after OoW release (it won't be done before because SoE is presenting OoW as a fix for all our pb).<br />
about the cost of LDoN armors, I think that aug that fit only in LDoN armor should be greatly reduce becase it cost so much that nobody want/have time to built a full set : all eight visible slots with their three aug each ~&gt; between 2.8kAP and 4kAP per slot, for a total of 27kAP and this is without auging the non visible slots and the weapons. so assuming only normal mission (we are weak without ornate quality armor, and the RvR/time_spent of hard is to small to be interesting) we get more than 512 LDoN mission!!!! just for the visible slot!!!<br />
so increasing armor cost by two (from 760 to 1520) and decreasing type 1/2/3 aug cost by three we end up with333 mission or 35% of reduction and can be done in three month (three mission per day every day :( boring but possible). more over it would make more sense, afterall augs don't double the power of the set so why should they quadruple the price. with the x2 / x0.3 price sytem the aug represent only a little bit more than the half of the price so it's closer to its power value.<br />
<br />
this price proposition is only for the current Malevolent set, but can be fitted to other set and to the unprobable better quality set we discuss at the beginning. but not that if they creat class specific aug of the power you sited, they can augment Malevonent quality sets to reach the Luclin quality gears, making so they could cost between 1.5k and 2kAP without pb.</div></div><hr />

You are right. Players are not going to risk doing  LDoN Difficult, BoT tower mini's, or GoD content with a 4 or 5K HP unbuffed Warrior.<br />
<br />
A progression path exists, IMO, from where you are to getting groups doing LDoN Difficults to BoT mini-named to doing GoD content.<br />
<br />
There are three question I think you should be asking yourself:<br />
<br />
1. Can I/Do I want to pursue this path?<br />
2. What do I do next?<br />
3. Provided I'm willing to try, will I be happy with where I arrive when I'm done (assuming &quot;Done&quot; exists a month from now - EQ, the Eternal Carrot)?<br />

The path is pretty much crap BB, and I think you pretty much know it.  You get your major satisfaction from raiding and toodle around getting gear for your various alts as something to pass the time.  But I doubt very much indeed that if you could not raid that you'd stay with the game all that long.<br />
<br />
They could do things to improve the path, but they won't.  They won't because raiders scream and shout about it.  They won't because it might entail them actually going back and fixing some of the crap they've released over the last several expansions.  And they won't because it doesn't sell future expansions.<br />
<br />
EQ's days are numbered.  Doubt me if you will, but I can see the writing on the wall.  Barring some unforseen changes, it's basically down hill from here.</div></div><hr />

No one ever said that.<br />
<br />
We simply want a clear and viable upgrade path so that we can perform a function in GoD single group encounters and in the new Oow.<br />
<br />
Clerics, enchanters, shamen, wizards, bst, etc are not governed as harsh by there gear as warriors.  They can easily get FT15 and 6k mana pools and 5k+ hitpoints EASILY and all of their focus effects.  Focus items and LDON gear for these classes is top notch, a warriors pales in comparison being its the SAME armor.<br />
<br />
I don't want your armor, I don't need it for my travels.  But I do need an upgrade path that is clear and viable for me to move past LDoN and into GoD and Oow, they are after all, single group expiditions that clerics, shamen, enchanters, and wizards can do with LDoN and bazaar bought armor/focus items/tribute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you get rewards now for guild management rather than killing things, damn this game has gone down a shitty path.<br />
<br />
GD<br />
<br />
And I have run far bigger raids (250 people on 10 simultaneous targets while defending 2 major chokepoints at the same time) than EQ (DAOC) can handle so I know what it takes to run a guild/raid. I just dont think it should be a pre-req to get equipment and btw a casual guild in many cases has the same issues just at a lower target level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">hehe, I think we actually agree. The primary thing I look at on a potential invite is TIME COMMITMENT, alongside intelligence. We can equip them eventually once we settle into a farm mode (can't really do it while you're progressing through new content though), and provided they're smrt, they can learn our style of raiding and gain in skill. The one thing we can't effect however is their availability to raid.<br />
<br />
Problem is, especially for warriors, someone with 5khps, ineffective agro (against time+ raid dps) and double digit resists is gonna need a LOT of gearing up before they can tank even the most trivial of trash. They'll just be following us around, dying to AEs, for months. That's not good for them, nor is it good for us.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, I don't think this armor should be 'common' casual player fare. This is for the high playtime player who just doesn't happen to be in a big guild, through choice or whatever. It should be more attractive to get several pieces of Royal Attendant fully auged before starting on the first piece of this armor. But, once someone has drained LDoN of worthwhile upgrades, they do deserve a light on the horizon in terms of an upgrade path.<br />
<br />
The people who complain LDoN is boring and they can't be bothered to even get Royal Attendant won't/shouldn't see this armor. I'm not suggesting it  them. This is for the very real problem of the small amount of people who are 'past' LDoN but are unwilling/unable to make the jump to a raiding guild just to progress in terms of gear. Remove this subset of players with a valid gripe from the equation and most of the arguments will be shown for what they are - people who want something for nothing.<br />

Difficult is contextual BB that is what u just cant seem to get. We are not saying that thing shouldnt be difficult but we choose to define difficult differently. We dont define it as us and our 71 closest friends beating on a mob that can whack 10 people in 30 secs without thinking twice. We choose to define it (and if we could agree on this exactly we would have a stronger argument) in the context of both a 6 man grp and a longer period of time (at least per piece) than relative to a raider. We also choose to define it in the context of harder than LDoN 6 man but perhaps slightly easier (but likely longer) than GoD Trials for example.<br />

I think the gear that is currently on the merchants is fair for the effort that it takes to do countless easy ldons.

<br />
What I will do is list the things I can and can't do and the conditions required for those things to happen. My magelo is current. <br />
<br />
I can tank hard LDoNs, but only with people I know have a clue and I play with regularly. Most pickup groups either won't take the risk with me as tank because I don't have &quot;enough AAs / hps / AC&quot; or because they prefer the &quot;easy win&quot; over a challenge. <br />
<br />
I duo Qinimi with my wife's shaman. We can kill the named ukun but so far the other nameds we've spawned have beaten us. Qinimi isn't really a challenge for a full group, if you can find enough people willing to go. (This doesn't include single group BiC events, which are a different animal entirely.)<br />
<br />
I've attempted the first sewer trial ( 65 warrior, 65 shaman, 65 shaman, 65 druid, 65 beastlord, 65 ranger ) and got spanked horribly by a named turtle although the others managed to root/rot the named for the kill and an augment he dropped. The weak link here was me and I'm convinced AAs, not gear, will be the deciding factor next time I can get my group of competent friends together to try it. <br />
<br />
I'm in a micro-guild. We can't do PoP flag raids internally which means I'm stuck with our open raid organization. During my standard playtime, in the last 6 months there has been one raid I could attend that would net me a progression flag and that was to a zone that I'd already gained access to through an alternate flag quest. (This is where some asshat normally tells me I need to rearrange my life to get the flags or stfu. I've heard it before, restrain yourself now please).<br />
<br />
I'm willing to put in the work to progress. I think I could put together a group and survive in Elementals. But I won't change my life to accomodate raids. If asking for options for progression that require hard work but don't require raiding is whining then I have nothing left to offer to the discussion. Locking significant progression behind raids only is a poor design decision. Designing raids around larger and larger time commitments is a poor design decision and is self-defeating in the long term because time, even for hardcore raiders, is finite. <br />
<br />
Once a non-raider milks LDoN for everything they can, once they get to Vxed, once  they max out their AAs then what is left? If your only answer is &quot;join a raiding guild&quot; then you've missed the clue train. Non-raiders will reach that point at varying paces but to pretend that the wall isn't there for them to slam their foreheads against is dishonest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Before I respond, I think it needs to be made clear that I am not advocating and have never advocated that non-raiders should receive the same rewards as the current expansion raiders have available to them.  So your question is skewed incorrectly from the beginning.  I have asked for an upgrade from the current LDoN armor, available through hard missions only, in order for those non-raiders not on the current raiding progression path through arbitrarily locked PoP zones to be able to progress to future expansions that require, in my experience having actually grouped and raided in those zones, EP-level armor)<br />

Why should you receive those rewards for killing big mobs with big raids?   I'm sure you can come up with several reasons to justify your one-track progression model.<br />
<br />
I can come up with several reasons to justify my alternative progression model.<br />
<br />
Our disagreement does not lie with the REASONS, those are subjective, our disagreement is far more simple.  You believe that there is one and only one way to progress in this game, to get to the top of the tree and snatch up the brightest red apple.   You believe this is the only way and the best way because it is the way that you have traveled.  You probably believe this is the only way and best way because historically, starting from when the original EQ developers left the company, it was the way Sony chose to develop their progression system.  This system benefits you and it rewards the many raiders who have re-arranged their lifestyle in order to accomodate a certain playstyle.  It justifies to the raiders the sacrifices they have made. <br />
<br />
But there is nothing inherently better in your one-track progression system.  So you feel the mobs you have beaten are difficult.  No shit.  You beat them with 54-72 other people.  The difficulty was spread around quite conveniently.  The encounters I face are equally difficult...for my six-man team.   We just don't spread it around quite as much. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I am incredibly disheartened to see this myopic viewpoint from our class correspondent.  I honestly feel that you cannot possibly represent the non-raiding playerbase with Sony.  Accordingly, I don't feel the overall model of the game will evolve, mostly because Sony may feel the need to continue to pander to those members who somehow have a sense of entitlement because they require more &quot;difficulty&quot; using the numbers of players they throw at events.   Don't get me wrong.  I don't feel the current one-way progression system is the fault of the raiders.  I feel it is the fault of Sony and I feel they went down this path when they lost their vision.  I look forward to what may be created in Vangaurd, which is where the vision landed.  For right now, Sony's model is spiraling out of control.  And it has birthed the viewpoint quoted above and I think that is a sad statement of the game.  I think it has spawned the many &quot;casual versus raider&quot; or &quot;hard core non raider verus hard core raider&quot; arguments seen throughout all class message boards.  The classist and elitist nature of the game is growing, the power differential is expanding with each expansion (nyuk nyuk), and if I were to have my druthers it would be that my class correspondent might see the trouble approaching.  But he has his own agenda, being a raider, and I fear that may not be the case.</div></div><hr />

I don't want  to seem impolite but I didn't post to get advice on what to do next, where to focus my playtime or anything like that. Every warrior here who has less than 200 AAs could benefit from 200 more than they currently have. In my opinion it'll take me less than 50 AAs to get my survivability to a point where i'm not a hindrance.<br />
<br />
My point in posting at all was to provide a reference point  for raiders and non-raiders alike as to what a non-raider can and can't do at the ~5200 hps /1350 AC mark (unbuffed). I'm currently doing what raiders say I should be doing to progress and I'm here to tell you that there is a point where I won't be able to progress past without raiding. I'm not there yet but I'm also more casual than a lot of dedicated non-raiders.<br />
<br />
Am I a good example? I don't know, nor do I care. I quit holding myself to anyone's standard but my own. I will do what it takes, in the time I have to play, to be the best warrior I can.

Agreed but that would mean OMG new content.

Whatever do you mean  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
All i'm saying is if you expect to survive as a 5-6k tank in GoD hard zones like Trials 5-6-Sewers etc., survivability is highly dependant on if you did those aa's, ND3- CA5-LR5-CS5-ID5-Sturdi5-Physical Enhancement- Ripostes help too.  Not having them suggests you dont really put enough emphasis on your character enough to WANT to take those challenges on at your best, you cant expect to take the best without trying to be better yourself - sometimes grinding has to be done, otherwise just sit on the sideline for a bit while you catch yourself up to speed so you CAN take those encounters. Thats my point.</div></div><hr />

As I recall Gunnar, you are beyond LDON content so your opinion really doesn't matter.  It's not your content anymore.  Go farm Time again for the gabalzillion time and let loot rot and say what your doing is risky and rewarding.<br />

<br />
Now you're making assumptions of my attitude based on my AA choices?<br />
<br />
In the EQ I play advancement comes in small steps. The AA path you suggest is optimal for a raiding warrior who MTs all the time. That AA path isn't the optimal path for this non-raiding warrior though. <br />
<br />
After long searches of Alla's and Lucy I determined I wasn't going to get max sta through upgrades for a very long time. Which is why I got innate sta and advance innate sta. More hps is better than less, right?<br />
<br />
I got one rank of ingenuity for the eyecandy. Sue me.<br />
<br />
I got a rank of BW and innate regen 3 in a misguided attempt at boosting my solo recovery times just a smidge. I don't regret the AAs spent, i regret wasting time trying to solo.<br />
<br />
When i first started working Archetypes i went with 1 rank each of CA, CS, ND, CF, FB and NH. I reasoned that small all around improvements would be better for my regular exp situation than focusing exclusively on CA or ND or CS. I have single ranks in Ferocity and Punishing Blade for the same reason. Any increase in my dps, even a small one, that doesn't require raiding or camping a no drop weapon for 18 hours is a good one in my opinion.<br />
<br />
So now I've reached a point where I have to go back and fill in some Archetypes. If I didn't care about being my best I'd just get 3 ranks of fear resistance or packrat or something equally useless. Its not about being so good before I ever attempt something that success is guaranteed. Its about pushing myself as hard as I can to identify the weaknesses and then address those weaknesses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is one of the first of the raiders on these threads (Brutul and one other did as well) to acknowledge that some kind of alternative progression should be available.  We both seem to agree that if my small group of friends can hack the EP content we should be given the chance to test our metal against it.  <br />
<br />
We disagree on the ways in which that concept should be implimented.  I feel the EP should be opened up entirely or made availble through an arduous VT-style quest (a la Tactics, BoT, Torment).  Should the current arbitrary barrier - RZ - stand in the way, I then suggest we be given an upgraded and &quot;class&quot;ified LDoN set. <br />
<br />
Gunnar believes LDoN is useless.  I think several casuals and nonraiders who spend their time in these dungeons daily would beg to differ, but so be it.  Accordingly, Gunnar would make EP content available through instancing or new LDoN-type dungeons.  I don't have a problem with either concept, but I also believe it is far too theoretical.  Sony will not spend time implimenting a new expansion to make EP content available via instanced or LDoN-type dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Also, I think we can both agree that the chances of each post in a 20 page thread staying on topic is not lilkey.  With that being said, I would like to extend my sincere apologies for misunderstanding the true meaning of your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Our disagreement does not lie with the REASONS, those are subjective, our disagreement is far more simple. You believe that there is one and only one way to progress in this game, to get to the top of the tree and snatch up the brightest red apple. You believe this is the only way and the best way because it is the way that you have traveled. You probably believe this is the only way and best way because historically, starting from when the original EQ developers left the company, it was the way Sony chose to develop their progression system. This system benefits you and it rewards the many raiders who have re-arranged their lifestyle in order to accomodate a certain playstyle.<br />
<br />
Get my position right before you lambaste it.  My position is completely different from what you portray and it's getting a little tiring to see it misidentified out of prejudice.<br />
<br />
My position is this:<br />
<br />
There ARE upgrade paths that put you EXACTLY where you should be in terms of progression in EQ RIGHT NOW.   These paths exist, and are attaniable by anyone who chooses to do so, and they put at ABOVE elemental level gear with a maximum of 2 groups.<br />
<br />
This is good and this is exactly what you claim you want.   <br />
<br />
I'm opposed on the other hand to, and sit down for this, because it's VERY important that you pick up on this subtlety.<br />
<br />
To get scaling rewards from non scaling encounters.    You should &quot;tap out&quot; on the quality of gear that's available for killing a certain encounter type.  This is how EQ has been designed since DAY ONE, and it's the REASON it's the most successful MMORPG in history.   If you never left the gates of West Freeport and continued gaining experience points and got linear gear increases by killing the same mobs, regardless of how easy they got, this game would've failed in the first 30 days.<br />
<br />
You gain your gear, then use it to gain more, but the thing is you need to use it in more difficult encounters than you previously did, otherwise it gets boring and rote.   Permafrost gear isn't very good at level 65, and there's a reason for it.  Permafrost is too easy at level 65 to justify it.    In other words, you get rewarded based on the difficulty of the encounters you face.<br />
<br />
This is why killing the same mob 15,000 times in a row should NEVER EVER EVER give the types of upgrades that you're asking for.   Hell, right now, the boots found in a Hard LDoN are a little better than Tormax boots, and this is GREAT.    It's appropriate to the level of encounter you face, and the fact that the game progresses along.   Ferubi gear is better than raid gear up to and including anything pre-elementals, with the exception of some VT pieces.     Vxed/Tipt drop elemental quality gear, and KodTaz/Ikkinz/Yxxta has gear that is the equivalent of time gear, period, all attainable with a single group or 2 groups.   <br />
<br />
I had to leave Sol B to get Cobalt and go to Karnor's, then Sebilis.   You should tap out on LDoN and move on to GoD, that's called progression.   Thats what I want.   I dont' want to make you raid or suffer with subpar gear if you don't, I simply want you to recognize and sieze the opportunities that are available to you BEFORE bitching about them.<br />
<br />
I happen to LIKE this model, new expansion gear should ALWAYS exceed old expansion gear, AND the Luclin model of named being 10x harder than anything else in the zone was stupid, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't require progressively harder encounters to attain progressively harder gear, it ABSOLUTELY should for the health of the game.<br />
<br />
Read VERY carefully, this has NOTHING to do with raiding or not raiding.    Clearly, raiding SHOULD produce better gear, because it's inherently logical that mobs that require 50 people to kill should have gear that represents that, but my point is and ALWAYS has been that there SHOULD be more acquirable single group loot.  The thing is, THERE IS NOW, but people are so fatalistic that they'll find reason after reason after reason that they can't or won't do it.  The arguments remind me VERY much of arguments about why Cobalt pieces were &quot;impossible&quot; to get, even though they weren't.<br />
<br />
I happen to ALSO agree, and have said so on multitudes of occasions that PoP sucked ass in the first tiers in terms of itemization and it hurt people who werent' going to take the path of progression, and that Sony made a HUGE mistake in not putting in single group nameds in PoP in the lower tiers.<br />
<br />
The thing is, we're no longer in PoP, we're past that point.<br />
<br />
<br />
But there is nothing inherently better in your one-track progression system. So you feel the mobs you have beaten are difficult. No shit. You beat them with 54-72 other people. The difficulty was spread around quite conveniently. The encounters I face are equally difficult...for my six-man team. We just don't spread it around quite as much. <br />
<br />
Not really.   I've seen that argument before and it's not really accurate.   It's a completely different thing to manage and compensate for CH rotations, Mass offtanking/Mezzing, DI replenishment, Aggro management on mobs that WILL, not &quot;have an outside chance&quot; but WILL one round anyone who pisses them off enough, mobs that if they leave a certain position will wipe an entire raid without forgivenss, managing of AE MGB's, all dealing with connectivity issues of 50ish people, having multiple mobs engaging a raid and if one person dies, a chain reaction begins that will completely wipe a raid, rampage management, etc.  <br />
<br />
There isn't any longer Vindicator/AoW style fights where everyone beats on one mob until he's dead.  That died the day that PoP was released.   <br />
<br />
There are very few encounters in EQ that come even remotely close.   Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru, Diabolical Destroyer, Malevolent Priests, Yunjo Coliseum Event and Tri Fates all do, and earlier the PoJ trials did, and hell, some of the LoY encounters do.   Those are as close to &quot;6 man raids&quot; as I've ever seen.    Nothing else comes even remotely close.<br />
<br />
Some LDoN mission, or killing some named don't provide the kind of challenge level that most raid encounters do.  I'm sorry, they simply don't.   EXCEPT IN GATES OF DISCORD.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I am incredibly disheartened to see this myopic viewpoint from our class correspondent. I honestly feel that you cannot possibly represent the non-raiding playerbase with Sony.<br />
<br />
Yeah, now, let's deal with this one for a minute, because that cheap shot won't go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
First:   There are not one but TWO threads that *I* specifically started that are NOT debate threads that are simply for the collection and presentation of data SPECIFICALLY on behalf of casual warriors, one on TSW and one on SOE boards.    No other class correspondent in EQ has done this insofar as separating and collecting issues at different levels of the game.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I don't filter things, even when I don't agree with them.   Imagine that.   As a matter of fact, here, let me quote for you from a thread which I wrote yesterday.<br />
<br />
I think the point is that some warriors think it's important, and while you may or may not, enough do that it made it onto the list.  It may surprise you to know but I don't necessarily agree with the entire list, but the point of the list isn't what you or I deem &quot;most important&quot;, but what the class as a whole feels is important.   My function in this position is to wade through what everyone says and present the &quot;voice&quot; of warriors to the team, I'm your voice, not your brain.<br />
 <br />
On other topics, I'll give input and opinion, but when it comes down to reporting, there's a line that won't be crossed, and that line is that I speak on behalf of you guys, not in place of you guys.<br />
 <br />
Enough warriors felt that endurance regen was important (both here and on TSW and in channels) enough that it was appropriate to put it in there.   <br />
<br />
Just because I HAVE an opinion doesn't mean I force that on ANYONE, and I am patently offended that you'd stoop to that level.  No one on ANY forum will stop me from having OR expressing an opinion on ANYTHING, but to claim that I'm &quot;biased&quot; in reporting things when the evidence is COMPLETELY contrary is nothing but a cheap shot and I for one won't tolerate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Accordingly, I don't feel the overall model of the game will evolve, mostly because Sony may feel the need to continue to pander to those members who somehow have a sense of entitlement because they require more &quot;difficulty&quot; using the numbers of players they throw at events. Don't get me wrong. I don't feel the current one-way progression system is the fault of the raiders. I feel it is the fault of Sony and I feel they went down this path when they lost their vision. I look forward to what may be created in Vangaurd, which is where the vision landed. For right now, Sony's model is spiraling out of control. And it has birthed the viewpoint quoted above and I think that is a sad statement of the game. I think it has spawned the many &quot;casual versus raider&quot; or &quot;hard core non raider verus hard core raider&quot; arguments seen throughout all class message boards. <br />
<br />
What i find most amusing behind this is that this IS what &quot;the vision&quot; is.  &quot;The Vision&quot; which has been nicely hashed over on the Vanguard forums by Brad himself is PRECISELY what my position is.  Here, let me quote Brad himself.<br />
<br />
At the risk of jumping head first into the controversy, my feelings go back to the concept of risk vs. reward. <br />
<br />
If you fight for hours and hours into the depths of a dungeon, knowing that if you screw up it's a lot of time lost, I'd argue the risk is greater, and so should be the reward. <br />
<br />
So I think these varying types of encounters and contiguous time commitments do have an impact on risk/reward and that the lewts should be adjusted accordingly. <br />
<br />
I think we are very committed to providing different regions of content for different playstyles and time commitments. But I don't think we'd agree to an assertion the rewards should be roughly the same<br />
<br />
<br />
And there we have it, the OFFICIAL Vanguard position, which just about MIMICS to a &quot;t&quot; my position.<br />
<br />
<br />
The classist and elitist nature of the game is growing, the power differential is expanding with each expansion (nyuk nyuk), and if I were to have my druthers it would be that my class correspondent might see the trouble approaching. But he has his own agenda, being a raider, and I fear that may not be the case<br />
<br />
No, it isn't.   LDoN 6-man attainable gear was an upgrade to PoP 6 man attainable gear for most slots.     GoD 6 man attainable gear is an upgrade to LDoN gear for most slots.   As a matter of fact as I was typing this message, a 17AC 140hp mask just dropped in Kod Taz.... off of a random blue con trash mob.  Guess what!   That mask is an UPGRADE to my mask, which came from Tallon Zek in Tactics.</div></div><hr />

And he has to be content for the indefinite future with playing on the fringes of GoD. But of course his first hand experiences and personal perceptions of the content aren't going to be considered valid, because people like Frodlin have declared that &quot;non-raiders&quot; aren't succeeding at GoD content because they aren't willing to work hard enough at it.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, Mukaz is EXACTLY the type of player I've been referring to as what people should do, he sees the opportunities and tries to sieze upon them.  He doesn't let retired board whiners determine his play, he goes and tries.    If he doesn't succeed, he determines what will make him succeed and makes attaining it his goal.<br />
<br />
Sewers aren't the &quot;fringe of GoD&quot;, they're great.   Natimbi is the only &quot;fringe&quot; of GoD, Qinimi is great, and Mukaz at his level... DUOS THERE.     If he can beat the named dog, then he can beat the named Anueks in that zone, the only one he can't beat with one group is the named Noc, which *I* cannot beat with one group, that noc is sheer badassery.    First time I tried him he hosed 2 groups in 15 seconds.   <br />
<br />
He'd do fine in Riwwi as well, which is hardly fringe.<br />
<br />
Some mobs in zones are above the level of those exping on those zones.  Anyone remember Sand Giants and Spectres?   Hell, Fire Giants?  Nagafen?   Trakanon?  Juggs?   Venril Sathir?   Well, these aren't any different from GoD.  There's some beasts that are mobs that will destroy people who try them.   That noc in Qinimi, Taskmistress Krisz in Riwwi, Zun Muram Votal in Ferubi, Packmaster in Ferubi, Weaponsmith in Ferubi.  Cragbeast Queen in Natimbi.   <br />
<br />
He's not realistically ready for  Ferubi, or Vxed/Tipt yet, but he will be if he continues in the path that he's going.   The point is, he's trying the content and learning his limits and his needs, and going after them.<br />

Glatius, I think your question is a valid one.<br />
<br />
I think it was valid when POP came out too.  Most non-raiding people at the time were AAXPing in Sebilis, Chardok and Cazic Thule.  Most of them had been avoiding the latest expansion (Luclin) for a whole year.  It is a very fair question, why did those people buy POP?<br />
<br />
Obviously the enticements of more levels, new AA's, a few better XP zones, and new spells were enough to make them buy POP, even though they had hardly touched the content of Luclin.<br />
<br />
I think you will find the same motivators in OOW.<br />
<br />
We all know that GoD contained a lot of questionable ideas and unfinished content, just like Luclin.  The followup expansion can rectify most of that.  POP revitalized the game, and OOW might do the same.</div></div><hr />

Your model does not mesh with reality in two important aspects.<br />
<br />
First, new expansion gear does NOT exceed old expansion gear.  GoD non-raider accessible gear simply is not superior to Royal Attendants in LDoN.  GoD non-raider gear is also not better than PoP pre-Time elemental gear.<br />
<br />
Second, PoP does not always require progressively harder encounters to obtain progressively better gear.  Pyronis is not progressively harder from RZ.  Yet in order to access this mob and many others like him I must first beat RZ with a large-scale raid force.  That refutes your entire progression model. <br />
<br />
Your upgrade paths in effect go against the very model that you advocate supporting.  You do not want nonraiders to acquire gear in PoP in order to acquire gear in LDoN in order to acquire gear in GoD in order to acquire gear in OoW.  You want nonraiders to acquire gear in GoD and LDoN in order to avoid the necessity of acquiring gear in PoP because the PoP gear is simply unavailable for a large segment of the gaming population. What you suggest is that I skip an entire expansion in order to &quot;progress.&quot;  How exactly does that fit with your model?  With every other expansion in Everquest, the raiders and the nonraiders alike would tackle the content, acquire the gear, and then use the gear earned from that expansion to tackle the next expansion.  The rate at which the raiders versus the nonraiders accomplished this task was different, but the progression was the same. <br />
<br />
My point in this thread is that PoP did away with that model entirely.  Rather than allowing us to use the gear acquired from the previous expansions to go after content in PoP, at our difffering paths, Sony placed a barrier in the center of PoP.  It required, arbitrarily, that players kill a large raid mob in order to access single-group and small-raid content.  Now, then, an entire armor set is no longer available and the REASON it is unavailable has nothing to do with my ability to actually kill the mob that is holding it.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly, raiding SHOULD produce better gear, because it's inherently logical that mobs that require 50 people to kill should have gear that represents that, <br />
<br />
<br />
No, I don't feel that is &quot;inherently logical.&quot;  It is logical to you because that is how you function.  To me, it looks like the difficulty is spread out amonst 50 people instead of six so it is inherently logical that the encounter should be more difficult.  But it does NOT follow that the gear must be better.  I am not going to argue that you shouldn't obtain better items from Qvic than I would from Tipt, but I do not think it is &quot;inherently logical&quot; just because you take in 50 people with you to beat Qvic. <br />
<br />
<br />
I happen to ALSO agree, and have said so on multitudes of occasions that PoP sucked ass in the first tiers in terms of itemization and it hurt people who werent' going to take the path of progression, and that Sony made a HUGE mistake in not putting in single group nameds in PoP in the lower tiers.<br />
<br />
The thing is, we're no longer in PoP, we're past that point.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, YOU are past that point.  Many non raiders and casuals are still in PoP.  In fact, they are still in Velious and Luclin.  Last week, my guild of friends killed Cazic Thule in Fear for the first time.<br />
<br />
PoP was a progression expansion, just like Kunark or Velious or Luclin.  Non raiders should be able to eventually glean from PoP much of the gear as they have done in prior expansions.  It may take them a little longer but it should be available to them.  According to your own model of progression that is how the game ought to function.   But it doesn't and we cannot progress this way.  It is for this reason, and this reason alone, that I suggest we make better LDoN armor available for hard mission DKP.  If you feel the current LDoNs are not challenging enough, then add different sorts of hard missions that have a boss mob at the end, create a challenging trial the likes of Tipt or Vxed.  But make the gear available. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, now, let's deal with this one for a minute, because that cheap shot won't go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
First:   There are not one but TWO threads that *I* specifically started that are NOT debate threads that are simply for the collection and presentation of data SPECIFICALLY on behalf of casual warriors, one on TSW and one on SOE boards.    No other class correspondent in EQ has done this insofar as separating and collecting issues at different levels of the game.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I don't filter things, even when I don't agree with them.   Imagine that.   As a matter of fact, here, let me quote for you from a thread which I wrote yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
For my advocate, I'd prefer if they were passionately dedicated to my cause.  You aren't.  That said, I apologize for suggesting you cannot represent the non raiders.  I think you are trying to do that, and I think your casual threads are a step in the right direction.   But don't ever come back here talking of trees, apples, and wounded dogs.  If you want to support my playstyle, then try to project an attitude of actually doing that.  Don't condescend and don't insult.  I think it is just as equally a &quot;cheap shot.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
What i find most amusing behind this is that this IS what &quot;the vision&quot; is.  &quot;The Vision&quot; which has been nicely hashed over on the Vanguard forums by Brad himself is PRECISELY what my position is.  Here, let me quote Brad himself.<br />
<br />
At the risk of jumping head first into the controversy, my feelings go back to the concept of risk vs. reward. <br />
<br />
If you fight for hours and hours into the depths of a dungeon, knowing that if you screw up it's a lot of time lost, I'd argue the risk is greater, and so should be the reward. <br />
<br />
So I think these varying types of encounters and contiguous time commitments do have an impact on risk/reward and that the lewts should be adjusted accordingly. <br />
<br />
I think we are very committed to providing different regions of content for different playstyles and time commitments. But I don't think we'd agree to an assertion the rewards should be roughly the same <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with this!  Why are you so blind on this point?  Why do you absolutely refuse to read the now hundreds of posts by non raiders saying exactly this.  <br />
<br />
Our argument is that the PoP arbitrary barriers broke the risk/reward system.  You demanding that we acquire less-appealing alternate gear from GoD and Gates than I believe I can acquire with my small groups of nonraiders in Fire, Earth, Air and Fire IS NOT IN LINE WITH THIS PHILOSPHY.  <br />
<br />
You admit PoP was fucked up.  Yet instead of coming up with a way to fix it, you suggest we skip it and go acquire smaller (for the most part) rewards.  To be clear, despite your insistence to the contrary, GoD six-manable gear is not an upgrade to most 8 primary armor slots.</div></div><hr />

Because you have 10khp/2kAC, that makes you wrong in everything you say regarding casual players, even though the EPITOME of a badass non-raiding hardcore player who's got a LOT of room for growth in gear, but the BALLS to try the content regardless of what others tell him has said &quot;I do GoD content, and it'll take X so i can succeed next time&quot;.

<br />
Need/Want:<br />
<br />
Raiding warriors need elemental+ gear. Casual gamers do not.<br />
<br />
With full LDoN + augments, a warrior can easily get to mid 7k hp. With that they can progress up to Kod Taz. They don't need elemental+ gear, they just want it. That's the end of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Your model does not mesh with reality in two important aspects.<br />
<br />
First, new expansion gear does NOT exceed old expansion gear.  GoD non-raider accessible gear simply is not superior to Royal Attendants in LDoN.  GoD non-raider gear is also not better than PoP pre-Time elemental gear.<br />
<br />
Bullshit:<br />
<br />
Bracer of the Heartstriker is superior to ELEMENTAL bracers in some aspects.   Crafted Wristband of Strife is as well.   I want you to read something here that I wrote... pay particular attention to the bolded parts before pulling this shit again:<br />
<br />
No, it isn't. LDoN 6-man attainable gear was an upgrade to PoP 6 man attainable gear for most slots. GoD 6 man attainable gear is an upgrade to LDoN gear for most slots. <br />
<br />
You'll notice I didn't say &quot;for all slots&quot;.     I am still wearing a Luclin earring, and I'm post-time.    A FIVE expansion old earring.   To gain upgrades, you DONT NEED TO COMPLETELY UPGRADE EVERY SINGLE SLOT.    Furthermore, the augments from GoD make LDoN armor BETTER than LDoN augments do.   Oh I'm sorry, you are ONLY happy if you completely replace every single piece of gear, upgrading isn't enough.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there is not a single piece of single group elemental gear that's not VASTLY exceeded in GoD single group content with one exception, and that's the pet weapon.   The ONLY pieces of gear that are not exceded in GoD attainable by a single group are visible pieces of armor.   EVERY SINGLE OTHER PIECE that drops in the elemental planes is exceeded in GoD in single group, or MAXIMUM 2 group content.   <br />
<br />
Earrings, Rings, Masks, Shoulders, Necks, Belts, range items... EVRY ONE of them can be attained in GoD with 1-2 groups that make their Elemental equivalents that take raids look bad.<br />
<br />
A Glyphed Prayer Ring and Dauntless Muramite Ring (or Glowing Bone Ring) are SUPERIOR to an Elemental ring set of Moss Band and Band of Swirling Air.<br />
<br />
A Resonating Earring of Battle is superior to the Clawed Earthcrafter hoop.<br />
<br />
Gaunt Veil of Purification is greater than any mask found in the E-Planes, and many in Time so is the Incantator mask of death.<br />
<br />
Fleshbound Shroud of Aggression is greater than ALL elemental and MOST time shoulders.<br />
<br />
Resonating Anuek Collar is greater than ALL Elemental necks, although it's not greater than the overpowered talisman of AHR, except that it's augable.<br />
<br />
Carved Vrex Totem is greater than Stonewood Bow (the default Elemental level Range item), althoug granted, the bow allows for shooting.<br />
<br />
The point is, you're wrong, GoD single group attainable gear EXCEEDS elemental raid attainable gear with the exception being weaponry and visible armor.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of the post was basically something that can be summarized in a sentence:<br />
<br />
PoP sucks for non raiders:<br />
<br />
I agree, it does... get out while you still can.  I've been complaining about this for god knows how long, and they even said they were going to fix that, but it hasn't happenned.   Accept the reality that PoP is 3 expansions old and isn't going to get fixed, and move on.   That doesn't justify scaling rewards for repetitive non scaling content though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, once again, nice asshole condescending response.  Nice &quot;cheap shot.&quot;  You wonder why I think you are unable to represent me?  Because you throw in shit like this.  <br />
<br />
Of course I don't think I NEED TO COMPLETELY UPGRADE EVERY SINGLE SLOT.  (Your constant use of caps lock only detracts from your post.)  I was stating very clearly in my post that you entire progression framework that you advocate and that you say Vangaurd advocates is turned on its head with respect to PoP &gt; LDoN &gt; Gates content.  That was my point. <br />
<br />
The reason I made that point was that your entire reply proposed that we focus on the progression model and not on the gear.  Fine, so I did.  And in response you shoved in my face that I need to replace every single peice of gear.  <br />
<br />
We aren't communicating here.  I talk about gear and you poke fun at me because I'm ignoring the overarching progression model.  I address the problems with the progression model and you snidely bring it back to gear.  That is just poor form, Frodlinl.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point is, you're wrong, GoD single group attainable gear EXCEEDS elemental raid attainable gear with the exception being weaponry and visible armor.  <br />
<br />
<br />
We have twenty upgradeable armor slots - ten of which are visible armor and weaponry.  You just suggested that GoD gear &quot;EXCEEDS&quot; elemental gear ... with exception of half of the slots.  In other words, no, it doesn't.  It fills half the slots and that takes into account extremely difficult BiC ring events that involve multiple 1300 unslowable, unmezzable mobs in the 9th event - and harder content in Tipt, Kod'Taz and Ikkinz1-3.  That is not something to scoff at.  I'm going to see if it's doable - Haass is going to see if its doable.  But when we do it, we will have far surpassed what you and your guildmates were doing when you wore your EP and Time gear.  But you suggest I'm whining when I make note of that. <br />
 <br />

<br />
PoP sucks for non raiders:<br />
<br />
I agree, it does... get out while you still can.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes that is part of it.  But I'd suggest that if we are all in agreement on this maybe someone somewhere ought to consider actually fixing it.  I think the fix could be pretty simple.  If you don't want to open the planes and let the content itself be the barrier, then require an arduous flag.  But don't call me a wounded dog or tell me I'm waiting for apples to hit me on the head when I make that suggestion.  We all agree the content is broken; lets fix it.<br />
<br />
The other part of it...I think you just completely missed.  The purpose was to highlight exactly how off-base your own progression model is.  You think future expansions should be more difficult because we will have acquired the gear from earlier expansions?  Well, guess what?  Non raiders are pitting themselves against EP+ difficulty content but without EP gear.  You are suggesting they gain not-even-EP-equivalent-gear by pushing the envelope against this content.  Your progression model suggests that the risk and the reward ought to balance out - yet players must beat RZ in order to progress toward...much easier content that drops EP gear.  The same EP gear that you say I'm whining about wanting...from the same content that you ADMIT is broken but want me to ignore. <br />
<br />
Accept the reality that PoP is 3 expansions old and isn't going to get fixed, and move on.   That doesn't justify scaling rewards for repetitive non scaling content though.<br />
<br />
So gear three expansions old will never ever be made available to non hard core raiders. Instead, your solution is It Sucks! Get over it!  That is no solution at all. Telling me to ignore the fact that it exists at all because I can upgrade 10 of 20 slots (and not the ones that traditionally contain the most AC and HP) out of an expansion that should be tackled using the EP gear given your own progression model....is not a reasonable solution.    EP and Time level people are dying to Tipt and Vxed.  Sure, maybe I am skilled enough that I can overcompensate for my lack of gear.  But according to your own progression model, I ought not have to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Imo, GoD is great for the non-raider for the most part. As Frodlin said in his last post, the lacking things are weapons and visible slots. <br />
<br />
I would say the lack the lack of weapons is more of a problem since RA armor is pretty good, but non-raiding weapons (in particular wars since we are tied to aggro procs) are falling way way behind. The difference between 15/20, 14/18 weapons for non raiders and 38/35, 29/25 weapons for raiders is just way too large in my opinion.<br />
<br />
For armor, I wish they would have had one more dungeon type zone that is somewhere between Ikkinz and Ferubi (more on the Ikkinz side) that was set up similar to something like HoT where 1-3 groups could farm an armor set that was between RA and Raex. <br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'd say if you are having trouble with GoD, then go back and farm old stuff. It is doable without any raid gear with some effort. Just like an elemental guild can't complain that they can't get to Qvic, a moderately geared casual player can't complain that they can't hang in Vxed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But hell, who listens to us anyway when they've got Frodlin, the guy who thought that Knights needed mini-defensive because SoE released a fubared expansion, telling everyone we're clueless?  In fact if Frodlin has been listened to, the content in GoD wouldn't have been touched at all, and Knights would now have mini-defensive to help them progress there.

You were JUST as right as I. Knights MAY need at least a short autoparry ability to get the Clerics rolling. Giving Knight's half Defensive would have conveniently disposed of the issue.<br />

I repeatedly at the top of my lungs shouted my opinion over on PoN that the content in GoD was misdesigned, that they screwed up the content.  Did I specifically state that they'd included opponents for level 70 toons rather than level 65 as became to be known as the truth?  No, I didn't.  But I knew absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt that if Knights were having the problems they claimed to be having, there was no other reasonable conclusion to arrive at other than the content was misdesigned.  As I recalled you were in agreement BB.  It turns out we were right.  Froldin argued with us until it became impossible to even pretend that we were wrong.  Then, I admit, he was man enough to admit it and changed his position.  But that doesn't change the fact that he originally believed with all his heart that only PoTime Knights needed mini-defensive and that was solely because he wanted to see the content of GoD unchanged and still wanted his friends and comrades to be able to progress there in single groups.  Not because it would help non-raiders in any way.  Not because he saw excluding a huge chunk of the player base from the expansion as a problem in any way.  But solely so fellow raiders could play in the expansion like he was.<br />
<br />
Now, this is a true representation of the facts.   Refute them if you wish, but we both know I'm right.  And if I'm an ass for bringing it up and pointing it out, then so be it.  I'm an ass.  But at least I'm an ass with the facts behind him.</div></div><hr />

The reason they don't open up the EPs is that it its pointless. These aren't designed for exp except in certain few fringe spots... they just can't hold ppl like previous zones can.

I did the Tipt and Vxed trials before and after the changes with my chanter.  I haven't noticed significant changes in most mobs.  In fact, from posts on thse forums it sounds like the trash in the trials has been ramped up, respawn has been increased, and charm efficiency has been decreased.  Stuff that used to hit for 300 now hits for 900+.  According to DPS parsings, the slowed trash mobs in Tipt have 780 DPS, significantly higher than before.  The trash frequently hits for 1.3K and there are far more yellow mobs now.  The boss was slowable before and he's slowable now; the only difference is that some warriors post they cannot use defensive or furious.  The resounding conclusions from posters on these forums is that Tipt is harder now then it was when you did it.<br />
<br />
So, no, the stuff has not been &quot;toned down considerably.&quot;  <br />
<br />
In any event, pawning this off as &quot;toned down considerably&quot; is simply ignoring my statement that YOU did this with EP/Time gear and you call me a wounded dog because I'd like the chance to progress through all the content and do it in EP-equivalent gear as well.  Somehow, though, I am a slacker letting apples fall on my head because I find your suggestion to beat an encounter that appears HARDER today than when you did with gear that is significantly less than yours was at the time is appallingly short-sighted. <br />

Um, what?  Your post was about the progression model.  According to your model, you progress into new content using the old content.  Yet, I just outlined that you expect us to get into the new content (GoD) without using the old content because it remains blocked to us (PoP).   In response, you just told me that you got into the then-new content (EPs) using the then-old content then available to you (VT/Ornate).  The two concepts don't match.  What you said doesn't respond to nor address my point.  Can you see where the points aren't matching up?  Of COURSE progressing into EPs using the prior expansions content was easier.  According to YOU, that is exactly how it ought to be done.  But it then follows that progressing into GoD without the use of the prior expansions' content is far more difficult.</div></div><hr />

The reason they don't open up the EPs is that it its pointless. These aren't designed for exp except in certain few fringe spots...<br />
<br />
<br />
Naubi, I don't mean to be disrespectful but I've already posted answers to this in several different places.<br />
<br />
We want access to EPs both for the experience (which IS significant, especially with 5 more levels to pound out) and because I believe small groups of friends ARE able to take down EP minis. <br />
<br />
We need this gear because we belong to guilds or we have groups of friends who raid with significantly fewer numbers than you do.  As when we used Velious armor in order to springboard our excursions into Kunark for epics and help us take down things like Gore, we could use this gear to assist with taking down prior content.  If our guilds wish to progress we will ultimately need to use this gear to help us into Ikkinz trials, Kod'Taz raid events, and possibly even EP gods once we have level 70 and new AAs.  Ultimately, we need this type of gear because it is a mainstay in Sony's progression table and despite the fact that we do it on a much slower timetable, small guilds and casual players and hard core nonraiders are progressing.</div></div><hr />

This is what's confusing me. You seem to want entry into the EP's because you &quot;need&quot; the loot to follow the progression.<br />
<br />
Yet you totally ignore the progression when it comes to doing the PoTime flag progression. Kill these mobs, bing! ToSoRo opens up to you and you farm Kizrak. Kill these mobs, and go after RZ getting a decent mask, a bow, and other progression gear in the process.<br />
<br />
Progression - starting from where you are right now and killing those mobs that are next in the progression that opens up content and gives you loot to improve you in a stepwise manner and prepare you for the next step in the progression.<br />
<br />
The way you use progression is. Gimmie da l3wt!<br />

<br />
Adding more gear we could earn without raids basically means something simple, you would make us more powerful, which would mean we might just get all flags done for EP without them needing to relax the requirements, it means we could get to the zones where the game bases it xp rate off of, everything below this XP will be a joke when OoW comes out.<br />

<br />
PoP, by design, is zerg-proof in the manner it is set up.  The encounters are not hard but you have to work well together to win them.<br />
<br />
No amount of loot will help you win RZ if your tactics are shit.  No real lack of loot is holding you back now.<br />
<br />
Straighten up your tactics and find yourself a strong pickup leader ... a full set of raex on every warrior wont guarantee you success on RZ if you still have 25-30 adds running willy-nilly on your raid force.  I've seen dozens of pickups on MM wipe to RZtWL using a botted 12.5k/2500 warrior.</div></div><hr />

The idea that you get waaaaay overgeared without earning your way there and go back and show RZ what for is sketchy as heck.<br />

BTW, Tipt is easier than when I first did it. I've done it several times. Once recently after the changes. I thought it was going to be completely nerfed.

Raex is Ep/Potime Armor. Some of it drops in the EP's and some of it drops in PoTime. You most certainly ARE asking for armor from the set that appears in PoTime. Armor that I wear right now.

I think the link should say &quot;Title 1 2 ... 22 23&quot; to warn people &quot;if you want to keep your sanity DO NOT CLICK HERE!&quot;<br />
<br />
As to the topic... <br />
<br />
I think that there is a nice progression path in place atm.  I started doing GoD trials with 0 elemental gear.  I've had HUGE upgrades lately because I helped test the VP quests so I have almost all of them done but I was doing GoD before I had a single elemental level item.  It was hard - as hard as any raid I've ever done.  But I could do it.  I'm currently missing trials 3 and 6 to be KT flagged.<br />
<br />
I think what is available atm isn't too far off what it should be although it would be nice if the no drop pieces were a bit less rare - since people wouldn't be able to farm them for plat I don't see why they need to be so rare that you have to devote your life to getting a piece.  If the no drop upgrades that drop in Ferubi and the trials dropped often enough that you had a good chance of getting them if you XP'd there consistantly would that be enough?  Or still no because of the difficulty of finding groups to go there?  My non raid guild (guild I was in before my current raid guild) used to take small raids to Ferubi and did rather well there.  The drops were substantial upgrades for us and with 3 groups we could get through there without much trouble.  <br />
<br />
I think additionally opening SolRo tower through an alt quest would be nice - let people farm ornate drops for themselves instead of having to farm plat to buy it.  <br />
<br />
Another armor set on LDoN would be ok too - some people still like doing LDoN.  But I don't think it should be elemental level.  Half way between Tak and elemental as some people are suggesting seems appropriate to me - or maybe as someone else suggested new class augs that would raise the AC for warriors or mana for clerics or x for y up to closer to elemental level would work.  Like a type 3 aug that was 10 AC + 40 HPs warrior only with the cleric version maybe being 10 HP 40 mana and the knight version being 5 AC 30 HPs 15 mana or whatever.  You can currently get either/or but being able to get both in one would improve the armor?  I didn't look stats up so the numbers are totally made up but the idea is there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">he didn't bother reading my response to Frodlin's post <br />
Actually, that's true. I skipped anything that looked like a responce to Frodlin's post. No responce is possible. The point is right on the money. There are guilds in the EP's right now that earned their way in. After looking at the requirements to get there, to provide a &quot;shortcut&quot; would be an unimaginable travesty. I'm pretty sure &quot;ubers&quot; would kick up at major fuss. I'm more than pretty sure they wouldn't have to - SoE once wrote they wouldn't vicitmize Warriors by giving Knights Defensive. Clearly given all the flags and the fact guilds are in there right now, EP access is even more abusive.<br />
-----<br />
Ariene,<br />
SoE said they weren't looking at a near EP armor set for LDoN. Maybe there will be something in OoW. If there is, that would certainly explain not putting a new set in LDoN.<br />
<br />
On the Warrior top ten list they didn't want to discuss drop rates on aggro weapons. Unless things are badly out of kilter (never or always drops) I don't think they'll change drop rates on other things.<br />
<br />
I don't know how well farming augs and exping at the same time would work in Ferubi, but it works well in Kod'Taz - however that a little further up the path.<br />
<br />
EDIT: forgive Gerick, he doesn't understand that he often sounds inappropritely jealous and that Clerics are Saints for sitting chained to the CH order in raid after raid - Bless you.<br />
-----<br />
Basically, that leaves &quot;casuals&quot; with trying to get SoE to do an alt-flag for ToSoRo, and following the Yellow Brick Road (progression path) with the knowledge that level 70 and near trivilization of the early parts is likely.<br />
<br />
Concidering the thread started with players saying there was no progression path - that's making headway.<br />

If you want my honest thoughts on your ideas<br />
<br />
Alt flag quest for sol ro is something I would love, it would increase the amount of people there doing pick up groups.<br />
<br />
Up the drop rate? heck yes, it is no drop and if you can kill it once you can kill it again, so why hold it down to a 1 in 50 (thats just a random number)<br />
<br />
As for LDoN armor? I wouldn't make it anymore than a point between ornate level and elemental level, best thing I would make a set for each class instead of something for all plate classes, customized armor would be alot better on me, I'd love to have all those caster stats turned into decent AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your ideas aren't bad.  They have some real merit.  But I also understand Gerick's intention.  It's tough playing a class that is constantly evaluated based on stats which are extremely difficult to improve on.   No one asks a Necro or an Enchanter how much mana they have.  People aren't worried, very much, about how many AAs  a caster may have.   Same with many of the other classes, they're not evaluated by their stats, but at most they may be evaluated by their AA abilities.  But Warriors and the Knight classes are constantly being accepted or rejected by people based on the arbitrary evaluation of, not whether or not they can play the class, but whether or not they are perceived to have enough AC and HP to be viable.  Sometimes that perception is accurate and you'd be a fool to even attempt that content with that tank.  And sometimes that perception is a false one that none the less becomes so prevelant that it's taken to be true.</div></div><hr />

Don't want people to think I'm trying to take credit for ideas that weren't mine.  <br />

I'm right in the middle between raider and casual.  I raid but I prefer grouping.  I'm not quite elemental yet so I know what its like to not have the best gear.  I think I can identify somewhat with both sides and was just trying to list the ideas that I think would work for both.  <br />

I think that things aren't as bad as sometimes it looks to the casuals and people give up and don't attempt what they could do if they tried BUT I also think the ubers don't realize what its like to do LFG and not have that guild tag over thier head that means they are the best.  <br />
<br />
I don't think casuals have it as bad as some think but I do think that some tweaks are needed.  I think some minor adjustments would fix things though - I'm not in the camp that thinks a whole new system is needed.  <br />

I could be wrong about how lazy people are. But I think if knocking off PoP progression flags is merely a matter of hitting them with 40-50 level 70 players in a pickup raid and saying &quot;Thanks for the flag.&quot;, players will make room in their busy LDoN farming schedules to do it - so long as LDoN equipment sucks by comparason.<br />
<br />
When players are level 70, do you really see getting into ToSoRo as a challange? RZ may not have a great drop rate on BoW's, but he's going to have a great dop rate so far as hitting the floor within 2 hours of becoming available henceforth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Honestly, I'm in a much different spot from Gerick and Haass, and I'm in a much different spot from you and Frod. But even as casual as I am, I can see the writing on the wall.<br />
<br />
 I like my guild. I left it once to do more raiding with a different guild. I've raided with other guilds as well. If I was REALLY worried about keeping up with the raid Joneses, I'd bug my sister for more grouping opportunities with her EP/damn near Time guildies. That's not my focus. My focus is tanking good mobs for my guild and helping them progress. I truly enjoy tanking stuff for guildies that gives a good fight, but that we can win at and that drops stuff that we can use. I pointed out Mistress of Darkwater somewhere else - that's OUR version of flag mobs. Sure, we can beat it with two groups. Most nights, though, two groups will be the max you can get, and sad to say, but at this point when I log in to EQ, I WILL be the Warrior with the most HP in the guild.<br />
<br />
 Yes, I'm rambling. Anyhoo.<br />
<br />
 I prefer grouping and raiding with my guildies. I also prefer not wasting my time fighting for the crumbs the bored Time+ers leave me for those kinds of mobs. I'd like doing the old progression that we didn't have the numbers, gear, or AA's for before 65/PoP. MY bitch is that people who have supposedly progressed beyond ever needing that stuff again won't leave it alone. It doesn't prevent our progression, but it expands the time and effort it takes to Herculean proportions for my guildmembers, and I don't appreciate it or the gamestyle that makes my progression artificially harder.<br />
<br />
 That being said, I don't think that 70 will automatically crumble old content, just like 65 didn't automatically crumble Luclin content for non-raiders. It certainly won't crumble it if the gear doesn't keep pace with the leveling, and frankly, if trends continue from PoP to GoD into OoW, I don't see casuals anywhere on the radar for loot in OoW.</div></div><hr />

In fact it has gimped everything in luclin ( and prior expension naturally ) even for non raid or casual.<br />

And you, sir, are very contradictory.  The sad thing is you haven't even realized it.  You tell me that I must first &quot;raid something easy,&quot; and then I should &quot;go after a harder mob.&quot;  This is your own definition of the progression model.<br />
<br />
The problem, sir, is that your progression model has nothing at all to do with fucking reality in PoP.  In PoP, I must first &quot;go after a harder mob&quot; (RZ) in order to &quot;raid something easy&quot; (Pyro). How exactly does this fit into that handy-dandy model you describe above?  It's EXACTLY the fucking opposite.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, Tipt is easier than when I first did it. I've done it several times. Once recently after the changes. I thought it was going to be completely nerfed. It isn't, but with 5 players available during some of the dicier moments I didin't even break a sweat. When I first did it, I certainly did and that was with 6 players at all times.<br />

Really?  No, shit?  Well I direct you to This Thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7675).  I don't need to argue this shit with you.  Raiding warriors from these forums have already proved your claims false.  According to these raiders, it sounds like the trash in the trials has been ramped up, respawn has been increased, and charm efficiency has been decreased. Stuff that used to hit for 300 now hits for 900+. According to DPS parsings, the slowed trash mobs in Tipt have 780 DPS, significantly higher than before. The trash frequently hits for 1.3K and there are far more yellow mobs now. The boss was slowable before and he's slowable now; the only difference is that some warriors post they cannot use defensive or furious. The resounding conclusions from posters on these forums is that Tipt is harder now then it was when you did it.<br />
<br />
But I don't need to hear about your Tipt wet dreams and self-congratulatory ass-kissing.  I've done Tipt both before and after the changes.  I've experienced the content and the supposed &quot;changes&quot; with my own eyes.  I didn't see any difference, except that respawn is indeed faster and there are more even and yellow-con mobs.  I know that EP/Time geared tanks are dying one-rounded and I know that EP/Time geared groups are failing to these trials daily.  Maybe you think you are convincing someone but it sure as shit ain't me.</div></div><hr />

Level 70 will do the same for PoP and GoD.<br />
I disagree.  Single groups and pairs of groups are still unable to accomplish anything in VT.  Emperor Ssra has still not become the equivalent of an Auliffe Chaoswind.  You still don't even see single groups in NTOV.  This is because those zones are unfriendly to small numbers regardless of individual power.  I predict the same will be true of most POP boss encounters even at level 70.<br />
<br />
Two groups at level 70 won't be able to finish the Bertox script in 2 hours, they won't be able to kill Blazzax or Tantisala before the AE overcomes them, they won't be able to spawn and kill an Air Avatar before it despawns, and they won't be able to finish the Fennin Ro script even if they spend the full 6 hours on it.  That's my prediction.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are a few POP mobs out there who are like Seru or AoW, in which fight duration really doesn't matter, and you can theoretically win with 3 people of sufficient power with perfect execution.  Kriziik the Mighty is an example.  Those kinds of fights are in the minority in POP, though, and you can't really progress on them alone.</div></div><hr />

You can't compare Augmented armor to unaugmented armor. Put augments in the elemental armor and it is nowhere close. Additionally, RA isn't really all it's cracked up to be.

Sass, you, I, and Brutul simply disagree about this.  I have already listed the exact mobs that I feel will be doable with three groups and under.  Brutul confirmed that he held the same belief and felt I missed a couple mobs.  <br />
<br />
Those mobs are not &quot;in the minority&quot;  - I would say I listed more than 50% of the minis in PoP on my list.<br />
<br />
Players can most CERTAINLY progress on those mobs alone.<br />
<br />
Arch Mage drops elemental helms and boots.<br />
Babs drops elemental bracers, boots, and gloves.<br />
Blaz drops elemental boots and bracers.<br />
Mags drops elemental boots and bracers.<br />
Pyro drops elemental gloves, boots, and bracers. <br />
<br />
Several of the other mobs identified in my posts drop upgrades to legs, ears, fingers, weapons, shields, belts....Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean when you say that we could not &quot;progress on those mobs alone,&quot; because in my opinion that IS progression.  It is certainly the progression used by raiding guilds to tackle the gods and GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Did you experience old VP? ST ? VT ? PoM pre revamp? or even Ntov? let me guess.....you haven't?<br />
<br />
Did you miss the part where we're asking for an alternative to raiding? Let me guess...you ignored it.<br />
<br />
With the exception of VT, the key for which isn't that difficult (just time consuming), all of those zones required raids to gain access to when the content was new or one expansion old. But that's ok because it was only 1 (2 in Velious) zone that non-raiders couldn't access and while we couldn't get the  very best  gear we could get close to competetive given time.<br />
<br />
Then PoP changed that. No matter how much time I spend in the game, without changing my play style, I will never see Sol Ro Tower or Fire, Air, Earth and Water. I don't care about Time. Just like the other final content of previous expansions it should stay inaccessible for a very long time. <br />
<br />
Now, long time raiders are telling us to skip content  to &quot;progress&quot; . Why? To what purpose? Gear is not the only measure of progress or success. I was flagged for Tactics long before I got an MB kill and I earned that access spending long hours in  a sub-par exp zone, competing against other groups of non-raiders for our &quot;progression mobs&quot;. <br />
<br />
I cannot ever get competetive with raiders, like I could in the past, even if I spent 4 more rl years and Sony granted me 10 more levels because ever increasing amounts of content are locked behind raids.  Its not solely about elemental level gear. Its also about being able to experience content I paid for without having to alter my entire fucking life to do it. <br />
<br />
In case you missed it, I'm already doing what raiders say I should be doing to &quot;progress&quot;. Now, if I can pass the sewer and mountain trials (which I will) and progress in GoD without elemental armor what reason is there to keep me out of the elemental planes? <br />
<br />
SOE could solve this real quick and just tell me and all the other non-raiders that further expansions are designed for raiders only instead of insisting there is content for everyone. It'll save me $40.00.</div></div><hr />

We've already had this discussion.  Brutul already pointed out that he DID beat Pyro with 24 people at level 65 with NO EP armor whatsoever.  Clearly it is doable.  So maybe we have to kill Pyro and the birds and the mini-minis, or farm some of the mini-minis in Air in order to acquire the upgrades to kill Blazzax. <br />

You didn't answer my question, though.  You didn't respond with how this was not EXACTLY the progression intended; why you feel I &quot;can't really progress on them alone.&quot;<br />

You'll notice I'm harping on little things.  That is because I do believe there are some points that we can all agree on - and doing so significantly cut down on the amount of issues worth the bickering.<br />
<br />
I believe that we can all agree that casual raiders and nonraiders alike eventually can achieve access to &quot;raid&quot; zones from prior expansions. <br />
<br />
I believe that we can all agree that &quot;progression&quot; in the game sense and in the technical sense typically requires that one kill a comparatively easier mob and then progress forward to kill comparatively more difficult mobs. <br />
<br />
I believe we can all agree that RZ is a comparatively more difficult mob than are several others in the Elemental Planes. <br />
<br />
I believe we can all agree that Sony did impliment alt-key quests for lower level PoP zones, thereby acknowledging that alt-key quests are an appropriate way in which the players might experience the &quot;depth&quot; of the content.</div></div><hr />

I believe we can all agree that Sony examined in &quot;depth&quot; the question of which zones might appropriately have an alt-key quest and which should not. Those that, based on their criteria, should be alt-keyed were and others which might have been weren't.<br />
<br />
The question is not the feasability but wether it should be done.<br />
<br />
Depending on the zone, I'd agree. Unless I've missed a major reason not to unlock ToSoRo, I believe the raid flag mobs are sufficiently isolated so they wouldn't fall pray to those after loot rather than satisfying EP/PoTime flag requirements.<br />
<br />
That's however the rub. I don't believe raiders that have succeeded in completing the EP/PoTime flag requirements or those in the process of completing them should be sacrificed on the altar of &quot;casual&quot; players.<br />
<br />
I don't believe tearing down flag requirements intended to diferentiate raid content from non-raid content is appropriate. The is a legitimate purpose for those flags and it's not simply to be a timesink. It's to create a progression both in moving through the content and gearing up while doing so.<br />
<br />
I do agree the &quot;someday&quot; these requirements might be eased. However the recent VP revamp does not show them being eliminated if precidents are going to be used as an argument.<br />

Haha, who the hell cares?  Does 1 week of EP farming make any difference in the fight?  The two pairs of gloves we got from Pyronis were PB's first elemental molds.  There's some chance we did an earth ring or something, but we had zero competition for flag mobs at the time, so we didn't waste a lot of time getting sol ro after we killed Rallos.

I could be wrong but does this imply that you were (if not the top) within the top 3 guilds or so on your server?  If this is the case, then it is safe to assume that you spent a good bit of time in VT gearing up, and that your 24 people were seasoned raiders who were already very used to raiding with each other in intense situations.  I'm glad that you've the ability to kill some rather impressive things with small numbers, as that to me shows more talent than anything else could in EQ  :)  .  I simply dont believe that your average lv 70 baz equipped group of 18-24 players can boast some of the same feats when/if they ever decided to open the EP's.<br />

<br />
So do you agree, then, that (1) there are EP mobs that 18 people, level 70, are capable of killing and (2) those 18 people could progress from the gear obtained from those mobs?<br />
<br />
I assume you have because you have assumed away that part of the argument and now are arguing that the same 18 people should be able to kill RZ.  Only your exercise wasn't any kind of real logic exercise.  You just assumed half the raid away to charming, alone.  Wanna come up with a way to nerf enchanters into oblivion and that would probably be it. <br />
<br />
You have already been told by two raiders, Phatron and Brutul, that mobs in Fire and other planes are doable with a couple groups.  This has moved beyond the realm of debate into fact. <br />
<br />
Maybe 30 level 70's could kill rZ.  I've seen 40 level 65's in the best lower-PoP and VT gear do it.  30 people is a far cry from &quot;a couple groups.&quot;  I now raid with a group that can maybe get 15-18 people to show up, tops.  Assuming 30 people made this possible, it would have to be the best damn dedicated work-together group of people you've ever met.  So adding 12 random people to cover the bases doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to argue about whatever you want to argue about, but I think its flat out silly to keep talking about how difficult the EP mobs are when we have two respected raiders IN THIS THREAD saying its doable.  That ends the debate, right?  That is the reason you moved on to arguing that RZ is doable with the same people.  But I believe you are wrong and I seriously doubt that anyone here is going to step up and tell us that they personally killed RZ with 18 people before they wore Elemental Gear (or, hell, after). <br />
<br />
<br />
I believe we can all agree that Sony examined in &quot;depth&quot; the question of which zones might appropriately have an alt-key quest and which should not. Those that, based on their criteria, should be alt-keyed were and others which might have been weren't.<br />
<br />
The question is not the feasability but wether it should be done.<br />
<br />
<br />
You only addressed one of several different fundamental agreement points.  I guess you concede the others.  In fact, you seem to concede that Sony acknowledged that an alt-key quest was an appropriate alterantive to killing big mobs, right?<br />
<br />
As the nuance you raise, feasibility is irrelevant and was never part of the question.  Anything is feasible.  Your question is whether it &quot;should be done.&quot;  Well &quot;should be&quot; is pretty subjective.  We know that Sony determined that rather than kill mobs like Gruumus and Terris Thule and Storm Lords and MB and Agnarr, players could instead earn the same rewards with single-group content.   So we have some inkling of Sony's subjective state of mind.  I see no inherent reason why this same logic ought not apply to the rest of PoP.  You seem to be arguing that Sony created some criterea in selecting zones to make accessible.  First off I think that is giving Sony too much credit.  But aside from that, you are making an assumption here (Sony created some criterea) and I see no basis for it.  Moreoever, you haven't identified what presumed criterea Sony might have used.  I'd be interested in what possible criterea that could be that would not also embrace the ability to alt-key quest the zone access given Sony had done that elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

So do you agree, then, that (1) there are EP mobs that 18 people, level 70, are capable of killing and (2) those 18 people could progress from the gear obtained from those mobs?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for you post and in the spirit of quid pro quo, if you are surprised, lets end the debate.  I'm willing to believe that I could be wrong on this although I seriously doubt it because I have actually beaten RZ and I saw what it took.  So lets ask the folks who ended the debate on the difficulty of the mobs in Fire.  It's not me accumulating a raid force, Sassinak, its people explaining that it has ALREADY been done.<br />
<br />
Brutul, with how many people did your guild down RZ?  Phatron, you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">Your question is whether it &quot;should be done.&quot;<br />
That's not a nuance. SoE has already twice decided to have flags. Once when origanally designed and a second time when removing them elsewhere.<br />
<br />
My point is not trivial nor are the effects. Is there to be a raid progression path controlled by flags, gatekeeper mobs, and keys or not. If there is and guilds are currently in that progression should their progression mobs be somehow be protected from small raids or groups that have every reason to want the loot although the result would be &quot;cockblocking guilds&quot;?<br />
<br />
In addition there is the progression question. The prograssion mobs DO offer loot that improve guilds doing the progression. To some extent they are reliant on that loot. RZ is a good example. Guilds on the way to the EP's still often need aggro weapons for their MT's.<br />
<br />
Finally there is the question of prestige and game enjoyment. How much of these qualities are preserved if the a guld the has plowed through 50 flags to get to PoTime finds the Family Hugs guild there doing Phase 1 with their 18 best players?<br />
<br />
It is pretty clearly for these reasons that although alt-key flags were provided for some zones they were for others. I rather imagine numerous guilds would object if casual players were in PoEarth in droves screwing up the Mud Ring and other content they worked for 6 months to reach.<br />
<br />
Would seeking out the top 4 guilds on every server and advising them of the proposal to alt-Key the EP's so they can register their opinion pro or con to SoE be a good idea? Rather than debate, we could cut to the chase.<br />
<br />
Better yet, SoE could reply directly and avoid an uproar.<br />

Again with the &quot;protected&quot; cry-babying.  Seriously, don't waste my time trying to convince me that raiders need protection from nonraiders and casuals.  It's embarassing to me as a nonraider and its shameful to me as a raider.  Raiders did just fine obtaining rewards first when there were no gatekeepers.  They do not need to be handheld and I'd like to think that NONE of the other raiders on this thread feel they need to be. <br />
<br />
YOU just admitted in this thread that raiders are dependent on the loot that drops in the elemental planes in order to progress.  Well, guess what?  You progressed from the elemental planes, into Time, and not into GoD.  Hi, see me?  Yeah, I'm the tank now trying to progress in the same GoDdamn content but without that gear that you claim you were dependent on in order to progress. <br />
<br />
<br />
BB, I'm going to assume you don't know the meaning of nuance.  Nuance does not mean trivial.  In fact, it is generally thought of as a compliment as it connotes a deeper or more subtle degree of difference.   Here, though, my question asked whether we can agree that Sony made closed zones available via either killing a mob or questing for the alt-key.  You didn't answer that question - and you still haven't.  Instead, you changed the concept to be whether allow alt-keying for all closed zones was &quot;feasible.&quot;  That is a nuance, not a trivial difference, but it is irrelevant.  Mostly because you aren't using feasible correctly.  Feasible is like possible.  Is it possible that Battleblade will understand the nonraider's point in this thread?  Sure, it's possible.  But it isn't probably given all we currently know about Battleblade.  Similarly, when constrained only by programming and technical hurdles, of COURSE it is feasible that one could acquire access to a zone via an alt-key quest.  But that isn't where we should be looking (and I, at least, didn't).  <br />
<br />
I notice you still didn't address any of my questions.  I keep responding to your drivel but you never return the favor.  Answer my questions when I ask them or I'm through debating with you.  I see no point talking to a wall that can't manage to carry on a two-way conversation. <br />
<br />
<br />
You only addressed one of several different fundamental agreement points. I guess you concede the others. In fact, you seem to concede that Sony acknowledged that an alt-key quest was an appropriate alterantive to killing big mobs, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
You seem to be arguing that Sony created some criterea in selecting zones to make accessible. First off I think that is giving Sony too much credit. But aside from that, you are making an assumption here (Sony created some criterea) and I see no basis for it. Moreoever, you haven't identified what presumed criterea Sony might have used. I'd be interested in what possible criterea that could be that would not also embrace the ability to alt-key quest the zone access given Sony had done that elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

It is possible to frame a debate in such a way that begs replies to questions that in themselves are presumtive.<br />

What criterea we don't know and we'd only be guessing at but you were the one who presumed that so I asked you to elaborate.  Tell me, what criterea would Sony be examining and exactly how would that have applied to Tier4, but only Tier4, since Sony already opened up Tier1-3 with alt-key quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the most simple thing.<br />
<br />
You don't have to have a SINGLE PoP flag to get a Quintesscence of the Elements.   This is why.   They decided that it was a good idea to add this little gem so that guilds wouldn't have to go back and backflag everyone over and over and over to get someone in Time.   It created a situation where flag mobs were more contested than they should've been not because of desirability to do them, but because people HAD to do them to fill in an irrelevant gap in their flags to get to a completely different zone.<br />
<br />
Now, a guild has to have enough people on to &quot;raid&quot; someone in to snag god shields, indicating that enough people have done the progression path to create a &quot;buffer&quot; where a sizeable majority of the people who come in have done the footwork that it takes to progress.<br />
<br />
Undo that, and you have easily pickup raids doing cornerstone gods without ANY pre-flag requirements whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Vigdis, I just felt like we were referring to very different things.  Example:<br />

I know that a single person has 3-boxed Aaryonar using monk/shaman/bard.  This does not mean that Aaryonar is single-group content for non-raiders today.  It doesn't even mean Aaryonar is doable by 18 &quot;semi-raiders&quot; who can actually profit from killing him.<br />
<br />
Now Brutul refers to killing of EP bosses with small numbers of well-equipped people today, and suggests that it will be doable by the same or less people at level 70 who are worse equipped.  I look at the historical counterexample of Aaryonar, and I and think that if Brutul was right, then Aaryonar would have been routinely falling to such forces long ago, but he wasn't.<br />
<br />
15-18 &quot;semi-raiders&quot; who are level 65+AA's and have pre-Aaryonar loot should be capable of killing Aaryonar, with difficulty.  But it rarely if ever happens.  Similarly, 18 pre-EP-equipped people should be capable of killing Emperor Ssra if they performed flawlessly, but I haven't heard of it happening yet.  Now it might be true that 18 pre-EP-equipped people can kill EP raid targets at level 70.  To me, that will be an impressive feat.  To me, RZTW is not a serious barrier to people who are capable of that.</div></div><hr />

Easy answer for aary :<br />

 <br />
<br />
Thank you.  I believe that is as close to a concession on this point as we are likely to get.  I don't believe it should have been a hard concession because Brutul and Phatron have stated that they have and despite your reference in your post to well-equiped people, Brutul told you flat out that he was not in Elemental armor.  Nevertheless because we are obviously on &quot;opposing sides,&quot; any concession is headway. <br />
<br />
As for the RZ talk, I cannot know how to address it.  I've asked Brutul for his numbers, as he was the one with the example of killing Pyro with few people and without elemental gear.  In my experience, the RZ script is fundamentally different from the typical minis you find in the planes and it requires significantly more people.  <br />
<br />
Finally, because you claimed it wasn't so, I also asked to address that the gear obtained from mobs in Fire would assist with the groups' progression.  I don't even see how this is debatable but you were the one who stated it...  Since you haven't addressed it since, I believe it was probably said in the form of rhetoric and that you likely regret having said it now.  If 18 people can kill mobs that drop elemental-gear, I'm not sure how we can contest that it is progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know that a single person has 3-boxed Aaryonar using monk/shaman/bard.  This does not mean that Aaryonar is single-group content for non-raiders today.  It doesn't even mean Aaryonar is doable by 18 &quot;semi-raiders&quot; who can actually profit from killing him.<br />
<br />
<br />
That isn't true.  It's happened and happening still on our server.  I was in a guild that killed Aaryonar with 18 people just at the release of PoP.  NToV gear was a significant upgrade to everything we had at the time.  We were on the AoW rotation, raiding Plane of Growth, and we were trying to break into Ssra.   This was, in fact, the guild I left Unhomed for because I felt they were progressing but keeping with the &quot;tight-knit&quot; concept.  Unfortunately, progressing further meant taking on more and more people and moving farther and farther from that concept. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now, a guild has to have enough people on to &quot;raid&quot; someone in to snag god shields, indicating that enough people have done the progression path to create a &quot;buffer&quot; where a sizeable majority of the people who come in have done the footwork that it takes to progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Understood.  I think.  Are you suggesting that without the RZ block people would be able to eventually kill the four elemental gods and access Time?  To that I respond, Sony has already addressed that concern with alt-key quests.  Alt-key quests do not allow the player to actually progress in the story-line, the quest just allows them to access the content.  Limit the alt-key quest to the content available in those zones.  Then even if players progress through the Elemental Planes and are able to beat the gods there, they cannot access Time.  I'll go one step further, even, to do away with mudflation back-peddling.  Create the alt-key quest in such a way so that once it has been completed, the character cannot later go back and kill the Tier1-3 gods to eventually access Time.  In other words, make that quest a choice for the pure nonraider or casual player. <br />
<br />
<br />
Undo that, and you have easily pickup raids doing cornerstone gods without ANY pre-flag requirements whatever.<br />
<br />
<br />
On many servers you already have that so I feel it it somewhat irrelevant and an outdated concern.  If people want access to the planes, they can join PUR and eventually have access.  But for those folks who remain true to their ideals and wish to progress into the content wtih their group or with their casual guildmates, I think the alt-key quest has some value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
then they need to remove that quest and let their prospective members tag along on pickup raids instead of waiting for their guild to 85 them in and help them skip everything.<br />
<br />
Everyone wins, no one can get in without a certain amount of flags and everyone has to work togeather, it would be more fair and across the board than it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">Gerick,<br />
<br />
The reality is that what would end up happenning is that guilds would simply kill the mobs again.  It's a lot easier to go spend a couple days wiping out all of PoP than to manage peoples' flags, or rely on pickups to succeed.   <br />
<br />
I realize that you want to sieze upon a perceived &quot;opportunity&quot; to have high end guilds sending mercenaries down to power you though content, but it's not at all what would happen.  You know it and I know it.   <br />
<br />
On my server, we have an interesting method of handling backflags.  It usually only occurs with the Elemental gods, but every couple of weeks all the time guilds basically go &quot;Hey, it's time to kill X, send whoever, we're gonna massively destroy these things this week, if you've beaten these things, then send your people and they can get their flags&quot;.   The thing is, we will NOT under any circumstance power people through who haven't done the content, that's not what it's about.   <br />
<br />
The same thing would happen in the lower planes if this occurred.  There would be a prerequisite to your guild having passed the content before being able to join, and the guilds would hose the content without blinking an eye.</div></div><hr />

It's a lot more simple than that Gerick, it's a matter of progression.   It's a matter of &quot;We will do this jointly to get the maximum number of people done, so we can do it less often, but we're not an educational institute, we're not here to hand you the encounters, we're here to beat them&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of the guilds on my server that currently participate, I'd say about 10% of the people go to Elemental planes for Exp.    The rest are in GoD, where the exp is better as are the drops.<br />
<br />
There's a few Elemental guilds who basically do EP exp, but if you think for one minute that the prices are artificially inflated on Stone Rings and bows, you're wrong.   There would simply be more available for insane prices.    What's even more ironic is the fact that in most groups I've been in in EP's, we destroy bow parts, because they waste inventory space.<br />
<br />
You don't need to 'practice your craft&quot; by making Elemental Bows, you can max out &quot;your craft&quot; far before the Stonewood bow.   While i understand that you dont' feel that it's fair that you cant' get in to the action of making a bundle off of Stonewood bows or Earth Rings, at least be honest about it and go 'Hey, I want in on the action too' rather than yet another conspiracy theory about how people are conspiring against you to keep you from getting tradeskill items and this is why they wont' let you raid with them.<br />
<br />
They dont' want the BoTization of the EP's, that's for certain, but that's not why they dont' invite you either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">That simply is not true, what I ment by those encounters was not them teaching us how to do them, the encounters i was referancing were the cycles you can start of by accident, those are the only thing groups need to learn to avoid being flame bait<br />
<br />
Its just like for example, some dumbshit killing one of the NPC's for a ring war, you only have to be bitched out by 20-30 people at once to learn not to do something, this is what I was talking about<br />
<br />
As for ele rings and bows, I can use an ele bow as a skill up AND as a result I could use there are VERY few things that a player can make that would be an upgrade for that same toon, my point by mentioning it was not that I would like to make them (I would) or that others will make them, my point is if 20 enchanters are making them instead of 4 then we will see the price go WAY down, that is something ALOT of ep players would be really pissed with, hell you can sell some of the components for an assload, so you really dont have to be a master crafter to make it rich, if more players were there causing the zone to give out it's maximum tradeskill loot instead of 1 or 2 groups there all of it would drop in price, lots of EP players would hate that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">On my server it's an unwritten rule that if a guild is not doing a target for the first time, people from other guilds are welcome to join for backflags assuming that their guild has successfully defeated said content on their own without help.<br />
<br />
We made a go at RZ tonight (wipe at 30ish% due to clerical misshaps).   We got about 100 or more tells from people wanting to flag our extra spots ... all of which we turned down.<br />

<br />
<br />
apo if RZ is all I need for EP how the fuck are you handing me my entire planer progression? its one damn flag, I've done all the others just like you.<br />
<br />
The only reason you let people come along who are in guilds already in EP is simple, if you dont then the other guild will need the target as well and then the two of you are directly competeing, this leads to fighting and people that have friends in the other guild getting upset and leaving.<br />
<br />
The reason you do it is you can not stop them from reaching the EP anyhow, so why not? when it comes to casuals however we are nobodys, no one will stick up for us in your guild, no one in your guild will get upset if you dont let us tag along, and we sure as hell are not going to try ninja drop in on your targets.<br />
<br />
So basically we are of little threat so you ignore us, its like I said the uber guilds get in bed with eachother to avoid fights and contested spawns, while not a bad thing I still think you should be fair to everyone and allow others to come along if you have the room, its not like you can just skip to RZ and get your flag for EP, we currently have to do all the same bullshit you do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, what threat do we serve? so what if ele bows and rings go from 70k to 60k, that isnt going to hurt your twinks all that much.<br />
<br />
Let me just repeat myself, we want sol ro more than we want ep, just be aware that if sol ro opens up the power of the general player (BoTizens) will go way up, these are also the people that pick up raid, so chances are it wont be all that long before we get to the EP on our own strength.<br />
<br />
Hope you can understand my cynicism here, I've seen the worst in all play styles so there is plenty of scum in each group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because you, sir, didnt help us gear up and train for the encounter.... when the time comes and we are on the threshold of our success ... why should we hand out all these flags?<br />
<br />
I hear the same song and dance every single raid i lead: &quot;but, but ... this is my last flag ... i need it&quot; from 100 mouths.  If they get pissy with me i simply fall back on &quot;sorry .. guild policy&quot; ... if they continue the bitch i sit them down and give them the talk:  &quot;Look, sir, my guild has worked hard for this day.  Where were you when we farmed towers for 3 months?  Where were you when we clawed our way through content?  That's right ... you werent there at all.  This is our guild's venture and our baby.  If you would like the chance to raid with us feel free to drop in an application.  Till that day i have members and friends to look after.  Good day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everybody wants to be your friend when you have something to give them ... nobody wants to be your friend when your knee deep in shit crawling uphill.  Gerick, the server and the guilds therein doesnt owe you shit unless somewhere along the way you took time out to help them.<br />
<br />
Point is we are a team ... we succeed as a team ... we wipe as a team ... we grow as a team.  If you're not part of the team dont expect to get the trophy.<br />
<br />
The reason guilds backflag other guilds is for one simple reason:  with all the competition on some servers, backflagging is a huge pain in the ass.  If a guild has proven that it can win an encounter we will backflag their members.  In return ,when they down a mob we need backflagging for, we send our members along to get them.  The whole &quot;you scratch my back ... i'll scratch yours&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">It would be good to note the following:<br />
<br />
We farmed VZ for about 2 months or more straight ... we actually at one time killed him 7+ times back to back ... monitoring the time he died ... and camping him till he spawned 3 days later.  Due to our extensive farming, every time we did him and were formed we announced it in our servers pickup raid channel. We'd call people to the zin then have them suicide and drag their corpses up for a rez and flag hail.<br />
<br />
All in all we've given out over 500 or more flags from small targets such as these, so as not to cockblock anyone's progression.<br />
<br />
On large mobs that dont die to pickups with a 90% or greater success rate, we will not push any randoms through the encounter.  If you cannot reliably do it on you own, dont bother asking us to help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u158"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p158">It's a lot more simple than that Gerick, it's a matter of progression. It's a matter of &quot;We will do this jointly to get the maximum number of people done, so we can do it less often, but we're not an educational institute, we're not here to hand you the encounters, we're here to beat them&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of the guilds on my server that currently participate, I'd say about 10% of the people go to Elemental planes for Exp. The rest are in GoD, where the exp is better as are the drops.<br />
<br />
There's a few Elemental guilds who basically do EP exp, but if you think for one minute that the prices are artificially inflated on Stone Rings and bows, you're wrong. There would simply be more available for insane prices. What's even more ironic is the fact that in most groups I've been in in EP's, we destroy bow parts, because they waste inventory space.<br />
<br />
You don't need to 'practice your craft&quot; by making Elemental Bows, you can max out &quot;your craft&quot; far before the Stonewood bow. While i understand that you dont' feel that it's fair that you cant' get in to the action of making a bundle off of Stonewood bows or Earth Rings, at least be honest about it and go 'Hey, I want in on the action too' rather than yet another conspiracy theory about how people are conspiring against you to keep you from getting tradeskill items and this is why they wont' let you raid with them.<br />
<br />
They dont' want the BoTization of the EP's, that's for certain, but that's not why they dont' invite you either.<br />
<br />
I love how on the one hand you characterize raiders with relatively noble intentions, they're not there as educational institutions, they're not there to hand people the encounters, they're there to beat them and so forth.  Yet you then turn around and as much accuse Gerick of being a greedy plat hungry lowbie because he'd like to have some access to some tradeskill items.  God forbid anyone should actually want to use the tradeskills they labored over for dozens or even hundreds of hours to actually make something that might be useful to themselves personally.  Oh no, all the tradeskill components have to be locked behind flagged zones and be extrordinarily rare.  Wonderful, so what was the point of tradeskills again?  To make crap that no one wants?  Ah, gotcha.  Another huge time sink with a mediocre reward that the raiders will still get more out of for equal or less time invested.  How nice.<br />
<br />
And you still have in no way addressed my earlier point Frodlin, perhaps it got by you, so I'll lay it out for you plain as day.  If you are as objective an evaluator, as you claim, of the non-raider status within the game today, how do you justify the fact that prior to the revelation that GoD was released with the mobs tuned for 5 levels too many, you personally felt that no changes to GoD should be made, PoTime Knights should be given access to a mini-defensive, and if anyone but hardcore uber geared raiders couldn't even have a prayer of succeeding in GoD, that was just too damn bad?<br />
<br />
I'm very much interested, as I suspect others are as well, in hearing how you felt that it was fine that an entire expansion had a big &quot;do not enter&quot; sign on it for non-raiders.  And how that can possibly mesh with your current stance that non-raiders are blowing their situation way out of proportion and everything is fine if they'd just go out and do stuff?  You've made it clear you like having non-raiders excluded from your content, how can we possibly believe that you're impartial and unbiased?</div></div><hr />

I never accused him of being greedy or plat hungry, I'd content that EVERYONE wants plat and upgrades.   I just want him to be honest enough to admit it, and not pretend that it's for 'working on his craft&quot;, that's all.<br />
<br />
If someone said &quot;Hey, I want in the Ring/bow action&quot;, I'd have no problem with that, hell, I'd want it too, although I don't tradeskill much except for baking.   The thing is, dont' portray it as though it's some blue collar thing that you're prevented from 'working on your craft&quot;.   You can max out fletching in Luclin.    It's NOT a negative thing to want in on a cash cow, but hell, at least have the balls to say that's what you want.   <br />
<br />
Let me start.  One of the reasons I go to Riwwi a lot is because.... people wont' go to GoD, so i charge them WAY more than the crap that drops there should go for, and make a bundle.  I've made half a million plat off of Riwwi drops alone int he last 30 days.   <br />

<br />
This one is simple:   Based on the available content at the time, and the way it was tuned, it was tuned to such a degree that it TOOK time geared warriors to tank this shit.   It was logical to me that if it took time geared warrior to tank the stuff, then it was INTENDED for such, and thus it was appropriate for time geared knights to succeed in single group content.   It was only after the retuning and the revelation that came out during the summit that we learned that it was intended for level 70 types.   Once it was retuned, the ability for knights to tank skyrocketed, thus negating the need to change the classes.   This also had the side benefit of opening the place up to more people.   <br />
<br />
You're assuming that my position was that it was a positive thing that it took time geared people to complete the stuff, and I never stated that.  I only said that if that's what it appeared to be designed for, then something needed to change.   When the content changed, then my position did as well.  It's all about context, and the context was different at the time.  <br />

Come on Glatius, I'm sure you don't believe exactly what you wrote the way you wrote it.<br />
<br />
Sorry in advance Gerick - I'm going to correct Glatius and be as gentle as I can.<br />
<br />
Gerick has 95 days played. We both know that there are players with 400+ days played on a Warrior that regularly do hardcore events.<br />
<br />
He wasn't very familiar with ToD and where it dropped.<br />
<br />
He does not understand why high level guilds might flags eachother's members for content they've each done, but not random people that give them a tell.<br />
<br />
He doesn't see why high level guilds, some still in the content, wouldn't want the EP's as open zones with no keys or flags require.<br />
<br />
Let me try hard to say it kindly - He seems to me to be a newer player (n00bie is such an unkind word) who would ask for things he hasn't earned (beggar is also unkind) like EP access, the right to tag along with high level guilds to get a high level flag 'cause they should be nice to lower level players if they have room, etc.<br />
<br />
I don't think he's a &quot;bad person&quot;. I think he truly doesn't understand high level guild and player sensibilities. They are totally alien to him. 'Why won't  you give me that or share it, you have so much?' seems like a reasonable question to him and not the standard EQ beggar's pitch.<br />

<br />
No, that's not a completely accurate restatement of your position at the time.  I clearly remember advocating that there be changes made to the content in GoD.  You were clearly opposed to such changes because you and your friends, by that I mean your fellow guild members, liked the challenge and you strenously objected to it being changed.  You even made a point of stressing that raiders needed challenging content and GoD was that content.  If keeping the content at that level of difficulty meant that PoTime Knights, and you made a serious point of it being only PoTime Knights, needed mini-defensive to keep the challenge at that level, you were willing to see that happen.  When I asked you about the rest of the Knights in the game other than the PoTime Knights, your paraphrased response was in essence, to hell with them.<br />
<br />
And yet now you'd have us believe that with regards to the rest of the non-raiders in the game you're not taking a &quot;to hell with them&quot; stand?  That you in fact are capable of standing back and impartially evaluating their situation and have properly and fairly concluded that even though non-raiders are staying away from GoD in droves, that has nothing to do with how well they can do there, but in fact they're under a mistaken impression regarding the difficulty involved?  That's pretty incredible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">You know, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that I think its pretty darned arrogant to think that GoD isn't as difficult as the general EQ populace think it is. Are the people advocating GoD progression somehow more enlightened than the vast majority of the playerbase? How about LDoN Hards, do you guys really think that players want 8Khp tanks just because its the status quo? Are you so stuck on yourselves that you can actually believe that you are right whereas hundreds, no thousands, of other players say otherwise. The vast majority of players don't do GoD or LDoN hards without serious tank because they &quot;heard it from a friend that it is hard&quot;, they know it's hard.<br />
<br />
Ignore it if you wish, but I'm tired of tanks having to take up the slack for the other classes in the gear department. Thats a huge part of our problem. People want overgeared tanks because they can slack off. Take a look at a random pickup groups gear and tell me that 9 times out of 10 the tank's gear doesn't totally blow the support classes gear away. I can say this, because I know how it is. I've played my druid much longer than I've played my warrior. Casters take a look at one stat and max it out and really, they are mostly effective by doing that. However, I tihnk thats a major problem here. Non-tanks don't push their character as far as they should and expect the tank to make up for it.<br />
<br />
I say this for one reason. SOE designs content partly with the players gear in mind. This is the whole group's gear in mind, not just the person getting hit or the melees expected weapon ratios. Do us all a favor and go start a random pickup group for a hard LDoN. Take a random sampling of players lfg and invite them, and inspect them. Do a quick estimate as to their gear level and then take appropriate peices of gear to match yourslef up roughly with your groups average gear level.<br />
<br />
Do your LDoN, hell do a few just to make sure, and come back and tell me that you passes every one of the adventures in 30 minutes or less and that they cleric was nuking and meleeing the whole time. The reason why peope don't flock to GoD or grind Hard LDoN is because they both require each and every player in the group to be adequately geared and AAed. Thats something that's just not happening with the vast majority of non-tanks.<br />
<br />
Really guys, there's a reason why joe casualtank can't get anything done. It's because his supporting cast isn't even performing on the stage as him/her. Now tell me, how do you fix that?</div></div><hr />

Raiding warriors from these forums have already proved your claims that the content was retuned and made easier false. According to these raiders, it sounds like the trash in the trials has been ramped up, respawn has been increased, and charm efficiency has been decreased. Stuff that used to hit for 300 now hits for 900+. According to DPS parsings, the slowed trash mobs in Tipt have 780 DPS, significantly higher than before. The trash frequently hits for 1.3K and there are far more yellow mobs now. The boss was slowable before and he's slowable now; the only difference is that some warriors post they cannot use defensive or furious. The resounding conclusions from posters on these forums is that Tipt is harder now then it was when you did it.<br />
<br />
But I don't need to hear about your or others' opinions of Tipt.  I've done Tipt both before and after the changes. I've experienced the content and the supposed &quot;changes&quot; with my own eyes. I didn't see any difference, except that respawn is indeed faster and there are more even and yellow-con mobs. I know that EP/Time geared tanks are dying one-rounded and I know that EP/Time geared groups are failing to these trials daily. <br />

In other words, I do not believe your statements that the content was returned.

SoE assured players that they were adjusting content (numerous players have reported noticing changes) to make it appropropriately challanging to all three plate tanks.<br />

On PoN the results of the changes (apparently their experiances convinced them that in fact changes had occured) was rather hotly debated for a bit.<br />

that changes weren't made<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let me explain why YOU are wrong.<br />
<br />
Never in the history of GoD were the mobs in Vxed and Tipt &quot;300 hitters&quot;, that's nonsense.  The day I went in (2nd day of GoD), they were hitting upwards of 1300ish, and furthermore they had significantly higher atk than they do now (meaning they hit for max FAR more often).   <br />
<br />
Slowed trash mobs in Tipt and Vxed are NOT hitting for 790DPS.  I'm sorry, that's ALSO completely inaccurate.   Tqiv Araxt the Enraged (demiboss in Uqua) does 780DPS and uses a multi cleric heal rotation.  Avatar of War does 710 DPS.    Slowed trash in Tipt and Vxed isnt' doing 790 DPS.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I've done the content both before the content changes AND after.  They're not even in the same ballpark as they used to be.    <br />
<br />
Another thing:   <br />
<br />
It takes HALF the kills in Vxed than it used to, the killcount used to be 100, it's now 50.   <br />
<br />
Every named that used to flat out REQUIRE two clerics spamming at full speed using defensive, now can be healed by a single cleric without using a disc at all.  (Chavoor the Trickster, Kyv Hunter, Crag Mama, etc).  <br />
<br />
You claim you experienced the content before and after the changes... you experienced them *as an enchanter* before the changes, how have you experienced them after?   <br />
<br />
Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru was NEVER slowable before, that's crazy, he's slowable now.<br />
<br />
There isnt' a mob that can one round a time geared tank in Tipt OR Vxed.  Your exaggeration knows no bounds.   It's simply not possible.   <br />
<br />
Spawn times I don't know about because I don't worry about spawn times.  All you have to do is stop at the non spawning areas (Cragmama, Undead) and pull respawn then move.<br />
<br />
The icing on the cake with your levels of exaggeration is this:   You claim in one breath that mobs are hitting around 4 times as hard, yet you claim that &quot;charm efficiency has gone down&quot;.  Those two statements cannot be reconciled.</div></div><hr />

95 days played, easy to explain. since this character was a re-roll for a better race and stats that cut off my old time, but an advantage was that I already had level 37 warrior gear to put on my new toon and rocket back up so all the time I spent in EC tunnle wheeling and dealing blackend chainmail and rygor was not on my new toon, all my selling from that time on was done on a mule, not my main acount.<br />

&quot;He does not understand why high level guilds might flags eachother's members for content they've each done, but not random people that give them a tell.&quot; Sure I understand pal, GREED is the issue here as you guys dont want to share your ball, even if you moved on from the EP's months ago, it's still your toy and your mom(sony) is going to have to force you to donate it to goodwill (non raiders) at some point.<br />

random tell? I send the tells while I sit in tactics waiting for a group some days, I send the tells not them damnit.<br />

They are in bed togeather to reduce competition for contested spawns, the only reason they help each other is so they dont end up fighting, it is also the reason they do not let people in non-ep guilds get in, because they are no threat.<br />

Thanks BB gotta get off my ass and get something snare equipped for the warrior. Have always boxed a snarer or rooter and its not enough any more.

Got on my pally, he just sits underneath my chanter which kills my reaction time. Warrior has better things to get (WA, Sturdy, speed5, dps, etc.) Plus I usually use runners as a pull strategy in easy LDoNs in all but Tak/Guk. The runner has a tendency to pull everything in front of you continuously if you can kill fast enough and assuming he has no way to path back to his spawn point (i.e. not through me) and cant gate. Its great sweeping forwardand having the mobs come to me, especially when moving/pulling/looting are my weaknesses in a 6box.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">On my server, we have an interesting method of handling backflags.  It usually only occurs with the Elemental gods, but every couple of weeks all the time guilds basically go &quot;Hey, it's time to kill X, send whoever, we're gonna massively destroy these things this week, if you've beaten these things, then send your people and they can get their flags&quot;.   The thing is, we will NOT under any circumstance power people through who haven't done the content, that's not what it's about. *emphasis mine   <br />
<br />
The same thing would happen in the lower planes if this occurred.  There would be a prerequisite to your guild having passed the content before being able to join, and the guilds would hose the content without blinking an eye.<br />
<br />
I want to address your point that I highlighted because you are in fact doing what you say you won't do.<br />
<br />
Guilds have a separate identity from individuals in this game. Individuals come and go within guilds. That's why you have to backflag, because the flagged individuals quit, ebayed, switched mains or whatever other reason there might be. <br />
<br />
The new individuals you recruit to replace the old ones haven't done the content yet or they wouldn't need to be backflagged. You are powering them through content they haven't proven they can defeat. <br />
 <br />
You do this to preserve the status quo for your guild without having to redo content that becomes easier and easier everytime you do it. You pay lip service to a set standard that you violate every time you do it. It doesn't even matter that you limit it to the elemental gods. The guilds one tier below you in progression do the same thing, deny individuals a space on their raids for flags unless they are a recruit being backflagged. <br />
<br />
I don't care about determining the rightness or wrongness of such an approach but don't claim you aren't doing something you really are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">As for the RZ talk, I cannot know how to address it.  I've asked Brutul for his numbers, as he was the one with the example of killing Pyro with few people and without elemental gear.  In my experience, the RZ script is fundamentally different from the typical minis you find in the planes and it requires significantly more people.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm not keeping up with threads that close anymore, but RZ with 18 won't happen for a long time, level 70 or not.  RZTW is an inherently zergish fight.  It's all about getting him dead before you are completely overwhelmed by the adds, and a small group trying to do him are gonna take a long time to kill him, and the adds will become unmanageable long before you can grind through his hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Never in the history of GoD were the mobs in Vxed and Tipt &quot;300 hitters&quot;, that's nonsense. The day I went in (2nd day of GoD), they were hitting upwards of 1300ish, and furthermore they had significantly higher atk than they do now (meaning they hit for max FAR more often).<br />
<br />
Slowed trash mobs in Tipt and Vxed are NOT hitting for 790DPS. I'm sorry, that's ALSO completely inaccurate. Tqiv Araxt the Enraged (demiboss in Uqua) does 780DPS and uses a multi cleric heal rotation. Avatar of War does 710 DPS. Slowed trash in Tipt and Vxed isnt' doing 790 DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that I'm geared for tipt or anything, but I've attempted it a few times. Once after the first &quot;retune&quot;, and twice after the defensive nerf. I can't speak for initial release tipt. <br />
<br />
All I'm trying to say is Tipt is DAMN hard, but even at 1400 buffed AC and no pet, and with cleric+shaman healers only, in pre-nerf tipt I was able to make it to the cragbeast event. Thats not to say they were 300 hitters, I saw PLENTY of 1100+ hits. Post-nerf with 2 clerics we got munched several times before even getting to the bridge. I've gotta guess the atk is back up near where it was initially.<br />
<br />
Pre-nerf, I only had perhaps 2/50 mobs doing over 400 dps. Post nerf I parsed several hasted hynids at over 400 dps (even spending 80% of the fight slowed) and ones that never got slowed at 800 dps before they munched us.<br />
<br />
Fact is, IMO, if they were going to nerf anything in tipt it should have been pets. I believe the % of &gt;lvl 64 mobs is higher now, but I didn't actually attempt to count them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">A lot of stuff in GoD got tuned down.  Ferubi is way easier that it was for sure.  Vxed takes only half as many mobs now (makes it shorter, not easier) and the Tipt Boss is slowable and gimped so he doesn't require defensive anymore.  I don't know what the Tipt trash was like before the revamp, I've heard people say it's harder than before and easier than before.  My guess would be it is probably the same hehe, but it's pretty hardcore now.  With 10,000 hps and 1850 AC I need 2 healers (cleric and druid) and I didn't get CH'd at all the time we did it.  Now the cleric I was with really likes SL, and I imagine she could have CH'd at least part of the time, but I was basically getting spam healed to stay alive on the yellow cons.  Those things tear ass.  I should add we had a bard slower and no charm pet, but I found Tipt yellow-cons pretty darn hard as an EP-geared tank, and we failed right before the riddler, although it was to a ill-timed respawn and not that it was just too hard for us.  <br />
<br />
I personally have to take it with a grain of salt when raiders that did Tipt pre-nerf and then went and farmed gear in Qvic for a couple months come back and say it's easier now, but I didn't do it pre-nerf so I can't really comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">Ignore it if you wish, but I'm tired of tanks having to take up the slack for the other classes in the gear department. Thats a huge part of our problem. People want overgeared tanks because they can slack off. Take a look at a random pickup groups gear and tell me that 9 times out of 10 the tank's gear doesn't totally blow the support classes gear away. I can say this, because I know how it is. I've played my druid much longer than I've played my warrior. Casters take a look at one stat and max it out and really, they are mostly effective by doing that. However, I tihnk thats a major problem here. Non-tanks don't push their character as far as they should and expect the tank to make up for it.<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
Really guys, there's a reason why joe casualtank can't get anything done. It's because his supporting cast isn't even performing on the stage as him/her. Now tell me, how do you fix that?<br />
<br />
<br />
This right here is the fundamental issue in my opinion. After some pick-up group gets a tank like battleblade off LFG, who is able to pull them through a hard ldon even though they are woefully unprepared, the all think they're equipped for hard ldons, and will continue to try them, but won't pick a tank like myself (who wins LOTS of hard ldons) because they think they think &quot;deserve&quot; a tank 3-4 &quot;gear progressions&quot; ahead of themselves or some shit.<br />
<br />
This same applies to tougher stuff like Tipt. Practically every class except warriors has a shot at getting a Tipt group with 1/2 my aa or gear, because they bring utility thats needed to get through the event. OTOH, I'm still lightyears from being able to win consistently, and any group that attempts to drag me through is basically bringing a dead weight.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, we warriors MUST stick together on this. There are threads on this board routinely discouraging people from attempting GoD without Ele+ gear, discouraging people from trying hard ldons without 8k+ hp and full defensive AA, and saying you need 6k/1500 unbuffed to tank in BoT. Thats complete bullshit. <br />
<br />
Several of you (Frodlin and Phantron come to mind particularly) have been VERY supportive of the &quot;just go out and try&quot; mentality, but we need more on board. Those of us that need pick-up players to group with need the mentality of our prospective groupmates to change. Everybody needs to be ready to pull their weight in a group, instead of expecting to have a huge tank so they can afk through every group or event.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to suggest here, but I guess pointing out to your gimp groupmates just how gimpy they are when they're thinking they're the shit because they managed to win Tipt with you or whatever else might be a start.</div></div><hr />

There are trends that have always existed, but I'm not sure how they play out. (please don't respond with stuff like arrogant).<br />
<br />
Very very top end players (much closer to the top than me) have always out of bordom or because they are after some short term goal or helping with an Epic, &quot;go slumming&quot; and end up tiers lower than they should be ocassionally. <br />
<br />
When things like LDoN didn't exist, then we don't &quot;compete&quot; and yesterday's Sebilis peeps or today's trying like mad to buy Ornate molds and patterns crowd didn't see high level players except when they were on their way to something uber. I know because I saw them march by me on the way to Trak or ToV and I was determined to join the parade.<br />
<br />
Sure such things divide players, but at the same time you don't have PoTime+ Warriors taking spots from BoT/Ssra/Droga Warriors.<br />
<br />
Why in the world should I do an LDoN and take someone's spot? It's augs and Adventurer Stone. They made LDoN into Aug Central and while augs sure do drop in GoD there are a LOT of aug slots. Besides there's The Stone to plump up. My Stone should have been done long ago but they wanted LDon to be an Everlasting Gobstopper. I left Sebilis right away when better became available to me and I didn't look back - not once.<br />
<br />
Casual players should not only be annoyed that they are rats in the LDoN Maze, but they should be wondering wth is a PoTime+ player doing there.<br />
<br />
GoD should have engaged me so firmly that I got bound in Nedaria. But it didn't, and I'm not.<br />

Another problem is the level cap as much as anything. A Cleric or Enchanter in lesser equipment with all their spells is effective at higher tiers than their progression comtemporaries.<br />

The point I'm trying to make is that we need to be more united about not buying the bullshit wrt how big of a tank you have to be to handle event x. This is exactly why a lot of us feel cramped wrt to upgrades. A time geared wizard has the same spells a 65 0AA wizard has.

<br />
As the owner of a wizard approaching 7K mana, 350+AA, and capped crit skills and 30-35% minimum focus in each type I have to disagree with the example. I blow the socks off a 65 0AA wizard. They dont crit for 6-8K routinely (without GoD spells too). That being said the warrior position is clearly the least forgiving of mediocrity from a gear/AA prospective. You tend to be geared or not and only some combination of luck and skill can hope to compensate for it.<br />
<br />
I wholly agree with the hp/ac question. I fortunately dont get asked not only because I tend to run with people of lower gear but also because if they dont recognize the DB then they want it linked. When I am running my other guys and he is not out I dont let hp/ac get into the debate. I force the grp to take a reasonable (defined more by AA then hp) tank. Got AoE taunt and most of your dfensive AAs done and got droga weps augged then fine by me. Make me pull my weight as a shammy or a cleric too. But will I go along with a 5k buffed tank with an inferior (i.e. worse than droga) aggro setup on a hard LDoN. Nope. Waste of all of our time, like it would be me soloing RZ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">Raiding warriors from these forums have already proved your claims that the content was retuned and made easier false. According to these raiders, it sounds like the trash in the trials has been ramped up, respawn has been increased, and charm efficiency has been decreased. Stuff that used to hit for 300 now hits for 900+. According to DPS parsings, the slowed trash mobs in Tipt have 780 DPS, significantly higher than before. The trash frequently hits for 1.3K and there are far more yellow mobs now. The boss was slowable before and he's slowable now; the only difference is that some warriors post they cannot use defensive or furious. The resounding conclusions from posters on these forums is that Tipt is harder now then it was when you did it.<br />
<br />
But I don't need to hear about your or others' opinions of Tipt.  I've done Tipt both before and after the changes. I've experienced the content and the supposed &quot;changes&quot; with my own eyes. I didn't see any difference, except that respawn is indeed faster and there are more even and yellow-con mobs. I know that EP/Time geared tanks are dying one-rounded and I know that EP/Time geared groups are failing to these trials daily. <br />
<br />
In other words, I do not believe your statements that the content was returned.  I do not believe them both because in my experience that is not true and because we have multi-page threads on these forums where raiders are talking about the zones being MORE DIFFICULT not less difficult.   I really don't undertsand why there is a discrepancy here and I'd like to get to the bottom of it because frankly I'm tired of you posting on these forums that the content was made easier when it just doesn't appear to be the case.<br />
<br />
You've not done tipt before the changes. You wouldn't even get past the first mob.  Before the changes they hit for 1.3+ too, and they did it nearly every hit with over 2200ac.  They toned that down now, yes they still hit for a lot, but not nearly as often, and they said that in a patch. By the way, the trash mobs couldn't 1-round a tank because they didn't hit hard enough. Also, pre-patch, the boss was unslowable.<br />
<br />
Tipt is not harder, it's easier. Although I have not done the newest versions of tipt, I'm developing this conclusion by what you've said.  (The mobs have less attack and the boss is slowable)<br />
<br />
ps. What the fuck in tipt/vxed ever hit for 300?<br />

It's about add management, period.  7 waves at 7 mobs/wave = 49 mobs = not outside the realm of manageability at all.  That is no different from bard PBAE-kiting 50 mobs at a time in HOH before the HOH nerf, except for the run speed, but the run speed issue is already mitigated by a 5-minute Selo's icon.  Once a strategy for managing the adds becomes widely understood, then the overall encounter will become on par with LMM in overall difficulty, and any group that's capable of killing EP mold droppers will be beating it, regardless of size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">I went through tipt last night and it felt like the mobs had been nerfed to just above hard ldon standards.We had no pet,but,this time I asked the chanter to annul everything on incoming before malo/slow.Did they change it again last couple days or was it just the annul?Even with no pet cleric mana was easy for steady pulls and I was pulin...thats usually bad hehe. :)<br />
<br />
PS all warriors need to ldon because of augs.Hate augs are the best things to come down the pipe gear wise in a long time imo.Hp/ac augs are easier and more predictably got in ldon for many warriors than in god still as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know about tipt since I haven't done it since the tune, but I'd imagine the annul could be making the difference.  In the Ikkinz trials annul on incoming makes a huge difference. I have no proof, and it doesn't really make sense, but it seems that dispelling any haste before slowing GoD mobs actually makes them slower than just slowing them without dispelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u190"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p190">Now let me explain why YOU are wrong.<br />
<br />
Never in the history of GoD were the mobs in Vxed and Tipt &quot;300 hitters&quot;, that's nonsense.  The day I went in (2nd day of GoD), they were hitting upwards of 1300ish, and furthermore they had significantly higher atk than they do now (meaning they hit for max FAR more often).   <br />
<br />
Slowed trash mobs in Tipt and Vxed are NOT hitting for 790DPS.  I'm sorry, that's ALSO completely inaccurate.   Tqiv Araxt the Enraged (demiboss in Uqua) does 780DPS and uses a multi cleric heal rotation.  Avatar of War does 710 DPS.    Slowed trash in Tipt and Vxed isnt' doing 790 DPS.   <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I've done the content both before the content changes AND after.  They're not even in the same ballpark as they used to be.    <br />
<br />
Another thing:   <br />
<br />
It takes HALF the kills in Vxed than it used to, the killcount used to be 100, it's now 50.   <br />
<br />
Every named that used to flat out REQUIRE two clerics spamming at full speed using defensive, now can be healed by a single cleric without using a disc at all.  (Chavoor the Trickster, Kyv Hunter, Crag Mama, etc).  <br />
<br />
You claim you experienced the content before and after the changes... you experienced them *as an enchanter* before the changes, how have you experienced them after?   <br />
<br />
Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru was NEVER slowable before, that's crazy, he's slowable now.<br />
<br />
There isnt' a mob that can one round a time geared tank in Tipt OR Vxed.  Your exaggeration knows no bounds.   It's simply not possible.   <br />
<br />
Spawn times I don't know about because I don't worry about spawn times.  All you have to do is stop at the non spawning areas (Cragmama, Undead) and pull respawn then move.<br />
<br />
The icing on the cake with your levels of exaggeration is this:   You claim in one breath that mobs are hitting around 4 times as hard, yet you claim that &quot;charm efficiency has gone down&quot;.  Those two statements cannot be reconciled.<br />
<br />
MY exaggeration knows no bounds?  Listen, I didn't post in the now 6-page thread by raiders debating the difficulty of Tipt.  Don't bring your exaggeration bullshit to my front door.  I was QUOTING raiders from these forums on the issue.  RAIDERS were the ones talking about typical hits of 300 turning to typical hits of 900+.  And the consensus from my friends is not in fact that the trash has been ramped up.  In my own personal opinion, which I stated originally, the trash has not really changed at all.  It has reverted to its former glory of 1200+ hitting mobs.  The problem is that the trash is more often than not yellow or white, where once it was blue. <br />
<br />
What do you mean charm versus trash can't be reconciled.  You aren't a chanter or you'd have noticed that there are massive amount of yellow and even con mobs in Tipt and Vxed and you'd have deduced that such a fact means it's increasingly difficult to find a mob to charm.  I've actually had to take a stonemite 3/4 of the way through as a pet because there were NO blue-con pookas or pookys.  That was simply UNHEARD of after release.  <br />
<br />
You are blind or you would have known that Heartstrike has ALWAYS been slightly slowable.  He was slightly slowable before and he's slightly slowable now.  I don't need to argue this with you.  Take it up with a chanter or a shaman (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20161&amp;highlight=tipt+slowable) or a chanter.  Oh, wait, I am a chanter and I'm telling you he was always slowable.  If your guild was too fucking stupid to slow him, or never needed to because they glided through on the back of chanter charm, that isnt' my problem.  Know the facts before you question credibility. <br />
<br />
From my standpoint, yes, I viewed the changes before and after as a chanter, with a Time SK tanking (and either a warrior or Ranger taking the named) and with a warrior in Time gear.  From my perspective, which is watching the tank's health decrease and going &quot;oh shit&quot; when the tank, either warrior or SK, is one-rounded, I see EXACTLY the same result before and after the changes.  I have BEEN in the groups where the warrior was one-rounded so don't even bother telling me about my exaggeration.  I have SEEN that Vxed and Tipt are stacked with yellow and even con mobs.  I'm not sure if you have honestly had that different of an experience (are you actually saying the mobs are the same percentage of blue-con in your trials?) or if you are just so far removed from the content now. <br />
<br />
Brutul talked about how brutal the changes are and how little things have changed; Phatron suggested that YOU were exaggerating the ease of the mobs and he specifically called you out on the bogus &quot;average&quot;  DPS numbers YOU were trying to pawn off on us because they include caster mobs.  Respected warriors here disagree with you.  So don't talk to me of my exaggeration knowing no bounds.   In my personal opinion, you have an agenda here (SHOW THEM POOR SOULS THE LIGHT, FRODLIN, AMEN!) and it benefits your agenda to convince the masses that Tipt, in particular, is doable by pre-elemental bazaar and LDoN-geared tanks because that makes KodTaz doable.   Maybe it's that you lack imagination to put yourself in our shoes or maybe it's that you just discredit everything the respected warriors in this thread have stated, and the massees of warriors in the Arena have stated.  <br />
<br />
But next time you feel like discrediting me, I'll kindly ask that you not fucking call me a liar again.  It's fucking disrepectful.  Especially when the shit you are calling me a liar about (Heartstriker being slowable for one) is so clearly confirmable by you.  What a goddamn prick. <br />
<br />
Niafix, I'm not going to respond to your post separately because is parroted Frodlin.  But I will confirm that I have personally done these trials before and after the changes.  The fact that I watched the health drop from the group meter versus the player meter means very little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">You've not done tipt before the changes. You wouldn't even get past the first mob.  Before the changes they hit for 1.3+ too, and they did it nearly every hit with over 2200ac.  They toned that down now, yes they still hit for a lot, but not nearly as often, and they said that in a patch. By the way, the trash mobs couldn't 1-round a tank because they didn't hit hard enough. Also, pre-patch, the boss was unslowable.<br />
<br />
Tipt is not harder, it's easier. Although I have not done the newest versions of tipt, I'm developing this conclusion by what you've said.  (The mobs have less attack and the boss is slowable)<br />
<br />
ps. What the fuck in tipt/vxed ever hit for 300?<br />

<br />
I think you make two separate points here.  <br />
<br />
First, you ask why I think non raiders should get powered through flag mobs.  Maybe you were responding to something that I literally have missed in this 70-page thread.  But if you think this is what I am advocating or what I think the majority of people here are advocating, then I don't think we are on the same page at all.  My primary suggestion has not been to open up the elemental planes.  My primary suggestion has been to permit players to access the elemental plane content via alt-key quests, as was done with Tiers1-3.   Sony could impliment a separate quest for each zone, could make it as difficult and time-consuming as they feel is necessary, but make it so that ultimately it IS doable with a single group.  Now maybe you think that is &quot;powered through&quot; ... I actually feel that quests are easily tuned for difficulty, easily designed to require players experience the depth of the game, and should be desired as we are, after all, playing everQuest.   I don't believe I'm asking for a handout; I'm asking that the progression model be be turned upright again.  It's one thing to hide raid content behind a raid encounter; it's something else entirely to hide group content and small-group content behind a raid encounter. <br />
<br />
Second, you brought up the issue of raid versus group priority to spots.  This is not a new thing.  Have you never been in the basement of permafrost when someone started a Vox raid?  Never moved aside in Chardok for a raid to get to the royals?  Never farmed or exped in the Kael arena when a raid came through to pull Vindi or AoW?  Never been hunting in Umbral when someone pulled Giraffe or Rumble?  Never been in the POTactics pit when someone spawned RZ?  I have on several occassions, through each and ever expansion.  What you describe is nothing different.  Moreover, it wreaks of the same &quot;protect the raiders&quot; that I so despise from BB's posts.  Raiders need no protection and I think most of them would scroff at the idea that someone feels they should.  Raiders have been well able to progress when such issues were in play and I see no reason why that concept should change.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could zerg some ep targets given the fire power,but, zergin rztw will often teach humility.You have to control his adds or rely on luck and speed of burn.Dps helps yeah,Tank healing is easy as is avoiding his only trick ...ae ramp.The ep's are filled with with differant strength targets.A few are easier many are harder.It's not easy normally to find a lot of targets unless ep's dont have many raid guilds in them...certainly picking and choosing might not be easy.Rztw is a good place to start imo and you won't need a beefy tank on him unlike a lot of ep targets with a small force.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've already discussed this with Sass quite extensively.  She ultimately agreed that there are far less difficult encounters in the EPs than RZ.  Accordingly, I don't feel the normal progression model is upheld with the RZ --&gt; Pyro ladder here.  I don't see how RZ is a good place to start or to learn when my targets in the planes would be the numerous mobs I already identified in prior posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">I wasn't talking about zerging as in having no strats or organization, but RZTW gets exponentially more difficult as time passes, so the encounter is inherently difficult to do with low numbers, unlike EP minis who have no adds and can be killed by anyone that can maintain a CH chain on a tank for the amount of time it takes to kill them.  It's not RZtW himself, but the massive number of adds you will have to deal with if you kill him slowly.  I don't care how good your kiters are, they are not going to be able to keep aggro off of your CH chain and stay alive with 100 mobs running around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u196"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p196">Well ,Vig I wasn't replying with your posts particularrily in mind.Please remember there are many people here advocating differant things in differant proportion.I have seen minor problems with non guilded ep flagged folks already in xp groups at raid pull spots.As guilds normally zone into ep's to do buisness it's a contrary atmosphere with a greater focus on this kind of problem imo ...at least in present eq.I don't want ep's to remain flagged just to hold xp ground,ts items and drops,or any other selfish reason.We are almost done in ep's and now with 5 or 6 other guilds there it's hard to find targets at all.Soon we will come back only for backflagging or the occaisonal raid.I don't xp in ep's hardly at all anymore.GOD is better.I wear nothing form xp groupage in ep's.I am normally relatively broke because I don't farm stuff often and have never farmed ts stuff for profit.<br />
<br />
I want future ep guilds to be able to raid in a similiar environment that I was able to.I want eq to show some integrity and not constantly retune the game to make old stuff that many many players went through easier.I wish their wasn't going to be level 70 soon because we will probably be still in time and see the advantage of 5 levels on quarm that past raiders didn't have. :(  A bloody quest that has been a significant part of progression for so many people shouldn't be undermined.When you can beat RZTW you will probably be able to handle yourself well in ep raid settings,because it forces some use of tactics and cohesion outside of the immediate control of leadership.It relys heavily on teamwork for an encounter of that level.People here have argued for getting powered through the rztw encounter and it being dismissed as a requirement  altogeather.<br />
<br />
They should produce more content for groups to use for progression besides just god imo.The world shouldn't revolve around GOD,but, it is a step in the right direction.I would say most raiders would say forget it.We did it ..it's there to do you do it.Thats the game.I am for alternative paths though and more emphasis on the non raid game.<br />
<br />
PS.It's possible i am beggining to cross this thread with it's sister there has the enormous post count has rendered me effectively dizzy.Yeah Brutul I agree that dps makes rztw a lot easier.When we did him with lower numbers we used more cod pets .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u197"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p197">MY exaggeration knows no bounds?

It has reverted to its former glory of 1200+ hitting mobs. The problem is that the trash is more often than not yellow or white, where once it was blue. <br />
<br />
So let me see if I got this straight, you were quoting a position that you didn't agree with to &quot;butress&quot; your position?   Why would you use a position that you KNOW is false, or SUSPECT is false to support your &quot;woe is me&quot; position?   I would agree that there's more level variation in the mobs (more white/yellow mobs), that was done to give an exp bonus, but the base stats of the mobs has been toned down.   The shit that was tearing through people at 1300+ max hit almost every time was blue.   They toned it ALL down, then gave a lot of it a level increase.   This didnt' make it harder, the atk is STILL significantly lower on even the yellow con mobs than the atk was on blue cons early on.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you mean charm versus trash can't be reconciled. <br />
<br />
No, you dont' understand.   Charm vs trash cannot be &quot;less efficient&quot; if mobs hit for up to 4 times the amount they used to.   For the same mana, you would have 4 times the damage output, making it the biggest efficiency boost in the history of Everquest.<br />
<br />
<br />
You aren't a chanter or you'd have noticed that there are massive amount of yellow and even con mobs in Tipt and Vxed and you'd have deduced that such a fact means it's increasingly difficult to find a mob to charm. I've actually had to take a stonemite 3/4 of the way through as a pet because there were NO blue-con pookas or pookys. That was simply UNHEARD of after release. <br />
<br />
Holy shit hahaha.    One of the first 4 mobs in EVERY SINGLE instance of Vxed/Tipt is charmable.   You're fixated on pookas is your problem.  You were waiting for the one little blue con pooka across the bridge at the dam and it's randomized in level now and assume your charms are 'less efficient'.    Hynids, Crags, Pookas are ALL charmable and ALL do tremendous DPS.   I cant' even imagine someone charming a mite and not charming one of the 400 million blue hynids or crags along the way.    Most enchanters I go with prefer hynids over pookas from the getgo, for reasons that I dont' know about.    Putting all your eggs into the pooka basket is insane.<br />
<br />
You are blind or you would have known that Heartstrike has ALWAYS been slightly slowable. He was slightly slowable before and he's slightly slowable now. I don't need to argue this with you. Take it up with a chanter or a shaman or a chanter. Oh, wait, I am a chanter and I'm telling you he was always slowable. <br />
<br />
Hi, your slows never did a fucking thing, someone would say &quot;slowed&quot; and nothing would change, at MOST it would be mitigated to 5%.   They do now.  There is a noticeable diference in what slows do.    Getting the same message when the mob has been changed *according to SoE*, AND according to players across the board is NOT an indication that it's the same effect.   <br />
<br />
<br />
If your guild was too fucking stupid to slow him, or never needed to because they glided through on the back of chanter charm, that isnt' my problem. Know the facts before you question credibility. <br />
<br />
The credibility of someone who goes through 3/4 of an expedition as an enchanter not knowing they could charm the first blue hynid or crag?  The credibility of someone who references data they suspect is wrong to support their position?<br />
<br />
From my standpoint, yes, I viewed the changes before and after as a chanter, with a Time SK tanking (and either a warrior or Ranger taking the named) and with a warrior in Time gear. From my perspective, which is watching the tank's health decrease and going &quot;oh shit&quot; when the tank, either warrior or SK, is one-rounded, I see EXACTLY the same result before and after the changes. <br />
<br />
So in other words, not based on the collection of data, or even based off of numbers scrolling on your screen, but based on how many times you've said &quot;oh shit&quot; per instance?   Based on watching someone else's health bar which is linked both to the mobs AND to the healers in your group?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have BEEN in the groups where the warrior was one-rounded so don't even bother telling me about my exaggeration. I have SEEN that Vxed and Tipt are stacked with yellow and even con mobs. I'm not sure if you have honestly had that different of an experience (are you actually saying the mobs are the same percentage of blue-con in your trials?) or if you are just so far removed from the content now. <br />
<br />
Hi, let me straighten this out for you:<br />
<br />
Time geared warrior:  11khp buffed<br />
Max damage on Tipt mobs:  1300.    <br />
Max single round melee:   5200<br />
Max Single Round if Chaos Claws procs every single round:  7720<br />
<br />
The MAXIMUM possible single round damage in Tipt is 7720.   Any character with more than 7720hp can NOT be &quot;one rounded&quot;.  It is IMPOSSIBLE, it can NOT happen.    <br />
<br />
<br />
Brutul talked about how brutal the changes are and how little things have changed; Phatron suggested that YOU were exaggerating the ease of the mobs and he specifically called you out on the bogus &quot;average&quot; DPS numbers YOU were trying to pawn off on us because they include caster mobs.<br />
<br />
First, they don't include caster mobs, but that's ok, you can keep believing what you want.   When I do an &quot;average&quot;, I throw out everything that doesn't include routine melee.  The 20 DPS mobs dont' get counted.    The only thing Phantron was right about was that Chaos Claws throws a ringer in to the mix, in that a couple of lucky procs and it can mess things up badly, particularly on Ra`tuks and Kyvs.   <br />
<br />
 Respected warriors here disagree with you. So don't talk to me of my exaggeration knowing no bounds. In my personal opinion, you have an agenda here (SHOW THEM POOR SOULS THE LIGHT, FRODLIN, AMEN!) and it benefits your agenda to convince the masses that Tipt, in particular, is doable by pre-elemental bazaar and LDoN-geared tanks because that makes KodTaz doable. Maybe it's that you lack imagination to put yourself in our shoes or maybe it's that you just discredit everything the respected warriors in this thread have stated, and the massees of warriors in the Arena have stated. <br />
<br />
HAHAHAHA, Just to show how incorrect you are, back in early GoD, I made a claim that I could tank Tipt in Vex Thalish gear.    People scoffed at me, so I went to my bank and did it.  I put all my old gear on, got to 1400AC, 8800HP, and old craptacular weapons and did it.   I succeeded, and this was BEFORE the changes.   I'll be more than happy to do it again.<br />
<br />
But next time you feel like discrediting me, I'll kindly ask that you not fucking call me a liar again. It's fucking disrepectful. Especially when the shit you are calling me a liar about (Heartstriker being slowable for one) is so clearly confirmable by you. What a goddamn prick. <br />
<br />
Ok, as long as next time you don't use data you know isn't correct to support your position, I won't call you a bullshitter.    Getting a slow message is uhh... a fucking stupid way of determining whether the thing is actually causing a difference in a mob's melee damage output.<br />
<br />
My agenda is a lot more simple than you think it is, and no, I don't want bazaar people running into Tipt thinking they can beat Jhiru, that's yet another mislabel of my position (which is a &quot;lie&quot;, only in a nice form).    I've told people OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER again, that there's a LOT of GoD content for them to gain from, and they can eventually get into KT, but theyr'e not gonna run from the Bazaar to Tipt.  They need to go through Barindu, Ferubi, and the Sewers and gear up before going.   I recommended going through LDoN and gearing up first too.<br />
<br />
I want people to be like Haass, and not listen to your drama as an enchanter who can't figure out that you can charm the first blue hynid that comes to camp, and go out and try it for themselves.   The world doesn't begin at Tipt, that's a big barrier, and there's a LOT more before that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Niafix, I'm not going to respond to your post separately because is parroted Frodlin. But I will confirm that I have personally done these trials before and after the changes. The fact that I watched the health drop from the group meter versus the player meter means very little.<br />
<br />
Yeah, because two different 2200AC+ tanks who have been the ones being hit taking the logs both before and after are no match for &quot;I watched the tank's healthbar&quot;.   That can get shelved along with:<br />
<br />
- I had to charm a stonemite because there were no blue pookas<br />
- Slowed tipt trash mobs do more damage output than the Avatar of War<br />
- Even though it costs the same mana, and charm lasts as long, mobs hitting for four times the damage they used to is an &quot;efficiency decrease&quot; (even though they dont')<br />
- Mobs used to hit for 300 average in tipt HAHAHA</div></div><hr />

Frodlin is absolutely right. Whether everyone is complaining everyone that it was too hard or not, it was most definately doable with Bazaar/LDoN equip. I can try to get the magelos of my exact group, but we did it very early on (well before any changes) with LDoN equip. For the first Jhiru fight I was at 9300hp/1700ac. Group make up was war, pal, rng, rog, clr, enc. We used WS and then Furious and no charmed pet. It wasn't pretty, but we won. After that we used pets everytime and it was trivial.<br />
<br />
I'm all for more content for non-raiders and expanding the upgrade paths since that is the way I play myself and there is nothing I would like more than to have the amount of contect raiders have, but to say the EPs need to be opened just so people can do this content is simply untrue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Everyone noz it's untrue. There's never really a justification for converting raid content to group content except through mudflation no matter how much the manufactured argument list is growing.<br />
<br />
There's a contiguous path. Not all mobs are tougher than all of the previous. Not all loot is better than all of the previous. But it does take you through an expansion and allows you to enjoy a variety of challanges and settings. To insist that a NPC guide lead you though it by the hand or it's not there is pretty silly.<br />
<br />
I will say this points out an advantage raiders do have I haven't thought of - in a successful guild, leadership and raid leaders select targets based on what's up that will result in progess. Apparently there ARE some players unable to fill that function on their own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Kerch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">When I came back to EQ, some time around March and April, I had no knowledge or experience with GoD (or LDoN really).  After I logged back in, a few in game friends suggested I try out the two mountain trials with them.  Innocent to public perception of Vxed and Tipt, I merrily followed them through the zones leading to Barindu.  Over the next few days, I succeded in passing both trials.  Tipt, in particular, I beat on my first try.  My group of War (me), Mnk, Shm (boxed by the monk), Drd, Clr, and Brd was able to drag a tank buffed to 8200 hp and 1500 ac through both trials.  <br />
<br />
  I tanked *every* mob, including named, and had a great time doing it.  Perhaps the group was built to compensate for my apparent weakness, but everyone there was roughly at my gear level.  The druid had a charmed pet and alternated between running from the pet when charm broke, and patch healing me.  The monk pulled and used his shaman pretty much only for slowing.  The cleric healed and recast Bulwark of Vie every time I noticed it fell.  The bard was responsible for babysitting what we lovingly called the &quot;Portable Nuke&quot; and did little else.  There were a few deaths, mostly charm related, but things went pretty well.  Between furious and defensive, we killed Jiru with only the monk's death to mourn.  My only real complaint was that Jiru dropped that damn charm instead of one of his bracers.<br />
<br />
  It was only later I found out I was a fool for even daring to try the trials.  I think its a shame that more don't try the expansion out, cause i've had a great time in it so far.  I haven't visited Tipt since the patches changed it, but people who's opinions i trust say it has only gotten easier.  I don't know if you would call me a &quot;Bazaar Warrior&quot;, but I have never seen the Emperor much less any of the Elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u202"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p202">So let me see if I got this straight, you were quoting a position that you didn't agree with to &quot;butress&quot; your position?   Why would you use a position that you KNOW is false, or SUSPECT is false to support your &quot;woe is me&quot; position?   I would agree that there's more level variation in the mobs (more white/yellow mobs), that was done to give an exp bonus, but the base stats of the mobs has been toned down.   The shit that was tearing through people at 1300+ max hit almost every time was blue.   They toned it ALL down, then gave a lot of it a level increase.   This didnt' make it harder, the atk is STILL significantly lower on even the yellow con mobs than the atk was on blue cons early on.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I was responding to a raider with comments from other raiders.  Have you bothered to read that thread?  I don't see you calling the raiders liars.  Yet they are ones saying &quot;the shit was tearing through people at 1300+ max hit.&quot;  You reserve that for me.  <br />
<br />
Yet, if you'll go back and look, all my post was asking for was some clarification.  Who am I to believe?  Do I believe you, who seems only hellbent on insulting me, or do I believe the numerous other raids who have posted on this thread and the Arena thread?  <br />
<br />
Moreover, the conclusion of those other raiders is not contrary to my own.  They conclude that Tipt is really fucking hard, for a time or elemental-geared tank.  I totally agree.  I don't feel the trash has been at all ramped down.  Maybe other parts of GoD have been affected, but I do not feel that Tipt has.  The trash is just as difficult as ever it was in my experience of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
No, you dont' understand.   Charm vs trash cannot be &quot;less efficient&quot; if mobs hit for up to 4 times the amount they used to.   For the same mana, you would have 4 times the damage output, making it the biggest efficiency boost in the history of Everquest.<br />
<br />
Holy shit hahaha.    One of the first 4 mobs in EVERY SINGLE instance of Vxed/Tipt is charmable.   You're fixated on pookas is your problem.  You were waiting for the one little blue con pooka across the bridge at the dam and it's randomized in level now and assume your charms are 'less efficient'.    Hynids, Crags, Pookas are ALL charmable and ALL do tremendous DPS.   I cant' even imagine someone charming a mite and not charming one of the 400 million blue hynids or crags along the way.    Most enchanters I go with prefer hynids over pookas from the getgo, for reasons that I dont' know about.    Putting all your eggs into the pooka basket is insane.<br />
<br />
The credibility of someone who goes through 3/4 of an expedition as an enchanter not knowing they could charm the first blue hynid or crag?  The credibility of someone who references data they suspect is wrong to support their position?<br />
<br />
<br />
The credibilty of someone who makes assumptions is next to nil.  It is nil actually.  You laugh, you insult, you demean and you condescend.  Can't you just answer questions without ad homenim attacks?  I find it disappointing to note that my class correspondent lacks so much class.  <br />
<br />
You mostly come off like a complete ass.   Did I say I didn't know what was and what was not charmable?  But you assume it anyway?  I can't imagine how exactly your chanters call things in your trials.  Pooka and Pooky refers to separte mobs - it was not an unintentional mispelling.  Bugs are stonemites.  Honestly, I didn't know Crags are charmable, but I am told that is because its fucking retarded to charm them - they break charm so often it is simply unadvisable. <br />
<br />
Maybe you haven't experienced this, but I have literally had trials where there is nothing but yellow con mobs up to the bridge, and white con mobs through to the mother.   Maybe you haven't done as many as your class is not as necessary as an enchanter in these trials.  A fact that I find vaguely troubling given I play a warrior as well. <br />
<br />
Charm is most decidedly less efficient when the universe of charm mobs is drastically decreased. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hi, your slows never did a fucking thing, someone would say &quot;slowed&quot; and nothing would change, at MOST it would be mitigated to 5%.   They do now.  There is a noticeable diference in what slows do.    Getting the same message when the mob has been changed *according to SoE*, AND according to players across the board is NOT an indication that it's the same effect.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Hi! So, you mean to say that when you were calling me a liar and telling people I was exaggerating because &quot;Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru was NEVER slowable before, that's crazy, he's slowable now&quot; ... what you REALLY MEANT to say was that he IS slowable, he just mitigates most of it?  Ah, I see. Thank you for the clarification.<br />
<br />
In a very quid pro quo kind of sense, let me inpart some of my own.  He was 17% slowable previously, not 5%.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi, let me straighten this out for you:<br />
<br />
Time geared warrior:  11khp buffed<br />
Max damage on Tipt mobs:  1300.    <br />
Max single round melee:   5200<br />
Max Single Round if Chaos Claws procs every single round:  7720<br />
<br />
The MAXIMUM possible single round damage in Tipt is 7720.   Any character with more than 7720hp can NOT be &quot;one rounded&quot;.  It is IMPOSSIBLE, it can NOT happen.    <br />
[quote]<br />
<br />
You already said hi.  I said hi back.  How many times do you need to introduce yourself? :(  <br />
<br />
I disagree with your extremely techical conclusion.  Mobs can be hasted.  Moreoever, I suspect people use &quot;one-rounded&quot; in a looser sense than, um, a six second tic of the clock.  Basically, I'll dumb it down for you:  I've seen tanks slaughtered before a heal could land.  Now, I supose, rather than insult me you'll insult the healers.  Go ahead. /shrug  I'm getting rather used to that from you.  IT doesn't change the fact that other people in this board and others are reporting one-roundings . <br />
<br />
[quote]<br />
HAHAHAHA, Just to show how incorrect you are, back in early GoD, I made a claim that I could tank Tipt in Vex Thalish gear.    People scoffed at me, so I went to my bank and did it.  I put all my old gear on, got to 1400AC, 8800HP, and old craptacular weapons and did it.   I succeeded, and this was BEFORE the changes.   I'll be more than happy to do it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Condescending laughter, Frodlin?  Thank you.  <br />
<br />
Brutul has already addressed the Vex Thal thing.  He commented that a magelo that I felt honestly demonstrated some of the best gear I had ever seen on a non-raider was below VT quality.  I think you might have to dig a little deeper into your historical bank gear.   I barely break 8800HP with full buffs, which I wouldn't actually have in a six-man group.  Was the rest of your group VT-geared as well?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, as long as next time you don't use data you know isn't correct to support your position, I won't call you a bullshitter.    Getting a slow message is uhh... a fucking stupid way of determining whether the thing is actually causing a difference in a mob's melee damage output.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really?  Wow, someone ought to tell Sony that.  I might suggest, alternatively, that it ought to perhaps logically follow from a message that a mob is slowed that the mob is, um, slowed.   In this instance, as noted above, the mob actually was slowed and there was a difference.  You even admit there was a difference, it is just that your _perception_ of the difference is different from the hard mathematical calculation.  Hm, where I have heard that before....<br />
<br />
<br />
- I had to charm a stonemite because there were no blue pookas<br />
- Slowed tipt trash mobs do more damage output than the Avatar of War<br />
- Even though it costs the same mana, and charm lasts as long, mobs hitting for four times the damage they used to is an &quot;efficiency decrease&quot; (even though they dont')<br />
- Mobs used to hit for 300 average in tipt HAHAHA<br />
<br />
I've addressed this already.  All of it.  I've left this here merely to demonstrate what a complete prick you sound like.  But I'm glad I could get another laugh out of Frodlin.</div></div><hr />

In contrast to your contributions, Frodlin was:<br />
<br />
1. Concerned enough about Warrior issues to apply to be the Warrior Correspondent.<br />
<br />
2. On his own initiative started a thread to collect issues and suggestions from non-raiders and casual players without debate from players that didn't fit that catagory. To be an ombudman for thier issues<br />
<br />
3. Not only made it known the GoD had content for the non-raider/non PoTime+ player, but also all but published a spoiler.<br />
<br />
4. And a 100 things besides - some from the start of this board and many recently.<br />
<br />
In contrast to your contributions, I have proposed or supported (along with others) at various times:<br />
<br />
1. allowing removing augments unharmed from equipment for reuse.<br />
2. allowing the re-sale of AP purchased items back to the vendor.<br />
3. A new LDoN armor set (denied by SoE).<br />
4. Increasing the AP's for successful LDoN missions.<br />
5. Medium difficulty 18-person LDoNs.<br />
6. Opening up ToSoRo with alt-flags so long as it didn't interfer with raid content (make mobs invulnerable if you aren't progression flagged??)<br />

Oh, I completely agree.  The personal stuff is totally getting in the way.  Talk to the class correspondent.  He's practicing his taunt skills. <br />
<br />
Gunnar, I don't know how to believe you here.  The only person I've seen post here about successes in Tipt that is not EP-geared is Fynep.  And I can't tell what she had going into those trials:  I can only see that she is sitting at 8K now.  Aside from Fy, whose current HP are most definitely not what I would all typical pre-elemental, I haven't heard from anyone else.  Frodlin talked about tanking in VT gear (but I can't know what that actually boils down to), but I can't know if that was with an elemental group backing him.  I have no clear examples here.  Haass is going to be the test case maybe?  I don't know.  <br />
<br />
If you can direct me to actual people who are pre-elemental who have beaten this encounter with typical pre-elemental gear (lets say 7k unbuffed, because that is near to what one can get in GoD), then I'd like to hear about it. <br />
<br />
Regardless of what you have to say about GoD content and exactly how doable it is, that doesn't change anything about the fact that PoP content is completely undoable, that raiders advocate skipping an entire expansion in order to &quot;progress.&quot;  I find the concept rather self-contradictory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u206"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p206">Scroll up to Kerch.The fact is the drops that you want from pop that form the gap you speak of come off of raid mobs,however that raid may be formed up.When you can form a raid to get those drops you can form a raid to do rztw.Yeha he's a tougher event than some ep mold droppers so what.You are going to take a raid into the ep's then your raid should do what other raids have had to do.I'm still for more groupable content that drops appropiate loot past ornate tho.I'm also  not saying Tipt isn't a distinct challenge to people used to LDON or easy xp camps it is.This is not intended as a slight to anyone.I was surprised by the differance in difficulty in GOD.It actually makes me happy as a tank with the exception of charm pets being overpowered.The fact is tho a pet easily gotten can tank the majority of the whole thing really,though,to be honest I've never let one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not really sure what you mean by ignoring president and &quot;increasing tortuous contrived evidence.&quot;   I mean, first I didn't produce any evidence and then I did, but it was made up evidence that was conducting tort-like acts.<br />
<br />
I get your point, BB.  Vigdis = Bad.  Frodlin = Gud.  We will never reach any kind of agreement or understand because you cannot step outside of your own narrow universe.  I have the unique perspective of living in both worlds.  I killed Quarm last night on Melcindria; and I tried to kill AoW with a casual guild on Vigdis...unfortunately the &quot;most highly progressed&quot; guild on the server stepped in because they needed RZ helms for their alts. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your loud, insulting, and argumentative posts do not advance rational discusion. You consistantly try to emotionalize a straight forward &quot;issue&quot;.<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Oh no! Now I'm being argumentative in a, um, argument!  Well, shit on me.  My posts have often times directly dealing with the issues at hand.  You refuse to.  Here is a prime example, where I asked you on no less than four separate occassions, to simply respond to the questions but you can't.  Instead, your very next post directed at me is an attack about how I am not advancing rational discussion.  And you probably don't understand how very ironic that is statement is<br />
<br />
<br />
I notice you still didn't address any of my questions. I keep responding to your drivel but you never return the favor. Answer my questions when I ask them or I'm through debating with you. I see no point talking to a wall that can't manage to carry on a two-way conversation. <br />
<br />
You only addressed one of several different fundamental agreement points. I guess you concede the others. In fact, you seem to concede that Sony acknowledged that an alt-key quest was an appropriate alterantive to killing big mobs, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
You seem to be arguing that Sony created some criterea in selecting zones to make accessible. First off I think that is giving Sony too much credit. But aside from that, you are making an assumption here (Sony created some criterea) and I see no basis for it. Moreoever, you haven't identified what presumed criterea Sony might have used. I'd be interested in what possible criterea that could be that would not also embrace the ability to alt-key quest the zone access given Sony had done that elsewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is you who can't seem to respond to rational discussion.  How many times have I asked these same questions?  Yet you can't respond to them.  Not a single one contained a single curse word.  I just wanted to try and reach some kind of middle ground.  Calling me irrational, emotional, loud, insulting, and argumentative does not change the fact that you haven't responded to a single one of my questions directed SPECIFICALLY to you several times in this thread.</div></div><hr />

Um. First off, nice stealth edit to your previous post. But it doesn't change the fact that your &quot;post immediately preceeding&quot; mine was nothing but ad hominem attacks.  There was nothing to refute there as it was purely opinion.  Even though that was the entire substance of the post, I still did respond to each point (that existed at the time that I replied - you since changed it) and questions your insults didn't even make sense.<br />
<br />
But still you have never bothered to respond to my initial questions directed to you.  Ever.  How hard is it?  Apparently, according to you I contribute very little.  Then it shouldn't take a lot of effort to address those questions.  Yet it seems you are expending an awful lot of effort trying to avoid them.<br />
<br />
-Gunnar, I hadn't read Ker's post as it was posted while I was probably posting something here.  That is good news, but it still sounded like he acknowledged that his friends helped him through it and I don't know what their status was.<br />
<br />
-Ky, thanks for helping with this.<br />
<br />
-Everyone, REGARDLESS of the GoD content that does not change the basic fundamental concern here that we are expected to skip PoP content entirely.  Give me a break.  Aside from wanting the upgrades, the point of the game is supposed to be to have new experiences and have fun in new zones.  Why is it so off-base to consider that nonraiders and casuals might like to see those locked zones.  I have a friend right now in the casual guild that I raid with.  He has played since release, but stayed in his current guild.  He joined PUR where available but I think it is no surprise that such raids, even if they have the steam to continue raiding, do not have the depth to kill RZ.  My friend would like to see the planes, if for no other reason than to just SEE them and experience them.</div></div><hr />

Too lazy to find them, even though I directed you to them on no less than five occassions, eh?<br />
<br />
You were right.  Insulting me by suggesting that I might be &quot;found worthy&quot; or the questions might be &quot;found worthy&quot; was obviously going to result in me not re-posting the questions.<br />
<br />
But they remain just as pertinent.  I suggest that if you remove your purposefully insulting prose, I might repost them.   Otherwise, I think it should be easy enough to dig them up.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I am willing to repost them, I just need you to remove the insulting and condescending requisite first. <br />
<br />
Why have this added for debate?  Frodlin's entire point on the casual thread was to remove debate because debate, as we've found in this 70-page thread, does not actually resolve anything.  It just degenerates into raiders versus non raiders (although there have a been a few raiders in these threads who have sided with the non-raider perspective).  Moreover, any debate on the Sony boards is not going to be representative of the playerbase in any event.  There isn't much to be done about that, I recognize (except maybe make a poll during log in).  But many nonraiders and casuals do not care to debate topics on a forum all day.  Probably many raiders don't care to, either. Most people with lives don't care to do it. <br />
<br />
I do think that they should be listed in Frodlin's &quot;casual&quot; recommendations to Sony, but then again I put that on my list within the casual thread.</div></div><hr />

Would you kindly point out where I claimed this. I can certainly asert that IMO someone's post's are trollish - that doesn't mean the Moderators need agree, it's just my opinion.<br />
<br />
I proposed a way the discussion can be resolved rather than anyone continuing to fan the flames. I would expect those interested more at arriving at a ruling than trolling would agree it's a good idea.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
I submit that the following should placed on the SoE Warrior board to determine player responce (unfortunately, I never resolved my ability to post there) and see it if should be added to the Warrior Top Ten list (other non-specific Warrior issues have appeared on that list, and I suspect SoE might respond should this happen):<br />

&quot;Alternate individual non-progression flags should/should not be created for each of the Elemental Planes.&quot;<br />

You're arguing nonsense.   Everyone who's been here *except* you who experienced Tipt/Vxed  early on has said that they were badass, and moreso than they are now.<br />
<br />
You were playing on your raiding enchanter main.   That's another thing... this whole thing is about twinking your warrior with Elemental armor for you.  You're a raider who can't get in on a RZTW kill with your alt warrior and you're mad, because you want to take a mold dropper away from guilds who've earned their way into the place and the macinations in place prevent you.   The fact that your time/GoD geared enchanter can go on these '18 man Pyro kills' (if she's flagged for EP's) is meaningless, you want it for your wariror alt.   So, you set up this whole &quot;Let's help the little guy&quot; when in reality this is about TAKING from people who are BEHIND Blades in progression, it's not about standing up for the little guy, it's about squashing the little guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">Oh, and now Frodlin is the defender of the little guy?  The guy who said that keeping GoD difficulty at release level was worth giving PoTime Knights mini-defensive and to hell with the rest of them?  Somehow, you don't seem as impartial and unbiased about it all as you would like to believe.  Perhaps it's not intentional, but it's there none the less.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">Hey Glatius, <br />
<br />
I'm not impartial OR unbiased, but I'm a realist.    <br />
<br />
I dont' think it's very fair that one guild has gone through all of the hoops required and another group should be able to whine their way into stealing content that the first earned.   Those Elemental guilds that are doing EP content aren't 'big uber guilds', they just worked at what it took to get the job done.   They deserve the mobs they worked their way towards without alts of GoD/Post time guilds hosing them.<br />
<br />
You're CONVINCED that it can't be done, but people are POURING in left and right telling you that your'e wrong.   I'm sorry, Fatalism is out of fashion.   &quot;Woe is me&quot; is discredited.   Look at these quotes Glatius.<br />
<br />
Well I spent a bit of time in Ferubi Just me (A monk) and my Gimp 64 shaman. Was fun. Had to get mobs single and for safety I had mend up and stonestance. (Making it Very slow)<br />
But amazingly I was able to Duo there. ( No deaths) <br />
<br />
<br />
The combination of some LDON, some GOD, some bazaar gear CAN fill out a character very respectively and definitely is enough to be able to kill PA/RI/HS in ikkinz trials now theyve been made into total creampuffs. An appropriate group-build can also farm Kodtaz for nameds in the right spots with ease. If I can 2box a named there with myself and my clericbot, im confident a 6k unbuffed tank can do it with slows and 2 healers<br />
<br />
When I came back to EQ, some time around March and April, I had no knowledge or experience with GoD (or LDoN really). After I logged back in, a few in game friends suggested I try out the two mountain trials with them. Innocent to public perception of Vxed and Tipt, I merrily followed them through the zones leading to Barindu. Over the next few days, I succeded in passing both trials. Tipt, in particular, I beat on my first try. My group of War (me), Mnk, Shm (boxed by the monk), Drd, Clr, and Brd was able to drag a tank buffed to 8200 hp and 1500 ac through both trials. <br />
<br />
I tanked *every* mob, including named, and had a great time doing it. Perhaps the group was built to compensate for my apparent weakness, but everyone there was roughly at my gear level. The druid had a charmed pet and alternated between running from the pet when charm broke, and patch healing me. The monk pulled and used his shaman pretty much only for slowing. The cleric healed and recast Bulwark of Vie every time I noticed it fell. The bard was responsible for babysitting what we lovingly called the &quot;Portable Nuke&quot; and did little else. There were a few deaths, mostly charm related, but things went pretty well. Between furious and defensive, we killed Jiru with only the monk's death to mourn. My only real complaint was that Jiru dropped that damn charm instead of one of his bracers.<br />
<br />
It was only later I found out I was a fool for even daring to try the trials. I think its a shame that more don't try the expansion out, cause i've had a great time in it so far. I haven't visited Tipt since the patches changed it, but people who's opinions i trust say it has only gotten easier. I don't know if you would call me a &quot;Bazaar Warrior&quot;, but I have never seen the Emperor much less any of the Elemental planes.<br />
<br />
There's a shitload more where those came from, and people are just starting to crawl from under the pessimism and &quot;can't do&quot; attitude that you bring and are proving LEFT AND RIGHT that it's wrong.   The shit is doable and it's fun, that's the message that people who are actually GOING there are bringing back.  <br />
<br />
You are going &quot;But but that's not possible&quot; even though you've never been  to the content and have quit the game.    I'm sorry, you have no clue what GoD is like.  <br />
<br />
Success seems to follow those who don't listen to pessimism, and pessimists are rarely successful.   Trying and failing is more successful than avoiding for the fear of failure.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, I haven't seen a single post from anyone saying &quot;I tried GoD and it's not posible for me to do&quot;   Everyone who's tried, particularly recently has gone back for more, and has succeeded.<br />
<br />
If I were trying to make my mind up, I certainly wouldnt' be listening to former EQ players who have never been to the content, or to naysayers who don't know what their limitations are, I'd go try, and see if i could succeed, or if it was at least possible, then I'd make up my own mind.  That's what I'm trying to accomplish here.   I'm TRYING to get people to realize what they're capable of, and they'e capable of a LOT more than they sometimes think they are.   <br />
<br />
People like yourself dont' help matters much, but that's ok, you want to champion the &quot;former EQ players who wouldn't try&quot;, form a coalition or something.   I'll keep bringing people into content they're capable of and they'll thank me for it, even though sometimes I gotta drag em kicking and screaming.</div></div><hr />

 I'll be the first one to agree with that. The problem isn't that I'm not willing to try, it's that no one else is willing to try with me! The guildies I need to bring with me (read: clerics) didn't buy GoD, so that's out. Pickups don't want me, people I know who DO the content don't want me tanking there either, because they figure I don't match up. I can do a great many things, but I have yet to achieve mind control outside of CoH.<br />
<br />
 Even if you aren't talking GoD, Tactics groups? I can tank Tactics, I HAVE tanked Tactics for multiple hours. Perception still &gt;&gt; than reality. Don't convince ME to try the content - convince your friends to try the content WITH ME.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have this incredible bias toward anyone who's a raider.  You assume that just because someone raids, they're condescending, arrogant, and insulting.  Unfortunately that's the best example I've ever seen of the pot calling the kettle black.<br />
<br />
You haven't provided anything useful to any of these arguements - you don't even have experience to back up these arguements.  You're pissed about a game you don't play any more, follow these threads, throw insults at people, and then when someone actually produces something to not only disprove your point, but slam it into the ground, you just yell &quot;TROLL&quot;!<br />

Perhaps you should consider your own actions before being so hasty to apply titles.<br />

<br />
You're actually wrong again Glatius, BB isn't necessarily on &quot;my side&quot;, his position is drastically different from mine.  His position is aimed at maintaining an advantage through raiding, and while I agree to some extent with that position in principle, it's not even what I'm arguing here.<br />
<br />
I'm arguing that all the content is doable, despite what the naysayers say.   I dont' see why some wariror who goes &quot;I have 10khp buffed, and can't imagine it being possible with less&quot; is more smack on than someone who says &quot;I have 10khp unbuffed and it's doable&quot;, other than one is what you WANT to hear, and the other isn't.   The fact is, I took off my armor and dressed down to prove that it was doable.   Others CONFIRMED this as being accurate (non raiding single group people who are in Ikkinz now), yet you dont' want to believe it.  <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to insult you, I'm simply trying to point out that you're wrong.  That's not an insult, it's a matter of fat,  and have no way of knowing how wrong you are.  If you hadn't quit the game, or had tried it out, then you'd have a leg to stand on, but you haven't.   You believe what you choose to believe based on a core set of beliefs, the primary one being that there's some sort of Vendetta against casual or single group players.<br />
<br />
I know damn well what casual players go through, and some of the trials and tribulations of it, but I refuse to accept the &quot;woe is me&quot; approach to anything.   I refuse to accept anyone's notion that it's not possible until they've tried a number of times and ways and cannot succeed.  Not ONE person has reported this happenning yet (With one exception, Graal on PoN with Chavoor the Trickster pre-nerf, and he can now tank Chavoor because of the retuning).   <br />
<br />
On the other hand, reports keep coming in that some monk/shaman are duoing in Ferubi, people who never heard of the pessimism going in beating Vxed/Tipt because they didnt' know they weren't supposed to, people duoing in Qinimi, doing sewers with no cleric.   These arent' failure stories, these are success stories, and I have yet to see ANY failure stories, not a one.<br />
<br />
That's pretty profound Glatius, NO ONE has come here and said that they're unable to do Gates Content having tried.  Look at the Haass thread for god's sake, people over in the same level of gear are telling him exactly what I'm saying here, that it's completely possible.   <br />
<br />
I think my favorite of all the posts there is this one:<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say that the progression path is that short for non-raiders in GoD. My group hasn't been playing much the last 2 months and we are still working on farming bracers from Ikkinz 3 as well as the bosses for their drops. I have yet to see another non-raiding group on CT that is even close to this. I'd say unless you are insanely focused, you will not come close to finishing the single group progression in GoD before OoW is released.<br />
<br />
As for the difficulty and drops, I wouldn't focus on the random drops as much as working through the progression and letting them come as you go. Since the retune, the mobs are not that hard. There was a post above about ferubi tearing apart an elemental geared warrior. This may have been true on release, but they are chumps now. I went there the other day and our chanter kept going LD and I was too lazy to pacify so I'd just pull 2 at a time and tank them both unslowed, and it was no problem at all.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be run around the open zones and pick up any drops from spawnable named that would be upgrades.<br />
<br />
Then head to Ferubi and take a couple trips and at least pick up a 25/25/25 for everyone, and a 15ac for the tanks. There are 2 of each of these augs if you really wanna take some time. You may pick up nice random drops in the process. This is also a good way to get a feel for where you are at. If you can do survive well enough here, then the sewers shouldn't be bad. <br />
<br />
As for group make up, I'd suggest a cleric just for res if nothing else. Nothing like losing someone deep in ferubi or in a trial and having no way to get them back. It's just annoying and easily avoided with a ressing class. Also, if you can get the shaman casting subtlety 3, then you can slow extremely early without much worry. I often box a shaman for my group and I can drop in slow right off the bat and hardly ever pull aggro. That being said, I'd say cleric/shaman over cleric/druid. However, I've never had a bard in the group so I don't know how they do.<br />
<br />
It takes focus and can be frustrating, but there is a lot of great stuff in GoD for single group, and as a fellow hardcore non-raider I'd say it is the best expansion yet for hardcore non-raiders.<br />
<br />
This guy is ROCKING through GoD, and he had an EXTREMELY average gear setup before embarking on the adventure.    <br />
<br />
The simple fact is that GoD is absolutely fantastic for single groups, there is more progress and challenge in GoD that a single group can embark on than ALL of the other expansions combined.  There's a total lack of cockblocking, your progress is ENTIRELY up to you.  Hell, I won't be surprised to hear of Fynepsia reporting that his single group is going after Primals in Yxxta, actually I half expect it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u227"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p227">His position is aimed at maintaining an advantage through raiding,<br />
Stated exactly perfectly right. Glatius, you might listen some to Frodlin he's sometimes wrong but he's never stupid - I'd also be very concerned with what you are incapable of wraping your brain around.<br />
<br />
Very nice post Frodlin. I'm VERY burned out with the group game, but your post was so clearly and obviously true, that I'm going to spend a day grouping in an open zone to see if I can rebuild my enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
BTW - I'm certain that Frodlin is and will be a very dilligent ombudsman for forwarding the concerns and suggestions of casual players.<br />
---------------<br />
The rest of this post is an elaboration of what Frodlin posted about my views. It's offtopic sortof, so don't bother reading it unless you want to know what I really think. <br />
<br />
I believe that the penultimate activity in EQ is raiding. That if SoE would shorten the time to do raids, lower the number of players needed to around 30 for 70% of the raids in the game and have others at 54 and make a few other changes without seriously eroding the experiance it could even be improved. Unfortunately high level semi-cutting edge is tremendously draining. A 6 day a week schedule is overdoing it.<br />
<br />
I would like to see them take a look at the grouping experiance to try to achieve the same results. But both they and players seem to be satisfied with the grind model with a splash of hunting mini-named which are almost always straight up trivial fights with only the MT's ability so survive as a source of complication.<br />
<br />
I believe SoE needs to always keep players capable of shifting between raiding and grouping and encouraging them to do both, while creating MAJOR disincentives (barely sufficient content, serious equipment lag) to grouping only, unless they in fact improve the challange of grouping dramatically.<br />
<br />
I don't like a MMoRPG to find itself being converted into a rather low skill grouping or soloing game and players to be so lazy that they end up inducing SoE to make that shift.<br />
<br />
Unlike Frodlin who is bound by duty, I get to try to lead horses to water (btw, I'm convinced you can make them drink if you hold their heads under firmly enough).<br />
<br />
In that spirit and paraphrasing a true legend, I call to the attention of casual players to advice once offered to Paladins:<br />
Be careful what you ask for, you might get it.<br />
BB</div></div><hr />

I've said what I have to say on the topic and had you trivialize it.  Fine, you think I'm wrong, I got that.  It's perfectly clear.  Lets just sit back and watch how things go down the road.  Since I'm so wrong I'm sure that SoE's subscription figures will hold pretty steady and people won't become disenchanted and leave the game.  After all, they have Frodlin telling them everything is fine, nothing to see here, move along.  The release of OoW is going to be very telling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I can do what I did I just can't see how a decent group can't do better. They'll have more DPS more healing and more cushoin in case bad things happen. I fully expect that such a group will die and wipe once in a while. I almost did.  <br />

The fact that as a monk, with your mitigation disadvantage, you exp'd in Ferubi and didn't die once, nor did your 64 shaman, makes it a success.<br />
<br />
Obviously it wasn't an easy success, but it was a success nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Partha and Brutul seem to have a pretty solid idea of what GoD is all about, Partha's kind of hosed since his normal groups wont' buy it (sadly, based on misinformation), and there's not a lot of pickup groups going, nor is putting 6 random people together going to get anyone very far.  <br />

I thought about PMing you, but this is good advice for any badly undergeared Warior.<br />
<br />
Without being unkind, there are some things you need to reflect on. I'm just going to tell you them without being argumentative and at the same time, not willing to debate them.<br />
<br />
Near the start of PoP, a 5K HP ish unbuffed Warrior was concidered just about at the point where groups wanted them in BoT if they were going to encounter Jord Krigers. That's before the Sturdyness 500HP AA ability and before LDoN equipment and augments. You may have done much more advanced content, but what I told you is true. 7K HP's buffed was concidered average for a BoT tank.<br />
<br />
This should indicate to you just about where you are as an ordinary group tank, much less a cutting-edge content group tank.<br />
<br />
Work out a progression path (there is one - seriously) that gets you each needed piece of equipment that is an upgrade that you can obtain.  Do Sturdyness if you haven't. Put an LDoN aug in every slot if you haven't. Get the LDoN RA BP and legs if you can't find better. Farm items you can obtain in order to sell them to purchase upgrades in the Bazaar if there are any. Do the Loyalist Shield quest if you haven't.<br />
<br />
You are a WARRIOR, a class almost totally defined by it's equipment. It should be your main concern and at level 65 the quality of your equipment should reflect the level of your concern and determination to improve - yours doesn't and it's not SoE's fault, it's yours. SoE isn't a sucker either.<br />

You're arguing nonsense.   Everyone who's been here *except* you who experienced Tipt/Vxed  early on has said that they were badass, and moreso than they are now.<br />
<br />
You were playing on your raiding enchanter main.   That's another thing... this whole thing is about twinking your warrior with Elemental armor for you.  You're a raider who can't get in on a RZTW kill with your alt warrior and you're mad, because you want to take a mold dropper away from guilds who've earned their way into the place and the macinations in place prevent you.   The fact that your time/GoD geared enchanter can go on these '18 man Pyro kills' (if she's flagged for EP's) is meaningless, you want it for your wariror alt.   So, you set up this whole &quot;Let's help the little guy&quot; when in reality this is about TAKING from people who are BEHIND Blades in progression, it's not about standing up for the little guy, it's about squashing the little guy.<br />
<br />
Again with the ignorant assumptions Frodlin.   :p   You sound completely retarded and you lose all credibility when you make assumptions like that.  You are really a wanker, and you must assume that everyone thinks as deviously as you do. <br />
<br />
In fact, Vig is Time flagged (Despite my asking to look at her magelo on two separate occassions, you obviously have not.)  I am more than able to buy Vigdis items with my raiding chanter's DKP.  <br />
<br />
What I WOULD LIKE, however, is to raid in the planes with a close-knit group of friends.  And I cannot do that because Sony has cockblocked it and raiders like you choose to make ignorant assumptions and back the current system because it benefits you.  You cant see past your own 54-person raid. <br />
<br />
You don't understand that and you can never understand that because apparently you lack imagination and you've sold out so completely to a raiding game that you can't comprehend there are people out here who would prefer not to.  Those people are the friends I choose to raid with.  You see, I DID sell out.  The phase1 ring on Vigdis' finger shows that.  But I would like to PLAY THE GAME with people who haven't and I believe that all these hard working non raiders deserve a goddamn chance.</div></div><hr />

Is there an alternate progresison path to raiding- yes<br />

Will they put EP quality gear on ldon merchants- no<br />

Well it seems to me like he got it right on the money.  Calling others raiders and denying that you yourself are a raider is completely dishonest.<br />
<br />
You're a Time leveled character, you didn't get there through alternate single group quests.  What you're wanting is to be able to get your warrior through into the Elementals and skip Rallos Zek - your guild won't do this for you, and you're calling cockblock.<br />

Don't worry, I almost feel bad that your Time guild raid's schedule conflicts with local RZ pick up raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stealing? I paid for it too, in fact I pay more than you merely by virtue of the number of accounts I run. Under that logic I would argue raiders are &quot;stealing&quot; content from non-raiders (the majority) by being more vocal than non-raiders and more organized (its a function of uber guilds that they are organized or they dont prosper. They bitch at SOE and SOE caves because until recently non-raiders could be told that they could experience most of it, just 3 years later. Well that is no longer true. Non-raiders will never see the EPs and 1/2 of GoD. NEVER.<br />
<br />
And by the way give me 10 new zones in OoC that I (and most non-raiders) can use and I will be happy. That and some new slightly better drops. Oh and give me some content that challenges without have 1.5K+ hitters as well. Mix and match encounters would be far harder then the quick burn grp. As always the players merely min-max to beat the unvarried content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">Yet those people who are admittedly non-raiders aren't chiming in with agreement.  If it was so damn true, what you claim is true, then I would be sitting here all alone.  Yet I'm not, there are quite a few people saying the same thing.  Oh, but I'm CLUELESS, right?  So must be these other people.  Everyone who doesn't agree with you must be CLUELESS right?  Okay Frodlin, I've had a lot of respect for you for a long time, but right now I think you're full of bullshit.  JUST like you were full of bullshit when you preached on about Knights needing mini defensive so you and your guild buddies could continue to have an even stronger lock on GoD content.  BULLSHIT.<br />
<br />
So put that in your pipe and smoke it.  Go ahead, insult me some more.  I really couldn't care less.  Your opinion has just been put in the, &quot;looking out for their own best interests and really couldn't give two shits about others&quot; catagory.<br />
Glat its the most fun in the game for grping and is far harder for the xp then anything that non-raiders will do. I will not comment on what is possible for non-raiders because my equipment isnt typical and I 6box so I dont worry about my grp, if I suck I die no matter what.<br />
<br />
I will say that non-raiders need to bring a veteran grp to offset for equipment. That being said its worth looking at and trying today. Too much content has been gifted in the last 2 years and frankly too many non-raiders are used to having easy unlike the old days. That doesnt mean everything is right however.<br />

Looks like I nailed it right on the money.   You want to get Raex armor for your twink warrior.   Knowing FULL well there's a SHITLOAD of other content out there that doesn't require YOU to cockblock other guilds who have gone the path that gains them the fruits of Elemental Progress, who are actually upgrading their primary characters in Elemental armor, you don't give a rat's ass.<br />
<br />
This isnt' SOE cockblocking the little guys, it's SOE preventing YOU from cockblocking the little guys who have actually done the requisite steps to reap the fruits of their labors.<br />
<br />
You can take your Time Flagged warrior to fuggin Kod Taz and Yxxta and do Primals and Pile of Bones/Pixxt Priest Summoner, etc and other such targets, but no, you gotta have the Raex, and you're willing to swipe it from under the feet of the people who've done the progression, and who are trying to gear up their own mains.  <br />
<br />
To come here and pretend that you're some casual player advocate, when you're nothing but a post time enchanter wanting to take Elemental Spawns from those who've done the work is the most amusing pile of shit I've ever seen.   <br />
<br />
The best part of this whole thing is that you claim that *I* have no credibility because I fucking CALLED you on your bullshit of calling &quot;raiders&quot; in the 3rd person as though you're not one.<br />
<br />
It's funny, I'm the one here telling people that they can succeed without raiding, URGING that they do so, and you tell me that I'm defending raiding exclusivity, while pretending you're some &quot;little guy&quot; who the man is keeping down, when you're nothing but the man himself in disguise.</div></div><hr />

Holy Jesus Mother of god....<br />
<br />
PoM revamp was the best thing to happen to pure melee regarding that zone.  How fair was it that you couldn't get there without a raid, and once you left you needed another raid to get there (or double DA right clickies), while any caster who could get there one time could bind and solo left and right and make craploads selling cards from quadkiting.   It's now usable (although no one actually USES it even though EVERYONE has access to it), it's accessable, and it's no longer a way for casters to have exclusive content.   It ALSO provides an EASY way to get to Cobalt Scar and the Western side of Velious.<br />
<br />
If you had a VP key before, then it's one kill to get it updated for what is arguably the best Exp/Difficulty zone in EQ.   I got keyed the first day, not by my Time+ level guild, but by a pick up raid.   I was one of 4 of my guildmates to get keyed the first day.   Today, there was another pickup raid on Suled Dar's Shade, which keyed some more guildies and whoever wanted to come.   Next week, I'm sure there'll be another.   <br />
<br />
The sad thing about this whole thing is that I'm the only person I've EVER seen arguing that the Fabled mobs should've been made permanent, back when they were going away.   I'm the one who's argued that there needs to be more single group spawns that aren't *extreme* encounters who drop loot that gives people incentive to hunt in, and that can be killed with a single group.<br />
<br />
No, the fact that I'm a raider and think that certain content should require raiding erases all that.   Yeah, nice.</div></div><hr />

Yes, stealing, and when you put the quote in it's context, you'll see that it's referring to the reality that loot sucks ass, even most boss loot in PoP UNTIL you hit the Elemental Planes, and the EP/Time are the rewards for persistence, not the inherent right of 13 bucks a month.<br />
<br />
Vig's time flagged warrior twink doing a little sub quest to gain access to kill Elemental nameds and take them from under the feet of guilds who have put in what it takes to get there is indeed stealing.</div></div><hr />

Luckly Frod can have a spirited and opininated conversation with out it effecting what information he gives to SoE.  Using his new position in an attempt to gain some kind of leverage is just weak.<br />
<br />
If you're going to have a discussion, people are going to have opinions, don't try and basically blackmail him into either opting out of discussions or changing his opinion to fit yours by holding his new position over his head.  I think Frod having such spirited discussion is a good sign. It shows he has passion for the subject and that's what's needed.  I may not always agree with him, but I know he will still represent all sides of an issue to SoE.</div></div><hr />

However you have not actually gotten off your ass to observe these issues that he's presented - he doesn't necessarily have to agree with them all, but he does convey the voice of the warriors, not his own.<br />
<br />
If you deny this you haven't read a thing he's said, and your blatant accusations here only enforce your ignorance.<br />
<br />
Being a correspondent does not mean you're not allowed to have an opinion - it means when the time comes you put your own feelings aside and put together the overall requests and needs of a class.  This is why you'd make a horrible correspondent - instead of looking at all the possibilities, you're trying to silence the one you disagree with.<br />
