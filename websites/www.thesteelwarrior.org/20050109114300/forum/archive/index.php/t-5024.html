I've been in and out of the channel for a couple years now since it's been live, but these last couple weeks have been nothing but a collection of idiots typing in caps, putting people downand generally being the games #1 source of arrogant little bastard children.</div></div><hr />

1) I don't<br />

Yes, to catch the fucking troll (Here, i'll spell it out for you too...it's YOU).<br />
<br />
What the fuck do you contribute around here these days anyway?  I'm in FFXI, i'm on blah blah, you all suck because you're not me, I've read this thread before, you're not important, but for some reason I AM!<br />

Whoa, whoa, whoa Tex. Hold the guns up for a second! I probably contribute more than other people here...<br />

Plus, since fucking when do I rub in I'm &quot;better&quot; than anyone? I'll admit, some things that are posted here I've seen before, but that's no reason for me to be like, &quot;lol faget it's old.&quot; TSW Chat has been talked about many times here, it's most likely not going to change ever, and people should just get used to it. Name me a channel without a password that's not the name of the channel that doesn't have retards in it. That's right, you can't. IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE! I'm not cooler than any other person here, so if I were you, I'd take your own damn advice and take your Prozac.</div></div><hr />

If it's on 1-5, you've got yourself an apology.

I have had moderator status in the channel for the past few months now and I do a pretty good job of ejecting the retards now I think,and I do what I can to answer as many questions as possible to whomever may ask.....<br />

<br />
The days of is OSG better than Frostbringer and Fulorians Consumer Reports hotkeys are long gone,As much as I enjoyed them =P....<br />
<br />
There is some cool people in the channel and I have seen and taken part in some good discussions over the last month or so...<br />
<br />
I think the biggest issue now adays if the majority of the people in the chat all get on well,and new peoplee feel like insders cause there is alot of inside jokes and stuff,it has become kind of a second guild for me and I enjoy it alot...</div></div><hr />

Nearly free speech plus discretion. Don't give yourself too much credit there; I've wanted to ban you on more than one occasion.</div></div><hr />

Because as of now making worthless and annoying posts isn't a bannable offense.  It doesn't mean people like them though.</div></div><hr />

I am not horribly concerned about how I appear to people as I was before! I can't really 'own' people anymore here because:<br />
<br />
1. I don't play EQ anymore<br />
2. I'm not really concerned about the other parts of the board besides Tavern and Outhouse<br />
3. I tend to focus more on RealPoor <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that people complaining about the channel, while they say it's &quot;stupid, dumb, and full of assholes&quot; are just sad because they can't fit in with the latest clique.  I mean, I can only think of 1 asshole, and a bunch of sarcastic people.. and it's obnoxious from time to time, but most of the time it's either chat about mobs, or items, or asking for links. Hi people, this isn't any different then from when Chatja, Fulorian etc etc where in the channel. It's just that the &quot;obnoxious chatter&quot; is changed. Instead of being something from   one of the old clique members, it's something from the new... and you guys can't relate.<br />

While driving home today from getting my haircut, I think I figued out why people hate TSW now...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that people complaining about the channel, while they say it's &quot;stupid, dumb, and full of assholes&quot; are just sad because they can't fit in with the latest clique.  I mean, I can only think of 1 asshole, and a bunch of sarcastic people.. and it's obnoxious from time to time, but most of the time it's either chat about mobs, or items, or asking for links. Hi people, this isn't any different then from when Chatja, Fulorian etc etc where in the channel. It's just that the &quot;obnoxious chatter&quot; is changed. Instead of being something from   one of the old clique members, it's something from the new... and you guys can't relate.<br />

Fit it to a T!<br />
<br />
I used to think the channel was homosexual when I was in it back when I used to play my monk! But when I started to join in on the wacky hijinx as a warrior, it was all good!<br />
<br />
PS: Is the asshole Camaden, or is there some new asshole I have not been informed of? Because when I left, Kokonut finally came back making the sekrits complete =/</div></div><hr />

First, I don't give a fuck about not fitting in, especially since many act like pathetic 12 year old dumbshits.  There are a few decent people in chat, I'm not saying that all in there are bad.  It's just people like ninja, ikkan, etc.  It is a disgrace that people who are no more mature than, and actually act a lot like Sam are controlling a channel named after this site.  I do NOT want to fit in, and I don't give a fuck about not fitting it, and I won't shut up because children tell me to.<br />
<br />
And this has nothing to do with internet penis size.  It's my opinion, and I'll speak it.</div></div><hr />

Well here's your problem son!<br />
<br />
You can go ahead and take these &quot;decent people&quot; of the channel, and form your own channel! See how exciting and entertaining it is then! Look, the people there add humor. It's company for those long raids, boring exp groups, etc. If you want a channel where like 1 person drops in every 5 minutes just asking for a link, then leaves, make your own channel. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
PS: Reading comprehension is fun!<br />

Last time I saw ikkan go on a &quot;abusing of his powers&quot; spree was when he got kicked, so he started to kick the kicker, and the kicker and Ikkan got into a kick war. Big fucking deal.  I havn't seen the channel modded for any length of time for quite a while now. I think the longest was when Frodlin was owning some guy in regards to class balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
You say that it's full of ignorance etc, but why is it that nearly every single warrior related question  gets answered?<br />

<br />
To say nothing gets answered in TSW warrior question wise, or hell game question wise is a a lie. A huge fucking lie.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With that being said, you can take your perfect channel of question answering, elite everquest players and shove it. Because the humor I find, and probably about 50, 60, and sometimes 70 other warriors a night find funny makes TSW worth it to log into every single time I play eq.<br />
<br />
edit: And like I said before... If you feel like you can't relate, or you feel like an outcast then don't join. Bitching about it here isn't going to change shit, it's only going to result in a flame war.</div></div><hr />

I agree with what Surlok said, a lot of new people that come into the channel don't understand a lot of our inside jokes, because TSW has so many of them it is hard for some people to feel like they are 'special' or that people are listening to them. Is it my job as a Moderator to make these people feel at home? No, no it's not.<br />
<br />
If we have one major problem in TSW I think It's Holliy, honestly I can't say a single thing without getting a 20 minute scolding about it. Holliy gets so pissed off that I don't care about what he says, that he keeps going, and going, and going, and it never ends. Fek drama =/</div></div><hr />

I don't.  I don't join the channel, I don't plan on joining the channel, I don't want in the channel, and I am not making my own channel.  That doesn't mean many are a disgrace to the warrior community and are complete childish fucktards.  Ikkan and ninja especially.  It's like a swarm of Sams, only sometimes it's worse.  It's like logging on to SZ.  Or maybe being back in elementary school.</div></div><hr />

The subject was brought up, so I replied, plus I do see it as sad that people might join it and think warriors are all children.  Like I've said before, it's my opinion, and I will speak it.<br />
<br />

I've been in the channel quite a few times, I just no longer join.  It's not a hard concept to understand, but I know you're still not out of preschool.<br />
<br />
why try to change it from this message board? <br />
<br />
Who said I was trying to change it?  I think you all are a bunch of annoying shits, so I am saying so.  I know the channel won't change, and I'm not trying to change it.  I'm just saying that you are useless, and remind me why I wish someone would clean up the gene pool.<br />
<br />
And, if that post was what you call &quot;owning&quot;, then you guys really are sad.  Mine wasn't either, but unlike you, I don't think I'm l33t cause I argued with someone on the internet omgz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did I say that was what I wanted?  Read my posts before responding to them Binnamar, don't sit here and lecture me on false pretenses, debating a topic I didn't bring up.  I'm not even going to humor this stupidity with a response until you go back, read my post, and tell me where I said I wanted TSW elitism.  Find it yet?<br />
<br />
Didn't think so.<br />
<br />
Because the humor I find, and probably about 50, 60, and sometimes 70 other warriors a night find funny makes TSW worth it to log into every single time I play eq.<br />
<br />
Warrior: OMGZ SUM1 LINK COHS!!!<br />
Warrior 2: Fucking newb<br />
Warrior 3: &lt;&lt;link COHS&gt;&gt;<br />
Warrior: tHANKS TUNZ!!!<br />
Warrior 4: God damn paladins<br />
Warrior 5: Solusek Ro 25%<br />
Warrior 2: I can spin around twice on my head<br />
<br />
Yes, the 25 people who frequent this channel have heaps of intellectual humor that just bleeds comedy.<br />
<br />
edit: And like I said before... If you feel like you can't relate, or you feel like an outcast then don't join. Bitching about it here isn't going to change shit, it's only going to result in a flame war.<br />
<br />
Did I say I can't relate?  Did I say I feel like an outcast?<br />
<br />
I said that you people are ruining the channel.  Because there are three people with an intelligence quotient about on par with a bag of chips doesn't mean that they constitute the whole of the channel with whom I need to relate.<br />
<br />
However when they are the most vocal and most aggressive about their &quot;humor&quot; as you call it, then that's a matter of ruining the channel.  Gink ruins channels very easily, Ikkan ruins channels very easily, hell Melkoreth can ruin channels very easily.  Freezah can ruin channels very easily, all of them single handidly.<br />
<br />
When you have Ikkan (president of the Gink Sympathizers of America [GSOA]) running as a mod and attacking any Tom, Dick, or Larry and refusing to yield for any damn thing, Gink coming into the channel and being Gink, Fallakin running around going &quot;OH YOU FUCKING NEWBS KILL YOURSELVES&quot; and these new scrotumhammer people coming along telling me how godly their server and their gear is, then it's not a matter of &quot;well it's just one bad seed&quot;, it's a matter of the worst seeds you can ask for teaming together with a common enemy: intelligence.<br />
<br />
You say that it's full of ignorance etc, but why is it that nearly every single warrior related question gets answered?<br />
<br />
Warrior 1: What combo should I use for XX?<br />
Warrior 2: Fuck off.<br />
Warrior 3: &lt;&lt;joke&gt;&gt;<br />
Warrior 4: You shouldn't, you should get YY.<br />
Warrior 5: So Warrior 2 did you hear about...<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;insert conversation&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior 1: What combo should I use for XX?<br />
Warrior 2: Fuck off.<br />
Warrior 3: &lt;&lt;joke&gt;&gt;<br />
Warrior 4: You shouldn't, you should get YY.<br />
Warrior 5: So Warrior 2 did you hear about...<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt;insert conversation&gt;&gt;<br />

Warrior 2: Fuck off.<br />
Warrior 3: &lt;&lt;joke&gt;&gt;<br />
Warrior 4: You shouldn't, you should get YY.<br />
Warrior 5: So Warrior 2 did you hear about...<br />
Warrior 6: Hey Warrior 1, you should use XX or if possible try to use ZZ, but I would definitely go with XX.<br />
<br />
<br />
Happens all the time Binnamar, just because after the third, fourth, or sometimes fifth try someone answers, that doesn't mean that they should have to put up with that BS leading up to the way, nor does &quot;eventually&quot; getting answered constitute as &quot;every warrior question is answered!&quot;<br />
<br />
Because plenty go completely unnoticed.<br />
<br />
To say nothing gets answered in TSW warrior question wise, or hell game question wise is a a lie. A huge fucking lie.<br />
<br />
Point where I said nothing gets answered in TSW.<br />
<br />
If you look above, I said it takes several attempts - though often times things go completely unanswered and if you deny THAT, you're telling a lie.<br />
<br />
Again, read what I post Binnamar before attempting to respond, I'm not going to waste my breath on your assumptions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last time I saw ikkan go on a &quot;abusing of his powers&quot; spree was when he got kicked, so he started to kick the kicker, and the kicker and Ikkan got into a kick war.<br />
<br />
Do I need to list the number of times your wonderful and infallible guild member has abused his powers?  Should I get Frodlin for reference?<br />
<br />
This is pretty funny, It's myself and Dima's fault for entirely ruining a channel. Well you know, I'm sorry if you think that, but I also think that your blame is highly misplaced.<br />
<br />
That's quite alright, you are entitled to your right to be wrong.<br />
<br />
I agree with what Surlok said, a lot of new people that come into the channel don't understand a lot of our inside jokes, because TSW has so many of them it is hard for some people to feel like they are 'special' or that people are listening to them. <br />
<br />
Soandso tells serverwide.thesteelwarrior1, 'STFU newb, Rallos Zek says ur his bitch&quot; is not an inside joke, nor is it special.<br />
<br />
It's stupid, it's not funny, and it's an example of your unfathomeable levels of stupidity.  Let me give you another example of your &quot;inside jokes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Soandso tells serverwide.thesteelwarrior1, 'OMGZ that's so funny, Bert is lke totally raping you!'<br />
<br />
Again, not funny, childish and stupid.<br />
<br />
Is it my job as a Moderator to make these people feel at home? No, no it's not.<br />
<br />
It's your job as moderator to give off a perception that the channel is at least mildly mature and can handle a level of intelligence.<br />
<br />
You squashed that idea when people tried to have discussions about music (primarily classical) and you began verbally assaulting people because you, by your own admission, weren't intelligent enough to keep up with it.<br />
<br />
If we have one major problem in TSW I think It's Holliy, honestly I can't say a single thing without getting a 20 minute scolding about it.<br />
<br />
1) That's a malicious lie.<br />
2) I scold you when you don't know when to shut up and you're spamming the hell out of my screen, others' screens, and destroying perfectly good conversations.<br />
3) I do far more than scold you.  I try to talk to you, I try to be friendly/civil with you (tried more like it, I've since given up any thought of believing that you can return any civilty), I've tried to give you advice on raid encounters, I tried to comfort and advise you when your uncle passed away, and I've always tried as hard as I can to keep at least a friendly &quot;relationship&quot; with you as a moderator.  You've blown that out of the water.<br />
 <br />
Also, I find it relatively curious.  I'm the big problem with the Steel Warrior chat?<br />
<br />
This thread was started before I came back.   I've been away for the past two-ish months on account of RL issues and will continue to be away for the next two to three months.<br />
<br />
Is my ominpresence defiling the channel Ikkan?<br />
<br />
As well, it should probably be noted that I am the one getting ;tells every time I sign on from people saying &quot;Christ we need to get ownership of this channel to frodlin to stop ikkan from having mod powers&quot;.<br />
<br />
Holliy gets so pissed off that I don't care about what he says, that he keeps going, and going, and going, and it never ends. Fek drama =/<br />
<br />
Actually what you see is a paragraph post, about three to four lines in my responses to you.  Similar to what I do at the Steel Warrior actually, similar to what many people do in response to verbal assaults.  You however hate reading these things because you probably can't understand most of the words I use, or you don't have the attention span to follow-up with what you started.<br />
<br />
Posting a quick paragraph in response to your mundane levels of stupidity isn't &quot;long scolding that goes on and on and on&quot;.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you tried reading some of them you'd learn a thing or two.</div></div><hr />

Think of telemarketers. I bet they're kinda Perky and or Happy to call up people, but once you make a lot of calls you're all of a suddenly feeling the drag. Or hell, the person the telemarketers call, the &quot;callies&quot; get tired of that shit too. <br />
With that being said; We're not here to link you xxxx or yyyy we're here to converse. So, after 19,000,000.1 CHoS/SoTB questions, or 18,000,000 links for a raex bp people get tired of it. Once again, we're not here to provide a service for YOU.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
So what you want is a channel of Hard-ass eq players that only serve the lower warriors by linking them CHoS/SoTB and raex BPs? Because that's all thats goning to be happening in that channel. Talk to Hussar, maybe he will want to start a channel with you. I'm sure that after the first 20 minutes you both would have left, distraught that your channel failed.<br />
<br />
<br />
However when they are the most vocal and most aggressive about their &quot;humor&quot; as you call it, then that's a matter of ruining the channel.  Gink ruins channels very easily, Ikkan ruins channels very easily, hell Melkoreth can ruin channels very easily.  Freezah can ruin channels very easily, all of them single handidly.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ginks a troll, he's an asshole imo. I'm good friends (as I see it) with Ikkan.  He's a good guy,  and sometimes is an ass. See my telemarketer referance if you cannot comprehend why he is an ass at times. Hell I'm an ass at sometimes too. I don't have a fucking clue about who the other two people you listed are. So I can't comment on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you have Ikkan (president of the Gink Sympathizers of America [GSOA]) running as a mod and attacking any Tom, Dick, or Larry and refusing to yield for any damn thing, Gink coming into the channel and being Gink, Fallakin running around going &quot;OH YOU FUCKING NEWBS KILL YOURSELVES&quot; and these new scrotumhammer people coming along telling me how godly their server and their gear is, then it's not a matter of &quot;well it's just one bad seed&quot;, it's a matter of the worst seeds you can ask for teaming together with a common enemy: intelligence.<br />
<br />
Once again, gink is a troll. Ikkan is not a gink suppoter, or sympathizer. He hates him, and if he's being a troll, then he'll probably be kicked. Hell, Hoilly hates him. <br />

<br />
Happens all the time Binnamar, just because after the third, fourth, or sometimes fifth try someone answers, that doesn't mean that they should have to put up with that BS leading up to the way, nor does &quot;eventually&quot; getting answered constitute as &quot;every warrior question is answered!&quot;<br />
<br />
Because plenty go completely unnoticed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, refer to my telemarketer reference. I belive that is in section A of this post.<br />
<br />
<br />
Point where I said nothing gets answered in TSW.<br />
<br />
If you look above, I said it takes several attempts - though often times things go completely unanswered and if you deny THAT, you're telling a lie.<br />
<br />
Hey look another thing to refer to my telemarketer reference. I never recall saying that everything gets answered on the first try, or the second, or the ninth. Some people ignore it (as you posted in your witty TSW interpretation) or don't have said link. I mean, it's pretty hard to link a &quot;giant rat meat&quot; if you don't have one on you. <br />
<br />
<br />
 blah blah blah ikkan's a mean dictator blah blah blah<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is spam kicking a troll really an offense? I mean, he has the right to annoy the piss out of everyone in the channel right? Well, he does have that right, but guess what TSW is a dictatorship. I havn't seen Ikkan ever just chain kick someone for being there, unless something was done to provoke him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to go poke that lion with a stick untill he bites me... get the camera it'll be hilarious!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soandso tells serverwide.thesteelwarrior1, 'STFU newb, Rallos Zek says ur his bitch&quot; is not an inside joke, nor is it special.<br />
<br />
It's stupid, it's not funny, and it's an example of your unfathomeable levels of stupidity.  Let me give you another example of your &quot;inside jokes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Soandso tells serverwide.thesteelwarrior1, 'OMGZ that's so funny, Bert is lke totally raping you!'<br />
<br />
Again, not funny, childish and stupid.<br />
 <br />
I agree, I don't find either of those funny. Of course, I can't remember the last time I saw &quot;OMGZ BERT RAPED YOU HAHA PWNED&quot; <br />
what I usually see is :<br />
&quot;Shit, bert just despawned&quot;<br />
&quot;that sucks&quot;<br />
&quot;ouch&quot;<br />
&quot;heh =(&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You squashed that idea when people tried to have discussions about music (primarily classical) and you began verbally assaulting people because you, by your own admission, weren't intelligent enough to keep up with it.<br />
 <br />
It's his right to disagree in any form deemed neccisary by Ikkan. Just as its &quot;his right to be wrong&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
stuff that doesn't pertain to me</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
The subject was brought up, so I replied, plus I do see it as sad that people might join it and think warriors are all children.  Like I've said before, it's my opinion, and I will speak it.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I've been in the channel quite a few times, I just no longer join.  It's not a hard concept to understand, but I know you're still not out of preschool.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Who said I was trying to change it?  I think you all are a bunch of annoying shits, so I am saying so.  I know the channel won't change, and I'm not trying to change it.  I'm just saying that you are useless, and remind me why I wish someone would clean up the gene pool.<br />
<br />
And, if that post was what you call &quot;owning&quot;, then you guys really are sad.  Mine wasn't either, but unlike you, I don't think I'm l33t cause I argued with someone on the internet omgz.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, if you have to resort to insults, and name calling I'm pretty sure that I'm safe in saying you loose.<br />
<br />
Thanks for playing, please try again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and I never said that I personally owned you. People said that about my post. Not exactly sad the way I see it<br />
<br />
And my last addition to this post...<br />
  I wish someone would clean up the gene pool.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Let me be the first to tell you, Farewell, because you would be one of the first to go. Fucking elitist bastards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My post included more than insults.  As for why I use them, there is nothing I can't stand more than immature dumbasses.  I abhor them.  It is my primary downfall concerning other people.  So I do tend to use more than is required.  And while you personally may or may not deserve it, ikkan does seeing as he is one of the first to insult and and act like a moron.  Since you were defending him, I figure you are the same.<br />
<br />
Let me be the first to tell you, Farewell, because you would be one of the first to go <br />
<br />
Heh, highly doubtful.  I may have a tendancy towards being an asshole to certain people, but I am far from the level of utter stupidity that the channel shows and should be removed.<br />
<br />
Fucking elitist bastards <br />
<br />
If elitist means hating childish behavior and immature dumbasses, then I guess I would be elitist.<br />
<br />
That channel is a fuckin cesspool of dumbassery <br />

<br />
Did I say that?  There are many different types of humor.  Your type of humor is what makes shows like Jackass and reality tv popular.  OMFGZ you suxxor is not a joke, yet that is about as intelligent as some of you get.<br />
<br />
That's because he did man <br />
<br />
Asking stupid questions is owning someone?  I mean, I've explained all of that repeatedly.  So since he didn't get it though it's been obvious from my previous posts, I've been owned?  Seriously, that is a sad sad version of owning.  It even rivals your intelligence for a new level of patheticness.</div></div><hr />

How many times do I have to say I don't want to before you get it?  Should I spell it out for you?  I don't want in the channel, I don't want a new channel, but that doesn't mean I'll sit by while you continue to spew out your standard idiotic shit.<br />

Plus, I never called myself an intellectual.  I'm really not one.  I just have an IQ above that of my own shit.  Sadly thats becoming less common in people, as SZ, sw.tsw, reality tv, jackass, ninja, ikkan, sam, etc continues to prove.</div></div><hr />

Get off his cock sir, and the bandwagon.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the last time ANYONE used those phrases. Maybe Ikkan used &quot;stufz&quot; or something, but I can't remember it. Perhaps it's because you don't get the sekrits well enough? Also, SPEAK ENGLISH! I don't understand that last paragraph. Perhaps it's also because you don't seem to NEED TO JOIN THE DAMN CHANNEL IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT!<br />
<br />
Also, I'm HARDLY the poster child for it. I'm almost never there anymore, plus Dima is pretty much the cool kid (if you can call it that) there. So, in short, if you want to have your own Nazi channel where you can beat off to linking your own uber gear 6000000 times, be my guest ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
/groups with Hussar as he talks about Masterpiece Theater or whatever the fuck is apparently above the people of TSW Chat<br />

Hussar's first post... <br />
<br />
It's actually sad that the channel is associated with this site, or with the warrior population. I don't join it anymore, but it can't help the image of warriors to be so idiotic. Last time I joined it was approching SZ server population level of stupiditiy. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then you drop out for ~3 pages?Either way, if you don't like it stfu. Nobody wants to hear you bable on about &quot;how it's a disgrace&quot; because you don't fit in. <br />

Wow, far off there.  Most people in the chat are not like you.  Most are respectable people.  Also, I don't watch masterpiece theater, or things like it.  Like I said, I'm not an &quot;intellectual&quot; per se.  I'm just more intelligent than feces.<br />

The only thing I've claimed I'm more intelligent than is feces, and people who act like they are the poster boy for SZ.  I am not full of myself as you imply, I just don't look down on myself either.<br />

As for why I call people children and preschool kid.  I said that based on the level of maturity I recieved from people like ninja and ikkan.</div></div><hr />

To summarize:<br />
<br />
If you don't like TSW channel, don't join. It's quite simple.<br />
<br />
Questions DO get answered. If I see a question asked and it isn't answered within a few seconds, I answer it every single time. I very rarely see a question go by unanswered.<br />

I'm agree it could stand to be a bit more mature, but if that is how people want to act there really is nothing you or anyone else can do about it.  <br />
<br />
People can still come and get any information or link they wish to have, reguardless of whatever bullshit may be going on that day.  The people that are there will stop acting stupid to answer a question almost always to the best of their abliity from what I have seen.  I personally will answer any questions asked if I know the answer, and I usually do, however I have seen many others answer things as well.  I am sure some of the others that frenquent the channel know me and will agree that things do get answered and usually in a normal manner.  As long as people arn't pricks about the way they ask or just say something stupid they will get answered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanakus</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Binnamar, you've gone from being a respected, mature individual to being an ignorant twit in my mind, from your comments on this thread. I'm sure I'm hardly alone in such sentiments.<br />
<br />
 The PROBLEM with tsw chat is that it's full to the brim with immature children. Being a veteran of my class (yes, I'm only level 52, but I've stuck with the SAME character, a Barbarian Warrior, ever since I started EQ in September 2000) I was hoping that I'd find the same mature, knowledgeable individuals that attend this site, on a chat channel of the same name.<br />
<br />
 Boy, was I wrong.<br />
<br />
 Here's an example of my experiences in TSW channel:<br />
<br />
 I log on for the first time.<br />
<br />
 Me: Heyas all, I love the boards so I decided to drop by here - I'm a 52 warrior on the Rallos Zek Server who is very fond of the class.<br />
 Warrior One: Hello, blah, blah.<br />
 Warrior Two: Ditto.<br />
 Warrior Three: Ditto.<br />
 Warrior Four: OMFG we have someone from Rallos here?<br />
 Me: Yep.<br />
<br />
 Didn't seem too bad at that time.<br />
<br />
 Later on, same night:<br />
 <br />
 Me: Heyas, since you guys are grizzled veterans of our class, I have a question that needs answering: How hard is Nagafen to tank, for a warrior that has roughly 2350 hp/1000 ac unbuffed? * I link my gear*<br />
 Warrior One: OMFG you only have 2350 hp at level 52?<br />
 Warrior Two: NOOB<br />
 Warrior Three: Haha<br />
 Warrior Four: Your gear needs revamping.<br />
 Me: I'm working on it; it's hard to make cash as a warrior on Rallos, everything's extremely overpriced.<br />
 Warrior Six sends me a tell: Don't listen to these fools, many of them have nothing to do with the boards. Your gear and stats are fine for your level, around what I had.<br />
 I send a tell: Thanks a lot for your support and info.<br />
 Warrior Six sends tell: NP :)<br />
 <br />
 So I realize not everyone there is a grizzled veteran, sitting at his fireside with his weapons and greying hair, possessing a lot of life experience and maturity. Oh well, I say, every channel has its bad seeds.<br />
<br />
 A few days later, <br />
<br />
 Me: Damn, just had a really bad Umbral Plains raid with a 12-year-old girl leading it who cared ONLY about her personal gain in gear.<br />
 Warrior One: You're insulting 12-year-old girls?<br />
 Me: Not really, but they lack the maturity required to lead raids.<br />
 Warrior Two: What's wrong with 12-year-old girls?<br />
 Me: I just explained what's wrong with them.<br />
 Warrior Three: Hey, I'm 15 in real life.<br />
 Me: Then perhaps you're of the rare breed of more-mature teenagers. I'm just saying the average one lacks maturity.<br />
 <br />
 The conversation quickly becomes something like this:<br />
<br />
 Warrior One: Hey 12-year-old girls are the PWN.<br />
 Warrior Two: YA HAHA I'm 12 and I'm ubar!<br />
 Warrior Three: HAHAHA STFU ZAN I CAN SPEAK IN ALL CAPS HAHA<br />
 Me: What does this have to do with that?<br />
 Warrior Four: THIS IS A CAPS-LOCK-ONLY TIME FOR EVERYONE.<br />
 Warrior Five: HAHA NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT HAHAHA!<br />
 Warrior Six: STFU ZAN HAHA.<br />
 Me: Whatever, fellas. I'm outta this channel, period.<br />
 Warrior Seven: HAAHA YOU SUX0RZ<br />
<br />
 I leave the channel.<br />
<br />
 The average conversation there seems to go something like this, by the way:<br />
<br />
 Warrior One: RZ 50%<br />
 Warrior Two: Nice.<br />
 Warrior Three: Can someone plz link me BoW?<br />
 Warrior Four: *links Bow*<br />
 Warrior Three: Ubar.<br />
<br />
 Binnamar, for people like you to ignore the blatant childishness of the denizens of TSW channel shows that you are hardly the guy a lot of us thought you were. No one here intends to make a channel for themselves, and I don't think anyone here really IS elitist. Unlike you, we have some standards of maturity that we choose to associate ourselves with. The problem isn't that there aren't enough good warrior channels; the problem is that the main one, which is named after an excellent board, is full of fools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That channel is a fuckin cesspool of dumbassery.<br />
<br />
It's not like serverwide.cleric is any better. The only difference is, instead of the rickshaw-dumbasses your channel gets, serverwide.cleric gets all the pussy, grab-ass types. Actual discussion (read: not cutesy bullshit) is rare. So... it's not just the warrior class channel.</div></div><hr />

I remember the days of invading chat channels and having Elementous do big long stories. I remember the days when we were in Najena on test killing shit, back when /testbuff was new. I remember killing spiders in Everfrost with our barbarians. There's nothing wrong with having some fucking fun.<br />

That is exactly the average conversation,And the odd time you get someone in the channel that asks if a Chos or a sotb or any other acronym for some bazaar bought wep is actualyl that good.<br />
<br />
<br />
We ahve in this site a massive compulation of information for people to come and read.The same thing happens here someone come in and posts the same question and one of the veteran board posters will come and enlighten them to the search function.<br />
<br />
I am what you would call one of the veteran people in tsw chat,been in the chat since it was formed,I have endured the Ornate sword of the general vs frostbringer debates,I have wathced Fulorian and Frodlin and their consumer reports hotkeys,I put up with all the new droga buisness.I don't have the option of providing people with a search function in chat.<br />
<br />
<br />
The majority of the people that come into chat and get the cold shoulder when they ask questions are asking questions that they could easily find the answer to by spending 5 min a day on our class forum.<br />
<br />
All it owuld take is 5 min a day of taking a little bit of extra pride in your class and I would not have to answer the same Question 20 times a day in that chat( and I do) So every now and then yeah I can be a dick cause it jsut gets tiring.<br />
<br />
TSW has ALWAYS been a chat of brand new players and Veteran players with a few idiots thrown in,Since their is no ban function in chat channels eventually you get tired of hitting your kick hotkey and jsut learn to deal with the idiots,Its not like a MB where you jsut avoid reading their posts.<br />
<br />
So while at first it does come across as a channel full of idiots its only about 5 or 6 people taht simply won't leave and most now jsut tolerate them for the sake of the other 60 people that frequent the channel and are pretty Cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
There has been some great discussion in the channel and it happens almsot everyday,and I welcome it and anyone that comes in thier.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to give the channel a chance,log in and say hi to me and strike upa  conversation most of the dipshits have enough respect for me in the channel to shut up if I tell them to.I just don't have 24 hours a day to monitor it =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I wonder about this,here we ahve the site as I said before and their isn't much of anyhting you cna't find here....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When most people come into the channel and ask for information its becaseu they are not gettign things that are nto even available on the safehouse.<br />
<br />
It's warrior chat,Not Serverwide I need time Mob Strats.<br />
<br />
I have been called a cocksucker in chat becasue I would not help a Guy with Vallon Zek in time,No shit.I am not there to help your guild figure out shit my guild and hundreds of others did on thier own.I am not in that channel to provide leet beta infos.<br />
<br />
If you want my opinion on an aggro wep becasxue you knwo me and think I won't bullshit you go for it,if you want some help on an old quest or an old raid encounter by all means ask I will provide what I can.<br />
<br />
If your coming to the channel to get some kind of leet info about current content and your pissed off cause you get ignored or people call you a fuck head.Don't come cying to me.</div></div><hr />

Man you clerics just can't stop horning in on warriors lives.  First you wanna heal us, now you wanna tell us your chat sucks as bad as ours :p<br />
<br />
Serverwide.tsw is truly the shit on the bottom of the barrel.  It's full of the people who would get laughed off here because they can't form a complete sentance, and the only reason they're any more than a pimple on the ass of this game is because they're in a guild that is lead by a man much smarter than they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was one of the most entertaining days on EQ for me. Man, that was a riot.<br />
<br />
Also going after the Qeynos Exterminater was fun as hell too. I think I got to 5$.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anywho, to the guy that doesn't respect me or anything anymore... /shrug. I've never seen you in chat, and I do however see the gear bashing only because shit isn't hard to obtain anymore. With FH armor you don't have to go to SS to get some good visible armor pieces.  <br />
Since you're rallos.xxx I can understand why your gear is far behind, but the days of Crafted armor till level 55 are over. It's so rediculously easy to find cheap armor that is decent then the piece of raw metal you're carrying around.  <br />
<br />
But people arn't around to baby you and tell you that &quot;Wow, what great gear you have, I'm sure that you and you're little player vs player buddies will have no problem in slaying the mighty dragon Nagafen!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Damn, just had a really bad Umbral Plains raid with a 12-year-old girl leading it who cared ONLY about her personal gain in gear. <br />
<br />
Find a raid that is interested in your personal gain. That's your fault for going there in the first place. The fact that she is 12 has nothing to do with it. The fact that a 12 year old led a raid means she can get shit done I think.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
What kind of person did you think I was? A mothering, caring, attentive person? Hell no. I play a warrior, not some cleric.<br />
<br />
No one here intends to make a channel for themselves <br />
<br />
THEN WHAT IS THE POINT OF YOUR BITCHING? If you don't like the frigg'n channel, then either ;<br />
(a) Don't join (which I see you have chosen this option already!)<br />
(b) Bitch and whine untill it changes to your specific level 52 warrior needs <br />
or,<br />
(c) Make a new channel (/autojoin serverwide.52warriorineedhelpyay)<br />
<br />
I suggest you choose the option (c) because I don't join serverwide.thesteelwarrior to help your ass out. If I want to make fun of your gear, if I want to make fun of your wipe then you damn better belive I'm going to do it. If I wipe, then you better belive that I'm going to take any joke face first... because this is only a game.<br />
<br />
If you can't take criticisim, stand sarcasim, or take a joke then by all means keep your face out of the channel.  If you don't want to take criticisim, stand sarcasim, or take a joke then make a no sarcasim, no joke, no criticisim channel. Could even name it /serverwide.boring. Once you're channel is done, be sure to tell me so I can tell the Zerg of TSW to come and attack it. Go, minions, go !<br />

It's been on my /autojoin since then - It's like another /gu for me. I like having a bunch of resourceful warriors at my disposal to answer my questions, of which I've had my share. I like being able to answer other peoples' questions whether they're longtime residents or just popping in. Often if it's a question I can't answer and I'm not doing anything particularly requiring my attention I'll look it up online - but by that time someone else has usually beaten me to it. I like having people to bullshit with while I'm farming or LFGing or whatever. I don't like dipshits - I don't think we're lacking in that department - but from what I've observed, the same people joking amongst themselves with 'HAHA PWNT BY B3R7' often turn around and answer a question with *gasp* complete sentences.<br />
<br />
Granted, the off-color humor and childishness isn't for everyone. (On a side note, I think the immaturity is mostly satirical. I'm not saying genuine dumbfucks aren't to be found in sw.tsw, but I think a lot of the banter that is meant as parody is lost on some people.) I'm not going to say &quot;start your own channel&quot; or &quot;then don't /join,&quot; nor am I going to get into an argument here. This is just my opinion, take it or leave it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really, what I see as the biggest problem is that one guy wants some recognition, so he logs on first post patch and grabs ownership, and/or convinces people to give it to him.   He's made it &quot;his channel&quot;.   This wouldn't be a bad thing mind you, but he also has a lot of friends, people who have no business moderating a chat channel, and hands out moderation of the channel to the people who need Ritalin from time to time.   These people are not good for the channel, and doing &quot;them&quot; a favor by giving them perceived powers does the warrior community a disservice as a whole.   <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but Ikkan and crowd are not good for the overall serverwide good of warriors as a whole when they do stupid things like mod the channel to say some innane statement.    Mods exist to prevent spammers, kick people who need to be kicked, and that's about it.   To then associate this type of behaviour with this board and the overall warrior community, is simply put, not right.<br />
<br />
Childish jokes are great, everyone has em, everyone shares em, and no one really cares.    Channel spamming, jihads, and WORSE, the planning by MODERATORS of our channel and conspiracy to and following through with spam on OTHER class channels is WRONG.    <br />
<br />
If you want to play those games, that's your right, but if you have a position of responsibility as a moderator of a serverwide channel, then you DO NOT have that right.   People who abuse this do not deserve 19th and 20th chances on promises, they are too volatile and should not be mods.   If someone mods the channel repeatedly to make some innane comment then unmods it in a muscle flexing exercise, they need to be taken off the mod list PERMANENTLY, because what happens is the channel gets the reputation that it currently has.   <br />
<br />
For the most part it serves a good purpose, but overall, the lack of responsibility on the part of the moderators, Ikkan in particular, has tarnished it so much that it's become known as a cesspool, which is a downright shame.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big believer in 10th + chances.... if I'm on modding and Gink comes on, if he acts up ONE time, he's out,  because of the track record, not some ploy to flex my virtual muscles, but to maintain a sense of reasonableness in the channel.   I've only EVER modded the channel to stop jihads and spams.    Once we had a fairly productive modded debate on the channel, and from time to time those are cool, but for the most part, using your mod &quot;powers&quot; needs to be something rarely done, but judiciously and for the good of the channel.<br />
<br />
I'm just afraid that as long as mods are handed out based on whether you can cry to Dima or not till he gives in, and not based on who has the balls to put their foot down when necessary and not do it when not necessary, there's not much hope.</div></div><hr />

It was Holliey that was modding the channel, and if that WAS you as his dad (which I;m sure it was) you did boot me for &quot;offending&quot; your son.  Your son was giving out crap advice and trying to talk down to anyone that disagreed with him.  Then when I found out he was a pally it made it even more ridiculous.  If your going to let your 11 year old son mod the channel then it is a JOKE, and I'm not surprised many of the older warriors aren't interested in spending time there.<br />
<br />
I know you're a long standing member of the warrior community but this is no &quot;story&quot;, it's what happened.  And from the posts of others here it doesn't surprise me one bit.  Maybe he was playing himself off as you, but either way WTF is he doing modding the channel??<br />

Ninjaburger your on crack..and your overuse of the term &quot;son' further leads me to believe you are some pre-pubescent teen, trying to pass himself off as old enough to participate with the big boys.<br />
<br />
Either way you're a joke-just like the channel you and your friends mod.  The channel loses respectability when a pally is modding it, it even further loses respectability when some 12 year old kid pally is modding it.  IF you can't see that your are BLIND and/or too fuking young to understand the concept.<br />

Are you that retarded? Hollily is pretty fucking mature for his age, and I'd let him have the channel EVEN IF he's a paladin. Look son, it's not what class you play, it's who plays it. <br />

And just to add....why should anyone give 2 shits about what you judge to be mature??  In order to judge something you have to have experience with it, and you have 0 in this field my friend.<br />

No, the question is... Why would anyone give two shits about what you think is mature? I'd have Holliy be a mod on TSW over the waste of sperm that you are.<br />

16 not 12, it still doesn't change my point.  Kids are moderating the channel.  And Palladin kids at that.  If you can't understand why Palladin children moderating the server-wide WARRIOR class channel is wrong than I have to wonder about your logic.  I don't go into the Necro or Mage channels and attempt to mod them or expouse advice on how to play a class I have 0 first hand experience with.  It's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Is it so far fetched to believe that your son MIGHT be impersonating you??  If you had truly been monitoring the channel I doubt you would have kicked me.  The only point I was making is that palladin's shouldn't be moderating the channel.  And I tried to show him the same logic that I put forth in my previous paragraph.  Because of his immaturity he decided I should be kicked rather than say &quot;fine that is your opinion&quot; and move on.  You can believe what you like but those are the facts.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to know what parts of my story are &quot;Absurd&quot;.  The part where I claim a palladin shouldn't be moderating the server-wide WARRIOR class channel or the part where your son, impersonating his dad the big strong warrior, decides to kick me from channel?</div></div><hr />

He's not some &quot;kid&quot;, he's more mature than almost all other mods, and more mature than many warriors on these boards.  Truthfully I'd bet it was someone else who kicked you while you were talking to him.  As for being a paladin, I believe he did play a warrior at one point, but he does visit and post on these boards.</div></div><hr />

Hello and Welcome to everquest,A videogame . You do realize that the majority of the population that makes up EQ is of the Teen Age demographic? Is it so absurb a notion that if the majority of the people in the channel are Younge people that perhaps young people should moderate them?<br />
<br />
It isn't high school,I doubt they want to be told what to do by adults all day long then come home and log into EQ for some fun and continue to be told what to do by adults.<br />
<br />
How many guild leaders of high end Guilds are in the 15-18 range? More than you would assume I bet.Of course if you found yourself in such a position as an adult being led by a teenager you would probably have no issue with it so long as your guild was a success?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the channel the way it is,I see Questions answered constnatly in it and I see alot of people having a great time sharing time with other people who play the same class and share an equal enjoyment and interest in it;And as an Adult I like to come home from work and log into this game and hang outwith people who don't care what my age is and don't judge me on the fact that maybe the music I liek isn't as cool as I thought it once was and it allows me to let loose a bit and act like a fool cause no one is there  to tell me its not ok to have fun.</div></div><hr />

Ok, you're new. Holliy = one fucking great person. Yes, he's a pally, but he's a damn smart one at that. He's mature, unlike you, and at least he has a sense of manners.<br />
<br />
You dismissing him for being a pally makes me wonder how you act in real life. Do you say, &quot;OMG HE'S A NIGGER DON'T GIVE HIM THE JOB BECAUSE THIS IS WHITEY'S WORK!&quot;? It wouldn't surprise me. Just stop while you're ahea... nevermind, you weren't ahead to begin with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ezedriel7th Ham</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I pissed the child off when I said Pally's shouldn't be moderating the WARRIOR class channel. If Hoilley or whoever is actually a regular channel mod he's doing a poor fucking job. <br />
<br />
The odd thing is, I've never met you before in my life.  This post you made completely came out of the blue and I dont' know what you are referring to.  If you have some logs perhaps we can clear this situation up - but I recall no such instance where I waved around the &quot;I am Frodlin's Son Flag &quot;and started chain kicking you.  In fact I try to stay off the &quot;I'm Frodlin's son&quot; topic because I do not want that thrown around to mean that I use that to get ahead in EQ.  If I want to get ahead I want to do so for my accomplishments, not out of a hereditary investment.<br />
<br />
Similarly to Frodlin, I only kick spammers and abusers (or if another mod and I are joking around sometimes, though rarely).  And I only moderate the channel to prevent spammers.  There was one time, again similarly to Frodlin, where another mod moderated the channel and I was asked to debate class balance against a warrior who believed that warriors were 100% balanced during that time period, but that was not my modding of the channel and for a while I was pretty opposed to it.<br />
<br />
16 not 12, it still doesn't change my point. Kids are moderating the channel.<br />
<br />
So then you have no problem then with Ikkan and Binnamar having their mod powers removed as well?<br />
<br />
Remember though, I did not come to anyone about being a moderator of the channel, I was asked, insisted upon, and then finally given to.  It went something like:<br />
<br />
solusek.Dima told you, 'Hey Holliy do you want ops for TSW?'<br />
You told solusek.Dima, 'Why would I want ops?'<br />
solusek.Dima told you, 'Because you know you're shit, you're smart, you're mature, and I like having you around.'<br />
You told solusek.Dima, 'I donno, I'm a paladin, doesn't exactly feel right.  Thanks for the offer anyway.'<br />
solusek.Dima told you, 'C'mon Hol, just do it.'<br />
<br />
After being insisted a few more times I finally accepted.<br />
<br />
It's not like I actively sought out this job, whined to Dima, and then to shut me up he gave them to me.<br />
<br />
 And Palladin kids at that. If you can't understand why Palladin children moderating the server-wide WARRIOR class channel is wrong than I have to wonder about your logic. I don't go into the Necro or Mage channels and attempt to mod them or expouse advice on how to play a class I have 0 first hand experience with. It's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that there is a Russian fellow who knows more about American cars than I.  I have no doubt that there is a British fellow who knows more about American guns than I.  I have no doubt that there is a German fellow who knows more about American history than I.  I do not tell them that they cannot discuss these things with me or say these things to me because they're of a different culture trying to tell me about my history, my guns, my automobiles.<br />
<br />
In fact it's unbelieveably enlightening to have somoene who is NOT influenced by my cultural bias who is willing to tell me another culture's take on a situation.  It gives me a chance to see it clearly.<br />
<br />
And again, I did not ask for the position as moderator, it was given to me.  I took it, shrugged, and have been doing my job - keep down abuse (using racial slurs and stopping people like Fallakin from telling twelve years to commit suicide), kicking spammers, moderating and voicing against spammers - to the best of my abilities.  If you see &quot;Paladin OMG die!&quot; then you aren't looking at the big picture.<br />
<br />
I don't have prejudice against any class telling or modding anything if they have what it takes.  Let me give you an example...<br />
<br />
Not long ago, another channel I am a mod on (the serverwide.paladins:paladins) had an owner who was not even a paladin.  He was a monk.  No one argued because we knew he knew what he was talking about, we knew he knew what he was saying.  He was a great guy and it was an all around joy to have him as owner.  After someone else hijacked ownership, they gave him mod powers - more at everyone else's request.<br />
<br />
Takanit did well as a mod/owner.  Just because he was a paladin did not negate that ability.<br />
<br />
Is it so far fetched to believe that your son MIGHT be impersonating you??<br />
<br />
....If you actually knew me, you'd realize that is the single most farfetched claim in the history of farfetched claims.  I would never, not in a million years, claim to be someone else - much less my father.  It's ridiculous, fruitless, and gets me nowhere.<br />
<br />
I have had the opportunity to whip out the Frodlin card, but I haven't.  It's childish, immature, and pointless.  It doesn't win arguements, it shows that I'm a weakling.  It shows that I can be boxed into a corner and I need daddy to get me out.<br />
<br />
I got this mod position on my own (I made sure of that, informing Dima that if it turned out that it was due to my relation to Frodlin I would simply ask for deops), the fact that I was Frodlin's son simply came out at one time after I said something to I think Ikkan, and he said &quot;OMG you a Frodlin twink?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Dude you aren't Frodlin?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;You must be related to him somehow.&quot; &quot;Yeah...I'm his son.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't come out and say &quot;Ikkan I'm &gt; you because I'm related to Frodlin&quot;.  I said what I had to, denied that I was Frodlin, and finally admitted who I was after he guessed that I was related.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to squash e-penises and grow my own by stomping around yelling &quot;HA HA BOW DOWN I AM SPAWN OF FRODLIN!!&quot;.  I am in the Warrior Channel to discuss interesting topics with generally interesting people, help answer warrior and balance questions, and show my support for the warrior class in getting what they deserve.<br />
<br />
I was an ardent supporter for the warrior fix - to the point that I tried to get my own class nerfed - having gotten banned from two message boards (one of which being the Paladin Community) for voicing this opinion and being kicked off the serverwide.paladins channel several times because I wanted a warrior fix (better aggro, better mitigation, better innate HPs, recommended class on items).  It's not as though I'm trying to sit here and &quot;oh look at me, I wish I could be a warrior&quot;.  I'm happy with the class I picked for the reasons I picked it, however I am also fully understanding of the fact that other people pay just as much money as I to play this game and therefore are not entitled to a priveladge to enjoy their class, but a right to do so.  It's not an &quot;if you pick this class in a year you won't be allowed to enjoy it&quot; factor, it's Sony Online Entertainment's job to fulfill the fact that it's a warrior's right to enjoy the class he made.<br />
<br />
And that's what I stood up for, and that's why I am and always have been in the warrior channel. <br />
<br />
Now do me a favor and don't bring these obviously half-baked attempts at defacing me to the table any more, they really are insulting for no other reason than because you honestly are taking shots in the dark at me.<br />
<br />
 If you had truly been monitoring the channel I doubt you would have kicked me. The only point I was making is that palladin's shouldn't be moderating the channel. And I tried to show him the same logic that I put forth in my previous paragraph. Because of his immaturity he decided I should be kicked rather than say &quot;fine that is your opinion&quot; and move on. You can believe what you like but those are the facts.<br />
<br />
Have logs?  Because the only instance I remember was when I was leaving a Tak Hard dungeon and someone was spamming &quot;OMG HOLLIY'S A MODERATOR?  FUCK YOU AND DIE PALADIN!&quot;  And several people responded with contrary opinions and someone called us all tools several times before ranting and raving repetitively that I shouldn't be a mod.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, I remember you now.  That was you.  And the reason Frodlin kicked you wasn't because you were &quot;abusing me&quot;.  He kicked you because you were playing dramaqueen &quot;let's spam the channel with my depression&quot;.<br />
<br />
You constantly ranted and raved going &quot;Fuck you I'm leaving the channel&quot;.  After about the sixth time when no one listened, Frodlin finally said &quot;Here Chadd, let me see the computer real fast&quot; and so I let him sit down, where he then proceeded to say &quot;Well if you don't want to be in this channel so much, let me help you since you obviously can't figure out how to leave&quot;.  And he kicked you.<br />
<br />
Rather warranted in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to know what parts of my story are &quot;Absurd&quot;. The part where I claim a palladin shouldn't be moderating the server-wide WARRIOR class channel or the part where your son, impersonating his dad the big strong warrior, decides to kick me from channel?<br />
<br />
You can ask Frodlin, because I fully remember that instance.  You were spamming the channel with pity tales until he finally kicked you.  What's &quot;absurd&quot; is that you come in here thinking that simply because I picked a class that starts with a &quot;P&quot; instead of &quot;W&quot; at the character selection screen, you feel I am somehow inferior to you in someway and don't deserve the same rights and priveladges.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for me and several others, you're wrong.<br />
<br />
The only thing absurd is you coming over here, assuming that I would EVER impersonate Frodlin, making up several stories, and then telling me that I try to flex cyber muscles by kicking you.<br />

Wychway-I may be a noob to these boards but I've been playing a warrior since Kunark.  It was my first character and I built him up untwinked.  I'm the furthest thing from a noob you will find.<br />

<br />
Great, good for you.  but alot of people have bad experiences with the channel.  Enough that there are several threads on the board about it.  I'm not coming out of far left field here.  I'm not judging him solely on the fact of his age.  But the FACT remains I was kicked for voicing a simple opinion which is not wothout good reason.  I'm sure alot of other warriors logging into channel for the first time like I did would be shocked to know that a Palladin was moderating the warrior class channel.<br />
<br />
I see everyone standing up for Holley because he is a good guy but no one addressing my issue that a Paladin is moderating the warrior channel and giving out advice.  It may not be a big deal to his &quot;friends&quot; but to me, and I'm sure alot of others, it is.  The leader of the serverwide warrior channel should have first hand experience with his class.  Not someone who spouts off 2nd hand information.<br />
<br />
Surlok i'm not opposed to having fun.  To me fun is wit and humor, not stupid Mod tricks like booting or force spamming.  It's happening in channel, people have come forward and said it is happening in channel.  If that's your idea of fun, fine, but alot of other players are going to turn right around and leave when they see that happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, you're new. Holliy = one fucking great person. Yes, he's a pally, but he's a damn smart one at that. He's mature, unlike you, and at least he has a sense of manners. <br />
<br />
again no one addressing the real issue which is the joke the channle becomes when we let other classes moderate it and have the final say.<br />
<br />
Now shut the fuck up and play a druid. <br />
<br />
and I have no manners??? Hey Pot, say hello to the fucking Kettle, yep your both Black.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I every once in awhile join serverwide:TSW. Occasionally it is pretty ok, but more often than not I turn it back off within 10 minutes as it is just extra spam with nothing good for me. It does seem to have quite a few loud adolescent sounding boys being, well, loud adolescent boys. Nothing wrong with that, just not my thing. <br />
<br />
This is a great quote and sums it.  Would probably have saved a shitload of rants (but then what fun what that be?)  Theseverwide.steelwarrior channel is for adolescent dick waving.  If you want some real information, post on the boards, do a search here or aska  warrior friend.  If you get lucky and get a question answered in the channel great....if not don't be surprised because anyone who hasn't had a FRONTAL LOBOTOMY knows exactly what the steelwarrior channel is all about.<br />
<br />
The odd thing is, I've never met you before in my life. This post you made completely came out of the blue and I dont' know what you are referring to. If you have some logs perhaps we can clear this situation up  <br />
<br />
I've actually posted this story once before on these boards because i thought it was so funny.  It isn't out of the blue, you'll be able to find it if you search.  Secondly If I had logs for that day they are erased by now as it was afairly long time ago.<br />
<br />
You told solusek.Dima, 'I donno, I'm a paladin, doesn't exactly feel right. Thanks for the offer anyway <br />
<br />
Exactly that is my entire point...it doesn't feel right.  Thank you for admitting that.  Regardless of your maturity level or knowledge of play it belittles the channel to have someone from another class moderating it.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that there is a Russian fellow who knows more about American cars than I. I have no doubt that there is a British fellow who knows more about American guns than I. I have no doubt that there is a German fellow who knows more about American history than I. I do not tell them that they cannot discuss these things with me or say these things to me because they're of a different culture trying to tell me about my history, my guns, my automobiles. <br />
<br />
This is where we come to the different types of knowledge.  There is first hand knowledge (like that of jews who were imprisoned in Auschwitz) and there is 2nd hand knowledge (like that of the man who writes a book about the experiences of jews who were imprisoned in Auschwitz).  First hand information is ALWAYS more valuable than second hand.  A russian could have first hand experience with american guns.  A german could have first hand experience with american cars.  A Paladin WITHOUT a level 65 warrior will NOT have first hand experience with the high end game of that class.  Does this mean you can't discuss issues? No, you can.  But should be the final word or authority on ANYTHING warrior? Hell no.<br />
<br />
 And again, I did not ask for the position as moderator, it was given to me. I took it, shrugged, and have been doing my job - keep down abuse (using racial slurs and stopping people like Fallakin from telling twelve years to commit suicide), kicking spammers, moderating and voicing against spammers  <br />
<br />
Obviously you haven't been doing your job lol.  Look at all the posts by people who claim the channel is utter crap!!  This is just one thread on the subject!!  Maybe the chat is just fine for you and people of your propensity but a shitload more thinks it's just assinine garbage!!  Obviously a vocal minority here think chat is ok the way it is.  Alot of other, frankly more intelligent posters, have disagreed.<br />
<br />
If you actually knew me, you'd realize that is the single most farfetched claim in the history of farfetched claims. I would never, not in a million years, claim to be someone else - much less my father. It's ridiculous, fruitless, and gets me nowhere. <br />
<br />
Allow me to SMOKE this argument-<br />
<br />
First of all you can say all you want about far-fetched claims, people who will support your character, bla bla bla.  It comes down to your word against mine.  People can choose who they want to believe...there is no point in going around in circles on this.<br />
<br />
You would not in a million years claim to be your father?? it's ridiculous, fruitless and gets you nowhere???  Your father is a highly respected member of the warrior community...right up there with Furor and a few others.  It gets you EVERYWHERE to impersonate him.  His words as a respected member carry weight.  impersonating him might shut alot of your detractors up from time to time.  Please don't play innocent with me, I'm not that gullible.<br />
<br />
I could go on and pick apart your argument but it's a waste of time.  Everyone knows what the warrior channel is.  To the more intelligent and mature warriors it's a joke.  You are partly responsible for that as a moderator.  Always remember, as a leader the buck stops with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing absurd is you coming over here, assuming that I would EVER impersonate Frodlin, making up several stories, and then telling me that I try to flex cyber muscles by kicking you. <br />
<br />
There is nothing absurd about the idea that  16 year old son might impersonate his dad he looks up too.  Also i never claimed that was definitely the case, only suggested it's possiblity when your father (whom I respect) came forward and said you were his son and that he had never said those things to me.  I wish I did have the logs but instead I'll point everyone here to refernce I made to this event on *and notice this date* 11-15-2003<br />

Why the fuck do people keep using that argument?  Every time multiple people disagree with them, it's everyone jumping on the bandwagon, not just multiple people disagreeing with them.  Jesus fucking christ, Zhenobia would be proud.<br />
<br />
And merc, I highly doubt you were &quot;just suggesting&quot; a paladin shouldn't be mod, based on how you act here.  Holliy's version seems to fit your personality, with you spamming / flaming / whatever about it, causing problems instead of just making a suggestion.  Holliy knows his stuff, more than many warriors even.  I see no reason why a knowledgable and mature person should not be allowed to mod a channel.<br />
<br />
As for why the channel is bad, it's not a situation where a mod like Holliy or Frod can really fix.  The fact is it is owned by someone who gives mod powers to people like Ikkan.  Holliy and Frod don't really have control over that.<br />
<br />
A paladin mod simply is not a problem.  He is much more mature than most other people in the channel, and cool headed.  You were kicked, not by a paladin, but by a warrior, so most of your argument is void anyway.  Frod is the one who kicked you, and Frod only does that if there is good reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bleh I'm done, you obviously didn't read the previous posts.  Frankly there is too much garbage here to sort through.  but Frodlin has already stated he didn't send me tell or kick me, so who did?  I don't care what you 'Believe&quot; or not.  I give what I get.  I don't start flaming or bad-mouthing unless flamed or bad-mouthed first.  I suggested a pally shouldn't mod the warrior channels.  All the kids and Hoilley came out to slam me down for sayign that.  I stood my ground and was kicked.  At least I have a pair of nads to not go back on what i believe.  If Hoilley can't shrug that off and let it go without booting me from channel than he is fuking immature.  My concern is legitimate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ezedriel7th Ham</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can post all the shit you like Hoilley, and all you others can hop on the bandwagon and dis me, fact remains I said pally's shouldn't moderate the serverwide warrior class channel and for that I was kicked.<br />
<br />
Wrong, you were kicked for spamming pity-rants.  You wanted everyone to feel sorry for you because you didn't like the fact that I was a mod.  When you repeated almost seven times &quot;Fuck you I'm leaving this god damn channel&quot; Frodlin finally sat down and kicked you - because I wouldn't.<br />
<br />
 But the FACT remains I was kicked for voicing a simple opinion which is not wothout good reason.<br />
<br />
Again see above.  Spamming &quot;feel sorry for me&quot; in the channel gets you kicked.  I have no problem when people ask why I am a mod - it's a valid question...I'm a paladin.  You guys have every reason to ask why I'm a mod.<br />
<br />
I'm going to start kicking when you guys start spamming the channel.<br />
<br />
I see everyone standing up for Holley because he is a good guy but no one addressing my issue that a Paladin is moderating the warrior channel and giving out advice. It may not be a big deal to his &quot;friends&quot; but to me, and I'm sure alot of others, it is. The leader of the serverwide warrior channel should have first hand experience with his class. Not someone who spouts off 2nd hand information.<br />
<br />
Just suffice to know that I do not base anything I say on &quot;second hand information&quot;.  If I debate with you about a given topic - it will be because I researched this topic or have first hand knowledge. <br />
<br />
<br />
To me fun is wit and humor, not stupid Mod tricks like booting or force spamming.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what I was complaining about in my posts about this forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
again no one addressing the real issue which is the joke the channle becomes when we let other classes moderate it and have the final say.<br />
<br />
I don't have the final say on anything.  I simply kick people who are spamming or abusive and try to prevent disruptions.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a great quote and sums it. Would probably have saved a shitload of rants (but then what fun what that be?) Theseverwide.steelwarrior channel is for adolescent dick waving. If you want some real information, post on the boards, do a search here or aska warrior friend. If you get lucky and get a question answered in the channel great....if not don't be surprised because anyone who hasn't had a FRONTAL LOBOTOMY knows exactly what the steelwarrior channel is all about.<br />
<br />
For someone who's name I've only ever seen in this channel once, you sure do seem to have an awfully large bastion of knowledge about its inner workings.<br />
<br />
I've actually posted this story once before on these boards because i thought it was so funny. It isn't out of the blue, you'll be able to find it if you search. Secondly If I had logs for that day they are erased by now as it was afairly long time ago.<br />
<br />
So not only are you bitter, you're obsessed with me too?<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly that is my entire point...it doesn't feel right. Thank you for admitting that. Regardless of your maturity level or knowledge of play it belittles the channel to have someone from another class moderating it.<br />
<br />
It didn't feel right to me.<br />
<br />
Obviously the warrior community didn't mind.  Obviously the owner of the warrior channel owner didn't mind, and obviously the warrior community doesn't mind, judged by the responses to the issue here.<br />
<br />
As an FYI, the only thing that &quot;belittles the warrior community&quot; is the fact that with previously five moderators, the only one who didn't abuse his powers or tolerate disruptions that turned the channel into what it is now (aside from the Time abled warrior) was the paladin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously you haven't been doing your job lol. Look at all the posts by people who claim the channel is utter crap!! This is just one thread on the subject!! Maybe the chat is just fine for you and people of your propensity but a shitload more thinks it's just assinine garbage!! Obviously a vocal minority here think chat is ok the way it is. Alot of other, frankly more intelligent posters, have disagreed.<br />
<br />
If you'll read my previous posts in this thread I am one of the biggest suppoters of fixing the channel.  However Hussar is right, Frodlin and I - though we are trying - are unable to get the channel under control by ourselves.  The new owner, Kokonut, has been extremely supportive and has made a far more able owner of the channel, thus far I'm impressed.<br />
<br />
Also it's not a matter of &quot;not doing my job&quot;, because I wasn't here when this was happening.  I was gone from late November-Early December to just this week.  And will probably CONTINUE to be gone for a couple months.  I can't rightly &quot;do my job&quot; while I'm away.<br />
<br />
<br />
I could go on and pick apart your argument but it's a waste of time. Everyone knows what the warrior channel is. To the more intelligent and mature warriors it's a joke. You are partly responsible for that as a moderator. Always remember, as a leader the buck stops with you.<br />
<br />
When I was a guild leader on my Shadow Knight on Cazic-Thule, I took full responsibility for anything the guild did, or any issues with the guild.  When I was a guild leader on Brell Serilis on my rogue Maladwen, I took full responsibility for everything my guild did.  When I was a guild officer on the Seventh Hammer I did what I could and took responsibility for the actions of the members and myself.<br />
<br />
I will not take responsibility for the channel being infested with ineptitude and ranting and raving in a channel that I have no control over when I'm, at best, a &quot;sub-leader&quot;.  My job is to assist the owner, I'm not the operator, I'm a moderator.  I assist him in his tasks.  I will not take responsibility for Ikkan or his posse of Ikkanites.  I will not take responsibility for those infected with Aclylosparidus.<br />
<br />
It wasn't my job to make sure that the warrior channel was 100% spick and span while I was away on an announced absence.<br />
<br />
It's my job to try to keep it from being disruptive while I'm there.<br />

It could not possibly be that I did not recognize your name?  Or that I don't feel it important to hunt down every single little thread to scour for a reference to me in it?<br />

You may be obsessed with me, but I'm not obsessed with making sure that a reference to my actions isn't in every single little thread in the Outhouse.</div></div><hr />

Also i know damn good and well I never cursed you in channel.  I wouldn't give you such easy excuse to boot me.<br />

Oh yes, I remember you now. That was you. And the reason Frodlin kicked you wasn't because you were &quot;abusing me&quot;. He kicked you because you were playing dramaqueen &quot;let's spam the channel with my depression&quot;.<br />

Lets see, believe the guy that I know and have respect for, or believe the random fuck who is acting a lot like he was said to have acted (especially your anti pally mod bullshit).  I'm not &quot;on his dick&quot;, if he posts something that I see as uncredible, then I'd call him on that.  The fact that he couldn't remember a dumbfuck from the chat is not remarkable, considering this whole thread is about the number of them there.  I did read the previous post, and I put a quote from between them which makes it not sound like you said.</div></div><hr />

Here I'll hold your hand through it-<br />

Go back 4 posts and read the 2 quotes I have of his one after the other<br />

Quote 1-he can't remember who I am.<br />
<br />
Quote 2-he suddenly miraculously remembers who I am and the exact words I was saying.<br />
<br />
It looks like bullshit and it smells like bullshit, because it is bullshit.<br />
<br />
I actually could give 2 shits about being kicked out of the warrior channel. The place is a joke.  It's much more fun tearing apart the arguments of idiots like Hoilley and people who support them.</div></div><hr />

When Holliy first said he didnt' know you from Adam, he said that because he didn't, there really are a lot of idiots like you that make 1-time appearances, you are a voice in a big crowd.    You were this random person complaining about him.   He remembered, and typed that he remembered, and didnt' go back and correct the fact that he didn't remember you at first.<br />
<br />
Guess what, I didn't remember you either until he reminded me.  You gonna call me a fucking liar now too?    Yes, it was me, on his account telling you that since you were incapable of figuring out how to leave a channel that you spammed the channel with a great desire to leave that I would be helpful and help you find the way out.   <br />
<br />
I kicked you man, I kicked you for spamming, but worse, I kicked you for spamming pathetic &quot;poor me&quot; crap.   Not a little, but continual spam, it was more spam than a monty python skit.   I mean, we're talking a diatribe of self flagellation and threats. I was called into the room to laugh at what you were doing and with my mouth agape, I said &quot;wow, this guy needs to be booted&quot;.    <br />
<br />
What I guess I'm getting at is your presence made the channel really shittty, about as much as your presence is making this thread really shitty.  <br />
<br />
My kid's a pretty responsible guy, and takes his responsibilities pretty seriously.  Your implication that he is willing to impersonate me is absurd because he has his own reputation, his own identity, and doesn't need to leech a damn thing off of me.   He is a mod and if he felt you needed kicking, he could do so himself, he had no need to say it was me, that would be mildly retarded.    No, I wanted you to know that your spamming of the channel was not being tolerated by me and THAT is why I said so.<br />
<br />
Now, here's the thing..... <br />
<br />
You accuse someone of lying when they remember something mid typing.   Let us not forget how this argument started.<br />
<br />
it was with this pile of infested stinking and steaming bullshit.<br />
<br />
I logged into the channel once.....frankly it sucked. It was being modded by some 11 year old kid passing himself off as the mods father (Hoilley). I know this because the father came on and told me so in tells before he booted me...lmfao.<br />
<br />
No, get your fucking facts straight before accusing others of not having theirs straight.   <br />
<br />
You had this story so fucked up it was beyond recognition.  First you thought that Holliy was the father, and that there was some 11 year old kid pretending to be while playing his toon.  This wasn't what happenned.   We both happen to be mods, but I'm more recognizable than him, therefore I'm the one who booted your ass.   I didn't do so in tells, I did it in the channel, becuase I dont' send tells to fucking wierdos, and I don't like doing cross server tells, I VERY rarely do them and CERTAINLY don't do them for people who I am banishing from my presence.   If anyone is the liar here or has the faulty memory, buddy, it's you.<br />
<br />
<br />
People like to forget you, I look forward to that day with great eagerness.   It had passed once and all was good, now that memory has been refreshed.<br />
<br />
People like you my friend are the reason why mods need to exist.   <br />
<br />
Tell me you deny this... tell me you were kicked for no reason, tell me that you were civil and weren't spamming the channel with self-absorbed nonsense.   Go ahead, I fucking dare you.    <br />
<br />
Yes, I kicked your ass out of the channel and you fell under the EXACT reasons why I kick people, because you are a fucking lunatic who can't let a single thing go by, and were spamming the everliving crap out of the channel, making it into what people were complaining about.  <br />
<br />
You are NOT reasonable, you have shown such in your short stay here on the board, you are showing the whole world EXACTLY why you were kicked, and veryifying my wisdom in doing so.  Thanks for that, I appreciate it.<br />
<br />
I find it amusing that people like you are the reason this thread exists and the irony is you don't know it.</div></div><hr />

I got slammed in channel for suggesting a pally shouldn't mod it.  Guess what, I'm sure alot of mages would agree pally's shouldn't mod their channel either, and alot of necro's, and alot of chanters.<br />
<br />
When Hoilley a bunch of others tore into me about my initial concern with idiotic bullshit then i didn't let it go.  Cause frankly if one person had given me any kind of real answer or reason I wouldn't have given a shit.  But that didn't happen.  <br />

<br />
Wow nice added drama there, but it was more like me defending myself against about 4 or 5 idiots who weren't doing anything but belittling me and earnign brownie points with your son by calling for me to booted.<br />
<br />
I stayed and defended my position stunned at the utter stupidity of the people I was interacting with.<br />

Please spare me the BS.  you know damn good and well the channel was shitty loooooooooooooong before I got there.  I just brought it to your attention and you didn't care for that.<br />
<br />
No, get your fucking facts straight before accusing others of not having theirs straight -Frodlin<br />
<br />
No you get your fucking facts straight.  When you and Hoilley are done deciding what your version of the truth is let me know.  I'll have a good laugh then.<br />
<br />
You had this story so fucked up it was beyond recognition. -Frodlin<br />
<br />
Guess what pal, I could say the same thing about you and your son.  If you think your justified in kicking me for giving back to a bunch of juvenile brats what they were giving me than your more twisted than I thought.  Did you ever explain anythign AT ALL to me about why a paladin was modding the channel?? No.  Maybe instead of assuming every new person in chat is automatically just stirring shit you should try talkign to them like a human being first.<br />
<br />
Tell me you deny this... tell me you were kicked for no reason, tell me that you were civil and weren't spamming the channel with self-absorbed nonsense. Go ahead, I fucking dare you.  -Frodlin<br />
<br />
Un-fucking-Equivocally.  The only spammers were the swarm of social rejects that came out from their rocks to assault me for asking a simple question.  i stood in and held my ground.<br />
<br />
Yes, I kicked your ass out of the channel and you fell under the EXACT reasons why I kick people, because you are a fucking lunatic who can't let a single thing go by, -Frodlin<br />
<br />
If by that you mean letting go the smear of lies you and your son are spreading than your right.  I'm new to these boards but have been playing EQ for over 4 years.  If i was such a lunatic I'm sure peopel wouldn't have anything to do with me in game.  I'd have to play a necro or some shit and solo my time away.  Now I have to have 2 dispshits like you and your son who moderate a running joke of a channel bash me on these boards before hardly anyone knows me.  Yea i'm not going to just let that go by.</div></div><hr />

Good for you! I've been playing since before Kunark, myself. Though, time spent playing doesn't always denote 'skill' or 'knowledge' or even having the ability to ' know your ass from a hole in the ground'.<br />

By the way, if a spastic, vitriol filled string of posting to the tsw channel similar to what you're doing here occurred, no fucking wonder you got booted. Clue phone ringin' and it's for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ezedriel7th Ham</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had thought that my time in EQ had allowed me to venture into the unfathomeable depths of human stupidity and get a taste of the end.  I had thought that the certain few individuals who jihad or the paladins who come in and say utterly stupid things about class balance were the ending point.<br />
<br />
I was wrong, so very, very wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whatever, I'm not going to keep repeating myself over and over.<br />
<br />
Good, does this mean you're going to be getting a clue and actualyl read others' posts?  Or does that mean you are going to leave the boards completely?  Either one is preferable.<br />
<br />
I got slammed in channel for suggesting a pally shouldn't mod it. <br />
<br />
You moron.  I honestly can't believe how stupid you are.  The fact that you repeat this is not only stupid, but it's calling Frodlin a liar - yeah you have a whole lot of &quot;respect&quot; for him don't you?  He told you why he kicked you, because you were spamming the channel.<br />
<br />
I told you, I don't care if you question a paladin being a mod, you're allowed to question it all you like.  No promises that that means anything will change, but you're allowed to question and ask all you like.  I even encourage it.  Hell flame me a little while you're at it.<br />
<br />
But what Frodlin and I care about is spamming and harassment of people while in the channel.  You spammed and harassed me and spammed and harassed people who stood up for me - read back through your posts here, tell me you haven't been doing that.<br />
<br />
Be forewarned that denial would be a lie.<br />
<br />
Guess what, I'm sure alot of mages would agree pally's shouldn't mod their channel either, and alot of necro's, and alot of chanters.<br />
<br />
You really are missing the entire point of mine and Frodlins' posts.  The fact that I'm a mod is a moot point.  It's a dead issue, you're not going to win it, it's not going to change unless Frodlin becomes the owner of the channel (I'd request that my mod powers were removed so that it did not give off the perception that I was using &quot;daddy&quot; to get ahead in life).  Really, if you're going to keep responding about how you dislike that I'm a mod, leave, because your speeches fall on deaf ears.<br />
<br />
Supposing any of us were still listening...none of us care what necros would think, or chanters would think, or mages would think.  We don't really care, becauswe're not the chanters, mage, or necro channel.  We're the warrior channel, and if you read previous posts, the warrior communtiy has no problem with me being a mod.<br />
<br />
So what in God's name is your beef?  Do you feel your vote is superior to that of the community's?  Do you have an elevated status because you got kicked by my toon by Frodlin?<br />
<br />
When Hoilley a bunch of others tore into me about my initial concern with idiotic bullshit then i didn't let it go.<br />
<br />
What idiotic bullshit?  The only idiotic bullshit was your own.  You were CONVINCED that &quot;Holliy&quot; was the father, even though it was Frodlin who was.  You were CONVINCED that there was an eleven year old child passing off to be the Holliy-father while on his toon.<br />
<br />
You lied and said Frodlin sent you tells.  You lied and said we were kicking you &quot;to repress the voice against paladin mods&quot;, you made shit up, and you proceeded to call me a liar.<br />
<br />
You did not impress anybody, least of all myself, throughout the course of this thread.<br />
<br />
I did not know you when you made your first post - it was a cess-pool of incoherent dribble that quite frankly I overlooked and laughed at.  When you began harassing people like Hussar because he called you up on your stupidity, I felt I needed to clear the situation between you and I.<br />
<br />
You won't let it drop.  You're wrong, you know it, I know it, everyone here knows it, you just don't want to step down off your soap box and admit it.<br />
<br />
Remember though, you were kicked for spamming, no other reason.<br />
<br />
 Cause frankly if one person had given me any kind of real answer or reason I wouldn't have given a shit. But that didn't happen. <br />
<br />
Your lines between &quot;real answers&quot; and &quot;shit&quot; are so horrifically skewed that it would require brown-nosing in order to give you &quot;a real answer&quot; in your eyes.  Frodlin gave you a real answer, he kicked you for spamming.<br />
<br />
The problem is you have selective reading, and only read the parts of a thread you WANT to read and then exclude everything else.  You extract from context, you call people liars without attempting to get the facts straight, and then you harass people who call you up on your absurdity.  <br />
<br />
You have a lot going for you in this arguement I can see.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow nic0e added drama there, but it was more like me defending myself against about 4 or 5 idiots who weren't doing anything but belittling me and earnign brownie points with your son by calling for me to booted.<br />
<br />
And Merc chalks up another moron point.<br />
<br />
I swear you'd think he was grinding for AA's with the amount he's getting out of this thread alone.<br />
<br />
There were four or five people saying &quot;Hate to break it to you Merc, but you don't have any evidence, you're an uncredible voice, you're loud, you're profane for no reason, you're abusive, and you're spamming, that's exactly what he claimed you got kicked for&quot;.<br />
<br />
People here aren't &quot;earning brownie points&quot;, people here are coming from far and wide to observe the Man Who Goes Too Far, it's kind of like a side-show actually.  Where it was only Frodlin coming into the room to laugh at you when it was in the channel, now you're getting warriors from far and wide who want to get a sight of the Near Sighted Wonderboy.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with the fact that it's &quot;me&quot;, it has to with the fact that you're being narrowsighted, not looking at the big picture, prejudice, abusive, AND are spamming repetitive pity-me bullshit.<br />
<br />
Read this thread, you'll know exactly why you got kicked.<br />
<br />
I stayed and defended my position stunned at the utter stupidity of the people I was interacting with.<br />
<br />
Chalk up another.<br />
<br />
stupid    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (stpd, sty-)<br />
adj. stupider, stupidest <br />
Slow to learn or understand; obtuse. <br />
Tending to make poor decisions or careless mistakes. <br />
Marked by a lack of intelligence or care; foolish or careless: a stupid mistake. <br />
Dazed, stunned, or stupefied. <br />
Pointless; worthless: a stupid job. <br />

That is the dictionary's definition of stupid.<br />
<br />
Merc's definition:<br />
<br />
stupid    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (stpd, sty-)<br />
adj. stupider, stupidest <br />
Any number of a people who disagree with him.<br />
Those who do not see his &quot;enlightened&quot; view.<br />
Any one who plays a paladin.<br />
Any one on the Steel Warrior board.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you weren't sitting in a corner, raising a balled fist and crying &quot;I don't care what all you have to say, I'm right because I have no evidence to support my claim, no credibility, only a reputation as an obsessed and self-pitying spammer, and call everyone on this board a tool and an idiot.  I am right, simply because I say so!&quot; you would be in a position to call someone stupid.<br />
<br />
Right now, you're not in a position to call Gink or Ikkan stupid.<br />
<br />
You're not in a position to call Chavr stupid.<br />
<br />
You're not even in a position to call Earnie in What's Eating Gilbert Grape stupid.<br />
<br />
Now stop already before the people at the Ronald McDonald House wet themselves with laughter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please spare me the BS. you know damn good and well the channel was shitty loooooooooooooong before I got there. I just brought it to your attention and you didn't care for that.<br />
<br />
No the channel was fine before your one shot appearance, was fine after you never came back, and only deteriorated recently for inexplicable reasons.<br />
<br />
Again, you have only been in that channel once and for a handful of moments before spamming the hell out of it.<br />
<br />
You don't get to comment on its quality.<br />
<br />
No you get your fucking facts straight. When you and Hoilley are done deciding what your version of the truth is let me know. I'll have a good laugh then.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our version of the truth&quot; eh?<br />
<br />
Well you can be content in thinking he and I are wrong.  You can go on the rest of your life happy in the thought that he and I are wrong.  You can be buried when you die with a great big happy grin because &quot;You think you're right&quot;.<br />
<br />
The fact is though, you aren't.  You don't have logs, you don't have any real recollection of what happened, you don't have any credibility, and again, your memory of that event is so poor you thought *I* was the father.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess what pal, I could say the same thing about you and your son. If you think your justified in kicking me for giving back to a bunch of juvenile brats what they were giving me than your more twisted than I thought. Did you ever explain anythign AT ALL to me about why a paladin was modding the channel?? No.<br />
<br />
Here, I have something for you:<br />
<br />
http://members.roadfly.org/Fearsons/uncle+sam+copy.jpg<br />
<br />
Your last paragraph made no sense, except that you're mad because he kicked you and I'm a paladin.<br />
<br />
But guess what, NO ONE CARES!<br />
<br />
Read this carefully: YOU WERE KICKED FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE YOU SPAMMED.<br />
<br />
Do not make a single response to this thread unless it is in acknowledgement to your spamming.  Because that's the only reason you were kicked.<br />
<br />
 Maybe instead of assuming every new person in chat is automatically just stirring shit you should try talkign to them like a human being first.<br />
<br />
We<br />
<br />
had<br />
<br />
no<br />
<br />
issues<br />
<br />
with<br />
<br />
you<br />
<br />
until<br />
<br />
you<br />
<br />
started<br />
<br />
spamming<br />
<br />
pity<br />
<br />
me<br />
<br />
bullshit.<br />
<br />
Or are you going to go around in this loop of logic all day long?  Do warn me if you intend to not shut up, I'll remember to simply wait until you exhaust your stupidity before ever returning to this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Un-fucking-Equivocally. The only spammers were the swarm of social rejects that came out from their rocks to assault me for asking a simple question. i stood in and held my ground.<br />
<br />
You never asked a simple question, you started with accusations, lies, and insults about the channel.  These were people standing up for a point you falsely ridiculed. <br />
<br />
Spammer<br />
A person who enacts in the process of creating spam.<br />
Someone who causes spam.<br />
<br />
Spam<br />
A repetitive series of lines that offers no differing points.<br />
A repetitive jumble of text often used to cause distress to others.<br />
<br />
They aren't spammers you moron.  They're defending what they believe - something you claim to be doing.  The only difference is, you're doing it out of a self-elevating desire to be right and not an actual desire to find out the truth behind the situation and try to make sure it doesn't happen again.<br />
<br />
All you want is to get some pot shots in.<br />
<br />
Obviously you want to get as many in as possible before your ship COMPLETELY sinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
If by that you mean letting go the smear of lies you and your son are spreading than your right. I'm new to these boards but have been playing EQ for over 4 years.<br />
<br />
I'll light a candle for you at church.<br />
<br />
You're an inspiration to us all.<br />
<br />
 If i was such a lunatic I'm sure peopel wouldn't have anything to do with me in game.<br />
<br />
Judging by the look of these boards and the way you acted in the channel...<br />
<br />
 I'd have to play a necro or some shit and solo my time away. Now I have to have 2 dispshits like you and your son who moderate a running joke of a channel bash me on these boards before hardly anyone knows me. Yea i'm not going to just let that go by.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not going to let it go by&quot; eh?<br />
<br />
Drag it out longer, entertain us with your inane bastion f intelliphobia.  Show us O Lord that you are truly an Alpha Male and that you &quot;won't put up with our shit&quot;.<br />
<br />
I love it when you say it because it really puts me in my place!<br />
<br />
As an FYI, you don't have &quot;two dipshits&quot; bashing you because we hardly know you, you have everyone who's responded to you in this thread (most of them VERY respectable warriors) pointing out that you have an IQ on par with about three miles of sand in the Sahara Desert.<br />
<br />
I didn't remember you at first because you spewed out a garb of intelligible dribble that I could hardly discern from the chicken scratch of a four year old child.  I thought you were some friend of Ikkan's who'd come down here on false information and tried to flame me.<br />
<br />
It turns out you're simply a moron who has his foot in his mouth and doesn't realize that he's not only pushed it over the edge, but he's now free-falling to the floor below.<br />
<br />
Wonder if you'll know when you hit the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The channel does suck and thus I dont join it. Lots of shit being said here but it is sad that the channel carries the name of this forum with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to live chat as opposed to a message board where you the user gets to decide what he or she does and does not see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone that comes here with a claim that nothing but useless drivel ever goes on in that channel ever gave it the time of day end of arguement.I spend more time chatting in that channel everyday than I do in Guild channels while raiding 6 hours a day as an officer.That chatting is 90% of the time Discussing random things with memebrs of that channel anot not spamming it with OGM CHOS IS THE WIN !1!1!! as so many like to claim happens on a constant basis in the channel.<br />
<br />
<br />
If people only log in the channel and throw it in the same box as there melee window because it is little mroe than a distraction to pass downtime with then obviously they are only going to notice when some shithead pops in and spams the channel because that is the only time the chat will mvoe along in a fevered enough base to stick out amongst all the other normal melee chat you see.<br />
<br />
<br />
In any case I have seen more inane imature and unintelligent - uninformed statements made on these baords than I ever have in that channel and as I stated earlier I have been in it and never left since Day one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I also do NOT appreciate signing in to see Fallakin telling children to commit suicide, I do NOT appreciate seeing Ultimas calling people &quot;niggers&quot;, I do NOT appreciate Ikkan screaming at people because they have a difference of opinion.<br />
<br />
The thing is, you shouldn't have to wait until a certain hour of the day in order to enjoy the channel - because some people play limited hours.<br />
<br />
And quite frankly, no on, especially a child, should not be told to kill themselves.<br />
<br />
Ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing happens on any random Message Board that you visit unless it is heavely Moderated.<br />
<br />
It's and open form of communication and everyone that use's it has different levels of tolerance as to what should and should not be allowed in it.<br />
<br />
The things that are said in my guild chat on a daily basis are often ten times worse than anything I have ever seen in that channel.It's the anonymus nature of the internet.<br />
<br />
Some people choose to approach public channels with some respect for the people that are in them and listening; and others do not.Being that they are in fact public however,there is little you can do to control such behavior outside of simply not using the medium.<br />
<br />
I do not condone the use of Racial slurs or suggesting suicide to someone or any other form of abuse to anyone ,that is my own personal apporach. I wil go out of my way to say something to said individual about it to what they take from me comenting on it is up to them though and 9 times out of ten if they had the balls to say something like that with the purpose of insulting or harming another person than what I have to say probably goes in one ear and out the other.Often it is probably the exact response they are looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said,Majority rules and in that channel the majority of the people in it do not want to hear comments like the above,It is clear when the comments are made and the backlash from channel memebrs ensues.<br />
<br />
That is where the moderators come in and what class they play or what Gender they are or what age group they represent is completely irrelevent,their job is to represent the majority in upholding a certain level respect for one another in the channel.<br />
<br />
I could care less if the Channel owner is a lvl one chanter that can't figure out how to mem his spells yet as long as he is able to recognize the channels tolerance levels towards these things and uphold them.Hoilly just that and does a fine job.</div></div><hr />
