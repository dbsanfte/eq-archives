<br />
Questions: how do hate procs from ldon work? Specifically, how much agro per proc, and what's the highest agro proc you could put on a WMBS?<br />
<br />
GSoT - weapon already has a stun proc, would it make sense to add agro proc?<br />
<br />
What's a better proc to put on a weapon, stun or hate?<br />
<br />
Thanks ;) Depending on the replies, I may be buying LDoN after all.<br />

<br />
highest stun proc is Wrath of Ykesha, at 150dd and 0 sec stun<br />
<br />
<br />
as to which one is better to use, i'm really not sure yet, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many points are we talking about to be able to afford these procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorokFV</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure about anger III and wrath of ykesha, but anger II (200 hate) is 510 and Force of Ykesha (125dd instead of 150dd) is 760, according to the post on the necro boards. i heard speculation that the next level up of those procs would be somwhere around 1150, but thats not confirmed as far as i know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to hear some tests or comparison on Anger III vs Wrath of Ykesha.  I plan on adding one of these two to my Bloodfrenzy, assuming of course this doesn't actually decrease the effectiveness of said weapon.<br />
<br />
I think armor augs are pretty obvious, either straight hp or saves, tending towards the first for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... 300 is not too much compared to 700 on EB, so it wouldn't do as a proc on its own. Maybe added to another weapon, like CHoS or GSoT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I have GBoS and BoC, I am going to add the DD stun proc to BoC (so will have EB and Stun DD) and the Anger 3 to GBoS, (so will have hate proc and Stun DD!) This should make for some pretty damn sweet aggro hopefully.  Someone please post WHICH camp u can buy these procs at tho, so I can concentrate my energies there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The agro part is of course the Stun. The 100 dmg extra is nice but not worth the extra points, unless it also procs a lot faster.<br />
<br />
So, an extra test to determine the proc rate of the different Ykesha variants would be nice. And maybe one stun generates more agro than another, or it affects higher level creatures.<br />

Does it vary? Do you get more if it is hard or is it same as normal? Have not done any as of yet, but am curious. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at level 65 you get 51 points on normal, 74 (I think) on hard.</div></div><hr />

Do other people agree with this? I would think that saving for the 150 mr dd version is worth saving for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, its well known that the stun proc is whats responsible for almost all the aggro.  DD procs are almost worthless. The DD with stun is nice, but I'm not sure its worth spending 1150 points on for 25 more DD than with 760 points.  I like the DD, but I think the funny thing is that at the lower level, the Ykesha procs are far more bang for the buck then the Anger procs. Bite of Ykesha would probably be almost as much aggro as Force of the Ykesha.  I think I'll save for the 125 dd, but not gonna spend 1150 points on 150 dd.  Its just not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uira Tawhaki</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">K. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. LOL. :)<br />
<br />
I recently aquired a SotBS to go with my CHoS so I'll be augmenting double procs on both. I may put a Spell Guard IV proc on my Crescent Blades of Luclin since those have 10 MR on them and have decent dps.<br />
<br />
I came up with a list of known procs now. Please see this (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2997) thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
150dd+stun will outagrro 300 hate with EASE.<br />
<br />
Two force strike weapons outaggro EB/TB combo no problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morimoto</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know if there's a level limit for mobs effected by the stun proc?  The only stun weap I've had is that planar stun staff from BoT and that has a special notation on lucy saying it works up to level 65.  And if the stun part of these new procs wont land, will it still generate aggro as if it did?<br />
<br />
Trying to decide whether to go after Anger procs or Ykesha procs. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Ykesha stuns only go up to level 55.<br />
<br />
And someone definitely needs to put a Ykesha proc on a swiftblade of zek.  Definitely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As said in another thread, stun procs generate same aggro (I've even heard people say the aggro is greater when resisted!) when landed as when resisted.  And it doesn't really matter if there is a level restriction, since almost NO stun will land on any mob in mid-high end PoP, as well as many mobs in higher end Velious and Luclin.  I use GBoS and I haven't had the stun land for who knows how long, but it still generates excellent aggro.  /shrug</div></div><hr />
