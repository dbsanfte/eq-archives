<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after re-rolling a warrior and all a while ago life's been pretty fun. <br />
upon his birth, i went the route of dumping most of my points into stamina and now at 38 with level 30 or so shammy buffs i'm sitting on 173 stamina; which i feel is pretty good.<br />
problem is..my strength buffed out is around 130 :(<br />
gear i have now ( sparing magelo ) basically is full crafted, ssb, crested spaulder, chitin belt, 6/65 vel ring, FG ring, and planned a wolf collar at 51 ( the 10AC +2 dodge mod one ).<br />
<br />
money for upgrades is kinda not an option (read: just exp'ing, not really farming or collecting $$$'s ), but from where i can piece things together...how's this sound for moving some gear around?<br />
<br />
shoulders --&gt; crested now ---&gt; swap to a sebilite mantle<br />
feet ---&gt; crafted now --&gt; DWB's? <br />
hands ---&gt;RFV ( the tradable ones ) --&gt; gaunts of the black? CC gaunts?<br />
ear ---&gt; i think the orc fangs are it.. no idea really.<br />
face --&gt;grobb hide mask ---&gt; really lost here. i don't think there's a cheap upgrade for this.<br />
waist --&gt; chitinous belt...a TBB would be nice but i think the overall stats on chitinous belt would drop the AC too much.<br />
<br />
weapon wise i have lammy/centi ss/mith 2Her/crafted brawl stick/wally tooth/kunzar ku'juch with some crazy bow ( twisted longbow?). overall my AC is 799, hp's around 1710 which seem more than respectable.<br />
it's funny, i have one WR bag now, and with all my gear i carry ( basically the weapons listed + grobb meat/10lb. halas pie ) looting one item leaves me encumbered.<br />
<br />
down the road for upgrades i'm leaning towards i guess thurg gear/RZ stuff, but i noticed a lot of the RZ gear doesn't have +str attributes.<br />
<br />
i think except for the shoulders i'm kinda stuck with just shooting for buffs to get the str up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i scoped out a maelstrom cloak but the thing is just too damn heavy :(<br />
<br />
i forgot all about the hero bracer though; would be a decent swap with my granite bracer.</div></div><hr />

This one runs for about 10k on AB, but will come down i guess -<br />
its a nifty thing with nice stats.<br />
<br />
+ remember at lvl45 the cobalt stuff will start working for you<br />
(boots has a str30 buff - however if you are allways shaman buffed they will probably be overwrited).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get some cobalt boots, you will love the raw AC and self +25 str buff. Always handy when your group finds a chanty and no shammy.. happens a lot at this time in PoP.. even after the patch :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, the TBB is damned nice for a str boost, I still keep mine around for when I'm smithing. :)  Cobalt boots have str of kunzar clickable effect, +25 str, great for when there's no shaman around.   Hero bracer is a good call.  Also, until you can get into velious quest armor, get a barbed ringmail tunic, and swap out some of your crafted pieces that have useless stats( and several do, the wisdom and charisma on the helm come to mind)  :)  and get a few pieces of crustacean shell.  It's cheap, and some of thie pieces have both STR and STA....cant remember which off the top of my head.   Crystal chitin gauntlets and spider fur collar are nice for str as well.  I want to say crystal chitin arms are ac 18 and boost str too, but I cant access alot of game sites form work, so cant say for sure.  (If you're high enough level and either belong to or are friends with a good guild, indicolite arms from hate are a good str boost too)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only prob is that the cobalt effects won't work until 45 or so :(. <br />
one of my hunting buddies lent me the gloves to see if they'd work but alas You are not the appropriate level blah blah.<br />
The Bazaar is quite interesting on Test Server; lots of deals can be found on the common stuff but onto the more utility/higher level gear things start to thin out dramatically.<br />
<br />
I also forgot to mention that now i have 2 crustacean shell bracers too; ditched out the granite bracer and one of these days maybe the two of us can go get annihilated by the Mino Hero :D. Ahh, the memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember growing up as a woodelf warrior, till i was 60 i was unbuffed at 150str, alittle higher than yours but I ran with some ideas like mentioned above. If your a social player like i am, Head to ME, and listen for Axelgroth Belt rotting call. nice ac, nice str and wis  its no drop so people tend to let it rott unless people are there for that exact reason</div></div><hr />
