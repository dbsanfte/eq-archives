<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I finished getting the EF pts for the anger 3 aug.  Due to doing quite a few non EF advs, I am @ 100 pts shy of being able to get the 2nd aug.  My question is do you think I should equip the offhand with the anger 3 aug or spend the pts on the EF armor where I could almost get 2 pieces for the same price or get other items (ac aug in BB).  I currently use the Great Blade of Storms (a3 auged) and the SotBs in my offhand.  That is 3 agro procs.  I dont raid much so I doubt seeing a whole lot of weapon upgrades in my near future.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i wouldn't worry about angering the SotBs, hopefully you'll upgrade that piece of trash sooner or later, sooner then you would upgrade the LDoN armor you would buy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am using a BoC in my main and a CHSD in my off hand.  I only augmented the BoC since I am planning on upgrading the offhand, and with WA2 I am very happy with the number of procs that I am getting.  Every now and again I will hit a dry spell, but having an extra proc on the off hand is not going to make or break things.  If you feel that you need the extra proc there, add something cheaper like anger2 since you will undoubtedly be upgrading that offhand weapon in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I would first have to ask do you have agro problems or not. in normal groups do you have problems holding agro or not from your slowers and DPS people? If you do then I would say get a Anger 2 aug for the offhand and that is it, but if you are not having agro problems then I would say do not aug it. Looking at your HP I would suggest getting that up either by getting armor upgrades if the LDON armor is a upgrade or by getting a few of the 40HP augs for Chest, boots, arms, head, and sleeves. Now having said that I would probably only aug the BP with that 40HP aug and upgrade the other slots. You might want to try starting some Hard LDON groups and getting the armor upgrades like that. Some really good armor in Hard LDON.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize that once you unlock the item in the vendor with EF points, you can spend points earned in any camp to buy the item? not sure if i'm getting this right but it sounds like you bought one and are only looking at your EF points and not total points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The 100 pts shy is all my pts combined in the camps.  I havent had a huge agro contain problems and I havent tried the a3 aug yet as I just got it last night at 2am in the morning.  I guess I was just thinking about finishing off the agro I would possibly need then moving on to ac and hps.<br />
<br />
Im thinking the EF armor may be better for me than the NRO armor.  At half the cost and usually not a large decrease in ac adn hps, they seem a bit more attractive.  I usually only get to do 4-6 ldons a week so you are only talking 300pts or so a week.  Takes a long time to add up to the cost of Tak armor.<br />
<br />
Should I be looking at hp upgrades or AC?  I can get the 10 ac augs in BB for 510.  I know it all adds up but 40hps seem so small when mobs are hitting you for much larger amts of dmg per wack.  I know hps and dmg avoidance will improve with AAs but that of course, is down the road.<br />
<br />
I also have the Staff of the four winds.  I use that in SA mode when DPS is preferred.  Should I use the pts to aug that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe it is just me, but I would not buy anger 3 for offhand.  That's a lot of points for a very low proc rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what the other ppl are saying ... GBoS is a good weapon that you'll use for a while, worth the points investment.  SotBS you will probably be looking to upgrade.  I dont think it would be worth spending the points on Anger 3 for your offhand when you get less of a return on them than for mainhand and you wont be using that weapon forever.<br />
<br />
Better to spend them on armour / hp / ac augs.<br />
<br />
An opinion on the Tak armour vs the EF armour though... I was a big fan of the cheaper EF armour until someone put it like this to me:<br />
<br />
the difference between Tak and EF armour is something like 5AC, 15hps couple of saves.  If there was an aug you could buy for 700points that gave 5ac, 15hps and didnt take up an aug slot you would probably buy it... yeah?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just get one of the cheap weapon procs from 50 - 150 points since it looks like you'll upgrade soon and spend the ldon points on either some armor or hp / ac augments.<br />
<br />
Yes, EF armor set is probably the best bang for the buck warrior armor set, since NR armor is 1492.  It's all a question of how soon would you max out your armor with EF armor and be stuck looking for upgrades and wishing you bought the NR armor instead.  Personally, either armor set looks good to me, but I'm working on the NR BP because I don't think that is something I would get an upgrade for anytime soon and I want to get the best HP/AC/Stat combo I can for that slot.  If I'm going to get a 40 hp augment for it later, I'd feel much better having gotten the 100 hp BP than the 75 hp BP.<br />
<br />
So, as long as the EF armor has 3 augment slots and you've got points there and don't see yourself getting any ornate or GoD or hard ldon drops soon, go for it.</div></div><hr />
