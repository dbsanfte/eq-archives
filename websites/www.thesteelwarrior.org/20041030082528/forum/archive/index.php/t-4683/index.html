<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kanamarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im looking for a good place to hunt in the 30s. No LDoN yet or LoY. Ive tried OT but it was kinda slow (duo w/ uber twinked 30 cleric). any advice is appreciated, thx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Overthere is a great place, just get a full group instead of duoing. Unless you're twinked too, kills will be too slow if it's just you and a cleric. You get bonuses to experiences for each person you add to the group, and the mobs die faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mons Seru?  Take a right at the column in Netherbian Lair and you'll come to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really gotta recommend getting LDoN. <br />
<br />
I've been playing a cleric twink on and off and found about 3/4 of the group offers I get are for LDoN adventures, and setup time aside you get more XP, Loot and fun from doing a couple of adventures than you ever will from XP grinding in the overthere.  I was pretty dubious as to how much fun a pickup group of level 30 somethings could be, but so far the bulk of my LDoN experiences have been positive ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN is easily best. Other good places though...SolA, Crystal Caverns Were good for me on different characters. maybe Kaesora and Dalnir, though I never used them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Infected Paw. Advantages: nice loot, melee can bind relatively close in NK and good dungeon bonus to xp. Disadvantages: Gnolls run and are social; tough to duo with root as your only protection against runners and crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kahael Gibran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">paw. lguk, kaesora (dangeous if you dont know how to get out), sol a, Highkeep, Overthere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sadly most people are above 50. It can be hard finding groups at that level...but there's usually 1, maybe 2 groups going in OT. Other then that, get LDoN. Everywhere else is almost deserted. At about...35? You can head over to DL. There's more fun places out there but there's noone there.</div></div><hr />
