<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few gems from the patch today:<br />
<br />
- Damage Over Time Spell Foci - Extended Affliction has been changed to Burning Affliction, which causes DoT spells to do more damage instead of having a longer duration. <br />
<br />
- Kindle - We have added a new Magician spell to the game called Kindle. <br />
<br />
- Force of Akera - We have added a new Paladin spell to the game called Force of Akera. <br />
<br />
- Burnout V - this spell should now stack with the Shielding line of spells. <br />
<br />
- New Spell levels for Clarity line - Boon of the Clear Mind is now a level 44 spell, Clarity II is now a level 52 spell and Gift of Pure Thought is now level 56. <br />
<br />
- Draught of Lightning - We have added a new Wizard spell to the game called Draught of Lightning. <br />
<br />
- Frenzied Burnout - this ability has been changed to better stack with the Burnout spells. The attack speed portion of the spell has been reduced in percentage (it hastes the pet much less), but changed to a &quot;bard&quot; haste which will stack with Burnout V. The strength bonus has also been decreased but made to stack with that of Burnout V.<br />
<br />
- Sneak - Sneak will now work under water. <br />
<br />
- Instill Doubt - Instill Doubt will now work if the Monk is using his other skills. Previously, use of other skills such as a kick would cause Instill Doubt to fail. <br />
 <br />
<br />
I wonder if SoE is activly trying to get people to quite playing warriors.  Almost every class got something this patch, but one.  Sure is good to be special I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What I dont understand, is they give things like Kindle, Draught of Lightning, new Imbue spells and Force of Akera... <br />
when NOONE asked for such things...<br />
<br />
sure imbuing was a bit annoying, but i dont remember enchanters whining 2 months about it.<br />
<br />
And Force of Akera.... a 1 second cast stun that last 4 seconds, using so little mana?...<br />
<br />
they are obviously doing their best to make the Unbalance bigger..<br />
<br />
seriously..<br />
<br />
HOW THE FUCK CAN A COMPANY BE THIS RETARDED!?!?!?<br />
AND WHY????<br />
<br />
There is no reason to it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My number 1 alt is a mage, and been playing her more lately, as aa grinding gets old at times.  The best part about Kindle...mages don't even really want it.  It takes a useless pet(post 50 fire pets), and makes them...still useless.  And yet this was more important to SoE than class balancing.  I am so mad right now I can barely think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HOW THE FUCK CAN A COMPANY BE THIS RETARDED!?!?!?<br />
AND WHY????<br />
<br />
They are not retarted, they are just EVIL, they are doing exactly what they want to do....KILL OF THE WARRIOR CLASS.  I just wish they had come out with a patch about a year ago that said....&quot;We have removed the Warrior class from the game.&quot;  and saved themselves and us alot of grief and time.  But Sony is EVIL and has decided to make it a long and painful death, probably to provide themselves with additional amusement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish they were evil... really I do..<br />
I'd feel much better at hating them...<br />
<br />
But right now they're seriously not evil. Just pathetic.<br />
<br />
They are a group of amateurs with a lot of money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you see that EQ2 movie? with those two completely incompetent people doing Public Relations? I felt sorry for them hah...<br />
It felt as if they were lost...<br />
and they are.<br />
<br />
They are clueless, incompetent and yes.. RETARDED.<br />
<br />
I just hope it's only the online division that is as pathetic as this.<br />
Because Sony would be comdemned to a Bankrupty otherwise.¨<br />
<br />
ps.<br />
<br />
EQ2 is going to be the biggest pile of shit in history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, the wizard spell was asked on graffe... and you absor read graffe heavily (see the recent deepest guk thread on this forum). If I remember well, wizards have a magic draught at 63 with a stun component, occuring lots of unnecessary aggro.<br />
<br />
Of course it doesnt change the fact that SOE doent give a chit about warriors...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guys, stop overreacting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there is nothing about warriors in the &quot;next update&quot; thing on EQlive.<br />
Also there was post on EVERY class boards about how much our aggro suck in pop. even wizards that think all melees need to surround mobs and mash taunt, the MT a little more than others, think we need something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sony/VI resurrected Rev. Jim Jones and stocked up the Kool Aid...it'll all be fixed soon :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but at this moment, I need more details than that to even begin to believe it.  I hope you are right, but when a patch like this happens, it really makes you wonder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Umm actaully this gives me hope...<br />
<br />
Paladins have been saying for a while that they have a hole in their stun line in the 50s...and this fits in. And from the feedback I have seen on PoN, that is a spendy spell mana wise when they get it. It was asked for, and seems to be needed (within the class). <br />
<br />
I don't read the enchanter board--what eveer it is--but I just ran across comments from Wizards on Graffe's that the clarity line does not make any sence in its distribution and should be lowered to make them more useful when they are gotten.<br />
<br />
I am still a little scetchy on the new wiz spell, but appretly is almost an exact clone of an existing spell, minus the insta-stun, on a different resist line, closing a hole they had. <br />
<br />
All these are reletively small fixes, going over rough spots where classes were lacking abilities they have before and after the rough spot. <br />
<br />
And there are a lot of issues that are tied into warriro agro. Add to that Sony is not happy with melee dps in the 'very high end' which complicates the matter, and our fix, as usually has much further reaching consiqunces than any of these changes.<br />
<br />
I would just feel better if they had any modeling tools for their changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Guys, stop overreacting.<br />
<br />
They are working on warrior and the intitial taunt issue, I promise. I think you will be pleased with the results. <br />
<br />
No offense Solinar, because I respect the work you've done on this board, but I'm not gonna get my hopes up.  Even tho Furor's aggro idea is now on FoHguild.org buried in the EQ board somewhere, I really, really doubt that they even know how this game is played anymore based upon the bullshit that has been revealed via Raex BP.<br />
<br />
I don't think that they don't care, I think they're just too stupid to know/see what's going on in their own game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think they are working on the taunt problem.  Most likely they just dont know exactly what to do about it.  Listen to Solinar, I think he knows what he's talking about.<br />
<br />
As far as itemization goes, it's pretty clear they think 3-400 hps is a wide enough gap between time-geared warriors and paladins.<br />
<br />
The stun makes sense.  Paladins could stun mobs for all of their career except from 55-60 ish.  Now they can do it their entire career.  The new stun is higher mana cost than their 61? stun.  This isn't really a jump in power for them, it just evens them out for all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I would like to know,<br />
is if they're working on Taunt..<br />
<br />
WHY? do we not hear anything about it?...<br />
it's in their best interest to keep our hopes up.<br />
Why arent they saying &quot;We know of this issue, and are doing our best to fix it&quot;?... it's easy, it's efficient.... but they don't do it.<br />
why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I will be the first to say SoE has never been the greatest at communication with player base.  Its something I think they have tried to improve, but they still have a ways to go.<br />
<br />
As far as communication on this issue goes, Im pretty sure they have stated they want to do something about the warrior taunt issue.  I dont recall if it was the letter from the producer or on a message board or where it was, but I do recall seeing it in an official capacity.<br />
<br />
I really, really doubt that they even know how this game is played anymore based upon the bullshit that has been revealed via Raex BP<br />
<br />
I can tell you for positively certain, the Raex BP is not the &quot;warrior taunt fix&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As far as I'm aware, the most positive thing we've heard was that one of their  design team (forgotten name) said at a question panel at a fanfaire  'we really ought to give warriors a taunt that works'. That was several months ago at least and we've heard nothing in their official to do summaries since.  There has been a massive furore on the messageboards for months and no spokesperson has even give us a non-specific 'stroking' post.<br />
<br />
Not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am glad to hear they are looking at our aggro some but I still the the #1 issue in the game atm is the aggro locking that is achieved from stuns. I 2 box with a Pali friend from time to time lately that 2 boxes a cleric. Both of us are 65 and seperated by 103HP. We fought in Tatics Tuesday night, he cast 4 stuns on the elite guards then switches to his cleric for the next few minutes and never loses aggro. This is with slows, nukes, any melee. The only thing that seems to be even remotely close to getting the aggro off and then it only happens for a second or two is the snare line of spells. I just think that takes to much out of the game, but for 2 boxing, farming, or just getting easy exp it's great. Oh well, I think Shik said it on another post somewhere. I will continue to play from time to time but they sure have made RL the easy choice now when I get bored, screw starting some other class that I do not like to play anyways and still seeing the same issue right in front of me. I'll be out when needed on raids and some occasional groups but I'm done for a while until they start really trying to fix this. As for EQ2, selling any more Vaio's, Tapes, monitors or anything else with their logo on it....just not sure. I know they are different divisions but atm I just don't feel like sending them any more money than I absolutely have to........</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is the information you're basing your opinion that you're certain they're fixing taunt, it happened MONTHS ago, and they haven't attempted to ask this community, nor any other community for any input on the problem, nor have they given us any update on their progress or even an indication that they're still working on it.<br />
<br />
Patch message after patch message goes by, and it's the same dissappointment.  I can say i'm gonna do the dishes today, but it doesn't mean shit until they're actually done, and near as ANYONE can tell, SoE hasn't even filled up the sink yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Solinaar, <br />
I am unsure of if you play on test or have some other inside connection, but to spout that they are working on our issues and then to not substaniate that information with details of how you obtained  it or when we can expect to hear of the changes is an insult to intelligence and hope.<br />
<br />
Until word comes through more official channels, aka Absor, the dev corner, or the comming soon messages, we must assume that the devs do not care and are not working on it and that changes are not going to be made any time this year.<br />
<br />
The casters and hybrids getting upgrades is just another sign in a long list that SOE/VI could care less that our portion of their customer base exists. <br />
<br />
I would be overjoyed to be proven wrong. However, history and SOE so far have shown my point of view to be all too true. <br />
<br />
Until we have difinitive proof that our issues are no longer being ignored, we should continue on with plans of an organised petition of what we want. Hopefully we will come to a consensus soon and start being able to sign something.<br />
<br />
Until then:<br />
<br />
FUCK OFF VI!</div></div><hr />

Not true.  It just may not have been a community you are a part of.<br />

<br />

Im sorry if you are insulted, I cannot help that.  I hope you understand that if a person was privy to information of this type, that person would also be bound by a non disclosure agreement as well as a personal sense of morality and honor in respect to the disclosure of information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, that sounds slightly hopeful... I hope you'll forgive me if I remain somewhat less than optimistic about the results  however :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It seems odd to me that Sony would go somewhere else for feedback on this issue as this community is widely regarded as the best Warrior community in Everquest. I am not doubting you Solinar in the least I guess I just question Sony's actions and motives behind going elsewhere to gather concerns about our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">theres two good rules to follow when dealing with EQ communications:<br />
<br />
1.  that female character is actually a guy<br />
2.  the guy claiming to have secret inside infos is lying.<br />
<br />
I hope youre right, Sol, but experiance makes me doubt all such &quot;hush hush&quot; tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm inclined to believe if this information cannot be discussed then Solinar's information conduit is probably strictly 'unofficial' and probably technically in breach of trust.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah, because what would the world be like if everyone knew the taunt fix that SoE was working on before it was released.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">SOE isn't going to say much about taunt until they have actually figured out what the fix is. They are not going to say &quot;we are working on fixing taunt&quot; and risk building up expectations that won't be met if they can't come up with something they think is balanced. Once they have a fix that they think is the right fix, then you will hear about it.<br />
<br />
And Force of Akera.... a 1 second cast stun that last 4 seconds, using so little mana?...<br />
 So little mana? Right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I never said it made sense - neither did solinar. Fact remains if someone was legally bound not to say anything then nothing can be said. Damn it Graal stop reading my thoughts :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Gral, <br />
Back in febuarary, VI released a comment on the Dev corner to the effect that they would be working on agro. So what you said about them not working up expectations by not releasing info about a possible future fix is a bit exagerated.<br />
<br />
Solinar,<br />
Really now, if you have info and you can't share it wouldn't you be better served to not even say you have info. <br />
<br />
I am not personally insulted by your statement. However, your statement insinuated that every person who has gone through and evaluated SOE's statements and actions regaurding warriors and our issues and come to the conclusion that SOE is not making changes and doesn't care is wrong, and have made the wrong conclusion. Thereby insulting the intellegence of those posters.<br />
<br />
At the same time you offer absolutly no proof to corroborate your claims but expect us to blindly believe you, further insulting the intelligence of the posters here. (AKA they can not form their own conclusions about SOE's actions and must follow yours.) You also offer no explanation about how you might have come into the informaion you wont share. <br />
<br />
So for any prudent, intelligent poster who is accutomed to making conclusions based on actions and statement that have actually occured instead of mere conjecture, you are full of crap until you put your money where your mouth is.<br />
<br />
If you have signed some sort of NDA with SOE, then simply telling us that you have done so and how you came to be in such terms would most likely be acceptable proof that you are privy to such insider information and make your statement much more believable.<br />
<br />
Until then, it is harmful to raise the community's hope based on an unsubstantiated claim that you know SOE is going to fix it.  To do so would mean another &quot;lets wait and see&quot; attitude from the communtity which has gained little in the 18 months that our problems have been steadily growing.<br />
<br />
I would rather have no hope of news than the incomplete conjecture that you have given us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">We're not asking them to divulge any information...<br />
just a simple &quot;We know the issues warriors have, and we are trying to work on it&quot;....<br />
that's all...<br />
<br />
They don't need to do anything... they don't need to have a solution ready to go.. all they need to do, is KNOW we're having problems.<br />
<br />
And without any ocmmunications from their part, we'll never know that they know.<br />
Which is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have the sneaking suspicion that even if they are working on this issue, the complexity of code which has been patched and patched throughout the lifetime of this product makes them uncertain when and if they can fix it, until such time as they're sure the fix is in, they won't want to paint a big fat bullseye on their butts :p</div></div><hr />

Sol did state that he couldn't disclose the information with this line:<br />

I hope you understand that if a person was privy to information of this type, that person would also be bound by a non disclosure agreement as well as a personal sense of morality and honor in respect to the disclosure of information. <br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I'm still in the wait and see camp, but I am also in the camp that thinks a word from a more official source is in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Heh I love how you guys are all trashing the messenger.  Solinar has done large amounts of very technical work in the past, that has resulted in a lot of revelations on Steelwarrior.  Anyone who has not been here that long should not be bashing him for saying what he is.<br />
<br />
And if you guys are so privy to shooting the messenger boy, then I think we just found our reason that SoE hasn't said jack shit to us.  I don't really care whether he has the inside information or not; but it is sure as hell obvious that he's not going to disclose it.  Without Sol's statements at all though, I also noticed, like Kailyn, that this patch was dedicated not only to zone revamps, but also to fill holes in certain classes.  Believe it or not, I don't think SoE is trying to completely hose us; it's just worked out that way so far.<br />
<br />
True, they haven't said anything.  True, they haven't DONE anything (at least recently).  But I am given hope by the fact that they are working at filling holes in other classes; our turn will be soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have no problems with Solinar, just his message.<br />
<br />
An unsubstantiated claim that leads us to sitting on our duffs blindly hoping we will hear anything from SOE will not get us very far.<br />
<br />
Even Solinar stating that he is under an NDA with SOE would be enough to lend him credit in my book. <br />

Until then, I will not be led by  blind hope that our problems are getting fixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Believe it or not, I don't think SoE is trying to completely hose us; it's just worked out that way so far. <br />
<br />
I actually agree with this.  Nothing in this patch is in and of itself a bad thing(well, maybe Kindle, but that is a whole seperate issue about how SoE totally has screwed up mage fire pets), it was simply that when SoE decided to 'fill holes in certain classes', the class with the largest hole was not filled.  I agree, most likely Sol is right, and they are working on it(tho I will not count on it till I see it), and it is a big problem, and so is taking longer.  The rational side of me has no real problem with that.  The other side of me tho sees yet another patch go by, with more stuff for mana using classes, more newbie quests, more for everyone, but the single most glaring issue in EQ yet again not addressed, and I wonder if it is even worth grinding out them aa's.  Maybe I should just play the mage full time, they still have a roll(and a nearly useless fire pet that SoE gives us C2 for now, so it can chain cast more roots, snares, and other other crap).</div></div><hr />

- New Filters - We've added a Melee Warnings filter.  It will filter out &quot;cannot see your target&quot; and &quot;cannot hit them from here&quot; messages, along with other such melee warnings.<br />
<br />
<br />
This means you can toggle your options so that when the mob runs off to kill the enchanter and you are trying to get it back and are too far away to hit it or taunt it you won't even friggen know it.  <br />

If you are going to be inept at holding aggro, it is important to attempt to achieve perfection! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">heh, you know on the cleric boards, you could almost swear the first few posts of this thread are the same for their patch message thread.  Think I even commented on that one that warriors were left out too.  Upgraded Imbue lines...woohoo...now I can imbue several at once...whoopie my life is easier.  Nah, all it gave in the real sense was to a few more clerics who were fast the chance to get imbue spells for deities other than theirs.  It's not any upgrade like componentless ferocity for bst, 61 stun for paladins, nuke for wizards, underwater sneak for rogues (boy, I can almost hear the cheering on that one)<br />
<br />
How about this?  Paladins, at level 53, get the ability to stun mobs up to 61.  Nice for them huh?  90 mana for it, and trust me, at that level that's a pretty nice chunk of mana.  It's even a nice amount all the way to 61, although getting less and less problematic.<br />
<br />
Clerics are a little annoyed at the whole dot thing for symbols (which are more of a necessity in PoP than a luxury).  In a time when pretty much every class that has a component based line has their highest one component-less, clerics still shell out for their buffs.  Also add in the fact (considering a level 53 paladin spell can hit up to 61) that their level 58 stun cannot land on mobs higher than 55 (when we're supposed to fight mobs equal or higher level, our 58 stun cannot do so), and clerics feel rather left out as well.<br />
<br />
The whole enchanter thing is enchanters get single target and group versions of clarity and clarity 2...yet the group clarity came 2 levels before c2 (when group clarity is worthless), and group c2 came 1 level before KEI (which is group anyways).  All they did was lower the levels and make them more spread out.  It's much nicer spread now, and makes better sense.<br />
<br />
Still doesn't make much sense for the lack of attention to warriors.  Many people would just like a dev to come in and just say that they ARE looking into the problem at least, and not just come to hype up some expansion or spew some advertising.  Problem is, there's been so little attention from devs towards warriors...it'll nearly be a feeding frenzy when they finally do.  All I can ask them, if they are in fact working on something...no knee-jerk reaction when implemented.  Please.  Put it in, let warriors realize that, yes indeed you are trying to give them SOMETHING while you're making every other class in this game preferable to warriors.<br />
<br />
I noticed on the LDoN teaser, the info saying &quot;new spells&quot;.  I'm thinking the only way warriors would ever possibly get anything NEW is if they got it as an activateable spell (kinda like LoH and HT for Pally/SK), as the only new things the developers seem capable of adding is...new spells.<br />
<br />
Warriors are almost a dead class, with no cleric in sight.  We'd grab a paladin for the rez, but I think we'd rather use him to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Szerath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I believe they have a fix when I see it in action..and see that it works as a fix. Untill then we can do nothing but plod forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I don't doubt what Solinar says, or at least that he believes it.  However, all the evidence, other than a few very questionable suggestive quotes here and there, indicates that the problem isn't even on SoE's radar.  Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.  But they sure haven't said IT IS.<br />
<br />
Eight months and counting.  I'm sure that if they are working on it that they want to be sure it doesn't throw things further out of whack.  Yet I also see expansion after expansion how some class or other gets some huge boon handed to them that takes them months and months to neutralize, long after the class impacted has reaped huge rewards, and when someone is behind the eight ball and struggling, they can't seem to make up their minds on what to do.<br />
<br />
It's a tad disheartening to be honest.  You begin to distrust them.  Not that you distrust their intentions mind you.  Rather you begin to distrust that they are capable of understanding the impact of the things they do and begin to believe they are so gun shy that they'll let something negative continue indefinitely because doing anything might make it worse.  How many expansions will it take until they take action?  I've seen LoY so far.  And we have lost dungeons of Norrath coming up, anyone giving odds on if it will be fixed before the release of LDoN?  I'm dubious.<br />

It just leaves a bit of a bitter taste in the mouth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Furor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">While I am under no such NDA, pasting the entire post about proposed taunt changes would probably be in bad taste.<br />
<br />
If you are talking to those guys, you better make it clear that PAL and SHD (and RNG for that matter) should under NO circumstances be given this taunt change. They already have 'taunt energy.' We call them spells.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the idea is sound and definitely welcome.</div></div><hr />

They have given the Bards the old Monk FD, Rangers the Instant invis, just need to upgrade that to Rogue SoS levels now, and Pal/Sk almost equal warrriors, all they need is defensive... <br />

Well I have no sense of mortality and honor (strange I play a pally I know) but I am under a NDA and have been for years so I know the full ramifications of signing a NDA and what happens if you breach said NDA. Also info covered under the nda may not seem like it needs to be but you would be surprised what the bosses get upset about if they find you talking to someone outside of the NDA about it.<br />
