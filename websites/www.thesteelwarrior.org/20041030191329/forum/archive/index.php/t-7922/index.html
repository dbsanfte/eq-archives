I'm thinking the Blade of Strategy would probably buy me the better aggro...anybody think otherwise?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Will be similar aggro, but u can sell the Sword of the Bloodsworn, so do that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I aggree that the red epic is a little better aggrowise than SotB so if they are both auged alike go for the epic (have prime damit) and sell back the common SotB.<br />
<br />
Note . till you aug the GBoS put the epic in main (5.8 proc / min is better than 3.7 proc / min, especially when the normal epic proc is bigger aggro then the GBoS' proc)<br />
<br />
Yoda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen the proc on my red epic get resisted so many times it's not funny.  I'm assuming that if the proc is resisted that the net result is no increase in hate.  Because of this I bagged the red epic for the SotB ... the proc is resisted a LOT less, and even when it is the hate from the attempted stun is still applied.<br />
<br />
Or am I wrong?<br />
<br />
Either way, my mainhand is now a CHoS with an Anger 3 aug ... wow is that nice ... Incite + Anger 3 proc = teh win !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm assuming that if the proc is resisted that the net result is no increase in hate.<br />
As mentioned in the other weapon thread, resists still produce aggro, whether they are stuns or epic procs. Your assumption is wrong. :)<br />
<br />
But the SotB is still a better weapon IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As mentioned in the other weapon thread, resists still produce aggro<br />
<br />
Sure, but what part of the proc is producing aggro?  The resisted DD?  Surely a resist doesn't also add 400 hate?  I guess what I meant by no net increase in hate was that 400 raw hate isn't added on a red epic resist.<br />
<br />
In this case, wouldn't a resisted stun proc produce more aggro than the resisted DD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Epic is shit, always has been, that is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a resisted nuke/proc gives the same aggro as it if hit for full ... kinda the same as a missed swing produces the same amount of hate as a swing which lands for full.<br />
<br />
keep all 3 weapons ... augments will be removable this thursday and reusable ... so i would put anger2 GBoS in primary and anger2 red epic offhand ... after you remove the aug then sell the SoTBS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, there's a thread somewhere around here that says that hate modifying procs still modify hate regardless of resists.  <br />
<br />
I don't buy into it tho, just because of the red epic.  This is a weapon that people said the same thing about it for years &quot;Man, this is great, when it lands.  When it gets resisted tho, I can't pull aggro for shit&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;So a resisted Rage of Vallon still produces 400 hate?&quot; <br />
<br />
This is question that many here have answered with a YES but I still wonder.  In the dark past when I was using my epics I hated to goto areas with fire mobs, it really seemed to me that the hate never worked on a resist.<br />
<br />
Yes I know that stuns still agro and resisted  dd's still agro but the war epic proc is a unique proc, the first pure hate and it still to this day has an icon on the target for the duration of the effect what ever it is.  So my point is we dont really have anything to go by its a one and only. <br />
<br />
  About 2 months ago I used two reds on a raid in SolRo (was not MT) and never once did I get agro without taunting.   Think I will go back with a exp group and use the two reds (fire based procs NEVER land in SolRo or PoF at least on mobs I have killed).<br />
<br />
just my 2 coppers<br />
Rodney</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would use the Red epic simply because every other warrior out there has a SotBS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would use the Red epic simply because every other warrior out there has a SotBS <br />
<br />
Right, cuz it'd be way better to use something that doesn't work over something that does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's why I DW my Combine Scimitars still, over using my BoW. Lots of people have BoWs, very very few people have combine scimitars :D<br />
<br />
  On a more serious note, it is only when two weapons have very close aggro generation that looks can come into play. The epic has a worse ratio, better proc *if the hate works when the proc is resisted*... I'd call it an even match and use the epic, again *IF the hate works on a resist*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd use the redblade offhand.  <br />
<br />
The difference in DPS from the offhand is gonna be jackshit, it looks 50x better, and when the proc lands it is more hate which is the most important part.<br />
<br />
I used the epic 2hs as my main weapon for a while and I'm pretty sure I remember resisted procs still turning mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Assume detrimental effects (snare, stun, debuff, etc.) all function like a successful taunt and put the offending PC on the top of the hate list (this is why chain casting a quick-cast, no-mana, lvl 5 stun or snare produces agro lock, it is essentially a no-fail taunt). DD's and Melee damage add hate equal to the maximum potential damage, even if you miss or it's resisted. <br />
<br />
I think adding hate is a separate from Damage and detrimental effects and has little or no effect if resisted (no taunt, no DD effect), so an effective Blade of strategy proc yeilds 100 hate from the DD (max potential) plus additional 500 hate for total of 600 (alot).  A resisted proc should add 100 hate for the DD effect, no effect for the failed 500 hate, or the net equivalent of one extra swing (whoopee!).<br />
<br />
SotBS proc gets you a successful taunt (strait to the top of the hate list) plus 75 hate (for DD) for every proc regardless of wether or not it is resisted. The key is the successful taunt that puts you on top. As long as you ride the top of the list you are doing your job effectively. On top by 1 or 1000 doesn't matter as long as you can stay there or get back there within a cpl seconds.<br />
<br />
Blade of Strategy probably generates more raw hate that SotBS, but SotBS is better at keeping you on top of the hate list which, in the end, is what it all about. <br />
<br />
The addition of a 0 second stun to the Blade of Strategy would go along way to fixing the warrior epic 1.0 (making it roughly equal to the SotBS on a fail, and sooo much more on success). <br />
<br />
(And put 41% haste on the Blade of Tactics while you're at it, so we can be like the other fighting epics and we won't have to take up a valuble slot with a lame AC haste item.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why the fuck would you assume that when I have held aggro thru all snares, stuns and debuffs?<br />
<br />
a.) Because only us crazy warriors and those rude knights who try to show us up actually WANt agro. everyone else tries to avoid it and help you keep it.<br />
<br />
b.) Because it is a simple way of looking at a complex issue<br />
<br />
c.) because in addition to your taunts, your procs and damage keep you constantly jumping to the top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
d.) because, people casting debuffs usually aren't in melee, thus they only make a breif appearance on top of the list. Rangers who melee and snare and debuff and DD are big agro magnets - hence Jolt and Jolting blades.<br />
<br />
<br />
e.) because if a pally chain stuns/flash of light or a druid chain snares (have you ever jester kited?) or SK chain casts whatever cheap, quick, taunt-spell they have, they will get much better agro lock than any warrior could ever dream off, thus reinforcing the assumption of b.)<br />
<br />
I am not presenting a 10 page essay on agro with 10,000 hours of parsed logs as a reference. I am offering a simplified explanation of how agro works, that for the most part does work, in an effort to help other simple people like me understand (approximately) why a easy-to-get relatively cheap weapon like the SotBS SEEMS to hold agro better than a difficult, time consuming epic quest weapon. <br />
<br />
If you want to prove me wrong go have a taunt war with anyone who has a cheap stun, snare or debuff and see who wins. Then come back and disprove me with your 10 page essay and 10,000 hours of parses on how wrong I am - and I will thank you for the information. <br />
<br />
The above is how I approach agro, you are welcome, nay even encouraged,  to develope your own approach, then post it here for peer review as I did. I welcome any factual or well-thought rebuttal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here is what I've gleaned from quite a bit of reading on the subject of agro and hate. I haven't done any parsing myself, I do too much analysis at work to spend any amount of time analysing my past time. Sources are too numerous to mention, so if it looks like your idea it prolly is.  Here are the factors that will help you in avoiding or maintaining agro so everyone can do their job with maximum efficiency and safety.<br />
==============================================<br />
SUMMARY (if you don't want to read the nitty gritty)<br />
If you WANT agro:<br />
=&gt; Damage the MOB first to get the Hate Bonus.<br />
=&gt; Stun/blind/slow/snare as often as possible.<br />
=&gt; Use provoke preferably right after a successful taunt.<br />
=&gt; Use a weapon that procs, preferably a stun.<br />
=&gt; Use a fast 2H weapon<br />
=&gt; Dual weild fast 1H weapons with a good ratio that procs stun and/or hate.<br />
=&gt; stand close to the mob<br />
=&gt; taunt<br />
<br />
If you DON'T want agro:<br />
=&gt; let someone else (preferably MA) hit it first<br />
=&gt; avoid stuns (use in last 20% of MOB health)<br />
=&gt; slow/snare/debuff after slight delay, and or pause between them.<br />
=&gt; avoid fast 2H weapons, especially ones that proc<br />
=&gt; stand back from the MOB while fighting<br />
=&gt; don't sit<br />
=&gt; be extra cautious if you are 5 lvls or more below the MA<br />
=&gt; don't taunt  <br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
The Nitty Gritty:<br />
<br />
Hate Bonus: First Person to do damage to a MOB gets a hate bonus,  details are sketchy but it's significant. If you don't want agro, BE SURE the MA hits a new MOB first. Be aware when engaging a mezzed mob that MA may require 3 (or more) taunts to get a success, meaning a delay of up to 18 to 24 seconds while the MA taunts.<br />
<br />
Hate list management (most effective hate generators to least):<br />
<br />
Stuns, including weapon procs (send you right to the top of the hate list):<br />
These seem to be the best way to get a MOB's attention. Essentially a succesful stun moves you strasight to the toop of the hate list just like a successfull taunt (and it does it EVERY time not every 3rd or 4th time like taunt). If you don't want agro use stuns judiciously. If a MOB is unslowable stuns are useful to help lessen melee damage to the MA. If a MOB is slowed the any additional interuptions are not worth the added agro so don't use stuns on slowable mobs. If the mob is a caster hold stuns till last 20% of MOB health the MA should have enuf agro by then to compete with you.<br />
<br />
Slows (including weapon procs) - <br />
Second bestway to tick off MOB's. If you are 5 levels or more below the MA you should wait till the MA has had a few seconds to generate some damage agro.<br />
<br />
Direct aggro procs (warrior provoke line and weapon hate procs) <br />
These add direct hate and are very usefull when used right after a successfull taunt that put the MA on top of the hate list. Warrior provoke line, in addition to a direct hate boost, also has a Hate Over Time aspect adding hate every tick for 10 ticks. For example Incite (lvl 63) adds 400 hate plus 70 per tick for one min. Provoke line has a 30 sec recast so a Warrior can throw in an additional 400 hate every 30 sec, but this all costs him Endurance. Hate proc'ing weapons/augments are just more icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
Snare <br />
Snare has a significant hate generation capability. Suficient to allow a chain casting Druid to maintain agro from an entire group of melee who are just attacking. Just like Stuns it seems Snare sends you right to the top of the hate list every time.<br />
<br />
Less effective are:<br />
<br />
Stat Debuffs (cripple, flash of light etc) details are sketchy but they are nearly as effective as snare and may actually be in the same category as far as the MOB is concerned. Use with caution.<br />
<br />
Direct Damage<br />
DD's and weapon procs - adds hate equivalent to total POTENTIAL damage (if a 1000DD is resisted it still adds 1000 hate).<br />
weapons - POTENTIAL damage (damage plus bonus). If you look at two-hand weapons you'll see why they generate so much agro. A 30dam 31delay 30bonus weapon generates 60 hate every swing of the weapon; this means a hasted player is generating about 60 hate every 1.5 seconds or 240 hate per tick. Compare to a one-hand weapon with 13dam 20 delay 12bonus which generates 25 hate every swing or about 150 hate per tick. Off-hand weapons don't get bonus damage so a 13/20 would generate approx 75 hate per tick, total for DW 13/20 weapons is 225 per tick - not considering procs.<br />
<br />
Heals - generate hate equal to 2/3 of healing (at last report). 1000 heal = 666DD.<br />
<br />
DOTs - basicly function like weapons.<br />
<br />
Proximity<br />
Closer makes you more noticable. If you want agro stand REAL close, right on top of the mob or sometimes even inside the mob. If you don't want agro stand as far away as you can and still do damage.<br />
<br />
Level<br />
First, as level increases, Player agro radius decreases. This means if a mob is running towards the group he will enter the lowest level groupmembers agro radius first - and beeline straight for them. Sitting reduces your level to (1) which is why mobs run in and whack any caster who is sitting down. <br />
Second, lvl does seem to affect the hate list some, so given a choice of two player who are close to each other on the hate list the MOB will take the lower. The larger the gap the greater the effect. Players who are 5 or mor level below their grps MA should be extra cautious.<br />
<br />
Taunt<br />
Why is taunt way down here at the bottom? Well here is how taunt works, on a successful taunt the taunter gets an equivalent amopunt of hate as who ever is at the top of the list, plus one hate. This means on a brand new untouched mob a successful taunt generates one point of hate. Furthermore, taunt is only succeeds about 1 in 3 at lvl 60, meaning the MA only gets bumped to the top of the list on avg every 18 seconds. This means a lvl 1 No0b with a 10DD can generate more hate than a lvl60 warrior's taunt all by itself. In spite of this, taunt can be an effective tool when used in combination with all of the above. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
Your Frequent MA,<br />

<br />
As much as I want to go &quot;Haas&quot; on you. I won't, I will just point out a few things that are very very wrong with your understanding of EQ game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Stuns, including weapon procs (send you right to the top of the hate list):<br />
These seem to be the best way to get a MOB's attention. Essentially a succesful stun moves you strasight to the toop of the hate list just like a successfull taunt (and it does it EVERY time not every 3rd or 4th time like taunt). <br />
<br />
Big problem with your theory here. Stuns do not send the user to the top of the hate list. They do generate good aggro and amazing aggro from a pally who chain stuns but it does not automatically put you on top.<br />
<br />
DD's and weapon procs - adds hate equivalent to total POTENTIAL damage (if a 1000DD is resisted it still adds 1000 hate).<br />
<br />
Are you that clueless that you think a 6k nuke from a wizard equals 6k hate? Come on.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, taunt is only succeeds about 1 in 3 at lvl 60<br />
<br />
Taunt success is dependent on the level of the mob vs the level of the player taunting and the skill level the player has taunt at. Higher level mobs are much harder to get a successful taunt than lower level mobs. Being lvl 60 has nothing to do with success or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">b.) Because it is a simple way of looking at a complex issue <br />
<br />
No, it's the wrong way of interpreting an issue.  Don't say shit that's not true, it's real simple.  Stuns, slows, snares, they're all NOT THE SAME AS TAUNT.  You saying they are, and then saying they are again, is incorrect, and we don't like that kinda stuff around here. <br />
<br />
DD hate DOES NOT EQUAL direct hate.  If it did, Enraging blow at 700 hate wouldn't do JACK SHIT when your wizard starts blasting off 3k+ nukes, now would it?  Yet we clearly see people using EB weapons to great effectiveness, even over these uber casters you have just created in your fantasy world.<br />
<br />
Snare IS NOT a taunt.  I can tank, Bourbon can snare, and at the end of the day, I'll still be tanking, and no one will have laid a hand on his halfling ass.  Does it carry a large amount of hate? Absolutely.  Will it put you &quot;On top of the hate list, every time&quot; as you claim?  Hardly.  <br />
<br />
Here is what I've gleaned from quite a bit of reading on the subject of agro and hate. I haven't done any parsing myself, I do too much analysis at work to spend any amount of time analysing my past time <br />
<br />
Yeah, that does look a lot like a gleaning.  Perhaps you need to either spend more time reading and understanding the sources fully, or stop parading around your &quot;Facts&quot; until you're sure of them, because you're not sure of much here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tahrl, i'm surprised you made it past lv 20 with such a limited understanding of the way the game works.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">taunt is the only thing in the game to move you to the top.<br />
<br />
everything else has a numerical &quot;hate&quot; value<br />
<br />
Procs:<br />
Anger ~ 1000hate<br />
Enraging blow = 700 hate<br />
Anger3 = 600 hate<br />
Red Epic proc = 500 hate<br />
Taunting Blow = 450 hate<br />
Stuns ~ 450 hate<br />
Anger2 = 400 hate<br />
Debuffs ~ 350 hate<br />
Snare ~ 350 hate<br />
Anger1 = 200 hate<br />
<br />
Every spell a player casts (such as a slow/stun/snare) has a set amount of hate tied to it.  Thus a paladin chain casting a stun stacks up his aggro from previous casts.  Melee also has set hate values determined per swing by ratio and delay and dmg bonus ... thust melee swings build up hate over time.<br />
<br />
Whoever has the highest hate value gets the aggro.  Taunt or AE taunt is the ONLY THING which can move you to the top ... and then only when its successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Tahrl--If stuns were a taunt like you are saying, I could let my raid kill a mob 99.9% (never attacking it myself) and attack at the very end and as soon as my GBoS procs force shock one time, I should have agro over the entire raid.  Never ever ever ever in thousands of raids has anything like that happened to me or to anyone I know or anyone I have heard of even remotely.</div></div><hr />
