 <br />
Gates of Discord is being tuned to rework many of the experience areas to better balance the expansion for all classes. It is our hope that this re-tuning will allow for more group diversity and better use of individual class skills while maintaining the challenge of the new content.  We hope to roll out these changes within the next 2 weeks. Here's a quick breakdown of what's changed -<br />
* Experience has been increased in several zones.<br />
* Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges.<br />
* NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank mobs they previously had difficulty with.<br />
* Spell drops have been increased.<br />
* Zone travel has been made easier.<br />
* NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<br />
* Animals in various zones across Gates have been made non-agro. <br />
 <br />
Note: Please keep in mind that these changes do not affect every zone. <br />
We would like to thank all of the folks on the Test Server who have been helping with the re-working of the encounters and we hope that you enjoy the changes when they go live in the very near future.<br />
 <br />
Thanks all!<br />
