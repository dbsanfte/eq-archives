(I've counted) in BoT ST, and still no Ornate Greaves Mold. This is really annoying. Anywhere I can get greaves much easier? If you play on Bristlebane and have an Ornate Greaves Mold for sale please send a tell to Seraz. Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you can, try to farm plat for them, points for LDoN ones, or if you have the option, get your Sol Ro tower flag.  We clear the minis a lot, and I've seen a whole mess of ornate greaves molds drop there.</div></div><hr />

Most are single group kills, but of course it's faster and easier with more people.</div></div><hr />

The 5 minis drop chest pieces.  Most of the ornate pants in my guild came from SolRo, whether by our own hand or through bazaar purchases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I lucked out picking up a Wind-worn Chestplate last week.<br />
<br />
At least 80% of the time, in my experience, he drops crap. Ring of Torden, Spectral parchment .... and Jord Meat. Or some other stupid shit.<br />
<br />
I'm getting tired of seeing Ring of Thunderous Aura drop from mid sands too. Practically have to beg people to loot it and not let it rot. Heh.</div></div><hr />

...very well off solro bosses...  <br />
<br />
I have never seen or heard of legs dropping off of the solro minis. Only Ornate BPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goyan</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How often does Shadow Master Vintra drop them in Tactics?  I have only killed him once on the way to TZ.  Chain mold dropped, what are the chances of plate greaves mold dropping?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lakor</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anival the Blade in PoTact also drops Plate legs. Only takes a group or 2 to kill. There's more info on Allakhazam about him, if you want to go check him out. He's always  up on MM too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed Anival alot, Plate legs mold is most common, then the wand, then the belt, and once silk pants.<br />
<br />
My assumption was he drops plate and silk legs, Shadow master drops chain and leather.<br />
<br />
Anival is a prolific spawn. He really likes to spawn. A strong exp group can kill the path to Vallon and chances are he'll pop. Also check after Vallon raids and on server up. He  really  likes to spawn.<br />
<br />
If you've never done him i suggest 2 groups. The first spawn hits fairly hard and a/e ramps (small rng, use max melee and you'll be ok), then anywhere from 80 - 12 percent he splits. These do not have a/e ramp, stick a tank on both, kill 1 then the other.<br />
<br />
Becareful of walls, if too close to a wall the split can pop one of them into the wall and once we even had one cornered and on death the corpse warped to the same area but in Tallon's hall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and no. For a group of players/guild that first gets access to Sol Ro's Tower, the minis are still pretty much raid events.<br />
<br />
Also, crawling to those bosses is time consuming, even with powerful players well beyond Sol Ro Tower, some of those crawls still take a crapload of time with just 6 people. (Dresolik comes to mind ... /shudder).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solro minis definitly dropped ornate legs...<br />
I remind perfectly one time when 2 ornate legs dropped from one of them ( was in january or february 2003 and if I recall well it was Arlyxir ).<br />
Now maybe it has changed since they put ornate as drop on trash mobs in solro /shrug.</div></div><hr />
