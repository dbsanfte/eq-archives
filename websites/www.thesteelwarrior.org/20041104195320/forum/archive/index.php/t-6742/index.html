<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have done a few upgrades to my gear.  Added anger augments and a few dex augments.<br />
<br />
I am always striving for the best I could be.  With that said, my upgrades have to come from BoT Towers, Quests, Ldon or the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />
<br />
Also note that I made a future magelo with upgrades I am thinking about getting.  IE: Mana threaded bracer, Bloodied boots of the Dark Rites and Warlords Steel Gauntlets.  Yes I do have GoD but pickup groups are hard to come by and my few friends are out of the game atm.<br />
<br />
So any advice you have lay it on me please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LDoN would certainly be a lot of work, but would open up some really really strong gear upgrade options to you.<br />
<br />
See how that goes. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With your weaps A3 and A2 augged the first thing i would buy with LDoN pts is a 40hp aug for Helm.  Would also consider doing the same with Legs and BP.  I think you get more bang for your buck auggin slots you know you will have for a long time than going for upgrades via RA armor.  The Royal Attendant is very nice, but not a huge upgrade to the ornate you are wearing now (unless they are also fully augged). <br />
<br />
In the mean time the gaunts, bracer and boots from hard setting LDoN are good things to set your sights on. In fact, the gaunts and bracer are on my list as well. Good hunting to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I see a few upgrades you can do for quests.<br />
<br />
Shoulders- Strenth of the Elements<br />
<br />
Wrist,arms,shoulder (can be placed in any of the three slots)- Spirit wracked cord.<br />
<br />
Finger- Dain ring.<br />
<br />
I also agree with auging your BP legs and helm with a 40hp aug.<br />
<br />
I hope it helps.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Add 10ac augments for your cloak and belt to that LDoN list, in front of the 40hp augments. Snag at least 5ac augments for your mask, neck and shoulders as well. See if you can get a Tear of the Rainmaker or another Bloodmetal earring to replace that earring of rage. Other than that, see above. You're not in bad shape at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only reason I decided to use the blood earring of rage was my dex seemed low.  So I grabbed the rage for the +15 dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Warbow you server xfered?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Took care of getting rid of Blood Earring of Rage while keeping Dex.<br />
