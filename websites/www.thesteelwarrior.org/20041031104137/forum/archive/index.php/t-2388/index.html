Suggestions? Have a gsot that's not in the profile as yet as well as a BP Of Eradication. YAY! we finally able to kill Statue (Our first kill he dropped 3 bps, hsagra's shard and a reaver)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stick fierce heraldic in every slot except your gloves, boots, BP, waist and cloak.<br />
Bloodmetal earrings of engagement<br />
One of the +100hp elemental bows.  Obsidianwood are usually the cheapest.<br />
<br />
Ends up being a 450hp, 27ac, 5sta upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get rid of that substandard resist gear.  You're giving up way too much AC/HP with those Velium Blue Diamond Bracers and neck.<br />
<br />
Good alternatives are the Bracelet of Fortitude and/or Fierce Heraldic Bracer(s).  <br />
<br />
I see this all the time and what most ppl fail to realize, EVERY cultural armor bracer has +5 sv all as well as AC and HP, sometimes STA and WIS thrown in.  Even the non-cultural stuff (Fine Heraldic) have AC/HP and +5 resist all.  There is no reason why at level 60+ you should have Velium Blue Diamond resist gear of any sort. <br />
<br />
Cheap good resist neck is Dragon Tooth Choker, or PoK Talisman if you're into questing for one.<br />
<br />
Large races have a Stone of Morid as range slot for extra resists if needed.  Keep the IGS until you get Strength of Elements or a NToV / Ssra drop.  <br />
<br />
Keep the froggy crown just in case you need the extra resists(which you probably won't).<br />
<br />
Your guild can do Statue?, scoop up a Vindi BP for good resists as well.<br />
<br />
And oh yah. Fierce Heraldic boots and legs, pronto.</div></div><hr />
