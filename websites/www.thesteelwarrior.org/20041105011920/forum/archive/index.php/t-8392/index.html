<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone made a list of weapons that have the best DPS... I know i seen one for the argo in the library and i did a quick search but did not see anything promising... This would be help full so you would know what to get if your not the main tank and need to just provide dps for a raid as not all of us will be in the upper 1/2 of the MTing list...<br />
<br />
Has anyone made a list or can some one post the formule for calculating dps so i can creat my own list out of what i know i can get...<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've never seen a definitive one for 1-handers.  The berserkers have an excellent DPS list for 2-handers, which is relevant to warriors too.  <br />
<br />
Berserker top DPS weapons list (http://www.goberserker.com/modstorage/Berweaps.htm)<br />
<br />
Warrior DPS numbers might be slightly lower than what's shown, but the order should be the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">End Game DPS Comparison (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6989) <br />
<br />
This is taken from the library, and doesn't have GoD weapons included. But it will give you a look at the dps for time weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">kewl thanks for the information... <br />
<br />
**EDIT**<br />
humm not a lot there ...<br />
<br />
Is there a formula for a quick formula or do they have to be parceled out?<br />
<br />
<br />
What i am looking for is a list of weapons that i can look for that will give me good dps for groups where i am not the MT or in raid settings where i will not be one of the top 3 tanks..<br />
<br />
This will also help out as i 2 box either a 60+ shaman and warrior or 50ish cleric and a warrior... The warrior is still low in levels and dps to slaughter a mob is what i am looking at. So i am wondering what you all think that a good combo would be for a dps combo.<br />
I have seen all the talk about the argo and have read and reread them over and over but no one talks about dps...<br />
<br />
any thoughts on some good dps weapons??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For 2 handers.  Highest Damage, Lowest delay above 28 (unless you have a lot of atk mods), look for big damage procs.  DD over Dots, as dots piss off enchanters/bard to no end. &gt;=)<br />
<br />
For 1 handers.  Again, best ratio.  Main hands should be fastest (that's the old line of thinking).  Honestly, its been a long time since I've looked for a DPS 1h.  Procs are good.  I imagine FGx2 would be pretty fair DPS becuase they're quick and have a nice DD proc.  My 1h set up is normally good for around 100-110 DPS at best with CoR as my only DS.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I can average a really high 140 DPS with my 2h, and FA.  I'm sure it'll get better when I put a good DD proc on it.<br />
<br />
Tradeable DPS:<br />
<br />
WMBS<br />
Windblade<br />
Fleshgrinderx2, or that horror blade from deep in CT if you got the cash.<br />
Some of the LDoN weapons with their Dam &gt; delay<br />
<br />
Thats about all I can do right now with a brain that looks like a scrambled egg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A friend just told me that if you take the weapons damage and divide that by the delay it will give you a base/medium DPS number. He is a SK in the mid 50's area...<br />
<br />
Anyone know of any thruth of this??<br />
<br />
so a 12 damage and 22 delay should get you about .54/.55 dps number..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try this for a very very nice dps program<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the program it will be somehting i will have to play with and see if i can understand it..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try reversing that around to  delay / dmg.    22/12 = 1.83 ratio   Better ratios = more dps ( not counting aggro/ procs etc.)</div></div><hr />
