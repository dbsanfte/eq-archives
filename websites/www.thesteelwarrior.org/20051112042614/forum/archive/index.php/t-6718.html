At least this will give a reason to stop people from playing 24/7, and reward players who can only dedicated 2-3 hours a night to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But why penalize those hardcore players just because of the casual players.  It doesn't make sense to me.  I don't know how long it takes you to become fully exhausted from well  rested so I can not comment on that.  But to penalize someone that wants to exp for over a lengthly amount of time is quite ludacris.    <br />
<br />
  Even if the EXP from questing it will limit the amount of quests that one can accomplish at one sitting.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I do not know to me it just an added timesink like the many in EQ has.</div></div><hr />

Timesink, mebbe.  What we dunno at this point is how significant the bonus XP for PvE when fully rested is ... if, for example, it's 10% and it takes 16 real-time hours to go from Well Rested to Exhausted, that's effectively irrelevant.  If it's 50% and it takes 4 hours to go from Well Rested to Exhausted, that's insane.  If it's 200% bonus and 12 hours to drop to Exhausted ... well, I dunno.  Requiring a character to rest is a reasonable game mechanic, if well implemented, tho I don't have the access to judge this one.   <br />
<br />
Some nights, I've regretted being able to swing a bugle on a stick for several hours without pause ... I used to chat with my groups during downtime, and now it feels like the frickin' treadmill never stops from the minute I log on till the minute I log off, cuz their aren't med breaks anymore.  But I expect that the system they're testing now is more extreme than what would go live, and I figger that's deliberate for the testing model.  I think they're exploring ways to slow down levelling a little.<br />
<br />
I just found a lot of posts about this (surprise!) on the Blizzard forums, including   this  thread (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=21727&amp;P=1&amp;ReplyCount=46#post21727).  The system doesn't look perfect, but it doesn't look game crippling either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SWG has a similar thing.<br />
<br />
SWG requires you to get rest at a cantina or suffer from lost hp/mana etc.<br />
That is the reason I quit SWG.  I will not suffer harm because I play more than 2 hours at a time.  Any game that wants to harm me, isn't a game I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope it stays so then I'll have something to point to when people say Blizzard is so smart they know how to balance their games.  And looking at the current feedbacks, it seems like it actually will.<br />
<br />
I know people say Quests are the way to xp but at some point you've to grind.  If not the game will either be consumed too fast (assuming quests are supposed to be NOT grinds, i.e. relatively fast), or the quests themselves become grinds.  <br />
<br />
I don't see how you can justify punishing people for playing more.  From what I've heard, the rate you get tired is dependent on XP gained, not the time played, so that means the more efficient you are the quicker you've to stop playing otherwise you go to 1/2 or even 1/4th xp gained.  How does that even make sense?  If it's time-based, at least you're not being penalized for being efficient (even though it is still stupid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaboo</div><div class="date">04-17-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are technical reasons to implement this.  You need a lot more bandwidth and server capacity to support people that play 6+ hours per day.  For business reasons, I can understand Blizzard adding an incentive to get people to log off after a few hours.  If WoW takes off like everyone is expecting and becomes very profitable, they may change this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MachedorCT</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Played for 4 hours before going from Well Rested (200% xp bonus) to Rested (150%).  If it takes 4 hours for every stage (Well Rested, Rested, Normal, Tired, Exhausted, or something like that) then playing 8 hours a day shouldn't hurt anyone.  <br />
<br />
disclaimer - Did not time the amount I actually played, this is just an estimate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't the change from rest states dependent on how much XP you gained, not time played?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that is what I heard also but not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amberlee</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is based on the xp you gain from killing monsters (before the bonus is applied).  XP gained from quests does not factor into the rest state at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karubi</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you wont lvl up or rely on exping to lvl up. 90% of youre exp comes from questing and its alot faster and more fun than sitting in the same spot for 6 hours like eq pulling and killing the same garbage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Old post I know but just found this forum.<br />
<br />
1st thing. I've seen 3 posts from Karubi here and all three have been full of utter garbage. Do not believe a word out of his mouth and you'll be doing yourself a favor. Closer to 40-60% of your exp will come directly from quest turn-ins. Less if you do harder content/mobs.<br />
<br />
2nd thing<br />
<br />
 In case anyone missed it. The big problems with the rest state were twofold. It took 8 hours to go from ANY state to well rested. This was intentional and a poor design decision. It's being changed to incremental. Whether that means 2 hours flat per state, or 1 minute of rest = 1 minute of rest no matter how long there I don't know. The other problem was the amount of exp to drop a state is static through all levels. 20,000 I believe. Sure it might take you 4 hours to drop to Rested at level 10, but I routinely get down to Normal in 4-5 hours now easily at 30+. Faster if I do an instance or fight lots of + mobs. This is also being changed, the amount of exp to drop a state is going to scale.<br />
<br />
 Really that's the only 2 issues I ever had with the system, and they should both be getting changed. So whoopie.</div></div><hr />
