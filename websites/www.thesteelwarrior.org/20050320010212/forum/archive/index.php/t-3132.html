Be honest when voting, you don't have to say who you are. And noone here will bash you anyway :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the raid.  Though it is a habit of mine to eat often during raids (have mini fridge right behind me to make this easier).  TV is right next to my comp, so it is on often also.  But I'm one of the people who can pay attention to multiple things and have no problems with any of them, which is a rare thing in my family =p.</div></div><hr />

How do you pull that off? My CS runs slow when I run Everquest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I scratch my self in various places while waiting for something to do, and I somtimes play with my nipples.<br />
<br />
I slide down in my chair and put my legs onto a nearby chair, so my head barely in lvl with the keyboard, and I lazily type tells to friends. <br />
<br />
I take afk breaks to do push ups. Also whenever I do a 10 minute zone i usually go and do crunches and push ups. <br />
<br />
I stick a piece of plastic in my mouth and crew it till my its unrecognizible. <br />
<br />
Sometimes i lead raids and actually keep my eyes on the computer screen.<br />
<br />
Oh I have slept at the keyboard. Darn Plane of Sky raids back in the day. Cr = waking up at 6 am to a string of bodies at my bind in kael, and a full chat box of people swearing at me. <br />
<br />
See I have it pretty good, huh? <br />
<br />
Although lately I haven't been playing EQ, been lifting weights and practicing my soccer moves. <br />

I do this at all times, unless I need to talk to someone or am around enlisted guys (it looks bad).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">During raids: I'm always, always paying attention to what's going on on my screen.  I hate people who don't pay attention on raids, so I make it a point to be wide awake and ready.  (Plus, I often make the loot calls, being the guildleader and all. :b)<br />
<br />
Grouping with others: Always paying attention.  I view people who don't pay attention while exping as not pulling their weight.  <br />
<br />
Botting by myself: (ahh.. my normal means of exp on my warrior =/ )  I'm constantly swaping between the screens to see what's going on.  Does the cleric have decent mana for the pull?  Anything I need to root park off? etc.<br />
<br />
Soloing (any char BUT the warrior):  I'll kill until I need to med.  Then I find some safe spot to afk at til mana is ready again.  While I medding, I'll read boards/post, chat on the phone, what have you.  This seems very sloppy playing to me, heh.  But since I'm alone during that time, no one else suffers for my inattention.  ;)<br />
<br />
Ah yes, I have a dorm size fridge near my computers, too.  So chances are, I'm eating if I'm hungry at the comp, too. =p</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Heh. I used to chew on bits of metal or plastic, about anything I had lying around.<br />
<br />
Getting a tongue peircing actually cured me of that. (not that I reccommend this)<br />
<br />
I usually pay attention to everything that's going on and chat on top of that. Sometimes I attempt to paint my Warhammer/Warhammer40k minis.</div></div><hr />

I take smoke breaks on downtime too, but 99% of the time i'm watching the screen.</div></div><hr />

Since I don't get to MT often, I can get in and start beatin on the mob and chat in the other window :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gudrin</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i surf the web on my 3rd comp or im two boxing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not hard to spot the &quot;afk playing counterstrike&quot; people on raids.  They are the ones standing in the middle of the room with their arms at their sides after the mob is dead and everyone is back in camp, or worse yet standing in the corner staring at the wall.  I can't say I always pay attention, but that's what I try to do.  I have the TV on behind me, but don't pay any attention to it.  Have been known to websurf during downtime on raids, but not while there are mobs in camp.  This all goes out the window if I haven't had enough sleep though.</div></div><hr />

How do you pull that off? My CS runs slow when I run Everquest.  <br />
I play warcraft 3 while running EQ..</div></div><hr />

You must not be married...  Throw a wife into the mix and you'll be so confused with whats going on, you'll end up trying to tank emp with one of your groupmembers targeted. =P  <br />
<br />
You gotta love the demanding of your attention at all times when they have something to say to you about their day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm most commonly found leading raids, chatting to friends, talking in alliance/warrior/chchain/officer chats, boxing a cleric, listening to mp3s, reading message boards/looking up strats. Oh and did I mention I'm usually MA?<br />
