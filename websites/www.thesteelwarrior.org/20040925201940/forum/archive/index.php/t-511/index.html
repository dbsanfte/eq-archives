<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally, its over. All in all I'd say it was worth it...I've never gone through a longer and more PITA quest.<br />
<br />
Gotta say, the red blade does a very adequete job of holding agg, much better than I figured it would. Now if I can just get my CHSD I'll be all set...<br />
<br />
It took me about 6 months before I wrapped it up...so those working on it just plug away at it whenever.<br />

<br />
Hey man none of my plat is from ebay!  I made my money the old fashioned way, tradeskills :)<br />
<br />
CONGRATZ!  Even though they don't have the power they once did, dual wielding lightsabres is still one of the coolest things around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey Sterix, GRATS to you.<br />
<br />
Overall, the spiroc wingblade is the hardest part IMO. I MQ'd it as my guild has no intention of hitting sky...we're all focused on moving into tactics etc.<br />
<br />
For the warrior who needed queen, golems, and the scale, I'd say you'll have little problem with queen and golems with a couple/few groups, depending on equipment. As for that scale, if you have the patience park a tracker in EJ and cross yer fingies...otherwise you may wanna save yer plat :)<br />
<br />
Now if SOE would only change the delay to 20...we'd truly have an epic worthy of the name.<br />
<br />
Peace all (screw it, BLOODSHED)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow, congratulations Breaorn! That's great to hear!<br />

..but warriors shouldnt end their speech with &quot;Peace&quot;<br />
 - that takes away our jobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sam3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Grats :)<br />
For me, i just need the Ball and the wingblade to finish it,  but i don t have luck in PoF, more than 15 raid in pof and i ve never seen a golem up :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ratmandu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I finally got that stinkin Dragon on Saturday and the Queen yesterday.<br />
<br />
I only need a Ball of Everliving Golem and a couple of Rebreathers now :)<br />
<br />
Gotta thank muh Guildies though. They really moved when the call on Sev came. And they showed up in force for the Queen. Lub ya all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Congratulations! I myself am a lvl 63 warlord on Povar *grin* and just got my epic this Saturday. Aye...was definetely worth it :)<br />
I did buy 1 part of it, the golem ball, because i just couldn't wait until a fear raid and wanted to have it done in chardok, and then kill queen the second time with a weapon made from her own blade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>newbbarsher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gratz, way to go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">and then kill queen the second time with a weapon made from her own blade. <br />
<br />
Not sure I understand 'the second time' thing. You only need to kill the queen once as it drops every time (doesn't it?). Once you have your epic, create the 2HS version, have your friendly mage summon a runic sword, combine that single rune sword in your scabbard and voila, you have your two 1hs'ers. Now you can bank yer scabbard and run around with all three.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Braeorn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think he means, they were sticking around to kill her again for ANOTHER warrior in guild or in group, and he got to gank her with his brand new epic.<br />
<br />
So he felt some justice was served.<br />
