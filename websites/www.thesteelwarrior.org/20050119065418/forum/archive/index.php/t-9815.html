<br />
Yet I can vouch for it.<br />
<br />
Vanazir + FoY + CoF easily beat out aggro from a BoWar with Anger3 aug on a Time named (lvl75-80?), but could not compete with the same BoWar in a Dranik's expedition of level 63-65ish mobs, even with using incite as much as possible in the dranik's epxed and none on the Time named.<br />
<br />
If you're fighting level 65 or lower, IMO, go with Anger3. If you fight higher level mobs or raid high level named a lot, hedge your bets with one of each.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm with Phantron here.  Fought mobs levels 1-80 so far in eq ... and in all cases stun was never stronger (at least noticably) than anger3.<br />
<br />
Yak is nice aggro and nice dps, but you're kidding yourself if you think it ever takes the cake for aggro.  Overall it is a better proc for sure, but with our linear focus of &quot;piss the mob off so it don't eat your friends&quot; it falls somewhat short.  <br />
<br />
You can get by comfortably with it, but it is lesser aggro.<br />
<br />
Vanazir + FoY + CoF easily beat out aggro from a BoWar with Anger3 aug on a Time named (lvl75-80?)<br />
<br />
Did the BoW have CoF innate proc as well?  If not this doesn't prove shitall except that superior dps and 3 innate procs &gt; inferior dps with 2 stronger procs.  As well, Vanazir is considered to be a superior weapon for aggro than a BoWar ... ie<br />
<br />
Vana + a3 &gt; BoW + a3</div></div><hr />

Warriors aren't about dps, A3 all the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild has a strict &quot;no knockback&quot; policy on weapons, so if Ykesha has knockback, that pretty much rules it out.<br />
<br />
Besides, if the aggro difference is negligible, an extra 250 damage per minute (if the procs don't get resisted outright) isn't likely to make a while lot of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ykesha has a small amount of knockback yes.<br />
<br />
At the high end level aggro is rarely an issue so you're not going to notice any difference between Anger 3 and Ykesha easily.  My feeling is that you can probably get away with Ykesha and grab an extra 5 DPS while you're at it, but I stick to Anger 3 because you never know when someone does need that extra bit of aggro.</div></div><hr />

Except you're missing the statement that that superiority was ONLY on the higher level mob, while even with the addition of constant incite useage on the lower level mob, the BoWar was superior even without CoF as well as having inferior DPS to boot.<br />
<br />
You'd have a point, if the Vanazir was superior in both sitations, but it was only superior in ONE, and INFERIOR in the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done some limited testing Yak vs A3.  On Tactics Vallon Zek (lv 73) and MPG/KT named anger3 came out on top.<br />
<br />
Scaling aggro generation imo is pseudo horse shit.  I'm sure those who believe in and propagate the notion have only the best intentions, but honestly they've simply been mislead.  I've a stun-gun in my back pocked (FS + yak) and i can safely say without a fucking doubt that it never ever ever has out performed my A3 BoC as per aggro ... and yes i've done enough playing with it both on raids and in groups to make that call.<br />
<br />
14/18 w/ 2 stuns (superior ratio mainhand)<br />
15/20 EB + A3      (inferior mainhand ratio)<br />
<br />
If aggro on stun did scale with levels i'd certainly be able to tell you otherwise, but it just plain doesn't, hasnt, and will never.<br />

Sorry.</div></div><hr />

Unless its bugged, why would there be an aug that has roughly the same aggro but with a DD component and which costs ~300 fewer points?  Doesn't make sense to me.</div></div><hr />

Because at LDoN level of play and slightly higher(mobs level 1-66) Anger 3 is a superior proc for aggro. The stun &gt; anger3 theory only applies to mobs 68ish and/or above a certain number of hitpoints depending on the theory you buy into(if any).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh wait it's HPs now?<br />
<br />
No one has ever noticed any different aggro behavior between Txevu yard trash which has at least twice the HP as any yard trash of comparable level.  It has been shown conclusively that Anger 3 &gt; Yak on a level 64 yard trash in PoEarth and while you can believe aggro uses some strange code for mobs not level 64, Occam's Oazor does apply here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">depending on the theory you buy into <br />
<br />
I don't quite buy into the hitpoint theory myself....but what's your point with stating that Anger3 is superior on level 64 yard trash in earth? We know that already, and it's not &quot;some strange code for mobs not level 64&quot;; rather, it's the scaling aggro of stuns does not meet the hate values of anger3 until the mobs you are fighting exceed level 68ish.</div></div><hr />

Put a Yak aug on a anger/eb proccer and you'll be fine tho.Imo a3 is better.</div></div><hr />

Incidentally, I've been fighting stuff higher than 68 for a very long time.  A Paladin, whose primary aggro comes from stun, do not do any better or worse on those compare to anything else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah with some twisted way of comparing Bazu Bellow to Enraging Blow and then to Anger 3 versus a stun without understanding whatever intricaies that may exist in the spdat.  The claim 'stun = 1500 hate' also doesn't match what Paladins claim (600-700) and it also doesn't take into the fact that there's a lot of behind the scene stuff with spells.  Just because Bazu Bellow and Anger 3 both says 'incraese hate by 600' doesn't mean they're the same.  The top of the line SK aggro line now say 'increase hate by 1' does that mean Bazu Bellow is only 600 times as good as the top of the line SK aggro spells?  <br />
<br />
The only conclusive test proved anger 3 &gt; Yak, the one where two guys got a Fine Steel weapon each auged with anger 3 and yak and see who would get more aggro over a period of 20 some minutes.  All claims that Yak &gt; Anger 3 is based purely on 'it feels I get more aggro' and baseless claims such as aggro somehow scales with level, which has never been shown to be valid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think there was a controlled sterile test done in HoH or something as well. Cant remember.<br />
But the results of the test didnt mirror any real world testing by a long shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very few people have tested the actual yak procs versus the anger3 procs, and those that have done so have found anger3 to be marginally better.<br />
<br />
As for the arguments that stun &gt; anger3/EB ... you basically have people testing one set of criteria ... assuming that said criteria equals other criteria (or at least behaves similarly) ... then assuming that you can apply the same principles across the board.<br />
<br />
IE:<br />
<br />
Assume Baze bellow = anger3<br />
Assume Paladin spell aggro = yak proc aggro<br />
<br />
Paladin spell aggro &gt; Baze bellow therefore it stands to reason that yak aggro &gt; anger3 aggro.  <br />
<br />
Here are the problems:<br />
1.  Baze bellow has never been conclusively proven to work as well as an anger3 proc ... or even work at all the same, especially considering how much about the ability seems to be unknown.<br />
2.  Paladin spell-cast stun aggro has never been proven to be equivalent to proc stun aggro.  Before you get your knickers in a twist here, the case-proof earlier stated was the tash orb.  Once upon a long time ago tash orb = ench tash for aggro ... people (warriors in particular) duel wielded them for mega aggro.  Verant changed the way it worked so if you test a tash stick today vs any ol' enchanter spell you'll see that they are not the same.  This at least casts reasonable doubt that there is some disparity btw spell cast and proc. All of this even assumes that all stun spells have equivalent aggro.  Perhaps the ykesha proc itself has a different innate aggro component than a paladin/cleric ...?  The world will never know.<br />
<br />
None of these experiments were testing the procs themselves, but rather similar things compared with other things ... which somehow work out to prove that yak somehow is superior.  I find this odd as it contradicts every single real world (fantasy world) encounter i've ever come across.  It just plain don't work that way.<br />
<br />
The dps/aggro equations we have out there are not perfect, so any calculations involving said equations need to be taken with a grain of salt.  They are good equations ... just not definite and/or perfect.<br />
<br />
If you want to see for yoursellf a simple test costs no more than 3-4k.  Go out and find a buddy warrior ... pull off your augs and slap them on a fine steel weapon.  Go fuck around for a few hours and report your findings.  <br />
<br />
As for stun aggro scaling with levels ... not sure who started this rumor exactly, but i've run the tests both with slowed warriors + weighted axe proc vs proc (for a proc on the first swing of first round) and over time with FS weapons on mobs ranging 55-73+ throughout PoP, GoD, and a few OoW zones.  Never did high level mobs react any differently ... and yes some of them were well over 100k hps.<br />
<br />
Go test it for yourself and/or pick whatever you want.  Don't blindly follow or assume every nugget you find here is truth.   Just (for fucks sake) make sure you are testing proc vs proc ... anything else is irrelevant.  Until someone somewhere runs a series of tons of tests between the two procs showing yak to be conclusively better, i wouldn't run to the corner store to cash in your anger 3's just yet.  So far nobody has done so ... all we have are:<br />

 leet hackxor'd super-sekret inside infoz from billy joe bob's uncle who works for sony and some half-cocked outrageously flawed tests ...</div></div><hr />

I like both personally. I use A3 main hand and the Yak offhand. Once I have my Epic 1.5 later this week I will have A3 and Yak main hand, A3 offhand.<br />
<br />
I don't really notice any difference in aggro between them. The one thing I do like is that I know exactly what kind of hate A3 is. I haven't seen any hard evidence what kind of hate the Yak creates.<br />
<br />
In the end though, just do your own tests and see what you think. Everyone has thier own opinions.<br />

As for the people who don't have the LDoN points. Don't sweat it and just go with the yak.. you will do just fine.</div></div><hr />

Ykesha is fine aggro, but don't confuse yourself in thinking it is better than an A3 aug. It also causes knockback, I can't begin to imagine how bloody disruptive this would be if every war in my guild threw 3 Yak augs onto their weapons instead of 3 EBs. Its already bad enough with the rogues. That said, they are cheaper, so if you haven't bought two EB augs already (people haven't?) then Yaks might be the only option you have.</div></div><hr />

For those of us that got 10-15k points back in the day on the other hand ... it's not worth swapping back neccessarily if you just want top notch aggro  :D<br />
<br />
If I honestly had to go back and do it again i'd probably go with yaks.  Aggro with them is sufficient 95% of the time (some of us don't have a darkblade  ;)  ) and it would let me buy them other augments in a timely fashion.<br />
<br />
What i don't like, however, is the rampant bullshit flying around about scaling stun aggro and yak &gt; anger3.  It may be the better buy but it isn't stronger.</div></div><hr />

Empirically, just about every yard trash behaves the same in EQ, whether it's a mega HP trash mob in Txevu or level 70 yard trash in MPG or level 73 yard trash in Anguish.  You might choose to believe Anger 3 happened to proc about 50% more over a period of 20 minutes but you also probably don't know anything about statistics.  <br />
<br />
I've said this quite a few times.  Aggro these days isn't that hard to get, and believe it or not most of your aggro actually comes from ratio now.  Thus you're not going to notice a difference between 2 augs that easily.  You can definitely get by with Yak for cheaper cost and pick up 5 DPS or so along the way, but if you're somoene who wants to make sure you always have the best aggro, Anger 3 is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually,<br />
<br />
It's been shown by both Brale and myself that Ykesha is &gt; A3, not by an idiotic &quot;Go afk for 20 mins and see who has aggro&quot; methodology, but by the only known method of testing (as well as some information gleaned directly from the datastream which has been alluded to which gives a *precise* hate value).<br />
<br />
That methodology is simple:<br />
<br />
Pull using a 3rd party... using an anger 3 augmented weapon (i.e Fine steel dagger) you melee until you proc once, then stop.<br />
<br />
Then having someone else using an unaugmented weapon (i.e. Fine Steel Dagger) you melee until you gain aggro.<br />
<br />
You then subtract the melee based aggro from each side, and voila!  Your actual number.<br />
<br />
In every single instance of this real, repeatable, and verifiable methodology shows that once a mob HP/Level is exceeded, Ykesha destroys Anger 3 in every aspect.<br />
<br />
It's only asinine tests which are not repeatable, and not verifiable, such as &quot;The necro outaggroed me on X number of fights&quot; or &quot;Turn on attack and afk for 20 mins&quot; and other such nonsense that people follow blindly in the &quot;pure hate&quot; camp of stubbornness.<br />
<br />
It's really all about the thing in the back of their minds:<br />
<br />
&quot;But Anger 3 costs more so it HAS to be better&quot;<br />
<br />
Such solid logic!<br />
<br />
Stuns absolutely scale with mob HP/Level, this is easily tested via the same methodology on various level/hp mobs.  It's been tested so many times ones' head would spin, and verified every single time it's been tested... if stuns DIDN'T scale... it would be literally impossible for anyone to take aggro off of a gnoll hide lariat from levels 20-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The dps/aggro equations we have out there are not perfect, so any calculations involving said equations need to be taken with a grain of salt.  They are good equations ... just not definite and/or perfect.<br />
<br />
The very fact that your tests show yak obliterating anger3 is proof of the afformentioned statement.  Has it never occured to you that perhaps your precious equations are wrong?  Your results violate everything one encounters in a &quot;real world&quot; game experience.<br />
<br />
How, then, would you explain the weighted axe + augment + slowed warrior Frod?  Even when the yak aug'd axe logged more swings in the initial combat round the anger3 axe w/ proc would win out ... and would subsequently result with the anger3 warrior being in the HoTT window.  This test, unlike the others, was performed multiple times on red-con xp named and even once on a Raid calibur named (initial VZ in tactics -- pre-split).  On xp trash, xp named, and even mr raid named ... on all of them the anger3 won out.<br />
<br />
Before you jump all over me for faulty testing yet again:<br />
1. Yes we did log all swings (both miss and hit)<br />
2. No this part of the fight did not last long enough for ripostes to factor in\<br />
3. No, neither warriors pulled nor had initial/early aggro<br />
4. Both warriors engage at the same time and turn off attack after round 1<br />
5. Monitor who has aggro ... check swing count ... write it down ... rinse and repeat ... go to new zones/mobs ... rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
But perhaps I didn't find high enough level mobs with enough hps?  Please be so kind as to reveal where this magical line is where yak pulls ahead of anger3 ... because it sure as heck doesnt include a level 73+ raid named.<br />
<br />
It would be great if what you said was truthful Frod ... dps + better aggro for a lesser cost ... but it just doesn't seem to work that way, especially in everyday Everquest encounters (albeit raid or group level). <br />
<br />
 I do believe that at one time you stated stun aggro reached well over 1100 aggro (double anger3) ... by your calculations on raid named a GBoS &gt; BoC .... BBoTE &gt; BF ... BBoTE &gt; EoE?  BBoTE &gt; BoW ... BBoTE &gt; anything other than a Darkblade or higher.</div></div><hr />

sorry to make you cry but even if epic 1.5 is better than BF, the BF / epic1.5 combo is BETTER aggro than epic1.5 / BF ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, point taken.  It most certainly doens't HAVE to be the case but it still doesn't make any sense.  My personal feeling is that they are both similar in aggro but that Anger III *should* at least be marginally better given the fact that it costs more and doesn't have a DD component.  Now, whether or not that is the case or not is another story.  If it isn't, then I don't believe thats what was originally intended by the designers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a finesteel long sword aug'd with anger 3, and a guildy had a finesteel long sword aug'd with the cheapest ykesha aug. <br />
<br />
For one thing, comparing A3 to CHeapest Ykesha aug is pretty retard lmao. Only way you can even compare them is if it was 100-125 Yak. Therefore, the test was pretty unbalanced(Specially considering the level 20[Yes Cheapest Ykesha is level 20] Will probably be resisted 9/10 on BoT trash, more or less PoE)<br />
<br />
I currently use EoE+BoC both with 100point Ykesha. In raiding situations, I lose agro to 2 kinds of people, Warriors with Aug DB+Epic1.5, and Our Mage Tank, who can out-agro our Maintank.<br />
<br />
They are pretty even in agro, from what I have seen for the most point. Did a &quot;Sight&quot; test the other day actually. <br />
Info: I have WA2/Ingenuity3/Ambidexterity/CF2. He has WA5/Ingenuity3/Ambi/Flurry/CE 10/CF3<br />
<br />
I was outagroing him pure procage(3 Stuns/1anger) While his taunts and procage(1stun,3anger) were not holding up against me. May not be proof, but was enough for me to not switch out to anger.</div></div><hr />

 Interesting to have you say that, since all of my real world experience disagrees with you.<br />
Will play with it again next time I exp, doubt it will change.</div></div><hr />

I'll probably try to pick up the aug in Bloodfields and buy the Anger 3.  That way i can keep a no push weapon in my primary and have two stuns on my off hand.  Thanks for the discussion all :).</div></div><hr />
