<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has the drop rates on weapons gone down since release?  Few days after release I saw 4 or 5 bygone butcher blades and a couple sword of midwinter's vengeance.  Now I havn't seen either in a while.  Has anyone heard of SOE nerfing the drop rates or am I just imagining all of this?</div></div><hr />

Of course it did.<br />

How else do you think they get you to buy an expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got my own personal thoughts on this one but loot drop rates (and seemingly static spawn PH named mobs in certain instanced zones) in many parts of OoW seemed to drop after the Saturday 23rd patch. No proof but I was rocking and rolling on just about eveything I did prior to that and now it seems (didnt keep track prior to Sat) to be slower. Not specific to these items, just in general. For example I spawned a mob 7 times in a row and 8/10 on Friday and then spawned 1/12 on Saturday, 3/9 on Sunday, and 0/5 on Monday.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No proof other than the fact that this happens about this same amount of time after every single new expansion that is released.  I'm sure the drop rates and random named spawn times are indeed happening at a lower rate like everyone thinks they're noticing.  It's always happened in the past and will surely continue for future expansions.  Bump up the rate things drop and spawn for the first few weeks to drive people to get out there and explore, drop it down to SOE accepted levels after the rush has started.  Happens every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think alot of it has to do with the fact that at first there is a huge rush and people scower the zones for named mobs . <br />
<br />
now that the newness is gone there are less people camping named . I know I have found lots of named camped spots free this last week of exploring with my necro . <br />
<br />
named may spawn fewer times but they are still there . just half as many people are camping them , Most are proly off in PoP  trying to grind to 70th.</div></div><hr />
