I went to check out the guy who sells the special beans today and currently he's dubious to me and won't sell/talk to me.  I was wondering once maybe it sees that you're at that step of the quest does he automatically sell to you regardless of your faction?  This is gonna be a pain in the ass if I have to coldain because I think it's pretty much bottomed out(last time I bothered with velious faction was for some warlord piece)<br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone has gotten to that point yet and are also kos to coldain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
frost giant toes + frost giant heads = enough faction to buy and sell. go out into GD and solo some of the giants round the fort, they are pretty easy, toes need to be turned in in sets of 4 and heads 1 at a time(or 2?).<br />
<br />
look on alla for the quest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rachion</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the whole backquest to get me up to speed with the 1.0 wars.  I was kos in Thurg, spent two days getting from kos to dubious.  I could get the quest from dardek and I could get the special beans from the other dood, but i could not buy/sell.  Sooooo I brought my 23 necro who was indiff down and had him buy like 30 stacks o generics for me and i transferred them over to my tank.  Took me about 45 mins to go from 0 brewing to 55, combineing three generic coffee beans.  I stuck the result of that into the brewer with the special beans and wallah, coldain coffee.  So ya it was horid factioning in GD for two days but hey, I can bank in Thurg again and i'm a 55 brewer /cha /cha.  On a side note, when I was searching for and found Dardek, I was still kos in Thurg.  I would inviso in and I had a bard pax the room in the bar where hes snoozing.  I drped inviso and I was able to get the quest from him.  Couldn't do anything with the coffee guy, until i was dubious.  Hope this helps cya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to pok, the brewing vendors by the large bank, go to the brew barrel and skill up on ale untill it trivials at 68. <br />
<br />
Go to thurg, make sure you have some sort of invis and hand the dorf 35pp. You`ll get jumped for sure,  but if you can`t handle 2-3 green con dorfs then you don`t deserve the epic anyway =P<br />
<br />
Regular coffee beans, I had an alt buy them, combined in a brew barrel in the bar where the quest npc is, both generic brew and coldain coffee trivial below 68.<br />
<br />
Stand next to the quest npc, drop invis and kill 3-4 more green con dorfs, hail and then hand in the coldain coffee. The dorf will walk, invis up and follow him, when he stops hand in the items. There is no real danger here, at most you will have to kill 8 green/light blue con to 65 npcs .</div></div><hr />
