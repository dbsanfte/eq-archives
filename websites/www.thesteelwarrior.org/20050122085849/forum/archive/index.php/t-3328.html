<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">53 warrior here.  Long time player, but very part time.  non-guilded and limited funds. I hadn't actually played my main warrior for a long time until LDoN came out, but the adventures fit in well with my limited stretches of playing time so I've been enjoying myself in pick-up groups. <br />
<br />
I'm currently using Frostbringer/Snowchipper when I MT, which is most of the time.  I have a Stonebladed Axe of Dismay for 2 hand.  Over the weekend I tried the 2 hander as MT and didn't see any significant difference in my ability to hold aggro - plus my dps are significantly better. <br />
<br />
If I sold my 2 1-handers and the Axe, I would have enough plat to buy a Windblade, and I'm wondering if that would be a viable option for me, at least for a while.  This would leave me with the Windblade as my only viable weapon - no option to switch back to dual wield. <br />
<br />
DPS seems to be the single biggest issue with LDoN success or failure and I'm just wondering if I could legitimately present myself as an MT with only the Windblade for the next few levels.<br />
<br />
Completely different question - I'm looking at the GSoT in a couple more levels - they are disgustingly cheap on my server and a great weapon, but I have committed the un-pardonable warrior sin of not keeping all skills up - my 2HB is currently 82.  I would appreciate any suggestions for the best options for improving that skill given a limited playing schedule. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help;   I've been reading Steel Warriors for a long time and it's a great site.  I finally registered just so I could ask this question. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't use a Windblade if you're MT, you won't keep aggro with it.  Yes its great DPS but the delay on it is too long, and combined with the lack of proc, you won't hold aggro with it.<br />
<br />
Get a GSoT and don't look back.  DPS almost as good as a Windblade, but with a lower delay and a decent aggro-generating proc.<br />
<br />
If you're a few levels too low for the GSoT, stick with what you have now until you're high enough to use one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT is a damn fine weapon with a stupid graphic :D<br />
<br />
the whole problem i see with using 2Hers for you is your level; 2Hers + aggro + DPS really comes closer to 60 than at 53 where you are now and you may struggle with it. also another problem is when you hit 55 and you start using /desensive; a 2Her at that level will annihilate your DPS and you'll end up using 1Hers; esp with procs+DPS.<br />
<br />
i'd play the market; lowball yourself a GSoT and keep levelling. so far you're pretty well off and what you have although i'd lose the snowchipper and get a copper hammer of striking or a sword of the bloodsworn for the better proc value/aggro.<br />
<br />
even as a trainer weapon a GSoT is fast enough + decent damage. you'll work well with it and you'll grow into it.</div></div><hr />

But still, I did MT with it and it wasnt bad at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT is a great weapon for raising 2hb.  When I got mine I had like 60 skill in 2hb.  Dumped the 80 or so training points I had saved up into it and then used it while clearing yard trash in VT to max my skill.  You could put a stun proc into the windblade, but for the same points and less plat you could put the proc on the greatstaff and have a 2-proc weapon that can actually interrupt high-level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok - thanks.  Glad I asked :)<br />
<br />
I'm less than a yellow from dinging 54, so I guess I'll stick with what I have and slug it out for another level (can't afford a Copper hammer and haven't seen a Sword of the Bloodsworn for sale lately - don't know what they go for). <br />
<br />
I just went and bought a Greatstaff of Thunder - for 150 pp (I know they're common but I'm still baffled by the prices on these), so I'll be ready to go when I hit 55. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't look at the Windblade, it's overpriced IMO. A WMBS does better damage at 1/3 thew price, and a GSoT is better agro at 1/10 the price, after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish I had this kind of luck on /random. :)<br />
<br />
After not seeing a Sword of the Bloodsworn for sale on my server for at least the last month, 5 came up for sale since I posted this yesterday.  Picked one up this morning for 5K, so now I'm SotB/Frostbringer and that's probably as good as it's going to get for a while. <br />
<br />
A couple more questions -  when I hit 55, does the GSoT become a better option for aggro?  How about for DPS?  How about DPS now - would a WMBS, for example, be better DPS than the SotB/Frosty combo at level 53 or 54?  <br />
<br />
In general, I guess I'm asking at what level the big 2 hander damage bonuses start making a good 2H weapon a potentially better weapon for DPS and/or aggro. <br />
<br />
Thanks for you patience with my questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you won't really see much dPS with a 2Her until 60 unless you got a lot of aa's.<br />
<br />
I knew at 59 with epic i was doing so-so..but at 60 it went through the roof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Is Guts</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe<br />
<br />
Was just about to ask a question along these lines, so may as well ask it here. :)<br />
<br />
56 just, have CHoS and SotB for dual aggro, GSoT for 2H aggro and a trusty Stonebladed Axe of Dismay for 2H for non aggro / assist.<br />
<br />
Is the WMBS a good upgrade for the SbAoD or is it too quick and will get aggro when I dont want it ?<br />
<br />
Sorry if this not the proper way to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. 150pp for a Thunder stick is amazing. That's even better than taking the time to camp one once you can get in to BoT!!! lol<br />
<br />
At any rate, once your skill is up to par, I think you will find that the GSoT is more than enough DPS and agro compared to your current set up, even at 55. You will notice considerable increases as you level as Shik has mentioned, but I don't think the snowchipper is a good enough weapon to make your 1h combo better than 2h. Maybe if you get ahold of a copper hammer to go with your SotB, but until then work on your 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WMBS is good for DPS; and if you try hard enough you won't get aggro from it either but my examples and conclusions came from pairing with other warrs with EB...<br />
<br />
back to the frosty/SotB discussion..you haven't tanked anyhitng using /defensive ye..believe me the day you first fire it off you'll understand proc values ( no offense ) and it's all kinda touch and go..but for straight up DPS=aggro stats the CHoS is stellar...it might just come along and take the frostbringer out of contention although the prices on them are falling dramatically ( saw a few for 2K up for sale in the bazaar on my server ).<br />
<br />
Defensive is where 2Hers will hurt you if you don't have the levels to really dish out the DPS. But they're valid choices if it's all ye got.<br />
<br />
but to be safe..at 55-60 or so minus pop heavy hitters; Dual Wield will be the safest bet, esp when using defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play my warrior is short spurts these days, and even though he's only 63, level 56 was actually over a year ago. I can tell you that at 63 I use CHoS and SotB for dual-wield tanking, and a GSoT for 2-hand tanking. I've gone back and forth between the WMBS and Windblade for non-aggro work, but I tend to prefer the WMBS, even though it can pull aggro sometimes due to its speed. I had a SBAoD sometime back; it was okay and may be a good weapon for you in non-aggro situations.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary at level 56, though, but it sounds like you're on the right path.<br />
<br />
Oh...and to the original poster: do you want to know how good that GSoT you got for 150pp is? I bought mine for 26Kpp or 32Kpp (it was a while back, like the second month of PoP), and I still think that it was a great purchase, worth every copper piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-01-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for all the information - I feel like I have a better understanding now of my weapon options at various levels.  <br />
<br />
Most of my knowledge goes back to before the 2H damage bonuses, when anything but dual-wield was unthinkable for warriors. <br />
and to the original poster: do you want to know how good that GSoT you got for 150pp is? I bought mine for 26Kpp or 32Kpp  <br />
I'm aware.  I think it's a real shame to see a weapon like this at that price, but I guess it just shows what happens when the game supplies an overabundance of a level-restricted item. <br />
<br />
I started playing when Kunark was released and I am continually amazed at the equipment that is available now - particularly the cheap equipment.  I can remember a day when a Weighty Polearm or Bed Leg Club would have been 20K plus items (at least).</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience only...your mileage may vary:<br />
<br />
If you have enchanter class &quot;strong&quot; haste: yes<br />
<br />
If you are self-hasted/have weak haste: debatable based on group; at 65 a highly equipped DPS class can pull agro of it with me when I am weak hasted.<br />
<br />
If you are defensive: no...just not enough juice to hold the mob against spike damage.<br />
<br />
If you are defensive but have added a (760)-stun class mod: TBD (it is my next experiment in LDON to try this).  <br />
<br />
Basically at the prices GSoT is at there really is no reason why every warr that doesn't have an uber class 2 hander (BoW etc) doesn't have one that can wield it.  I personally think its criminal that Sony overflooded the market (I hope they weren't thinkin this was a class fix).</div></div><hr />
