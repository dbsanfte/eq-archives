<br />
Just curious on other warrior's thought's on what a good stopping point for ac is.<br />
<br />
There has to come a point to concentrate on hp's agin after reaching a certian lvl im sure.<br />
<br />
I know this old dog has been kicked alot of times on this board BUT i have herd no real conclusive stament saying THAT is all the AC you need.<br />
<br />
Any thought are welcomed.</div></div><hr />

There is no number anyone could give you that would be definitive.  It's based on what mob you are fighting.  In todays' current end game, the softcap is clearly higher then is acheivable.<br />
If you raid NToV, for example, then there is most definitely a softcap on AC.  It's entirely based on the content you are facing.  I tend to use a 4 to 1 ratio when selecting gear upgrades or augs.  I buff to about 2950AC without bard songs and I'm still not statisfied.<br />
AC is what makes a tank a tank, not HPs.<br />

<br />
As for augs, I'd take 70 HP over 10 AC.  20 AC+ augs are better than anything else in the game besides the 90 + effect combo augs from Anguish or the BiC aug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Anguish shielding aug is great because it also has more hp than the lowest HP augment I have.  However, I would value 20 AC over the 2 Shielding augs you can farm from Ikkinz.  Reason behind that is that you can cap Shielding.  You cant cap AC, atm.</div></div><hr />

So I'd put 20 AC over shielding, but probably not avoidance, but then the only avoidance augs I know of are from Anguish (90 + avoidance) and LDoN.  The first is a no brainer, and the second I doubt anyone will be seeing much of it.<br />
<br />
Of course the estimate on shielding HP is probably a little bit low...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are tanking xxeric for example, a high ac value and low hp isn't going to do squat cause you will be dead before you catch a heal.  Their is  a healthy balance to maintain I think.  I use hp augs where i have ac banked simply because I value 17,000+ hp giving a larger margin of error and more reaction time for healers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On stuff that can reasonably one round kill you, HP is probably more useful than AC.  If it was somehow possible to get say 20K HP but 1200 AC, then that'd obviossly be a bad idea, but it is simply not possible to end up with stats like that.  Unless you decide to replace all your gear with leather all/all items you're still going to end up with a reasonable amount of AC for the given encounter.  Also you will never be able to get so much AC that you can just expect mob to hit min every hit or even half of the time, and even if the latter was possible, you cannot guaranteed you won't die from a spike.  On the other hand it is quite possible to get enough HP so you can never get one rounded.<br />
<br />
On stuff that I feel that cannot easily one round me (which is everything except Xxeric and Keldoven right now), AC generally provides better savings in the long run.  However one round doesn't just mean 'mob max X 4' because in practice such a round never happens.  You sort of just have to experiment and look at how you die and see if it's really a one round kill or not.  Xxeric is a very good example where HP &gt; AC because you can't even get enough HPs to guaranteed to survive one round.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't Master of Hate actually slows down?  I never noticed any difficulty while tanking him.  IMO anything that can actually be slowed (not slowed but mitigate 95% or whatever) can't be considered to be hard to tank because even if it one rounds you, it's trivial to get another person to tank it.  If you look at Quarm for example, his potential one round is still pretty high compare to today's content but no one ever has problem tanking him because he's slowable.  <br />
<br />
I guess when I say one round, it's more like two rounds with a heal lapse in between.  Slowable mobs will never get two consecutive rounds between heals unless there's a serious lapse in healing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course shielding/avoidance work against each other.    <br />
((PS i know the numbers I use to illistrate are not right but the way it works is))<br />
<br />
<br />
Avoidance works first, then Shielding.<br />
<br />
Ex.  of Shielding weakening of Avoidance:<br />
Say a mob has an Hit of 1000.<br />
a Person whose avoidance allows them to miss a hit<br />
Person with Zero Shielding just saved 1000 points of damage<br />
Person with Thirty Shielding just saved 700 damage<br />
<br />
So obviously, the avoidance saves the person with no shielding more damage than it saves the person with Shielding.   in essence, the shielding weakened the value of the avoidance because your not saving the full blow when avoidance fires your only saving the shielding reduced blow.<br />
<br />
Ex of Avoidance weakening Shielding<br />
Say a mob has a hit of 2000 <br />
A person with 30 Shielding would be taking 1400.<br />
<br />
Now over a course of a fight that person gets hit 100 times.  Thier shielding saved<br />
them 60000  (600*100) damage<br />
<br />
If that same person had avoidance, and avoided 2 of 100 hits.    That person's shielding would only save them 58,800 (600 *98) damage<br />
<br />
in essence, the avoidance weakened the benefit of the shielding because the mob missed sometimes which means the value of the shielding is gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course they still work together in that the sum of the two is better than either.<br />
Mob Hit 500<br />
Mob Normally Hits 100 times in a fight<br />
Shielding 20  (save 100 per blow)<br />
Avoidance say 5 extra misses per 100 hits<br />
<br />
No effects:  500*100 = 50,000 damage taken<br />
Shielding Only: 400 * 100 = 40,000 damage taken<br />
Avoidance Only: 500 * 95 = 47,500 damage taken<br />
Shielding + Avoid: 400 * 95 = 38,000 damage taken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saying avoidance makes shielding is worse is like those saying improved parry/dodge 3 mods are bad because they lower the evade rate of other skills (because you're getting hit less before those skills even check).<br />
<br />
You might as well say sitting down allows you to get more damage mitigated with defensive since it takes away the chance of being hit for low, which makes defensive less useful.<br />
<br />
The reason why mods don't stack like say 10% avoid + 10% mitigate = 20% is because if they do, they'd get too powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Im not saying they are bad.   But Im saying since they dont stack linearly<br />
you would have to consider thier reduced effect when you consider how much AC and how much HPS they are worth giving up.<br />
<br />
Take a simplistic example.  Honed Trinket of Protection from Qvic that an xp group can get.  it has relatively low AC, and relative low HPs, for someone in Qvic+  group.   However, 2 shielding can be worth the AC/HP trade.   <br />
<br />
But it is a little more complicated when you look &quot;full picture&quot;.  IE if a tank had say some specific number of avoidance (say 50) then the 2 shielding might no longer be saving them enough to be worth the AC/HP loss of wearing that ear.<br />
<br />
Or it might change thier own personal &quot;value&quot; rate<br />
Like a person with Zero Avoidance might Value 1 shielding as 50 hps<br />
and a person with 50 avoidance might value 1 shielding as 40 hps<br />
<br />
Both Stack, Both are Good.  But since there are really 4 variables AC, HPs, Avoidance (Both +Avoidance +Imp Dodge Types), Shielding.   <br />
<br />
((Of course you have the same kind of thinking with AC too.   High AC reduces the value of Avoidance, Shielding.))<br />
<br />
In the end, remembering that they dont stack linearly is only really important<br />
to tilt your own tradeoff values when comparing gear on all 4 categories.<br />
AC, Hps, Avoidance (motd or imp skills), and shielding are all win.  <br />
<br />
But you simply can't come up with 1 exact tradeoff amount because they dont stack linearly.</div></div><hr />

Tell me when ya pull that off hehe, I could probably get around 200ac from augs but not much more then that, atm I have about 100-150ac in augs, and get about 750hp from augs..lol Been workin towards ac now instead of hp though, need to get more ore of stone strength's.</div></div><hr />
