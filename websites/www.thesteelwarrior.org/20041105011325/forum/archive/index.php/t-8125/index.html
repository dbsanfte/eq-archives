Heres my magelo, I have about 7550hp and 1250ac fully buffed. With bard and Ranger I can get a little over 1300. What are some upgrades you sugest to raise my AC without hurting my hp very much? Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">grab helanic tundra greaves, boots, 2x wrist, neck, and helm. will boost your hp a bit as well as your ac. look into questing a Loyalist Shield of Honor thingy. will bump your ac a ton. and maybe a stonewood too if you can afford it. definately get a new haste belt too. Soulscream might be a cheap and easy fix, im sure they'res something better tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd sell the Ornate Hammer and get a CHoS or something with a useful proc, you'll have cash left over for Helanic too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i didnt notice your weapons the first time looking at your magelo, but now that i do, you should probably get new ones before getting any more armor. it wont be doing you any good if you're not getting beat on.</div></div><hr />

The very first thing I would do is replace your neckpiece, 0 AC is bad.<br />
<br />
Amulet of Mummy Wrappings are pretty cheap, although I'm sure others will suggest something better.<br />
<br />
Also, upgrade your other wrist, lots of choices there.  15 AC is low for a warrior, heck the bracer of benevolence quests are free if you have good CoV faction and a couple of friends (only a few ac better, but ok sta/hp).<br />
<br />
Obsidianwood Compound or similar bow would give more ac and hp...can be expensive though, not sure how your money situation is.<br />
<br />
Of course, LDoN can provide upgrades for about every slot if your plat poor but online a lot.  I'd also consider replacing your weapons with some agro generating ones if you're main tanking a lot (if you're not not tanking for groups, then your ac is wasted of course).  My weapons and my belt all came from Droga, if you can get a group (or at least 1 healer + 1 slower) to go with you, you can get all the drops yourself.<br />
<br />
Your legs should be (relatively) cheap to upgrade: Kylong Shinguards or Greaves of the Orcish Master.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I go into bazaar from time to time and just set all the settings for my warrior and just see whats affordable but yet still an upgrade for me.  If you get too much junk, up your minimum price to see useful gear.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I know personally I dropped close to a hundred hp in gear just a month or two ago to gain 50 ac.  Since you don't have many AA yet, remember you'll get more HP that way too.  I typically use the 1 ac ~ 6 hp rule.  I also try to get pure HP now over a similar item with STA, that lets me avoid having to spend aa to up my sta cap for awhile longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gillum_Bristle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What wepons do you sugest? I can probably spend about 20-25k each. 1hs and 1hb are capped. 2hs is 180ish I think. And should I go with a shield and 1hs/1hb or stick with 2 weps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get a CHOS &amp; SOTB or better take some friends and camp them in Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gillum_Bristle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had both of those and I sold them both. I'm looking for higher end wepons<br />
<br />
Oh and I bought some stuff today. Bought Helanic Tundra Greaves, and Mummy Amulet. Spent about 8k and got 41ac and 117hp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your weapons look to be your weakest slots to me.  Get the droga weapons again and put anger or ykesha augments on them, you'll be fine with them until something higher end drops or you drop the cash for a BoC, then.  I am personally using an anger 3'd Copper Hammer of Stirking and holding aggro just fine.  If a weapon had the graphic of a plastic spork, but held aggro good, well, dammit, I'd use the spork.  =P<br />
<br />
My next suggestion is to take a healer partner and camp a soul scream belt in veksar.  31% haste that costs you nothing is a good thing.  I held the camp with just me and my cleric bot and did just fine.  I went insane camping the belt, but I walked out with one.  <br />
<br />
If you want a new neck, I'd try for cultural or amulet of mummy wrappings, or taking a healer and goofing off in natimbi til a shell inlad collar drops. <br />
<br />
Other than that, I would suggest getting to Ldon and earning some armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">as far as buyable weapons, chos and sotb are probably going to be as good as you can get. its pretty much droga weapons, and boc. and i dont think you can afford a boc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You went and downgraded weapons, even though it probably doesn't feel like it. If you want weaps that do more damage keep those bagged for when you aren't tanking, but definitely get the droga combo again for when you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had both of those and I sold them both. I'm looking for higher end wepons<br />
Unfortunately, the weapons you replaced them with are inferior.<br />
<br />
If you just want more damage, then you should look at 2-handed weapons, such as the Velium Gemmed Greatsword.<br />
<br />
Damage weapons come cheap for warriors.  Aggro weapons do not.  You won't beat the Droga weapons if your total budget is 50k.<br />
<br />
When you have 150k to spend, then we can discuss higher end weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The best buyable aggro weapons in order (unless i'm sorelly mistaken)<br />
<br />
1. BoCarnage                          300-500k<br />
2. Scepter of Destruction         250-350k<br />
3. Copper Hammer of Striking 10-15k<br />
4. Sword of the Bloodsworn    10k<br />
5. Greatstaff of Thunder          .1K<br />
<br />
CHoS and SoTBS were heavensent for warriors as nothing good was affordable or common enough to actually buy before them as for aggro weapons.  They really are top notch.<br />
<br />
Honestly, after you rebuy the weapons you sold, just hang out in the bazaar and look for high ac armor that has decent hps on it.  LDoN droppables and racial armor are probably your best bets.  Drop your current haste and try to find an Enchanted Sash of Wonder or a Soulscream Belt.  The above posters have good suggestions on specifics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">don't misleed people : the Greatstaff of Thunder is better than any other weapon on your list. But if you compare DW combo to the 2Her you have that (assuming max haste and max aggro AA) GSoT is between BoC/SotB and SoD/CHoS if you don't have any augment, and if they are all A3 auged the GSoT is between SoD/SotB and SoD/CHoS. <br />
<br />
thus the GSoT is still better than the traditionnal CHoS/SotB combo. but for sure you are right that when we have a BoC then we can bag the GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I fought that battle for a long time in a few threads here Yoda, and i personally consider the GSoT better than the droga combo unless  both weapons in the duel wield setup have aggro augs from ldon....<br />
<br />
But, i gave up on that crusade somewhere around the 1000th derrogatory comment as per my knowledge and experience.<br />
<br />
Point being dont throw you cash away chasing after a SoD or a BoC .. there are a number of weapons that come close, and it isnt worth a quarter to a half of a million platinum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gillum_Bristle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well one good thing about Britlebane is that the prices are fooked up. You say CHoS is 15k? There like 6.5 on Bristle, and Bloodsworn's are like 5k and sometimes less if theres a bunch for sale.<br />
<br />
Thats for the help, looks i'm I'm gonna be going back to CHoS/Bloodsworn. Seems kinds disappointing to me but if so many people are sugesting it it must work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yikes, lol.</div></div><hr />

You are, of course, overlooking the possibility that all these people play alts on your server and have these weapons for sale in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
