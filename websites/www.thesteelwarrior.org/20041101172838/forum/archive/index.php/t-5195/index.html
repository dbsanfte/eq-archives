<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShaikYerbooty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Eventually I'll be employing 2HB (GSot, GSo4w) as my primary weapon.<br />
<br />
Until then I'm using the SotB/CHoS combination.<br />
<br />
At my current level (51) mobs stick to me like super-glue, and I have no difficulty obtaining and holding aggro in LDoN adventures....my mainstay.<br />
<br />
PoP is not in my gameplan for the future, though I may help friends and guildies in the Planes on occassion.  LDoN and GoD instanced dungeon encounters are likely where I'll always live on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
In other words, I will likely not be a main raiding MT, but rather MT for single-group encounters.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, would Anger 3 augs in each weapon, or Guard 4 and Spell Guard 3 be a better choice.  Or perhaps some other configuration?<br />
<br />
Opinions with explanations of precisely why would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will want your defensive AAs and Anger 3 on your primary weapon.  If you dont plan on going elementals, then your challange as a warrior will be to tank Hard LDON (in the current environment).  This means not only taking the damage of Hard LDON, but holding agro.  Spell Guard and Guard, while being &quot;nice&quot; do not do as much for accomplishing your goal of doing your 2 jobs as a warrior.  Holding agro and taking damage.<br />
<br />
The reason I say you will want anger 3 on your primary weapon is that I really cant say that ANY proc augment is worth it on your secondary weapon.  It will proc point 8 times a minute.  For 1150 points, I dont know that it justifies an Anger 3 augment, while if you put a 125 DD proc on it, you are getting a whopping TWO dps out of it.  Again, points better spent elsewhere.  <br />
If you truely felt that Guard was worth it as a buff, then putting guard on your offhand might be worth it, as the infrequent proc rate would probably not matter so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks!  I've just been wondering lately if I'll actually need the additional aggro.<br />
<br />
My understanding is the proc rate on the Guard/Spell Guard augs is very high, but that Anger augs proc much less.  I have no experience with either at this point, so have no personal experience to base it on.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering if the additional 5% mitigation might be the way to go, upping my damage absorption ability, or if I'll really need the additional aggro of the Anger augs.<br />
<br />
The idea would be putting Guard 4 in my Primary weapon, and Spell Guard 3 in my Offhand.<br />
<br />
I'll definitely be working my Defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I'd say Anger 3 in a GSoT when you get high enough.  I can use an unaugmented GSo4W for tanking in PoP and that works fine but anything in LDoN I break out the proc weapons because I often have aggro issues with the GSo4W down there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd recommend an Anger 3 aug's GSoT for tanking and a WMBS for when someone else is MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaik<br />
<br />
My own experience with Guard and Anger is they proc at about the same rate.  Guard adds zippo agro though (it acts like Vie line and not like Rune).<br />
<br />
I would caution against putting 1150 pt investments (guard 4 and anger 3) into droppable weapons.  Odds are at some point you will want to swap out and sell them (especially as you are close to GSoT usage range).<br />
<br />
I'd suggest not modding either weapon (as you currently dont have agro issues) and saving your points.  When you get a GSoT mod it with Anger 2 or 3 (something I have myself done with  quite satisfactory results).  <br />
<br />
Depending on your further needs I'd focus on obtaining 2 additional no-drop EB/stun procc'ing 1 handers (CHSD/GBoS/etc) and mod one with Anger 3 and the other with whatever else you deem appropriate.  This setup would serve you in the event you need a &quot;must have&quot; agro setup in high lvl 65 groups.<br />
<br />
Anyway just some thoughts...take or leave what you will and have fun ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have an agro weapon primary, and when i put anger 3 on it, I started getting complemented on my agro.  IMO pre elemental people dont get weapons that are good enough for you to say that you can hold agro &quot;good enough&quot; without an anger 3 on them.<br />
<br />
As far as the Guard on your offhand weapon.  In someways im dismissive of it.  But in others, I think about it this way.  Guard = 5 levels of innate defense (each level of ID is 1 percent less damage), and if people think its worth it to pay 15 AA points and you get that level of mitigation for putting it on your weapon... shrug, it might be worth it, because its certainly no worth putting a DPS proc on it.<br />
<br />
BTW, please dont talk about varying proc rates.  Its been proven many times, proc rates from LDON augs are 2 / min onhand, .8 offhand.  The onhand will increase with dex, the offhand wont.<br />
The reason why Guard and Spell guard would &quot;proc a lot&quot; is that they are buffs with duration, and as long as they proc once per the length of the duration, then its always on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as the Guard on your offhand weapon. In someways im dismissive of it <br />
<br />
I had about 2 months of hands on experience with the Guard 2 aug on the bloodsworn sword.  I found in low damage env like regular LDoN the item procc'd often enough to keep up with rate at which it was destroyed with consumption.  In PoP this wasnt nearly the case (it got blown through fairly rapidly).  I sold the bloodsworn sword and have since destroyed that aug ;-(<br />
<br />
I'm sold enough based on my experience that I will probably add a guard 4 aug somewhere in inventory in the future.  I personally think it adds some nice utility when you don't have a Vie casting cleric around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My first instinct would be to put Anger III on a GSo4W and not look back.  Obviously you have quite a ways to go to get your hands on one unless your guild is much higher level and better equiped than yourself (no offense intended btw). <br />
<br />
With that in mind I would buy nothing atm.  1150 pts is a lot of points to spend and time will tell if you need better mitigation via armor or guard or better aggro.  Apparently I take it neither is an issue atm in LDON for you.  Aggro and mitigation have their thresholds and sometimes enough is enough.  More aggro won't help you if you don't lose it to begin with and more mitigation only helps if it reduces the number of cheals you need.  If after every mob you are at 50% health the cleric probably heals you back to full.  If you were at 55% health the same would more than likely be done as well.  If you were at 80% though you could go another mob before getting healed more.<br />
<br />
With all that being said, if you are a warrior and tanking most of the time, it is my opinion that you cannot go wrong with aug'ing a weapon with Anger III, I love mine.  I would just make sure the weapon I aug'd would be used for a very long time for that investment of LDON points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've never heard/seen anything about some augs proccing more often than others.  I don't believe it's the case.<br />
<br />
I've never felt I had too much aggro, I don't think that could ever happen.  I have not ever regretting replacing 125yak with anger3 on my 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ShaikYerbooty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you all for some very insightful advice.  No offense taken on my gear, I don't belong to a raiding guild and most of what I have except weapons are gifts from long-time friends.<br />
<br />
Before I hit the Planes in any serious fashion I'll likely be fully outfitted in Takish LDoN plate and assorted similar gear.<br />
<br />
I have the GSot and WMBS already, so based on your collective advice I'll put an Anger augment in the GSot and leave my SotB and Chos unaugmented since they are working for me at this stage.<br />
<br />
I gather the aggro I'm generating at this point will be insufficient in the long run so I'll need the Anger augs.<br />
<br />
As for proc frequency, I've always been pretty skeptical about claims that some things proc more than others.  I've never noticed much difference in the various weapons I've used to this point.<br />
<br />
It's good to have confirmation on that point!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had quite a dilemma myself, having acquired both a Blade of Carnage and a Greatstaff of the Four Winds. However, I can't advise you about the offhand. I use an Ancient Prismatic Mace offhand, since the proc rate keeps up Avatar, oh, 80% of the time, when I'm dual wielding, though the Mace is not augmentable (none of the Avatar proccing weapons are, sadly). An Anger2 modified Blade of Carnage is more than sufficient aggro for every situation I have run into, including LDoN, Raid-mob tanking (Storms named, Bastion of Thunder named and Tower named, other various &quot;boss&quot; type mobs). <br />
<br />
If you acquire a massive aggro primary, and slap AngerX into it, you'll rarely find yourself on the short end of the stick - if it's a 2h or a 1h. The added advantage of the 1h is that your offhand can provide some utility, at the sacrifice of your DPS. The advantage of the 2h is well documented - fewer ripostes, more dps, etc etc.<br />
<br />
In the end, weigh your hard earned points against the possibility of saving cash/winning randoms/otherwise acquiring weapon upgrades. If you're going to be a big Adventure Point spender, sink your money into the weapon that does the most attacks (2h or 1h primary).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would advise you a middle way. Spending 2300 points on 2xA3 is a waste.<br />
<br />
Not because it wont do you good. <br />
But because that sheer amount of hate will probably not be needed.<br />
It is going to be overkill. And you wont even need it.<br />
<br />
ATM you dont have agro issues.  <br />
Augmenting a weapon is not only stupid but only non-efficient.<br />
(You cant fix a problem that doesnt exist).<br />
<br />
IF at some point if the future you DO have agro problems.<br />
Take the easy way out : Ykesha75  (500 points i think)<br />
<br />
However with 2 DD/Stun weapons you will be well into your 65.<br />
And you could tank in PoV/BoT with zero agro issues with a good<br />
group and a wise usage of incite.<br />
<br />
My advice : <br />
- Bank points and bank a lot of them.<br />
- Slowly start looking at the Miragul plate (Legs 1st, buy but dont augment)<br />
- IF you have agro issues, augment the main hand with Ykesha75<br />
<br />
And if you ever get that &quot;I'll never change 2H&quot; put Anger3.<br />
But that will be in a LONG time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, actually that would be my advice too.  Dont spend the points on anger augs til you actually see agro issues, and even then, i would advise not doing anger 2, but saving for anger 3.<br />
<br />
Also, although this is a bit in the future for you, dont get LDON boots or gloves.  There are hard ldon drops which you might eventually get, and you will regret spending points on something you could have gotten better with a drop.</div></div><hr />
