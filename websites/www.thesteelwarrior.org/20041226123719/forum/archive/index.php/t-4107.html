<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doctor Choddy C</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically have a couple of questions, been reading here a few threads but I just can't find the info I'm looking for... ;/<br />
<br />
1) Basically first up, its been pretty much said that standard weps are 2PPM.  LDoN augs would also proc 2PPM so your wep would proc up to 4 times a min?<br />
<br />
2) Also, how would call of sky/fire work regarding this?  Would they be considered wourth getting?  If they are 2 PPM then thats all good, but if they overwrite one of the other 2 somehow, I don't want it on as the standard proc on wep and LDoN proc will be superior....<br />
<br />
3) Where the hell can I find something to work out average and maximum hit for weps?  Wondered how much +1poison damage on a 17/19 wep would be for DPS...... I wanted to find out how much that poison damage (if wasn't resisted) did on the wep per hit....I can't find any formulas anywhere, please point me in the right direction if I've been blind....<br />
<br />
BTW, on last part this is assuming that your level 65 and damage bonus is 13.<br />
<br />
Thank you for help, hope I can get the answers I need.</div></div><hr />

2)it is one more procs<br />
3)max hit for a weapon is lvl dependant ,there is a formula for that ( sorry , don't remember it .. somethig like DB + (dmg *5.7) i think).<br />
avg hit is target dependant (AC of target in fact), so no way to set an average sorry ... well, one way : parses !<br />
a 17+1 poison damage weapon will be considered 17 dmg weapon if PR check successful, 18 dmg if PR check is failled. check is on a per hit basis ... basically u can consider the weapon an average 17.5 dmg.<br />
if not resisted , the poison does 1/18 of the damages , DB not included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doctor Choddy C</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okies so with a standard wep, u can have 5 procs a min?<br />
<br />
2 (wep) + 2 (aug) + 1 (call of sky/fire)<br />
<br />
That right?<br />
<br />
Okies and 3rd part..... I'm sure u can calculate avg and max hits, as shown here, but this is out of date....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">max hit : as i said , u can , and it is something like what i said for lvl 65/maxstr/maxskill.<br />
no valid formula is known right now to calculate  anyone's max hit, even if a lot of theorical ones exists (the one on monkly business is /was one of them)<br />
<br />
modal : modal is NOT average and their formula is the good one for modal calculation.<br />
<br />
as i said, if u wanna know how good is your weapon, parse it, that's the only way. and parse versus each mob u plan to fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doctor Choddy C</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't parse it :(<br />
<br />
Reason being is these are deciding what weps to get, don't actually have em :/<br />
<br />
But ty much for your help, your info is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
