<br />
Is this sewers timed? and if so does timer stop when you get all 3 tools, or when you go back to Elej?<br />
<br />
Do you need to give  Elej anything, or just hail him?<br />
<br />
Tried invising past the underwater portion tonight, but got to many adds trying to kill spirit after water.<br />
<br />
Any info would be nice, not much written, since most bipass sewers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ummm, you get to Alej and do the text thing and he despawns the entire zone, save those 3 rooms and just a few roamers.  You can invis from room to room for this portion.  Not sure on the *exact* amount of time you're given, but it's somewhere between 30 and 60 minutes.  You do not need to clear the entire rooms, just until you get the emote.  The timer goes until you get back to Alej and say (I *think*) &quot;I have your tools&quot;. At which point everyone in the group gets flagged, hooray.  The zone doesn't lock out, so you could gimp people in.<br />
<br />
Clearing takes eternity in there with so many roamers and stuff.  You'd be best off to get a rogue to SoS and do the turn in.  But if you're a gimp like me, have fun clearing~  We found it possible to invis past the underwater part.  When you come up, run to the back on the water where all the static slimes are.  Clear some of them so that you've got room, and then continue pulling mobs out from the hallway.  Do NOT fight on the stairs/in the hall at least to start with, as there are a bajillion roamers that take that path.  The tricky part is that with some of the smaller mobs like stonemites, you can't land spells on them when you're up to your ankles in water...but it can be done.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Clearing takes forever, takes to long right now to do after a raid night, like I did for 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
Thanks for info ))</div></div><hr />
