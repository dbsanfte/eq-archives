<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I've been thinking of making a return to EQ after a few months away (left 2-3weeks before OoW came out). I still have my warrior account and I promised myself that if I ever go back to EQ it would have to be with either a cleric or shaman being boxed. Now here lies the problem. I plan to run both characters on the same computer and my present computer is less than optimal for 2boxing. Now that I have a little bit of spare cash saved up I'm planning on getting a bit newer computer. Nothing top of the line but something decent enough to 2box.<br />
<br />
My question to you, the reader, is; what are the minimum-to-average system requirments for 2boxing?<br />
<br />
I'm not a computer wiz or really knowledgable on computer lingo so try to keep the instructions fairly basic.</div></div><hr />

You could probably go a bit lower than that, but you may have to be kind of extreme about minimizing lag.  The Ram is the most important thing.</div></div><hr />

I three boxed on a 900mhz duron with  512MB of ram and a TI 4200 I think... wasnt too bad for velks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience has been that you can't 2box in any OOW zone with only 1GB RAM, even with everything turned off. My dual CPU machine may be playing into that though. Just buy tons of RAM and you'll probably be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that's true.  I attempted to 2-box in OoW with the comp I listed above and it was very very crappy.  OoW is really rough for running 2 characters on one machine for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atkins</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2 box the bloodfields w/o problem with 1gb pc.  With a lot of fx on too.  No real problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2box in OoW np with an athlon 2400, 1gb ram, and radeon 8500 128mb. I use old models and have spell effects off so that helps, but I run both sessions at 1280x1024.</div></div><hr />
