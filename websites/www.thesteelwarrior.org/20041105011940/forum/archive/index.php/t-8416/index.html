<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there are a couple of slots that LDoN (tak) armor flat out beats Ornate.  Looks like Wrists are one example.  What about the other slots though? Also, Everfrost LDoN armor looks a bit more like Ornate in Stats than some of the Tak armor.  Seems like Takish armor was meant more for Pally's and Clerics and such.  Anyway, slot by slot what would you recomend? Tak LDoN, EF LDoN or Ornate.  I've looked at it and made a few decisions, but want a second opinion :).  Already have the Ornate gauntlets btw.  Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
Forgot to add...what order should I upgrade if I should go with Ornate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nro ldon armor (royal attendant) is better than ornate in every slot, even more so after you augment it. It has more ac and more raw hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great thing about LDoN armor is that after your done with it(upgraded to something else) you can sell it back and get a good number of points back.  LDoN stuff beats ornate in every way IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, thing is...I have pp to buy ornate now, it will be a LONG time before I have the points for all that armor.  So, what should I buy now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have the pp go for Farwater armor (POP tradeskill), they have aproximatly the same AC as ornate (thus beter than EF and lower than Tak) but have the biggest HP from buyable stuff :<br />
<br />
<br />
------------ Farwater Plate -------------- Kizrak's ----------------- Malevolent ------- Royal Attendant<br />
Helm --------- 35 / 90 --------- 34 / 60 + Plainsight ------------ 35 / 60 ------------- 39 / 75 ------<br />
BP ------------- 65 / 120 ------- 63 / 115 + Shield buff --------- 63 / 75 ------------- 69 / 100 ------<br />
Arms --------- 35 / 90 -------- 34 / 60 ------------------------------ 31 / 65 ------------- 34 / 80 -------<br />
Wrists -------- 27 / 70 -------- 28 / 45 ------------------------------ 25 / 55 ------------- 28 / 70 -------<br />
Gloves ------- 33 / 80 -------- 33 / 60 + haste buff ------------- 31 / 60 ------------- 34 / 75 -------<br />
legs ---------- 43 / 100 ------ 45 / 90 + sta buff ----------------- 44 / 70 ------------- 48 / 65 -------<br />
feet ---------- 33 / 90 -------- 33 / 55 ------------------------------- 31 / 55 ------------- 34 / 70 -------<br />
sum-------- 298 / 710 --- 298 / 530 + some buff ------ 285 / 495 ---------- 314 / 605 ----<br />
slots ---------- type 7 ----------------- type 7 --------------------- type 1, 2 &amp; 3 ------ type 1, 2 &amp; 3 ---<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus unged Farwater give are better than unauged Tak, but you can't improve them as much...<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />

EDIT : the best buyable helm slot is still the helmet of rallos zek (55 / 100 + truesight).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you have the money for ornate buy it and then move on to GoD content. you can focus all you point from the random ldon on anger yak augs and not worry about armor, also you could jump right into hards at 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Considering Farwater Greaves are 600k and Ornate is 110k I'll go with Ornate :).  Only Farwater Greaves were available also, and only one of them.  Going to sit on the PP for a bit though and see what I can find.   Thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hehehe, yep farwater is a heck lots of pp because they are made from EP drops so they crafters are few and keep them highly prized. that's one more reason for them to keep EP closed to most of other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, guess its time to farm PoW with my main :).  Got a friend with 249 smithing so maybe eventually...<br />
Not to worry though, bought Ornate BP and Wrist.  Legs were too high and provided the least upgrade.  Same for boots.  LDoN Arms will be my first purchase there.  Other Wrist and Helm to follow if I don't get any Ornate drops before then.  BP and Legs are the only things that don't drop from normal Sol Ro mobs, so if I get the drops...that's more points I can spend on augs :).</div></div><hr />

If you can farm it yourself, then ornate is not a bad choice since it only cost you 500pp to make. If you are actually paying for the armor, then ornate is the worst choice you can make. Not only is LDoN armor better, but if you pick and choose the items per slot, you can get equivalent/better than ornate with straight bazaar tradeable items. If you REALLY don't want to put the time in to get LDoN Armor, then I would start shopping the bazaar for these items:<br />
<br />
Ears: Mosquito Leg Earring, Lizard Bone Earring, Iron Cog Earring, Tear of the Rainmaker, or Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
Neck: You have a decent neck, get a 10ac aug for it<br />
Face: Amygdalan's Chain Mask, Thulian Visage of Horror<br />
Helm: Helm of Rallos Zek<br />
Rings: Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience<br />
Bracer: Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet or Crystallized Acid Bracer<br />
Arms: Elbow Spiked Arm Plates or Dried Clay Armguards<br />
Shoulders: Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates or Forged Shoulderpads<br />
BP: even though you have ornate already, get an NRo BP, 69ac 200hp with the right augs<br />
Back: Crinose Cape of the Werewolf, Sol Ro Emblazoned Cloak, Hierophant's Cloak, Iksar Hide Cape<br />
Waist: Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
Boots: Boots of the Storm or Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites<br />
Range: Featherwood Compound Bow or Stonewood Compound Bow<br />
<br />
Your other slots should do fine with what you have already. You'll notice that I have recommended that you replace your haste item without recommending a new haste item. Just use tribute, you are giving up a lot of AC/HP with less than raid acquired 41% haste.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, like I said...can farm Sol Ro for everything except the legs and BP.  I bought the BP for 50k seemed like a good deal to me and I paid for it with Ornate Leather I sold :).  Thing is, Greagor is an Alt/For Fun character.  I do plan on getting some of the Tak armor, just don't have the time to get a lot of it.  Thanks a lot for the suggestions though.  I'll keep an eye out for some of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Legs do drop from trash in SolRo, so you can plan to farm them there too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd seen chain legs drop there but never Plate legs from anything but named...good to know :). <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Eh, I still have ornate bracers, boots, and legs.  I know at least for the bracers and boots, I could buy something in the bazaar with more hit points, but I just don't think it's enough more hit points to bother with.  I won the bracers, so those were cheap.  My big mistake was buying the boots instead of buying boots of dark rites.  Oh well.  I'll probably wait until I can get a more significant upgrade though.  <br />
<br />
Given infinite adventure points, certainly switching out for aug'ed north ro armor would be better, but I'm sick of ldons.  :p<br />
<br />
by the way, I have a 30hp/end aug from GoD in slot 1 of my north ro bp (i think it fits in any slot and is from Tipt, but it's LORE), a 40 hp slot 2 bought with points, and an empty slot 3.  Where do you get another 30 hp aug that will fit in slot 3 to bring my total on the armor to 200?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The VP key &quot;Cipher of Veeshan&quot; is 30/30/30 all/any, so you could use it in that spot, Callon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">callon, there two type all aug from low GoD that give 30 HP : <br />
Gem of Bolstered Power (30HP/30Mana) <br />
Sparkling Gem of Protection (30HP/30Endu).</div></div><hr />
