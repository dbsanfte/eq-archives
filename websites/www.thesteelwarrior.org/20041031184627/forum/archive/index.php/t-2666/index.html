<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dugman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just curious if anybody else is using dot weapons.  It seems to work reasonably well for me, and either way it's kind of fun to do.  For reference, here are my weapons, with procs in parentheses:<br />
<br />
Narandi's Lance (33 damage per tick for 18 ticks)<br />
Blood Fire (24 per tick for 21 ticks)<br />
Heartspike (20 per tick for 15 ticks)<br />
Blade of Strategy (nuke/aggro)<br />
Jagged blade of war (nuke/aggro)<br />
<br />
<br />
I use Narandi's Lance until it procs, then switch in Blood Fire and Heartspike.  Once one of them procs, I switch in the Blade of Strategy.  Once my last disease weapon procs, I swap in the Jagged Blade of War.<br />
<br />
This seems to work pretty well, especially when I have a good dex buff.  In fact, once I get two or three diseases going, even if I lose aggro for a moment the diseases can regain aggro automatically at the tick mark before I even have a chance to try a taunt.  You might think that dots breaking mez would be an issue, but in fact this has been surprisingly rare.  I can only count two or three cases where enchanters have tried to mez something I dotted, and even in those cases it didn't affect the outcome of the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong: I'm not claiming my weapons are better than more common weapons.  I'm just mentioning it since it's kind of fun switching weapons around during the fight and it does seem to work.  And I'm curious if anyone else uses a similar strategy.<br />
<br />
Now if only I could get Ichorflow from Grieg.... =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that was your question ...<br />
<br />
I do not use any dot weapons since I am usually puller or tagger my enchanter would get highly upset if I riposted and procced on a multiple pull and mez breaks cause of a bad proc (<br />
<br />
That's just me though.. I got a pocket enchanter and she gets pissed when she has to channel a root or a charm especially when she is not expecting it.  There is one thing &quot;knowing&quot; youll need to root or charm then mezzing a few adds , having one break on the dot tick and then hauling but to her mid cast of another mez. Nah shed deny me haste or annul a mob or something mean :)<br />
<br />
No dot procs for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;Wavecrasher procs a slow and dot&quot;<br />
<br />
I actually had wavecrasher briefly, but I found out that the proc doesn't stack with shaman and enchanter slows.  So I ended up trading it back, since 95% of the time I'm in a group with an enchanter or shaman slower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've never once riposted and procced a dot on an add on a pull that I can remember.  I guess it's possible, but since it's never happened  to me it doesn't seem like it's worth worrying about.  I mean, think about it: you'd have to have a bad pull and you'd have to riposte the wrong mob AND your proc would have to go off on the riposte.  It'd be very rare if it even occurs.</div></div><hr />

I said:<br />
<br />

That's just me though<br />
<br />
I do not use them in a box, I do not use them with a fox, i do not use dot weapons with a proc. <br />
<br />
I gave the reason; I can not afford to have a mez broken on a pull while duel boxing an enchanter, and yes I have proced on a pull numerous times using Silken Whip of Ensnaring, Blade of Strategy, Copper Hammer of Striking, and Sword of the Bloodsworn.  <br />
<br />
Sure your post sounded very good, gathering agro from swapping out 5 different weapons to gain agro and dps is wonderful, though I don't play a bard anymore, it does seem tiring and procs are &quot;random&quot; to be swapping for a proc. <br />
<br />
It is not anything I do much, swapping weapons constantly.  Good idea though )  Much more ambidexterous then I am.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's just me though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">have to have a bad pull and you'd have to riposte the wrong mob  <br />
<br />
Can't riposte a mob that you don't have targetted.  But I usually target mobs when I pull them and I dont pull badly, impossible with an enchanter.  But if I target two or more I don't know if I procced.  Im so conused now my head hurts (  <br />
<br />
/points at herself<br />
<br />
I don't use DoT weapons, just doesn't seem right, seems like too much can go wrong. <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Faederya, are you sure you can't riposte mobs you don't have targeted? I've farmed Unrest before, for zombie skins for a rogue friend, and on numerous occasions, once i get a train of tons of mobs on me, I've killed one mob, and when I switch to the next one, it's already partially dead. I can't think of any other reason for this to happen except for a riposte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;I actually had wavecrasher briefly, but I found out that the proc doesn't stack with shaman and enchanter slows.

<br />
The proc may not stack, but it still generates the proper amount of aggro that you need.<br />
<br />
The only problem with wavecrasher is it's still just a 9/19 and when it doesn't proc, it generates as much aggro as that old Lamentation was generating for you. Back in the day that was great. These days, that's just not that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You most definitely can riposte mobs that you don't have targetted as long as they are in your front arc.  I have done it far too many times farming greens.<br />
<br />
One curious thing I have seen though, and it could just be my imagination, but I used to slow a lot with a TOD since my tier one groups rarely had a slower.  I typically pulled as well.  Now if I ran into camp with a mob hot on my heels, it seemed that I riposted and proc'd a lot as I turned to face the mob.  Would get the &quot;mob has slowed down&quot; message and then turned on attack.  Seemed to happen many times.  This very rarely seemed to happen when the mob had to catch up to me.<br />
<br />
The other half of the observation comes from Plane of Tactics and aggro kiting.  A friend who has a rogue doens't exactly pay a great deal of attention and eats a lot of ripostes when the snared mob turns to run.  Is it just me or do mobs riposte a great deal of time when they turn?<br />
<br />
Maybe I am crazy as I have no parsing to prove/disprove this but it has always appeared to me that mobs (and possibly PC's) riposte at a greater rate while spinning than normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can't riposte a mob that you don't have targetted. <br />
<br />
Sure ya can.  My favorite pull is &quot;Inc assloads&quot; and then hit the riposte disc and mow em all down with something big.<br />
<br />
However, i'll tell ya straight up why I don't use all that shit -- I'M LAZY.  I'm sure this is quite a bit of the reason Fay doesn't do it either.  When you're playing 2 toons, you don't have time for all that fancy shit.<br />
<br />
However, I understand that playing a warrior is rather boring at times.  I'd expect all of you single character playing bastards to do this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can't riposte a mob that you don't have targetted <br />
<br />
Ok, I stand corrected.  Sorry for the misinformation.  Though that only strengthens my response about not using dot weapons (<br />
<br />

<br />
Ha, play a enchanter in PoP.  Boring is an understatement.  Sometimes I wish i didnt invest is Spell Cating Subtlety3, she can't agro off me for the life of her now ( <br />
<br />
/yawn ...  <br />
<br />
Though Droga and CT and ChardokB and SolC and Fear are still fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, the more I think about it, the more I think that this is probably just for shits and giggles.<br />
<br />
even if you have ALL of those effects on a mob at once (which is probably only every other mob at best), that's still only an extra 12 DPS.  The real question is how much do you lose doing all the swapping to inferior ratio weapons over lets say a windblade?  Your 1h combo is pretty inferior to a windblade by far, so while i'm sure it's cool, it's probably a lot more work than it's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All that swapping would make for alot of work. I don't use dot weapons, but if I did I don't think it would be worth all that for the limited returns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's for shits and giggles.  I mainly just do it for fun, not because I think it's necessarilly better than using a single uber aggro weapon.   I posted here mainly because I was curious if anyone else tried this.<br />
<br />
As far as the extra 12 DPS, I'm not sure that entirely reflects the aggro situation.  It seems like dots generate a tiny bit more aggro than their straight damage would indicate.  I'm not entirely sure if I'm right about that, but I've seen some times where I lose aggro, for instance, and the extra 50 or 70 dot damage kicks in and immediately regains the aggro.  50 damage doesn't seem like enough of a hit to really sway aggro like that, though.<br />
<br />
I really don't know for sure, though.  Anybody know off-hand how dot aggro really works?  I guess my questions there would be:<br />
<br />
- When dot damage goes off each tick, is there a small amount of bonus aggro or minimum aggro generated each time?<br />
<br />
- Does aggro degrade over time between hits?  If so, spreading damage with a dot would keep aggro constantly coming in, as opposed to a single big nuke which might degrade after a tick or two.<br />
<br />
Just curious</div></div><hr />

Well any necro will tell you that the Blood line (Aside from Pyre) doesn't generate a whole helluva lot of aggro.  When I was still playing my necro I could Pyrocuror a mob the instant it got into camp and I never pulled aggro, and Pyrocuror does quite a bit more damage than Boil Blood.<br />
<br />
I believe most of the aggro is actually caused by the disease counters on mobs...so things like a Chelaki Tail end up being good taunt, even tho they're just a very minor DOT.</div></div><hr />

...I believe most of the aggro is actually caused by the disease counters on mobs...so things like a Chelaki Tail end up being good taunt, even tho they're just a very minor DOT.  <br />
<br />
<br />
That's an interesting idea.  In my case, my procs are:<br />
<br />
Boiling Blood - 33 per tick, fire based -100 resist<br />
Boil blood - 24 per tick, fire based -100 resist<br />
Miasma - 20 per tick, 9 counter disease<br />
<br />
<br />
So if your theory is right miasma is actually drawing the most aggro of the three, even though the blood spells do more damage and are much harder to resist.  Maybe I'll fiddle around taking boil blood out of the rotation or moving it around and see how it compares.<br />
<br />
(By the way, I always kind of wanted to get a Chelaki Tail for laughs.  Something about giving a monster a permanent teeny case of the flu gives me a chuckle.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This &quot;counter&quot; aggro theory is interesting. Can someone explain the difference between &quot;raises disease counter by 9&quot; and &quot;decreases disease resist by 100&quot; ?<br />
Notably the Great sword of Bllodsworn, ,which I found to have pretty good aggro, has a dot but also changes the &quot;counter&quot;, which may explain the aggro. It seives Hp and mana but also changes the poison counter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This &quot;counter&quot; aggro theory is interesting <br />
<br />
It's not really a theory, it's a really well established fact.  It's why shamans have such a hard time doing damage....because of all the DR/PR counters on their most efficient spells.<br />
<br />
Basically a 'counter' is this...it's a little placeholder on your character that represents the strength of a certain spell.  For example... Trakanon's AE adds 9 poison counters.  Now take a look at the spell &quot;Cure poison.&quot;  Cure poison removes 1 poison counter per cast, so it would take 9 casts of Cure poison to remove Trakanon's AE.  By comparison, Counteract Poison removes 8 poison counters, so that would take 2 casts to cure that same spell (8 from the first cast, and then you still have 1 counter left, so you need to cast again).<br />
<br />
For the most part, the higher taunting DoT's and effects have counters added to them...Poison or Disease.  Boil Blood line has to be annuled, and leaves no counters on the mob, so it's fairly low aggro.  By comparison, Bane of Nife is 10 poison counters...it generates quite a bit of aggro.  Even the disease DoT's like Scourge and Pox generate a fair chunk of aggro, even tho their damage is less than the poison lines, just because of the disease counters which they place on mobs.<br />
<br />
So, for effects, if it has a poison or disease counter, chances are, it's really bitching aggro.  If it doesn't, then you might not have as good of luck.</div></div><hr />

14/24 proc: envenomed Breath which on the blade is 30DD and 200 poison dmg over 30 seconds. Doesn't sound like much but this blade out taunts the red epic easily, and it has an amazing proc rate.<br />
The main problem in getting this blade is it no longer drops in game as of a long time ago so it is exceptionally rare.<br />

Thanks for that info...I'm still a little confused though. If my sword adds 9 poison counters to a mob, does it only affect the dot from the sword? Or does it also lower poison resist for other casters? Or are spells which lower resists and spells which add counters totally different?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's a nice weapon, although 5 ticks isn't very long.  My own hobby is collecting weapons with longer procs (ie that last at least 10 ticks).  Wavecrasher is a nice one in that category, although unfortunately the dot won't stick if the monster is slowed by a shaman or enchanter.<br />
<br />
There aren't all that many weapons with 10+ tick duration dots for warriors, let alone tradeable ones.  In fact, I think I have the tradeable ones I'm interested in.<br />
<br />
As far as my wish-list of no-drop weapons, I'd love to get my hands on Ichorflow (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28829), but I'm not holding my breath.  The Great Sword of Pestilence (Vex Thal) and The Rotting Fist (Bertoxxolous) are probably the two best disease proc weapons - both have nice stats and proc Scourge.  <br />
<br />
Other no-drop weapons include:<br />
<br />
Wicked Shank (BoT) - Heat Blood<br />
Club of Slime (Earth) and Trident of the Deep Sea (ToV) - Waves of the Deep Sea<br />
Nevderia's Horn (ToV) - Suffocate<br />
Chelaki Tail (DN) - Strong Disease (ie permanent case of flu)<br />
Ornate Greatblade (Fire) - Boil Blood<br />
<br />
and Malevolence (GM event artifact) - Malevolent grasp (only 9 ticks, but an interesting item)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are completely different concepts, but they both can be in a spell.<br />
<br />
Spells that add counters just mean they can be cured by using the appropriate cure.  Spells that lower resists will say so in the spell description.  That doesn't mean that they are mutually exclusive however.....the ______ Decay line for shamans lowers DR, and adds Disease counters.  That means that everyone has a better chance of landing spells on a being with that debuff on, but if you wanted to get rid of it, a cure disease would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Poison counters seem to be &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than disease counters for aggro as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It might just be that in general, things with poison counters do their damage faster as well, giving the illusion that they do more aggro because you have more damage accumulating faster.</div></div><hr />
