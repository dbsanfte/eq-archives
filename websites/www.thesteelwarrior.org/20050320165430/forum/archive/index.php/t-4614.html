quote-<br />
The Sleeper was killed one time by Legacy of Steel if I'm not mistaken. <br />
<br />
They killed him useing a pathing exploit under a bridge in his room that prevented him from AE deathtouching them. I belive they did it over a few hours CoHing tanks to the bad pathing area when he AEed. The sleeper was ment to be unkilable, but through this bug they killed him. At this time, Everquest had no code of making npcs completly invunerable, things that wheren't ment to be killed such as the Sleeper or the Priest of Discord (ahhhh memories of that bug lol) where just buffed to insanse points that should render them unkillable but still attackable. After this, Sleeper's hp was bumped up to an absolutly insane amount like 10^100, last I heard a GM death touched him for a while and never made his health bar move ;). -end quote<br />

&quot;Wait for a sign from Gozer the Traveler; he will come in one of the pre-chosen forms.<br />
During the rectfication of the Voldrani, the Traveler came as a large and moving Tor.<br />
Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the Machetrik Supplicants,<br />
they chose a new form for him -- that of a Giant Slor!<br />
Many Shevs and Zuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day I can tell you!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering that LoS archives explicitly show them LOSING to the Sleeper, this is hogwash<br />
<br />
If I can find the exact page in their site I will link it.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Sony congratulated Rallos for doing something NO one else had done... considering this, it seems pretty obvious that LOS didn't kill The Sleeper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conquest suposedly exploited the axis to avoid 4th warders AoE and got disbanded.<br />
<br />
now Bnet is on a Anti Uberguild crusade because they are disalusioned in what uber guilds are about. and get their info all messesed up. <br />
<br />
my post of a Bnet Quote was just an example of bnet people getting everything all screwed up. and i thought it was funny.</div></div><hr />
