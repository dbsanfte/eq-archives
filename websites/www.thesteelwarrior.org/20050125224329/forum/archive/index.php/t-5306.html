<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd probably go with a Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn, since they can essentially last you to 65 if needed.  Don't worry too much about the recommended on these - currently these still proc at 1 and the recommended doesn't affect damage, as I have been told.<br />
<br />
For armor, look for decent non-recommended level gear.  Acrylia Plate or Crustacean gear are ok and should be fairly cheap.  Skull-Shaped Barbute is a great twink helm and always cheap.  <br />
<br />
Don't forget haste too.  SCHW is probably the best bang-for-your-plat, so I'd give them a look see.  <br />
<br />
6/65 rings of course are a great option as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SotB and CHoS is one of the best buyable weapon combos for a warrior at the moment, and have heard they arent effected by recommended level with regard to damage/delay/proc.<br />
<br />
Try for a haste item with &gt;30% haste, Cloak of Flames is your best option, but failing that Soulscream belt or Runed Bolster Belt will do.<br />
<br />
Get 2x 6ac 65hp rings and fill the rest of your slots with crustacean / crafted / gothic steel type stuff which is dirt cheap in the bazaar.  You can upgrade with Fierce Heraldic (assuming you do the right thing and worship RZ) as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Full Crusty + the 2 swords above + ...<br />
<br />
EDIT - bad info removed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mosq leg earrings... required: 51.<br />
Valorium Ring... required 46, recc 51.<br />
<br />
Those two don't make for good twink items. In general, only items to twink with that have rec levels are weapons, otherwise it's easier to get cheap crusty/acrylia/etc &quot;filler&quot; gear until 45+ when you get the nicer stuff.<br />
<br />
And CHoS/SotBS are a must for twinkage, along with some form of haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For armor I'd say just comb through the bazaar. You can find stuff like crusty, cobalt, engraved royal velium, gothic steel and crap like that for pretty cheap most of the time. Spend 25k on the weapons and haste and mix and match your armor, and you'll probably have cash left over IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinro</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i'm done buying and this is what 55k gets you nowadays.<br />

<br />
Overpaid a tad on a couple items but didn't find out till later. :o<br />
Overall i'm quite satisfied, this should easilly last me until 50+ and i'll probably make the weapons last to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks good.  Now start saving for FH, since several of your armor pieces will last you to upper 40's or so, but not much past that.<br />
<br />
One small piece of advice, and you probably already realized it.  Put the CHoS mainhand and the SoBS in your offhand at your level.  The extra 100dd on the proc will certainly make a difference against the mobs you are fighting at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinro</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye FH is what I was planning to get next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Offtopic but, the other day I got an invite to a group in PoV and having nothing better to do I jumped on it. It turned out that I was replacing a 57 warrior that the group was kicking out because he was in a full set of crafted. I felt kinda bad for the guy, and he was pissed, but seriously - crafted in PoV at 57?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">weapons look good and you have a haste item. only thing i dont like is that manna/hp necklass. i know there is a controversy over which is more important between hp and ac but this one has no ac at all. having said that though i would say you did a very good job of setting up your warrior which i presume was a nights work.</div></div><hr />
