<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CentariAdun</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there some sort of known bug with the Furios line of discipline's timers?  I imagine that they are based on actual time not on Game time, since if you use them all, then log off, then come back an hour later, they are all back up again.  <br />
<br />
In our Tank lineup, we have on average of 7-9 Warriors for Time.  It has been the case more than once where the warrior before me in the RoT would use his discipline, then die, then I would jump in and use furious.  Now, he &quot;should&quot; have his disc reset before mine, but that hasn't been the case as of late.  My furious disc would pop before his.<br />
<br />
We have one warrior who seems to have his repop ever 25 minutes or so from time to time.  Is the timer based on your PC clock or something?  I cant imagine that, that is the case.</div></div><hr />

I had a guildmate who had his year wrong or something on computer clock and his timer on disc was not working for a very long time.<br />
<br />
I dont think that means you can hack it to run around with furious disc on nonstop however.  I think the timer is based on your computer, and to actually use the thing, your timer on your computer has to be ready so you can send the command to use the disc.  Then the server checks and decides if you can or not.<br />
<br />
Of course, i could be totally wrong.</div></div><hr />

When I would zone back in, Incite timer is almost always sitting at 3 mins or so.<br />
<br />
I /bugged it, but I can tell you from experience that there is a bug with the timers at times.</div></div><hr />
