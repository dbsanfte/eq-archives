<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I fucking hate keys. I took a break a few months ago, while my old (applying again) guild killed off Coirnav, Xegony, Mystical Arbitor of Earth and Rathe Council. So I come back, and over this last week, I've missed 4 raids out of 5 I could make due to not having PoEb and Time keys. <br />
<br />
This fucking pisses me off so bad. I made it to all of the flagging in PoP to GET EP flagged, which I could be just raided into. Then I take an untimely break, and now I need *KEYS* to get into the raids. What kind of stupid bullshit makes SOE change the entire raiding system for the end of PoP? What's the point of my having attended all of these raids earlier if all that REALLY matters is getting those keys? Isn't the entire purpose of their system of raiding people into zones so guilds DON'T have to go back and kill every damn mob?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everquest, since the &quot;vision&quot; departed, has become more and more and more like other Sony products. Think of it as a really time consuming PS-2 RPG type of thing. And that explains why it's all keyed and flagged and all that other crap.<br />

They turn you into a goat, dye you pink, and run over you with a truck to kill you first.</div></div><hr />
