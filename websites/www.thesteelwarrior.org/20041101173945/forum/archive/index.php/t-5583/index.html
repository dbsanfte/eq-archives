<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roorni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I am a 53 warrior with about 2000plat in bank.  I usually group with a cleric, pally and a beastlord.  I have been told I tank pretty well and manage to hold aggro for the most part.  <br />
<br />
I know that my armor needs to be upgraded just not really sure where to start.  This is my main and hope to become MT for guild.  Any suggestions or advice is most welcome.  I thought about doing the Twilight armor quest but have been told it not worth the time it takes.  Have only been to Kael one time with raid and not seen any plate armor drop for the Thrugdin quest yet.<br />
<br />
Please check out my magelo by clicking on my name and offer any advice you see fit.  Thanks.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They're right about the Twilight armor, absolutely not worth the time it takes to quest it.  All the pieces are however droppable, sometimes you'll find pieces for sale in the bazaar.  I would not however suggest trying to buy them as you see them, if all the items for one piece are there at the same time go ahead, but many of the drops drop in the extreme unhunted areas of Luclin, you might spend 300p on all but one of the pieces and never see the last one because people don't hunt them.  Overall I'd suggest not bothering.  <br />
<br />
As far as Kael is concerned, it is in fact a wonderful way to get better gear for the underfunded.  The drop rate in general does kinda of just suck in there though.  You might want to look into the plate cycle and see if your guild can handle it, use the search feature for that and you should find some good posts.  Every mob in the cycle has a chance to drop some kind of plate quest piece, and you can run it continously as long as you can keep up.<br />
<br />
Looking at your gear it seems you have also spent a little time in Umbral.  Thats also a good spot for a few upgrades, the moktor gear isn't terrific but a few of the pieces, like boots, outshine the Kael armor IMO.  Also there you get a chance at some of the named that roam by the zone in, they all drop good stuff, Helm of the Raldukan etc.  Its a lot less intensive and easier to set up than Kael if you have even a good full group.  Will let others chime in now, good luck to you :)</div></div><hr />
