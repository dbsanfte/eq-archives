<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snarlwart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, just wondering if someone could suggest a couple of cheap, low delay weapons.  I'm interested in the low delay for hopefully quicker skill ups.  I'm not concerned too much with stats, damage, etc. at this point.  I'm primarily looking to skill up piercing, 2HB, and 2HS.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Velium weapons that drop out of DN have a somewhat low delay on them, and I believe there is no level restriction on them.  Since you are only level 21, I'd say these are your best bets, since you're victim to the level restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">War Marhsall's Bladed Staff 31/28 2hs.<br />
Ornate Rune Blade 19/30 2hs.<br />
Nathsar Greatsword 17/30 2hs.<br />
<br />
All are buyable. War Marshall's would be the most expensive and the other two will be fairly cheap. Even with the rec. level on WMBS it still is a good weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looking only at tradeable stuff:<br />
<br />
Go to lake rathe and pick up a shovel from the orc camp between rathe mtns and south ro- 2hb, something like 4/27 dmg/dly iirc.  Mossy branch is the &quot;best&quot; 2hb trainer (15dly), but they are very rare.<br />
<br />
For 2hs, the pale velium 2hs player made weapons have a 28 dly, and for piercing there is a &quot;sunflower thorn&quot;, probably from the scarlet desert, that is dly 16.  There are a ton of dly 18 piercers, check for cheap ones in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Centi warspear is piercing 20/30 and would be quite usable at your level. (er...assuming the centi weapons weren't affected by the rec level fix...I haven't actually looked.)<br />
It's a 2-hand weapon, though.<br />
There's an obsidian shard I had for a while: 6/26 with a proc at level 16. Proc lowers mob's AC by 5 and does 30 damage. This is a piercing weapon that fits in either hand, I believe. No idea what the price is.</div></div><hr />

For piercing, just put any good piercer in your off-hand and let it raise while you level.</div></div><hr />

As you can see, we don't actually know what you mean by &quot;cheap.&quot;<br />
If you you need weapons under a couple hundred plat, search in the bazaar by race/class/religion and your budget (and, of course, the &quot;slot&quot;).<br />
If you are purely looking for skill ups, get the combo with the cheapest/lowest delay you can afford and don't worry about damage at all.<br />
If you are going to use the weapon in pick-up groups and would actually like to do your job with it, and you are looking for really cheap ( under a couple hundred plat) stuff, then use stuff like the centi spear and the sarnak battlehammer as a floor. Stuff like that will be usable if you work at it, but obviously if you see something better and you can afford it, get it.<br />
The sarnak thing is 30dam/40delay, which is pretty slow, but you'll train up okay on it and I used to be able to hold aggro with it in the 20s, especially if I pulled. And it hits good.<br />
Not sure how much you've looked around here, but keep in mind that warriors' current thinking is that the aggro you generate outside of weapon procs is a function of the potential damage of the weapon, not how much damage the mob actually takes.<br />
In other words, if you swing a two hander at a mob twice, and once you miss and once you hit for full damage, the swing that missed will cause the mob to hate you exactly as much as the swing that hit for full damage.<br />
Basically, that means if you get a great weapon for tanking, then you can feel good about using that weapon in group situations even if your weapon skill is low; your low skill in that weapon will not influence how well you keep aggro. It will lower your actual damage output, but especially later in your career, if the group is depending on your damage output to turn the tide, the group will sooner or later get wiped out, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Brabble is right. Perhaps you could state how many plat you have to spend on training weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think this (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16301) is a nice skill up weapon for 2hb.<br />
<br />
Took my mage 3 kills to get this one, respawn time was not all to bad 5 mins or so(pure guess since i didn't time it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, if you wanna loot stuff yourself just for training:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=468</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Snarlwart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brabble is right. Perhaps you could state how many plat you have to spend on training weapons.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm really not too interested in nice stats/damage, so long as it has a low delay.  IF someone suggested a 'cheap' weapon that would also be a decent twink item, I would consider buying it.  Not looking to pay more than just a couple of kpp for a decent set of skill up weapons.  Some good suggestions have already been mentioned, guess I need to find a shovel ;)  I'm thinking about the WMBS also (since they're cheap on my server, and would be usable at a higher level).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions guys ;)</div></div><hr />
