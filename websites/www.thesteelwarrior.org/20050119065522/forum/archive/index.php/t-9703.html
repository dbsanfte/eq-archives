I'm in a small guild. 50 or so peeps. Average lvl 50. I have a lvl 65 SHM alt, but he's not much help. I camped all my gear in Velks, and when I got to the planes I found it was a bit lacking, so I saved up and bought what you see. However I'm kinda broke now. So I can't buy more gear upgrades. <br />
<br />
BTW. I'm kinda a Roleplayer, so yes I do wear axes on purpose. I will not budge on that. So no weapon suggestions unless they are axes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though i respect your love for axes ... you'll need to drop them in order to progress.  Sorry, but there just are not any axes out there warrior usable worth having, and you will not be able to effectively function with the ones you got.<br />
<br />
the next best axe that i can think of off hand is a 42/22 one from a GoD trial or some such.</div></div><hr />

If it don't look like Axe, then I'm not interested. Kinda don't cut it. <br />
<br />
My favorite Mech in Battletech. http://www.heavygauss.com/HEAVY/axeman.html<br />
<br />
So what you all are saying is there is NO way I can progress without using Swords? Even with a couple of Anger Augs? <br />
<br />
There are no better axes out there? Sounds like something that needs fixing. For goodness sake, they gave MNK's a quest turn in to change a tunic to a robe graphic with the same stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree but the fact remains: If your gonna be a real tank you gotta have proper agro weapons. <br />
<br />
There's no axes that fit the bill that I know of. You can put an anger aug in but idealy you want 2 types of agro proc's available to you. You'll have a tough time holding agro and your groupmates aren't gonna like it.</div></div><hr />

actually just go here and look through the list yourself :)</div></div><hr />

Where can I group that I can keep agro.<br />
When I play my SHM, if I took agro off of the WAR, it wasn't His fault. It was mine. Why my Friend who plays a WIZ takes agro, it's not the tanks fault, it's hers. Why is agro holding entirely on the shoulders of the tank. People really ought to get some skill in agro reduction too. I think the proliferation of EP+ gear among POS tanks has made the other classes lazy, in much the same way as C3 has made casters lazy. Mana management is as much a skill as Agro management.<br />
<br />
I can keep agro in the groups I've been in, but it often flops off of me, and I have to taunt it back. I ask the groups I'm in not to steal agro. Then the RNG wonders why he keeps getting agro when he's weilding a SotBS and a CHoS. For goodness sake people. <br />
<br />
Where can I tank? Who can I tank with? These are my questions. What gear upgrades would you recomend?</div></div><hr />

Axemann was made before GoD. In fact he was made a long long time ago. I wish I could just switch him to a Zerker, so I wouldn't have this problem. But he is a WAR, and frankly I love him as a WAR, (most axes in the game are 1hs) it allows me to wield a lot of the axes in the game. Currently I have a collection of 30 or so differnet axes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy shit i just remembered one weapon you could upgrade to that might very well give you just what you are needing!  DPS boost + something that will let you hold aggro:<br />
<br />
Frostreaver<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4687<br />
<br />
You'll have to get some friends together and kill the dain ... but that's pretty easy to do these days.  I'd wager it's pretty much the best tanking axe in the game.  It won't be quite as strong as some buyable alternatives, but with an anger3 in it my guess is it will serve you well for your gaming experience and will suffice in all encounters you'll come across.  People have done more with less.<br />
<br />
*Proc has a dd and stun component ... and a decent ratio for a 2hander for dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=40029) and this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25022)  may work well enough with some anger or stun augs for it to work out if you don't mind losing stats and such. FB looks really cool too, imo.<br />
<br />
As to the aggro issue, of course it's dependant on the group. But I think that a group has the right to expect the tank that they are inviting to have enough control over aggro that they can actually put a dent in their mana bar. A caster with decent gear and KEI almost never goes 00m in an XP group, the only thing that limits them is the amount of aggro that I can produce, which, though being good for lvl 56, isn't Knightly or anything. Until I can let the wizards actually have to med, I am working on aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">osserkon</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holding agro is the single most important thing we do. I like my agro weapon but i still have to work at keeping agro from time to time. With your axes it just won't be possible. <br />
<br />
Look thru the many agro weapon threads floating around and you'll see how important it is.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=40029&quot; what are you gonna tank with that? I sure wouldn't take that to BoT : )<br />
<br />
And here's the thing axe.. uprades are meaningless unless you mean to tank. In order to tank you gotta keep the mobs attenion on YOU not the others in your group. You can't ask everybody else not to do their job because you can't keep the mob hitting you. It just don't work that way.</div></div><hr />

Good hit Apolyon <br />
<br />
Ok upgrades after you get the axe: <br />
<br />
bloodmetal earrings<br />
maybe a ring of gallantry or another steel ring<br />
Ornate gloves for the clickie haste<br />
10 AC augs after you get your anger 3 aug<br />
Perhaps the Tak breastplate and boots</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shimmering jade axe drops off a lvl 75 raid mob<br />
<br />
The poleaxe has no agro proc and may not have an axe graphic<br />
<br />
Warmaster axe has nice stats but again no proc<br />
<br />
the first one has invigorate but i'm unsure how much agro that would generate. think thats like a self heal thing.. maybe on the axe it's a lifetap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the Frostreaver.  It's the best aggro axe you can possibly get at this point with deceent dps.  It has a great graphic as well.</div></div><hr />
