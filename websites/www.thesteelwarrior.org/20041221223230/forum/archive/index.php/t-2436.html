<br />
Do these haste buffs really stack so that I would be max hasted to 100%?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can have a haste item, spell or bard song, bard over haste and thats it.  those 3 catagories don't stack but any stat bonsus do give effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand the system, you can have 1 item haste, 1 spell haste(this includes most bard songs), and 1 V3 haste(certain bard haste songs).  Sometimes you will get 2 haste buff symbols, this just means that one haste has extra effects to it(as an example, speed of vallon, which has haste as well as agi dex and attack buff)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is 1 more haste that adds to that : the bard epic procs (called &quot;dance of the blades&quot; iirc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being that my bard is a main, I feel that I should explain how haste works properly:<br />
<br />
Item haste<br />
Spell/Song haste v1<br />
Overhaste v2<br />
Overhaste v3<br />
<br />
On my bard, I can have haste from my item haste, 60% haste from Warsong of Zek, 30% MORE haste from Rizlona's(Vah Shir haste is in the same line, and doesnt stack) and 10% more haste from Ervaj line.<br />
<br />
However, the Ervaj line tops out at an additional 10% haste...which is rather minicule, and that song twist slot is best served in nearly all cases by twisting another song, which is why you almost never see it being sung. <br />
<br />
I find myself mostly twisting Haste, Haste v2 and wind of marr, as the extra regen and mana is FAR more efficient than a few more % haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line, you may have:<br />
<br />
1)Item<br />
2)Spell/Song (ONLY ONE)<br />
3)Battlecry of the Vah Shir/Warsong of the Vah Shir/ Rizlona's Call of Flame<br />
4)Melody of Ervaj/Composition of Ervaj<br />
<br />
Any and all other forms of haste you may see in your buff box are simply providing a stat buff, or wasting a buff slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for slow:<br />
<br />
There is NO slow that stacks with ANY other slow.<br />
ANY slow OVER-RIDES ALL haste, i.e.  a mob hasted 50% and slowed 5% will hit at 95% of UNHASTED speed.  Dont believe me, go to seb, tank a shammy frog for 1 minute unslowed, but make sure he is hasted, notice the damage taken, then slow him a few %, and notice that you take FAR less damage.<br />
<br />
A mob hasted with Celerity 50% haste, and slowed 75% will hit at 16% of his hasted speed (25% of normal), not 75% of his normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aren't the Ervaj lines still limited by the haste cap? That, is they do stack with other spell/song haste but cannot take you over 100% haste. I thought that was the main reason they are never used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Certain haste (spell) will stack with others but afaik there is still debate on wether the higher haste is used or the first buff. I have been trying different combos in offtime to see if I can find 2 with non haste benefits that stack.<br />
<br />
I don't have my notes handy but I believe that shissar or vallon (or both) stacks with WR. However WR is haste only, no other benefits, but on the plus side it does actually give you 2-4 percent increase in haste, if in fact the higher haste takes precedence (or if not, you have wr in an earlier slot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO slows should be toned down significantly, but they should be made to stack.<br />
<br />
Of course this would mean that exp mobs would have to be tuned down as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as far as I know, it works like this:<br />
<br />
Item and Haste v1 are applied<br />
<br />
Ervaj is applied<br />
<br />
Haste v3 is applied after Ervaj afaik, tho I never even bought either one, and never will, and never will use them, even if it stacks first.<br />
<br />
Pretty damned sure that Ervaj is added before hastes that go over the cap, so a bard with max hastes being sung would have 60%+10%+30% plus any item haste, with 130% being the maximum, regardless of anything else, and more likely that not, everyone is going to hit 130% w/o the need for ervaj.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always just aim at achieving 100% through Item + Spell haste.  The bards in my guild are usually paired up with a bunch of rogues or casters for increased damage output.  I honestly don't blame them.  Bards &gt; All.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nokmgud</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The perceived stacking of SoV with the &quot;regular&quot; haste line alacrity, celerity, swift like the wind has always been odd, since all these &quot;haste only&quot; buffs are slower then SoV, therefore have no effect whatsoever.  Since they are also short duration buffs I'd just click them off if you get both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FurryCrew</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is a bard as well and as per what Mystaviant says is true. As for raid groupings...when I'm the only bard around i ussualy end up in MA group pumping out godly 100+ DS on the MA + haste/overhastes<br />
<br />
and yes<br />
Bards &gt; All</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is 1 more haste that adds to that : the bard epic procs (called &quot;dance of the blades&quot; iirc) <br />
<br />
Dance of the Blade falls under spell / song haste, but does have str and atk also.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple haste spells, the highest one takes effect.  Even if you have a pure haste spell like the click from EoP (20% haste, no other effects), it will usually stay up as a buff, even though it does absolutely nothing for you.  Unless of course the better one wears off and then the lower one would kick in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The haste of Speed of Vallon is on a different slot than the usual haste so it stacks with most generic hastes.  Only the highest one will matter though.  Actually if there's nothing in the game preventing you from stacking 10 or so haste spells if the haste effect is put on different slots.  Only spells of the same type on the same slot will overwrite each other.</div></div><hr />
