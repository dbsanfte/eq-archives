Any suggestions as to what would be good to 2 box?  ATM i am thinking shaman.</div></div><hr />

It's easier to find a slower (shaman/enchanter/beastlord) and some random DPS when you go to a group.  Also very useful when you're camping something boring, so you don't have to bug a friend to sit for hours on end at a boring camp waiting for something to pop.</div></div><hr />

I don't see too many of them plus being able to tinker in your spare time can be fun.  The cool lower level gnome cultural gear is fun to have and has some good clickies on it.</div></div><hr />

Warrior and shaman is just the core of any group, you can add anyone to it and get along just fine.  Plus cleric buffs last forever anyway...easier to get a Virtue and go if you really need to.<br />
<br />
The only drawback is that a shaman is responsible for a lot more than most people are capable of doing in a double boxed environment.  It's not a slam, it's just the truth.  A lot of people really get overwhelmed by doing more than F2, CH every few minutes.  If that's the case, cleric is definitely for you.   If you're good at multitasking, then you'll probably do great with a shaman.</div></div><hr />

The gist of it is, clerics, druids, and shamans all make a viable 2-box for a warrior, and all have their advantages and disadvantages.  Personally, I wouldn't trade my cleric for either one.<br />
<br />
I made my cleric a DE for the snare necklace, which sorta turned out to suck.  If I had it to do over I would make him a frog, just because I like the idea of a subserviant amphibian following me around.</div></div><hr />

Sure, cleric would be nice for single pulls and rezzes, but without haste, stacked dots, and a pet for extra dps I would imagine you'd net quite a bit less exp overall in the long run.  And once a mob is slowed you can literally just back it into a corner and go afk in some cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes me cry IRL   :(<br />
<br />
EDIT:  But to make this a bit relevant, it really depends on what you want to do.  A cleric would be great in a group/raid type situation so you always KNOW you have someone to heal you in a bind.  If you're into a more duo type deal, I would go with a shaman/druid for smaller heals, but you still get more DPS and a DS/Haste and slows/snares.  I would do a cleric because I love to group and I am terrible at multitasking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spend 80% of my time 2boxing on the shaman (~60% now with pained memory), as once you are in position and wont grab aggro over 2-3 dots, you really dont need more than that on the melee class.<br />
<br />
Cleric is just alt/shift f2 1 alt/shift <br />
<br />
You can get groups easy with both, shaman is a bit better for 2boxing. I find grouping easier when I'm slower+tank, likely because I've been doing it since Luclin.</div></div><hr />

At least i can narrow it down to ikky shaman or gnome cleric.  I have a while to decide though, im probably gonna wait to 2 box till i get scary to lvl 65 at least or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been running the Warrior Shaman combo for years now and really like it. As said a Shaman can be a lot more work then a cleric as they have so many abilities, and I really cant play the shaman to full effect when 2 boxing but he still gets the job done and I think I do pretty well with them.<br />
<br />
    To really use a shaman to full effect there is no such thing as sitting still. I very rarely sit the shaman to med, as he can canni more mana faster then he can med. And once you have Canni and Canni5 its really hard playing a cleric that has to just sit there and med all day. I do have a 62 cleric on a third account that I took over from a friend, but my Shaman with better gear and more AA can easily outheal the cleric so he is basically just a rez and buff bot.<br />
<br />
   And I lost track of the times Ill start off duoing someplace, then add more folks as guild and friends log on, and if we get more then 6 I just drop the shaman from group and let him tag along as slower and extra DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I normally box War / Enc for exp grouping, if i'm duoing and not in a group, I'll use war / clr.  Most of the stuff i do, with char's equipped the way they are, It's not to hard to duo mobs unslowed / or not  debuffed.  3 boxing the war / enc / clr gets a bit tricky..  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slow is overrated in high end zones where everything mitigates it.  I have been 2-boxing in earth lately, and I hadn't tried it until a week or so ago assuming I needed slow and didn't want to mess with the ToD.  When I tried it I found that slow was completely unnecessary and my cleric can easily keep me alive with 2 CHs per fight, which doesn't touch his mana, so he can nuke, MoR, and melee/yaulp without ever losing mana if he has KEI.<br />
<br />
And as others have mentioned, no matter what class you choose, you have most of the basics of a group already with a tank and your bot, so add a few dps people and a healer/slower (depending on what your bot is) and you can go anywhere.</div></div><hr />

You get snare and damage shiled and ports, but you don't get rezzes, slows or stat buffs.  All priests have their strenghts and weaknesses.  In my opinion, as a 2 boxed healer before 58, a druid is the weakest of the three.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My personal choice has been cleric.  <br />
<br />
I have two boxed a shaman / shadowknight, and two boxed a war / cleric both to very high levels, and for the warrior the cleric is the best, and here is why:<br />
<br />
1)  WAR can get a ToD (from old seb) that procs a 50 percent slow.  using this item has dramatically changed the things I could duo, such as razorfiends in PoV, etc..  Once that hammer procs, it's all cake from there.  This is a way you can partially compensate for shammy slow.  <br />
<br />
2)  In the beginning when two boxing it's easy to die.  A lot.  Cleric with rez makes this much easier to deal with - it's much easier to take on things even if you know you're going to die.  I almost never die with the cleric if things go wrong, just pop furious on war, then pop divine on cleric and run for the exit.  War takes all the aggro, gets pounded to dust, then I log on my shadowknight to summon the corpse and rez with my cleric, and voila!</div></div><hr />

if that is.  if EQ2 turns out to be good im gonna play that in addition to EQ and not 2 box eq.<br />

PS if i 2 box, im gonna get me one of those ToDs</div></div><hr />

1) Its a lot simpler.  Just cast CH while you're learning.  As you get better add in MoR, stuns, hammer pet, yaulp, and melee (or nuke if outdoors on horse).<br />
<br />

Bah meant to say 50 % slow sorry was typing at work, bloops.<br />
<br />
Also I experienced fun again in the game two boxing in velks, was some of the funnest moments I've had in months of EQ. <br />
<br />
Here is my current strat when my war was 60 (so they were all dark blue) in velks for upper / lower spiders:<br />
1)  Fabled exe axe (61 dmg 50 del) <br />
2)  Toss on a supernal elixer with cleric, plus protection of vie, then have my war run out and pull as many spiders as possible, up to about 15 max (usually pull from 10 - 12, basically top two floors of spiders).<br />
3)  Get back to safe spot, and as soon as spiders came down, pop furious when he reaches 35 percent health to frenzy. <br />
4)  Start of CH with cleric, lands just as furious ends<br />
5)  Start using shift-F8 to cycle enemies, popping on reverse DS one at a time on all the spiders, while casting yaulp VI every chance I get<br />
6)  keep casting supernal elixers on war throughout, so he is constantly being healed, occasionally tossing in a complete heal. <br />
7)  All the spiders are at around 50 % health or so, pop AE with cleric for 850 dmg, usually can cast twice<br />
8)  All the spiders die at nearly same time, getting exp for 10 - 14 kills at once!!  I'ts awesome!!  If I had a shakerpager, I could probably pull all the spiders at once and pop furious and wipe them all out in one shot hehe.  Last time I got this, got about 20 % of an AA in one go!<br />
<br />
- This is just one example of what you can do.  Once the cleric gets the mana regen yaulp, you don't even have to sit down to med and gain aggro - I usually just leave him up all the time, and auto-assist war, while yaulp is going + cleric hammer he'll proc like crazy and we go to town.  This is with my 66 cleric on 2nd box, by the way.  <br />
<br />
- the first time you ever tank something BIG while two boxing, as in red to your character during the 50's, it brings excitement back again, similar to how it was when you first started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durt</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I regularly 3 box w/ cleric and druid or cleric and chanter.  <br />
<br />
A cleric is definitely more simple/less work than a shammy - unless you're going to take em to a raid.  Expect to keep full groups alive and/or get tossed into the CH rotation if you do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I box a inny worshipping troll shammy and a war, the snare neck for shammys works well if you plan on duoing for XP a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The mana efficiency of CH is just too good to pass up.  I spend more time nuking with the cleric then anything else really.<br />
<br />
MoR, Stuns, Pacify, DA/DB, non aggro heals, and DI are just too hard to pass up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I think the shaman might have a lot more versatility and adds a lot to the ease of killing some stuff.  But once you learn how things work, the cleric starts to shine.<br />
<br />
<br />
And on unslowable mobs, cleric, definitely.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only downside I've really run across is lack of invis but that's easy enough to fix.  And for those times where invis won't help, Pacification to the rescue.  Go where shaman/warrior combos can't ;)</div></div><hr />

The warrior can handle tanking pretty much any zone lower then Sol Ro/Elemental planes with just the shaman healing.  As it was said early in the thread, anyone can tank a slowed mob=p.  While I'm shouting fro groups for hours on end I normally due them in PoTactics or something relatively easy like that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a 70 Warrior and a 70 Cleric in both groups AND in raids.  I was originally going to play a Shaman as a two-box, however the healing power of a cleric is eons ahead of any other class.  You can, and rightfully so, outheal any other class any day of the week, and you do it in both efficiency and speed.  Also, Divine Arbitration is a fucking godsend for when mobs come into camped supercharged, and no Light, Remedy, or CH is fast enough to keep you alive.  <br />
<br />
Overall, a cleric really isn't all that hard to 2box.  It does require you to pay attention and keep your group alive as well, but you can play a cleric entirely from one set of hotkeys.  It's not rocket science, and they're immensely powerful classes.  What you do not get from 2boxing a cleric though is any sort of DPS enhancement.  You can cast a reverse damage shield on the mob, but that's about it.  You can nuke too, but cleric dps, overall, is pretty unsubstantial.  A shaman could run circles around a cleric any day of the week.<br />
<br />
What do you get by playing a shaman?  Shaman heals are pretty decent, but the overall healing power of a shaman is 3rd on the totem pole (Clerics 1st by a large margin, then druids, then shamans).  You can slow, obviously, which despite being an extremely old shaman &quot;function&quot;, is still the most powerful tool they have in their arsenal.  Those mobs in Riftseeker's hit freakin' fast as hell unslowed, haha.  The new OoW buffs are total &quot;pwn&quot;.  Wunshis, Fortitude, Might, and Sense (and if you're lucky, the new Champion spell too) are totally badass.  Even Ferine Avatar can make up for a lot of lacking stats if you're unlucky to have a full set of Raex yet (which most warriors do not have).  <br />
<br />
The most powerful aspect of a shaman?  If you play them right, they hardly ever run out of mana.  :D<br />
<br />
Why do I play a cleric over a shaman?  Well, my friend plays a shaman, but when you consider the amount of hitpoints a warrior has and how much of a beating they take, it's a shitload easier to keep yourself alive using a cleric than it is a shaman.  Also, I frequently participate in my guilds/guild's (just switched guilds) CH rotations.  I've grown to really adore the cleric class, and if I ever quit my warrior (which I never would), I would most definitely play a cleric.  I love the class now. :)</div></div><hr />

I play/played a warrior since EQ was released, my girlfriend started up a cleric half way through luclin and after pop I got a third account and made a beastlord.<br />
<br />
Cleric is so easy to box with, you can really concentrate on tanking two or three then if you get multiple agro. I've found when you get multiples in camp, you can really be in a bad position depending on mob dps if you have anything less than a cleric healing. And if you do bite it, at least with a cleric, you won't have to wait for a rez.<br />
<br />
If you three box, go a beastlord. Dps, buffs, slows, and haste. None of which are the greatest available, but are a good all round complement to your 2 box set up.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much means I never wait on other people's slow ass to get to my exp spot.  Guildies and friends are free to come and go, but the core is always there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have access to both cleric and sham but i do prefer shams. with good gear theres no problems on the healing side, so my preference leans towards shams. <br />
better mana regen, more dps and better buffs.<br />
<br />
a war cleric duo can probably pull off trickier kills, or exp in harder places where single pulling necessary, but if your duoing for exp, then more often than not youll go somewhere your comfortable with anyway.<br />

also, haveing a laptop to box you can make more use of a sham. ijust make macros for assist, heal, slow, pet attack, nuking. at most you only need to press two or thrree buttons during the course of a fight without taking your eye off the screen.</div></div><hr />

Gulug has a good point that once you have hotkeys in place it's only a few keystrokes every fight.  The problem I have is the other 4 people in the group ask for champion, sta, agi woushi and god knows what else all the freaking time.  Where if you play cleric you cast virtue 1 time every 3 or 4 hours and say don't die before that runs out plz.<br />

Shamans are fun as hell, I enjoy playing them a lot, but they don't stack nearly as well as cleric do in a raid environment.  Having an extra cleric available as a warrior is very effective on raids for vie, DI, hot, and spot heals.  <br />

Tough call if you have to choose, it  depends how far you want to take your warrior and what type of play you want to do.  If you plan on raiding a ton I'd prob lean twords cleric if you are just planing on playing by yourself and picking up groups for fun maybe think about shaman.</div></div><hr />

Well said.  I play a cleric on my second machine all the time.  Raid or not.  It's damn nice to not have to depend on someone else to cast something on you.  DI fires, reach over and hit the hotkey and DI yourself... or chain PoV or HoT or whatever.</div></div><hr />

Druids with proper AAs and gear are more than sufficient healers and their utility makes them very very compelling.  I keep a pocket cleric around for rezzes as needed :)</div></div><hr />
