ive won one out of two hards now. the first i had about 7000hp and the second more recently i had 7500 (the one i won). now i have 7750 but people wont do a hard because they say i dont have 8000hp yet. not one of these people who asks about hitpoints has EVER asked me my AC my aa setup or my agro setup. not one has asked me what aa my groupmembers might have. you know the difference between 7750 and 8000hp is barely over 3 percent, comparable in effect to a FT1 increase on the cleric. my strong agro setup alone is worth as much to me as 1000hp. success on a hard is highly dependent on abilities of bards shamans enchanters and so on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rysingsun,  while hitpoints is overrated you do not have anywhere close to the ammount needed.  They probably ask your hps because of your gear or guild or weapons bieng wielded.<br />
<br />
LDON hard with a tank without AT LEAST 8k pts is a pain, hp's are not overrated.  a cleric goes from needing to ch at the start of a fight before it's slowed to having to supernal you because you don't have enough hp to cover dmg spikes you die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, I would like to say that yes it would be annoying. <br />
<br />
As someone who regulary plays thier druid as a primary healer in LDON or BoT or wherever I too equally find it annoying when people keep saying &quot;Hows your mana?&quot;. <br />
<br />
However I do understand the purpose of the question is to prevent things going sour fast.<br />
<br />
The real reason I ask about HP/AC is because although I do not believe there is much difference in healing 7k and 8k. There is a big difference on how you heal 6K and 10K. This is especially so for Druids whose CH if they are lucky will barely top 6k. I will also state that AC can be just as important. I have in the past been known to request that a AA stacked Ranger take over tanking from a less advanced Warrior. (Not in Hard LDON though)<br />
<br />
You also may claim that these Warriors should not be offering themselves in Hard adventures. That would be right.  but it's bound to happen. Same happens to other classes.<br />
<br />
You are also correct in saying that healers should be just as concerned with the tanks AC, AA's and agro setup as they are with HP's. Except for AC I have to admit that I don't really know anyone (including myself) that asks about AA's and agro setup unless setting up a raid.<br />
<br />
This could be because if someone claims they have 9.5k. One would assume they have a good AC and are reasonably stacked with AA's.<br />
<br />
If with the same ingame ease you could display a casters mana pool. Then you would probably find any class turning them away. Perhaps that is an unfair advantage.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say here is that although I believe your right in the way these healers are addressing the situation and not bothering to be concerned with factors than can easily outweigh a numeral HP figure. I do believe that unless you know the Warrior you about to group with, It doesn't hurt to ask his HP/AC. Not so you know how many HP's he has. But do get a fair idea of his overall robustness without asking for a resume on AA's or so forth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">there's a simple fact, warriors with hps lower then 8k don't have good gear.  If they don't have good gear they likely have not spend enough time getting thier aa's either (with exp groups come eventual drops normally)<br />
<br />
Then there is the other issue, if you do not have good slowing classes (read shaman/enchanter) and using a BL with no debuffer you might find your BL taking insane resists rate (happens) and your cleric will be using the less mana effecient spells not only to keep you alive but alot more often running into group effeciency problems.<br />
<br />
AC is a factor, but if you have hps at a certain points you normally have acceptable AC.  I'm sure there are examples against it but they are rare enough hp is a good standard to go by.<br />
<br />
I have warriors in my guild with the EXACT same hp as me or greater with 200 less ac. but thier ac is sufficent for hard ldon.<br />
<br />
The difference between your hp's and someone with more is effeciency.  It's the reason paladins are better group tanks then warriors they come with greater effeciency.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I always assume they ask that so they can time their heals more efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have never seen any improvement in healing efficiency after they know what your HP is.  In fact very high level of HP tends to lead to the cleric thinking (and usualy does) they can get away with Supernal Remedy you the whole time.<br />
<br />
Actually clerics should be asking what your AC is, not HP.  I can guaranteed you whether they CH you for 4000 or 8925 will not make or break a group.  If your cleric CHs for 4000 every CH and you still wipe on a hard LDoN, it wasn't because the cleric didn't heal efficeintly enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmph.  Wars with less than 8k unbuffed should stay out of hards?  Or am I misinterpreting? =p<br />
<br />
With HoV, BSS, Fot7 and any ol' sta buff, I buff out to 8200+hp. Sufficient for a hard if the healer is not a dumbass. As has been said before, the CC and puller make or break a hard LDON group.  Even a group with a 10k tank will fail if the puller, healer or CC are idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">why do the clerics want to know how many hp i have for a hard ldon? next time they ask me ill ask them how many flowing throught they have. <br />
<br />
I refused to cleric hard LDoNs until I got to ~FT10.  I refuse to go anywhere where I know I'll be a liablility to my group.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but a tank in a pickup hard ldon group who has under 8k HPs is a liability to that group.  With a good puller, you can win.  But the healer are going to be working a lot harder then they should have to for a bunch of strangers.  <br />
<br />
If you want to do Hard LDoN, get a group of friends who know each other well and go.  I heal a tank that I KNOW better then I heal a stranger even if the stranger has more HPs.  When you know a group, when you can predict each others responses, then you can do fine with not perfect stats for the area.  In a pickup group though when you have no idea what to expect you really need to be above the absolute minimum required.<br />
<br />
Hmph.  Wars with less than 8k unbuffed should stay out of hards?  Or am I misinterpreting? =p <br />
<br />
I was reading it as buffed HPs.  If it is unbuffed then 8k is way more then enough.  I think he meant he got to 7.5k fully buffed but maybe I read it wrong.<br />
<br />
I would say though that a warrior who doesn't have 8k BUFFED HPs shouldn't be tanking Hard LDoN in pickup groups.  With friends yes, but with strangers no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;&lt;there's a simple fact, warriors with hps lower then 8k don't have good gear. If they don't have good gear they likely have not spend enough time getting thier aa's either&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
in other words since they are absolutely clueless both about warriors generally and who im grouped with they use my hitpoints as a gauge of the quality of of my group generally.<br />
<br />
with my 2stun/2hate agro setup i can pretty much kite the mob around for 2 or 3 seconds if i take a damage spike down below one bubble.  furthermore once the mob is snared the warrior is deadweight anyway since the mob can be kited around by ANY group member who gains agro.<br />
<br />
for this reason with a skilled warrior the only mobs that present a healing dilemma for the lower hp tanks are the few that are unsnarable. but again this assumes the group knows what they are doing as well. keep in mind all the people but one (guildy) who questioned me about my hitpoints were people looking for pickup groups, so they could not claim they knew anything about the other group members. people looking for pickup groups gain very little information about what is in store for them when asking only about one stat of one member the MT. it gives me the impression that they see a fight as a very one dimensional affair based on them healing a tank and everyone else doesnt count.<br />
<br />
i can use the opportunity to throw in another rant. yeah ill offend a few people here. but clerics act like they know so much when they ask my hitpoints but i really think they flatter themselves a bit. because whether im fighting a 70 percent slowed mob that hits for 360 or an unslowed mob hittingfor 960 i always seem to have the heal cast on me at the same point .. at 40-50 percent. yesterday i set a new personal record for heal cast on me. we had a single shaman slowed mob on an easy ldon with no possibility of adds and i had the CH cast on me at 73 PERCENT. it landed at .. you guessed it ... 68 percent. then the cleric says to the group &quot;20 manna&quot;. well what do you expect? honestly i dont know why they dont interrupt the heal when they see its going to be wasted and recast it at 20-30 percent (30 being extremely conservative for single pulls). and how come they CH me on a slowed single at 45 percent but if im puller and there are no pacifiers or mezzers in the group they wont preheal me before the pull if im at 50 percent? even then i pull anyway because its rare that i die to an unmezzable pull of less than 4 mobs when pulling at 50 percent.<br />
<br />
so excuse me about being a little cynical when a cleric whines about me not having enough hitpoints for his tastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ariene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good clerics do start heals early then duck them when the tank doesn't need it.  Good clerics do lots of things.  In my experience though, good clerics don't often do pickup groups.  <br />
<br />
If you want to do pickup groups, you take what you can get.  I'm not willing to do that so I don't ever LFG outside of my guild or friends.  If I can't group with friends I tradeskill, solo or log out and do something else.  <br />
<br />
Don't argue if a cleric doesn't want to heal you in a hard after finding out your HPs.  Do normals until you find a cleric who heals you when you NEED it and who isn't constantly out of mana.  Then stick that cleric on your friend list.  Then group with them again until they learn all your tricks.  Then take them to hard ldon and have FUN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You assume incorrectly that skill takes precedence over gear.  It's the other way around.  From an unbiased point of view, there is no reason for you to believe that a pickup cleric will know how to heal a 8k HP warrior for hard.  A hasted mob can easily shred an 8k warrior before the cleric can reasonably react regardless of aggro issues.  There's also no reason for the cleric to believe that you possess the skills to overcome the lack of HPs since you obviously don't know each other.<br />
<br />
If anything, it's communication that can overcome lack of HP, not skill.  You can have all the greatest skill in the world but if your group has no idea what you're doing, you'd still just be another corpse.  EQ is a group oriented game, and a poor group that coordinates well is better than a group with great players that do not communicate (unless the players are so good that one person can take care of it all, usually an enchanter, but that usually implies a very uber character or trivial content).  Consider you have a cleric who has to ask you what HP you have, chances are this group lacks the necessary communication to overcome the lack of HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just like any other class in EQ, it doesn't matter how one dimensionsal the class is, you can still have people fuck it up. Bad clerics are bad clerics, just like bad tanks. If I'm in a pickup group, I usually have to tell the cleric flat out that they dont have to heal me at 60%, that I'll stand there and press taunt at 5% until they tell me otherwise. Those blunt, it is effective and at least from my experience, the cleric is usually relieved to hear this. I've had clerics that I've had problems with not healing at the right time, too late, or too early, usually it involves them casting remedy on me before they hit CH and then whining about being LOM. wonder why that is...<br />
<br />
A little open communication usually solves all my healing woes. Bad groups are easy to come by, but with a bit o talking usually I find many would be bad groups just need to tell each other what they are going to be doing before the shit hits the fan. Many times with my druid I'm in a group without proper CC, you'd be amazed at the number of people who don't know you can kite/rootpark adds indoors with a druid. It's those type things that some people are willing/can do with their class that really make the other people in the group feel more comforable with strangers and many times make a bad group good.<br />
<br />
Then again, there's still a lot of shitty clerics/players out there.<br />
<br />
*still wondering why I bothered typing all that...*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I generally pull my hards and bring a hydra wiz along to kite any adds i might get :p<br />
<br />
As far as the hp thing goes, it just makes them a bit more comfortable I suppose.  The difference between knowing if they can start CH's at 45%, or if they need to start at 75% can make a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can't go wrong CHing at 70% anyway, especially for LDoN hard.  CH at a low % indicates the content is easy if not trivial, and in that case it's not horribly important just how low they decide to heal you at.  And if the content is trivial, it's not like you're losing your HP very fast so who cares your CH is for 2400 instead of 8925, it's not like you need to be healing very often anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Jesus, what a crazy derailment of a misunderstood question.  <br />
<br />
Generally, if a cleric wants to know how many HP you have when you first get into a group it's because they want to gauge the point at which to start a heal.  It has nothing to do with judging the quality of your character or skill as a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Generally, if a cleric wants to know how many HP you have when you first get into a group it's because they want to gauge the point at which to start a heal. It has nothing to do with judging the quality of your character or skill as a tank.<br />
<br />
I agree that often if asked once you've joined the group how many HP you have, then the Cleric is merely trying to gauge the point at which to start a heal.  However, if asked prior to joining the group then it's to determine if they're going to include you or not and that your HP is one of the criteria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I find the 'how much HP' question annoying because not only does it seem like they're questioning your place, it rarely makes any difference anyway.  I certainly have a lot more HP than the warrior a cleric that'd ask this question is used to, but this rarely actually improves the performance of the group.  If the content is actually difficult I rather the cleric play safe and lose a bit of efficency on CH rather than thinking I have 12K HP so he can CH at 50% on Hard LDoN, which will most likely get me killed at some point.<br />
<br />
The only time a cleric should ask what your HP is if he thinks you're going to die before his CH lands, because then it is actually necessary to make the adjustments.  Otherwise, just play it safe at 70-80% for all nontrivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't think its a wrong question, there's many warriors out there that aren't geared for Hard LDoN, its simple as that.  If they ask because they are doing something considered difficult by many people's standards, they aren't going to want to pick a random war with no idea what kind of gear he has.  Casters aren't as affected by gear.  I see this as kind of like when I want an enchanter/mage for charm pet groups, would you just randomly pick one and hop ehe has the spell/AAs to handle it safely?</div></div><hr />

But I rarely need to do that, because I am either in a guild group or adding DPS characters to a group nucleus of war, dru, and enc.<br />
<br />
I've had people who aren't the cleric ask in group what my AC/HP is. Those are the ones that really bug me, because usually what they want to know is how uber THEIR gear is. I usually give them the raw number, then ask what their defense, dodge, and riposte skills are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't have any problem with someone asking my ac/hps for hard.  If you're running in circles to get CH to land then you're probably pretty marginal for tanking there and while you might not have a problem with starting an adventure with a good chance of wiping/downtime/failure, the group might not want to waste their time with a tank that has a fair chance of wiping their adventure and wasting their time.  Also if the cleric doesn't have good flowing thought or AA themselves they may know that they can't do hard without a good tank.  You can do hard with a weak tank or with a weak cleric, but probably not with both.  Nobody likes to spend 90 minutes and come out with no points and several deaths for their effort, and it's selfish to join a hard group if they have to succeed in spite of you and not because of you.<br />
<br />
And when I play my cleric I do like to know the tank's hitpoints, but I usually find it out by landing a CH at 50% and seeing how much it heals for :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Brutul's got it about right- My cleric alt's at FT7, maybe a 5k manapool. I'm really, really marginal going into a hard LDoN. I can't afford to pour 1200-1500 mana a fight into your undergeared arse until I get a feel for your tanking capabilities. Information like HP/AC/AA lets me make those choices much closer to right the first few times, and I can adjust into it ten times a quick as I can with a total unknown. It saves me ulcers over your getting spiked, and it saves you early deaths. <br />
<br />
From that standpoint, it's not 'What's your penis size?', it's 'You got a condom in that wallet?'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I see nothing wrong with a group asking for your AC/HPs before inviting you to a hard LDON.  You don't need time gear to do them but a warrior with none of the HP AAs wearing bazaar gear is going to get squished.  Most people I know of that do them like the tank to have at least 8k hps buffed.  That's not unreasonable to expect of a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i still say you guys are missing the point entirely. this was a pickup group. the cleric was looking for a pickup group and wanted to do a hard. she asked no questions whatsoever about the quality of the other players. ive done 2 hards. one successful and one not. both were pulled by bards. one bard got us through the entire mission without once getting a bad pull or a resisted lull. the other had 2 resists leading to her death in the first 3 pulls. then we quit.<br />
<br />
but does the invite to the group ask about the bard? does he ask whether the shaman has his defensive aas? big fat no. its all about hitpoints you see.<br />
<br />
as for the role of skill. its sad that with a bard puller the warrior doesnt have to really use his skill very much. when doing normals with poor players however there are a lot of opportunities for a good warrior to pull his group out of a bad situation.<br />
<br />
skill is very important for casters in general. i know a druid who pull miracles of crowd control in adventures with no slower or mezzer. i know a shaman who works the same kinds of miracles. and i know a wizard who anytime we get 3 mobs with no mezzer he justs kites one away and kills it before the rest of the group combined can take down the initial target. ive seen great enchanters and horrible ones.<br />
<br />
... and ive seen our raids fail because our raid leader never communicated properly what we were doing. you know .. when the mob manna taps and he only says once during a high spam time anything about it and a third of the party gets manna-drained?<br />
<br />
skill has a lot to do with it.<br />
<br />
but you know what REALLY BUGS ME? when a warrior buys a 100hp neg15 AC item just so he can boast that he has 8500 hp and (doesnt mention his) 1200 AC (and his attrocious taunt setup) when i have 7750hp and 1650 AC and THAT warrior gets picked for the hard ldon! and the group who picks him says &quot;blah blah blah 1150 AC softcap blah blah ...) ...<br />
<br />
grrrr<br />
<br />
disclaimer: a lot of good input from you guys. keep it up. this isnt a rant on the replies im getting .. just a chance to vent.<br />
<br />
its a pickup group. even ungeared unguilded unraiding pickup types like a shot at TRYING to pick up some good gear improvements in a hard which is a MUCH smaller timesink than most raids are even if they arent uberly geared for it.</div></div><hr />

This may surprise you, but a lot of EQ players have a very limited clue.  They've read or heard something somewhere and suddenly it becomes gospel.  They know it, love it, live it, even if it's completely false or only partly true.  Once upon a time, for example, people though agi mods really helped in not getting hit so people loaded up on agi items.  It took a good long while and some solid testing to come to conclusion that agi wasn't all that useful in the end.<br />
<br />
Getting frustrated because other people are either idiots or are close minded isn't too awfully useful, since you'll be running into idiots or closed minded people almost every day of your life.  They're everywhere.  So unless you become a hermit, expect to cross paths with them on an ongoing basis.  It's just one of the negative aspects of being a member of the human race.  And if you doubt me, just watch some of the reality shows or a show like Jerry Springer and you'll see what I'm talking about.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It seems to me that the main problem with the hitpoint question is that it's an incomplete picture of the quality of the warrior-character (and, for that matter, the quality of the player). At a certain point, hitpoints tend to run parallel to AC and even AAs, but if &quot;everyone&quot; looks for a magic number of hitpoints, then there are probably ways to jack up hitpoints.  I do not find it reassuring when the only question I get asked is about my hitpoints; there is a chance that the person I'm talking to knows something about the game if he asks for AC as well. But that question seldom gets asked.<br />
Sometimes *after* tanking for a group with a good healer--cleric, druid, shaman, whoever--I will tell the healer my stats--all the relevant tanking stats &amp; AAs. Unless a caster has played a tank class before, it seems to me likely that he won't have a precise idea how his healing efforts relate to the characteristics of the tank he's healing unless the tank gives him a yardstick. I only bother with this if i think the healer is capable of learning something from the info, though. Some people appear to be operating at maximum mental RPMs at relatively low levels of information processing. They'd just be confused if they tried to deal with more than a one-number measure of a tank, lol. I tell them nothing, unless I'm tanking for them with my troll sk and they are not trolls, in which case I speak Troll to them.</div></div><hr />

I have a brain I can decide myself if I am fit for this/that or not. <br />
<br />
If that question irques you like it does me then choose not to answer.<br />
<br />
Also clerics who have to ask how many hp you got after you are in their group... I mean CH pretty much tells you that anyways. Why ask? When I am only healer in-group I never ask. After couple of fight I am usually able to adjust to a new tank. Also IMO most important damage reduction for an average warrior is set of defensive the AAs. Once you got those maxed the difference between have and have-nots is huge.<br />

I personally don't like the how many hp do you have question.  Sure, it can be appropriate, but I'd rather make the assumption (/gasp!) that the folks are capable or near-capable to handle it.  People whine about repetitive content and grinding over and over.  I don't see how placing a warrior in a box marked &quot;7k&quot; or &quot;7.25k&quot; etc really helps out.</div></div><hr />

Unless the cleric is being stupid and going oom from it.  Clerics that use divine light to heal a 12k tank in an xp group piss me off :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">i still say you guys are missing the point entirely. this was a pickup group. the cleric was looking for a pickup group and wanted to do a hard. she asked no questions whatsoever about the quality of the other players. ive done 2 hards. one successful and one not. both were pulled by bards. one bard got us through the entire mission without once getting a bad pull or a resisted lull. the other had 2 resists leading to her death in the first 3 pulls. then we quit.<br />
<br />
but does the invite to the group ask about the bard? does he ask whether the shaman has his defensive aas? big fat no. its all about hitpoints you see.<br />
<br />
as for the role of skill. its sad that with a bard puller the warrior doesnt have to really use his skill very much. when doing normals with poor players however there are a lot of opportunities for a good warrior to pull his group out of a bad situation.<br />
<br />
skill is very important for casters in general. i know a druid who pull miracles of crowd control in adventures with no slower or mezzer. i know a shaman who works the same kinds of miracles. and i know a wizard who anytime we get 3 mobs with no mezzer he justs kites one away and kills it before the rest of the group combined can take down the initial target. ive seen great enchanters and horrible ones.<br />
<br />
... and ive seen our raids fail because our raid leader never communicated properly what we were doing. you know .. when the mob manna taps and he only says once during a high spam time anything about it and a third of the party gets manna-drained?<br />
<br />
skill has a lot to do with it.<br />
<br />
but you know what REALLY BUGS ME? when a warrior buys a 100hp neg15 AC item just so he can boast that he has 8500 hp and (doesnt mention his) 1200 AC (and his attrocious taunt setup) when i have 7750hp and 1650 AC and THAT warrior gets picked for the hard ldon! and the group who picks him says &quot;blah blah blah 1150 AC softcap blah blah ...) ...<br />
<br />
grrrr<br />
<br />
disclaimer: a lot of good input from you guys. keep it up. this isnt a rant on the replies im getting .. just a chance to vent.<br />
<br />
its a pickup group. even ungeared unguilded unraiding pickup types like a shot at TRYING to pick up some good gear improvements in a hard which is a MUCH smaller timesink than most raids are even if they arent uberly geared for it.<br />
<br />
Alot of us understand what you're saying, but truthfully, pick ups have too many new/under-geared players.  I see nothing wrong with asking you what your HP is if its something difficult in nature, would you honestly pick a random tank to go do tipt with you? What Tipt is like is basically what EP tanks are to a BoT tank in hard LDoN, maybe slightly easier(Tipt that is).  I'm 10.3/1950 and I still feel like a ranger in Tipt.<br />
<br />
If the only thing that the other person is interested in is &quot;am I more uber?&quot;, then yeah they can piss off, but when it comes down to it, tank IS the most important job, and if you have no idea who its going to be, you best be asking.  And if you could only ask one stat about a tank, HP is the best way to sum him up.  <br />
<br />
When I play my cleric I honestly don't ask what their HP is in standard XP groups, I watch how they drop in HP and arrage my healing accordingly, but if I was to ever set up a GoD/Hard LDoN group I will definately make sure the tank has the gear to do the job properly.  Also what you forget is that what a 10K tank can handle, can be done by a 8K tank, but how much room for error(human or RNG), is whats important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">In pickup groups I like to see a certain standard of gear on players before I feel comfortable doing them, I am precious about my win/loss ratio and I hate to spend a couple of hours and come out with nothing to show for it.  As a warrior its not such a big deal to me cos I know how many hps the tank has ;) but when I play my chanter in hard LDoN's I like to know I'm not wasting my time.<br />
<br />
Generally its at the point of having put the group together and deciding whether to do hard or normal, the tank is the most gear dependant class and as such is going to come under the most scrutiny.  If they're using a splitblade of destruction (even if they've chucked anger 3 in it) im not going to be confident in their agro, how many hps they have is also a concern though I dont play a healer so its more the healer's perogitive to pull the plug if they dont think the tank is &quot;big&quot; enough.  Doing a hard I like to be confident in the group's ability to win, not just thinking we have a chance - like I said, Im precious about the leaderboard stuff.<br />

Doesn't matter which class you ask, they'll nearly always say they have the most important job in a group, depending on where you are. Don't believe me? Here you go - my job (healing) is more important than the tank slot. In a lot of places, CC or pulling classes would tell you the same (and they'd be right). Enter class interdependency.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why you warriors can't just lie about it - clerics have been lying about our mana since release. As long as you have the skill to back up a slight lack of gear, and your cleric isn't a complete dumbass, the cleric isn't going to care that &quot;oh n0s you lied about 300hp&quot; (if they even realize it) because you tank just fine anyway. One of the best damn KT tanks I've ever healed (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=864253) (post-nerf) would get laughed at if people asked her HP before inviting her. Skill &gt; AA &gt; AC &gt; HP in my book, and AC matters more than ever in GoD since mob spike damage is brutal. That said, I don't ever ask tank HP because after 1 CH, it's easy to see a ballpark. I guess the reason I don't worry might be because if it's ldon/solro or less and the tank is way undergeared, I'll load aggro spells and tank instead. Since 99% of the clerics I talk to don't even know what our aggro spells *are*, I'll assume that's not a common thing. I don't group with too many clerics though.</div></div><hr />

ive won one out of two hards now. the first i had about 7000hp and the second more recently i had 7500 (the one i won). now i have 7750 but people wont do a hard because they say i dont have 8000hp yet. not one of these people who asks about hitpoints has EVER asked me my AC my aa setup or my agro setup. not one has asked me what aa my groupmembers might have. you know the difference between 7750 and 8000hp is barely over 3 percent, comparable in effect to a FT1 increase on the cleric. my strong agro setup alone is worth as much to me as 1000hp. success on a hard is highly dependent on abilities of bards shamans enchanters and so on.<br />

sorry i'm so late getting to this thread (i havent read all 3 pages yet) ... but at under 8k hps buffed youre begging for disaster in hard ldon.  <br />
<br />
3 things matter in hard ldon and 3 things only:<br />
1. can you puller pull singles<br />
2. can your healer keep up<br />
3. can your tank roll with the punches.<br />
<br />
i've tanked hard ldon with less than 8k but it was damn hard and very inefficient.  quit whining, grind some xp, and come back later.  if this complaint was for a BoT group or regular ldon i would agree, but hard ldon can be quite challanging unless your gear is strong.  Most hard ldon mobs arent that bad if your cleric is good (with 8k and just under hps), but occasionally mobs come in hasted and sow'd ... 8k hps does not last long when the mob is buffed and hasted and hitting for 900's ... anything less than the 8k rule of thumb will wipe you pretty fast.  i've been there and tried tanking it and can speak from experiece.  every hundred hps i got after 8k made hard ldon easier and easier ... now with over 9k i can go into these buggers with a sub-par cleric and we still do just fine.<br />
<br />
3 character typesmake or break ldon:  puller, healer, and tank.  nothing else really matters as long as those 3 are on top of their game.</div></div><hr />

Oh, come on now.  LDoN High-risk is not *that* damn hard really.  If you are running Guk Assassinations it might be but most any competant group of people can do EC/MMC ones without getting too crazy about it.<br />
<br />
I've run a number with myself pulling (a 1300AC/6.8k buffed rogue tyvm) and no CC beyond a paper-chanter or even a Ranger + Wizard on roots/snares.  I'm *far* from the best puller for the things but good people that communicate well can handle some pretty strong stuff if they pay attention.<br />
<br />
If your tank has his or her defensive AAs done then I am quite content with a 7k knight or Warrior, assuming just a cleric is healing.  With less than ID5/LR5 then I do like at least a secondary healer that isn't a fool but normally we run with either a shaman or enchanter/druid.  Ideally I love a bard puller/CC and a cleric with the rest of whatever makeup you like, as long as one of them can tank and hold aggro.  I don't tend to form charm-groups though, not for a lack of efficiency but just because such groups are wasted in LDoNs.</div></div><hr />

You can't really look at it like that, 7700 vs 8000.  People say 8K tank in Hard, doesnt mean anyone with 7999 or less is worthless, Its like calling 21 your legal age to drink, doesn't mean miraculously on ur 21th birthday you are considered responsible enough to drink, just a line that gets drawn.  But those who play classes outside tanks, that feel asking for a tank's HP is an outrageous request, grab random warriors and do Hard, or get a tipt/vxed going, then come back and still claim its unfair to ask a tank his HP. Usually the tank knows what he can/can't do, but if some 7k tank wants to &quot;try&quot; something really hard, and doesn't care about loss/win, I wouldn't want to be in his group cuz I don't like losing and wasting time, but thats a personal preference.<br />
<br />
Also its not about being able to tank in a perfect pull enviroment, its about when shit hits the fan, are you going to be an asset to the group, or a liability.  Skill plays alot, but you can't measure skill in numbers. &quot;Hey how whats your skill rating?&quot;. Thats something you have to group with to find out, and when you're doing something difficult for the average joe schmoe, you need a starting place. HP is a good spot to start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like the Marine Corps, or any military in the world, you have the Infantry, and you have support.  In the USMC, its alittle over 4 support per infantry, and in a group, you have the Tank, and 5 support.  In a raid you have 1 Main Tank, 71 support, usually. True that you NEED a healer in most situations, and you NEED Dps to get anything accomplished, but considering that a healer/dps is only a partial set of support, I consider tank the most important job</div></div><hr />

7-8k wont make or break your hard ldon, but when youre dealing with a sub 8k tank you probably either arent going to have competent ac of max defensive aa's to help mitigate some of the incoming dmg.  same with a strong aggro setup complete with ldon augs etc.<br />
<br />
breaking 8k buffed really isnt that hard to do these days.  btw regular ldon, ornate, and scads of buyables, and warrior who puts some time and effort into their gear and aa's should have 0 problems breaking the 8k barrier ... it just takes a bit of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit- yeah and i wouldnt say that an 8000hp buffed warrior is gonna be just peachy, but rather that is the bare skin and bones for a pickup hard ldon.  an 8k warrior is gonna still run into some rough spots ... especially in ruj where mobs like to come in hasted now and then from a random shaman mob.  8500+ with decent ac and all defensives and higher makes for a pretty strong ldon warrior.  a knight can probably make do with less, but only because you dont have to worry so much about aggro issues and mobs will get slowed faster.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to try tanking a hard ldon with my now 8k buffed hp and a pickup healer, however.<br />
<br />
Tank and healer are a combo, a  strength in one can make up for a deficiency on the part of the other. When someone asks for your hp/ac just assume they're hoping you'll make up for their deficiency! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Well, for pick up groups - playing with strangers I can see where people would be reluctant to have a 7k tank with them in hard.The thing that makes a hard ldon easy for me is the puller.I'm pretty sure I did  a few hard ldon's when I only had about 1300 ac &amp; 7k from available buffs maybe less.When we went has a guild group it was a nice challenge,but, great pulling had us winning.The bard was $$ in hard LDON.<br />
<br />
On a hard a month or 2 ago  I probably should of pulled and let our chanter mezz off me but we had a lighter geared sk do it and it  didnt go so well.Imo pulls &amp; cc &gt; tankage in hard ldon.A lot of tanks can do the job in an excellant group pulling mostly singles.If you're without a good bard,lacking chanter, or with a group you don't coordinate well with yet, the tank will have to be heavier.<br />
<br />
At about 7k I wasn't useless to my group when we first tried it.They were really good players mind you, heals and slows came fast while I prayed for my droga weapons to proc hehe.We won several missions at that time like 75 pct success rate and LDON was new to us.Im not enamored of LDON the way some players are.Lots of players know those dungeons very well and have their strats down cold.My point is;as in most encounters it's a team effort.A strong group raiding late velious and early luclin content with a bard pulling can do it.I know one of our tanks loved LDON and started doing hards at about 7.5k buffed as routine with any one who would take him and never looked back.Hehe if people want me to pull no hard LDON  group will pass without erm..excitement.<br />
<br />
As i remember it;the hard ldon mobs beat me down back then, kinda like Tipt mobs did on my last visit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">A good puller makes hard ldon's pretty trivial.  Monks are especially good at pulling hards now with their unresistable lull, pretty easy to pull singles.</div></div><hr />

hard ldon if you have good hp/ac aa's etc and a good group should take about 45min.  If you don't you're looking at a hour and a half or more and it's retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Ideally I love a bard puller/CC and a cleric with the rest of whatever makeup you like<br />
<br />
What have people experiences with bards and clerics pacifying in high risk LDoNs been?  We've tried it before with a 65 bard, and every single, I mean &quot;every&quot; single lull spell was resisted.  Obviously we didn't win, cause we had to rez him every pull, and finally gave up knowing full well we'd never make it before the timer.  Was he missing a song he should have had?  A higher, less resisted song?  What about cleric's 65 lull'n spell Pacification?  How's the resist rate on these?<br />
<br />
Point is, I have a friend that can 3-box high risk LDoNs using an SK, shaman, and a mage.  I'd love to be able to 3-box these as well (war, cleric, wiz), as we're both pretty much even when it comes to equipment.  But, I've never even tried because I can't feign, and I figured the cleric wouldn't be able to pacify at all after seeing what happened to the bard.<br />
<br />
I'll never win one with my class combo I'm sure (not till some serious upgrades anyway), as relying on the Truncheon of Doom is no where near consistant, so I'll be OOM often healing on unslowed mobs.  But it would be nice to Eye of Zomm find a named that's close enough for me to get to, like that same friend used to do before finding out he could actually win these things.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is for me to barrow the shaman.  As long as I can pull singles, I'm sure I could handle the mobs with my warrior, cleric, and his shaman.  DPS will be severly low though, so I definately won't win... but like I said, it'd be happy with just being able to get some named on my own when bored for the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Pacification lands, but the risk rate is relatively high, and the mana cost can get very instensive. Bard pulling in LDoN Hard, however, has very little to do with lull songs, and much, much more to do with the combination of mezmerize, mem-blurs, Fading Memories, and a dozen other bardic tricks that I don't really understand very well. It's an intricate weave of 'What the fuck?' that only a bard can possibly pull off. <br />
<br />
Your three-boxing friend has the advantage in that he has three classes which all have the potential to be valid pullers in many situations. You, however, get to be tricksy instead. Root, for example, can be a powerful pulling tool. So can snare + Exodus.</div></div><hr />

He's just going in and killing nameds then right? because I GUARANTEE he never ever wins with that set up.<br />
<br />
the main thing if not only thing that allows bards to pull hard ldon is fadin memories.  without it they simply cannot pull effectively in hard ldon.<br />
<br />

<br />
wasting time ...<br />
<br />
ive known people who root dotted for months without ever dying.<br />
<br />
and THAT is wasting time.<br />
<br />
wasting time is when you refuse to take on anything challenging. when youve done 30 ldons in a row without a failure and the minute you suggest &quot;hey! lets try some excitement!&quot; and the answer is &quot;ldon with less than 8000 is a pain. and you might lose and 'waste everyone's time' &quot;.<br />
<br />
come on you guys. give yourself a challenge once in a while. and dont boast over your time raids. im talking about a personal challenge.<br />
<br />
wasting time?<br />
<br />
perhaps just perhaps this pickup group with non time-equipped gear will learn for once to start refining their technique. if and if they learned anything from their ordeal their time was not wasted. you know what our technique is in normal ldon? trying to figure out whats the optimal pull size. 2? 3? do we pacify with 4 or do we just pull them and mez (usually we just mez it). and chaos reigns and almost all our wipes are caused because its too easy and we get incredibly sloppy.<br />
<br />
so those who say a cleric  /lfg (meaning looking for pickup group) should sit on her butt for an hour trying to find a 8500hp tank (with a 10aa bard and 10aa shaman that she never asked about) and turns her back on a 7750 tank who ... did you think maybe he might have chosen hard because he was impressed with his group makeup? ... <br />
<br />
... oh forget it. lets all go to CoD or Valor; single pull everything ... or root dot for a while ... and never die ... and have that slow boring grind.<br />
<br />
... but at least we wont be wasting anyone's time.</div></div><hr />

It's not a challenge to do it with a 7.5k tank, it's retarded and completely dependent on the cleric or the warrior popping discs left and right like some little monkey.<br />
<br />
I am NOT time, I'm not even techinically elemental since I have no elemental gear yet.  Hard LDoN aren't really a challenge, ferubi is not a challenge, trials are.<br />
<br />
It's not that I'm stuck high on my horse looking down on you, I know what hard ldon is like for me and a ft 15 cleric with focus and aa's and I KNOW unless your cleric is superior geared or you have superior dps or both, it's a frustrating waste in peoples time to spend a hour and a half for a amount of EXP and challenge they could of got by pulling too much in BoT.<br />
<br />
I've had plenty of undergeared people without proper experience in my groups because I give them the chance. and only once out of 100 ldon have I found any one of them learning and staying within thier limits.<br />
<br />
Bad puller = won't win because you either wipe or pulls to slow or both.<br />
bad tank = healer runs out of mana too soon.<br />
bad healer = well you know where that goes<br />
bad slower = you know who dies first or who wastes cleric mana?<br />
bad dps = well see the above unable to complete within 1.5hrs.<br />
<br />
You want to practic tactics? go to a e-plane and pull as fast as you can quickly as you can, try and kill 55 in 1.5 hrs and you have to constantly move. (any loot that drops unless it was a named up in zone when you zoned it can't be looted) (btw if you fail you have 30min to finish killing 55 and then you're kicked out of the zone, also they provide less exp then your e-plane zone)<br />
<br />
But you're likely not even e-plane so can't relate to that analogy.<br />
<br />
Picture BoT mobs, except slightly harder, in a zone like Cazic Thule, now clear out half the zone in 1.5hrs.</div></div><hr />

at under 8k buffed youre going to slow your group down and maybe even cost them the win.  a good cleric can make up for a lesser tank, but you cant simply run around as a lesser tank expecting that your cleric is going to pick up your slack.  thats just a shitty and selfish attitude to have.  if you cant pull your own weight and bring good things to the table, perhaps you should go elsewhere or simply not get your panties in a wad when they turn you down in search of a beefier tank.</div></div><hr />

He's just going in and killing nameds then right? because I GUARANTEE he never ever wins with that set up.<br />
<br />
<br />
At first it was only named... but not anymore.<br />
<br />
He wins them.  Not every time, but most of the time.  One mistake, one or two deaths, could set him far enough behind to lose.  Collection missions only.   He wins them with the SK pulling singles every pull, shaman as the only healer and slower, and the mage as the biggest source of DPS.  This is a 65 SK with around 275AAs, who is buffed at almost an even 8k hps 1600something AC.  He &quot;just&quot; broke the 8k mark recently with shaman and cleric buffs (he has a cleric as well whom I assume he buffs himself with before the adventures).  He would also have KEi before going in I'd assume as well.<br />
<br />
I won't win with my setup, that can be guarenteed.  I can't pull singles consistantly, pacify will cause me to have to zone every 3rd pull, and I can't slow the mobs, save for a lucky proc... but am losing far too much DPS trying to slow as a warrior for me to most definately secure a loss by timer.  I have mana problems 3-boxing regular LDoNs, let alone attempt a high risk with my setup.  If I could slow, I'd have no mana problems in regulars, and of course still have them during high risks.<br />
<br />
But with SK, shaman, mage...  single pulls that are almost guarenteed, slows guarenteed every mob, and solid DPS (even if the mage is out of mana, his pet is still doing something).<br />
<br />
This is the trick, collection missions unlike other types of adventures actualy &quot;do&quot; change depending on how many people are in your group.  I know a lot of people believe that it's the same adventure no matter how many people are in it... but that's not the case with collection missions.  Yes, the &quot;mobs&quot; are the same, but the drop rate adjusts.  I have never gotten a crappy drop rate while 3-boxing regulars, but constantly see crappy drop rates for full groups.</div></div><hr />

Got any proof lol.  You're asking what can't be proven other than my friends word to me (he's a RL friend of mine, a friend that I've known since the first grade... he's not gonna lie to me).  The only way to &quot;prove&quot; this is to VCR tape the whole damned thing and send it to you.  No screenshots or logs are gonna prove anything to someone who doesn't seem to want to believe it anyway.<br />
<br />
Remember, we're talking about 20-30 mobs in 90 minutes here, not the 50+ it takes for the other 3 LDoN adventure types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">This was hard ldon btw .. not easy.<br />
<br />
Btw his crit heals, crit nukes (on taps) ... and critting both at the same time .. not to mention his innate lifetap proc on his weapon, LDoN lifetap proc on his weapon .. and spell imbued lifetap proc ... he can pretty much keep himself healed.<br />
<br />
all he would need is a random &quot;Q&quot; and an occasional tnarg.  the limiting factor woudl be the dps, and a really good mage can cover that.  Hard ldon isnt that hard, but to win you DO need some measure of gears/aa's to pull it off easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">i could believe it .... sk's are the kings of single pulls .. especially if they use their pets.<br />
<br />
He's feign pulling I'm sure.  The pet won't stand up to an unslowed high risk LDoN mob.  Would get one rounded most of the time.<br />
<br />
Now, pet pulling &quot;is&quot; possible in high risk adventures... I know cause I've been there when we've done it.  But it takes the likes of Virtue, Focus, and a celestial heal just before the pull, for the pet to survive it.  We've reserved this tactic for those few LDoN zones that have a first room full of mobs with no room to feign split.  Gets too expensive mana wise to keep a pet like that the whole adventure, cause on occasion the mobs feel like finishing off his pet, even though he's feigned :(  And recasting all those buffs again not only is mana costly, but time costly as well.<br />
<br />
But I doubt he's pet pulling when he 3-boxes, cause there's no way of buffing the pet large enough to survive (cleric isn't in the adventure with him).  Darkness and feign combo I'm sure.  He's a pretty consistant and fast puller with feign.  Multiple caster mobs are about the only thing that can cause problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">all he would need is a random &quot;Q&quot; and an occasional tnarg.  <br />
<br />
For sure.  I don't have all the fancy lifetaps and whatnot as a warrior, but Q was still certainly enough to keep me healed durring high risk LDoNs.<br />
<br />
We've 3-boxed together in a few, where I'm playing my 3 and he's playing his 3.  When we started, I was complete healing myself over and over.  Pretty much the second I started taking damage from the mob (if he was having a wiff streak on me) I'd have to start casting CH for it to land in time.  So we started Q'n me right after the slow, to help out and save mana.  I found that I was ducting every complete heal out while Q was up, and only letting it land when either Q had worn off or a particularly nasty round landed on me.  Q was keeping me up easily.  Easy enough that I could keep cancelling out the complete heals and restarting them again, over and over.<br />
<br />
Slows, single pulls, and decent DPS.  The 3 winning combinations for high risk LDoNs all packed together in 3 characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh!  Sorry lol.  I thought you were still doubting that he can win these.  You're talking about the drop rate.<br />
<br />
The drop rate, I can't prove that either of course, other than telling you what I've seen.  I'm certain that it doesn't work the way you just described above with the zone in zone out example.  I'm pretty sure that the drop rate is set upon adventure aquisition, not when you zone in.  I probably should have been clearer there.  When you accept the adventure, that's when the variables are set, not when you enter the zone, nor how many people happen to be in the zone total.  It's how many people were in the group upon accepting the adventure.<br />
<br />
If I were to accept an adventure while 6 people were in the group, then have only 3 zone in... I'm fairly certain the drop rate would be set for 6 people.  If I were to accept an adventure while 3 people were in the group, then invite 3 more... I'm fairly certain the drop rate would be set for 3 people, and those additional 3 people wouldn't even be able to zone in so it doesn't really matter for them anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that the drop rate is a percentage in the same way that any loot dropping off any mob in the game has a percentage chance to drop it.    My theory is that this percentage chance to drop the collection pieces is set when you get the adventure, a percentage that is probably pretty high for only 3 characters, and is set in stone no matter how many people drop from your group before you zone in.  I'd imagine that upon accepting the adventure, the instance is created, populated, and all loot that it will ever drop is already on the mobs waiting for you inside.  Just like how all of the other zones in EQ work.<br />
<br />
This is purely from experience mind you.  The fact that I have never once had a crappy drop rate in the 20+ adventures I've 3-boxed.  But have had crappy drop rates on about 15 of the last 20 adventures I've done with 6 people, over the course of hundereds of adventures.  Obviously 20+ adventures isn't as big of a sample as the hundreds I've done with full groups... but I've never seen more than 3 every-mob-drops-the-piece drop rates in a row on full group runs ever.  While I've seen 20+ 3-boxing.<br />
<br />
Also, focusing on that same idea you had above... the game of Everquest doesn't even work that way.  Loot drops on mobs are already generated and on the mob when the mob spawns.  The loot doesn't get created on the mob upon death.  You'd never see mobs wielding the weapons they're carrying, nor see the light sources from light source generating items, if that was the case.  A patch came during old world EQ, before even Kunark, that put those burnt out lightstones on willow wisps because of this.  People were only killing the wisps that glowed with a lightsource, cause they knew ahead of time that wisp had a stone on him.  So the burnt out lightstones were added, which also eminated light, so that no one could tell the difference anymore, and all wisps would then have an equal opportunity to be slaughtered heh.</div></div><hr />

ShowEQ does not know anything more than what the EQ client software is told.  The server knows what's on the mob, but it does not send this info to the client.  All ShowEQ knows, is what the client is told.  Is that mob wielding this particular sword model?  Is that mob wearing a leather look?  Plate look?  Does it eminate a light source?  Which item icon to display is not sent to the client until you right click on the mobs corpse.  The details about the item, it's stats, it's name, etc, are not sent to the client until you right click on it's icon and request the information.<br />
<br />
Read any ShowEQ message board or MySEQ message board, and you'll eventually hear this.  Read any EQ server emulator boards, and you'll eventually hear about what the client handles and what the server must tell it and when.  Hell, program for a living and none of these things should come as a suprise to you.<br />
<br />
as far as I can tell between 5 man groups and 6 man drops are identical.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell they seem identical as well.  That's the nature of randomness on percentages.  If, for example, the drop rate was 50% for a 6 man group, and it was 60% for a 5 man group, rolls of the dice will reveal pretty similar results.  You won't notice any difference till you parse out many many sessions of drop rates.  To the naked eye, they'll both seem equally as crappy, with the occasional luck streak.  Compare that to the drop rate of 6 vs. 3 characters.  The drop rate could be 90% for 3 people for all I know.  You're gonna notice that with the naked eye, no parsing, easily.<br />
<br />
But please post some information on your name server etc so I can see if you're telling truth or exaggerating about 100+ wins.<br />
<br />
The first &quot;month&quot; of LDoN's release I saw people on the leaderboard with 100+ wins already.  I say I have 100+ wins 9 or so months after release and I must be lying?  Who the fuck do you think you are anyway?  You have a Blade of War... Ooooooo, I must pale in comparison to you automaticlly.  You're not getting any information about my character nor my server.  I've shown that I know far too much about ShowEQ and emulators on a message board that EQ employees read for that.  I'm not about to risk everything just because you have a trust complex.  You're also not getting any real info in PMs either, cause at this point your opinion means absolutely jack to me.  When I tell someone the truth, and they call me a liar, that's exactly what happens.... you register lower than barn yard animals in my book.<br />
<br />
Telling the truth or exaggerating about 100+ wins lol, like that's even that big of a feet to gasp over and call someone a liar over.  100+, meaning lower than 200, isn't even going to register on ANY leaderboard.  I just took a look at your server, and the top wins are 815!  815 wins!  The LOWEST spot at number 100 is 276 wins.  My exact wins are 187, I wouldn't even be on any leadboard for you to see.  A good 140+ of those wins are all collection wins.  Collection wins where the drop rate was decent to poor, but rarely rarely where the pieces drop off every single mob (Can count the number of times that happened on one hand).  Out of 20 or so 3-boxed runs, &quot;every single one&quot; had a drop rate of near ever single mob.  The drop rate obviously changes depending on the number of people accepting the adventure, or I would have lost a few because of crappy drop rates by now.<br />
<br />
Loot is not always pre-generated because of the issue with showeq I think<br />
<br />
I'm coming here with my knowledge of what I've learned from ShowEQ/MySEQ developers writing about their own program, my knowledge from tinkering around with EQ server emulators and reading what the developers of those have explained, and from what I've seen first hand about drop rates... you come to me with &quot;I think&quot;'s, and call ME a liar.<br />
<br />
You know what?  I think I know exactly what your problem is.  Another case of a non-reading, non-comprehending, jumping to conclusions, e-idiot.  You probably think that those 100+ wins I was talking about were all high risk adventures, when I never said such a thing.  I said my friend can 3-box high risk and I can't.  I said I can 3-box normal adventures.  And then I said that  in 100+ wins with full groups that I've seen this or that about the drop rates compaired to my 3-box runs.  Nothing more.</div></div><hr />

That's was either incorrect or CHANGED as I mentioned.<br />
<br />
If you are telling the truth and not exaggerating you substantiate your claims to a degree or at least provide credibility.  Saying you know how showeq works ETC does not flag you in sony to the fuer for suspension.    I didn't call you a liar I AM asking for some sort of proof or credibility which you are reluctant to provide.<br />

I think is a issue with loot tables etc.  YOU THINK the drops rates are phenominal because of how many you have in group...  I THINK you're wrong, no side has proof to either side...<br />

You're wrong.  Loot is not sent to the client until the minute the client right-clicks on the corpse, but loot is generated on the server immediately (see rogues who use pickpocket)<br />
<br />
You dont believe him?  Instead of calling him a liar, howsabout you try it yourself?  I've done 4-man and 5-man LDoN's and won in the same time I usually do with 6 (approx 45mins).  Oh, and getting 100+ wins is a joke nowadays for anybody who spends any amount of time trying to get LDoN wins.  I don't even try (just take pickup groups every now and then) and I have somewhere around 150.  You would not be able to verify even if he gave you his name and server because he would not be on a leaderboard, like he said.  Stop being an ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Bleh, sorry forgot I posted on this thread.=/  I'll clarify since I know many think you actually need an 8k+ tank to do these.  <br />
<br />
At 6.8k hp and 1300 ac, you are probably (well, not probably) a bit undergeared to go there.  I , generally, group with the same bunch of people:  Paladin (me), Druid, Chanter, Ranger, Rogue, and a shifting 6th person depending on whose available.<br />
<br />
My gear was subpar for the group, as I had just recently picked a new main and was working on gearing the paladin up.  So my friends were willing to pickup the slack.  Their gear was basically ssra level, at the time, to give you a rough idea.<br />
<br />
At any rate, with those stats, you are going to require alot more work to keep alive.  Fortunately the druid is very good at what she does.  They had to work around it a bit of course, slow asap, control the pulls very well so I wasn't eaten by multiple mobs at once, etc.  I mean, you are talking about a rougher experience and you are only going to find people willing to do that if you are friends with them.  But, its doable.  And by the time I was ~7.2k self buffed we really didn't have anymore issues.  I dont' know if that was a gear thing or just being so used to eachother that it was no longer a factor.  <br />
<br />
But, even aside from friends, I was tanking hards with god knows who in pickup groups and only 7.5k hp.  The cleric I use, when shes available, is notorious at telling me I'm a gimp tank, even with 9k hp/1800ac in easy zones.:P  And she never had complaints keep me alive with 7.5k.  The gear there is really appropriate for people of that level anyway because those are the ones who can actually use it, when you become a 9K+ tank you are really likely to just be selling the gear anyway.  <br />
<br />
My main point is, its not that a group can't survive with a sub 8k tank and its not that they can't do an adequate job (defined as, tanking well enough so that you don't need to take mana breaks to finish the mission), its that the healer is too lazy to do anything other then randomly push ch once every few seconds.  Instead of saying, &quot;I'm not taking some Sub 8k tank who will just be mooching gear they don't deserve&quot; you should be saying, &quot;I'm too lazy to do the job of a real healer, so I want the tank to makeup the slack for me by going in with more then I require.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Though it could be tril, thats not necessarily true.  i would equate a warrior with less than 8k to be the equivalent of a cleric with decent (not good mind you) mana pool and maybe FT6 ... with a decent pool and ft6 you cant afford to have a tank that cant always hold on for that cheal.<br />
<br />
at under 8k you'll see lots of fast heals which is mana intensive, and as such requires a cleric with much deeper pockets and FT10-15 + mana regen buffs.  Otherwise you'll spend more time sitting and medding than fighting.<br />
<br />
A 6800hp warriors and a 6800hp knight are 2 completely different things ... one has guaranteed aggro (means an early slow and no healing other people).  a 6800 hp warrior genearlly wont have any ldon aggro procs and is therefore a liability for more reasons than just his sub-par hps/ac.<br />
<br />
the &quot;how many hp?&quot; question is a good one to ask.  If you feel uncomfortable answering for the situation or fear they might turn you down, then chances are you should just hunt elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Paladins do have the advantage of instant agro so you can get slow off earlier without problems.  So you can adjust it a bit as needed.  My only point was, by 7500 hp I really wasn't having any real problems.  I would say, a 7500hp 1300 ac tank would hold his own fine.  Below 7k, your group needs to be on its toes, but its doable.  <br />
<br />
People have their preferences.  Some clerics like to slack (I know many who are like that personally) and just want to hit CH every few seconds, so they want a beefier tank who can take the unslowed period without too much of a problem.  But, I feel allowing people to think an 8k tank (or even a 7k one) is required is harmful to people who will then not venture there because they feel inadequate.  I bet there are alot of people who can do Hards and would benifit greatly from the gear that drops there, but have heard they are incapable so they don't even try.  That same issue came up again with GoD.  How many people missed out (or are still missing out) on some nice gear in the sewers and Vxed because they heard it was vastly out of their league?  Sewer trial 2 and 4 aren't even much harder then normal ldon's.  <br />
<br />
Having preferences is fine, especially when you can afford to be picky.  I just wanted to help inform people who may have heard some of this and immediately dismissed their ability to do it that it may not be out of their league.  And, that with the gear they'd aquire by trying, they would soon see themselves improved to the point they are easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason? I've got no problem tanking the hard ldon, I usually do a better job than most of the tanks I get when I do pickup groups. Obviously it depends who's pulling, who's healing, and who the other option is, but there's times where I tank for 45 minutes cause the healer is really low on mana. Stun + rune = mitigation.<br />

my 7750 warrior was much more expensive (time and money)  to equip than my FT15 druid. so i must disagree with the quote. and oh yeah .. manna pool size is irrevelant in everything except raid bosses.<br />
<br />
andrej you are coming very close to derailing this thread into a rant about why chanters can tank as well as warriors :)  but i will give you this complement .. that you know how to be creative in your playstyle to win. dont tank for long stretches. allow even a severly subpar warrior to tank while defensive is up and assist when its down.  i presume if you stun to mitigate for yourself you also stun (or rune) the melee MA when his hp drop unexpectedly fast to give time for the heal?<br />
<br />
but andrej .. no one will ask you if you have the capability to help the group in such powerful ways. they dont care if you have 600 aa or zero aa. they dont care if you bought all your spells. they only care about one thing. if the warrior has 8k hp yet.<br />
<br />
Aerionn ... the cynic<br />
<br />
p.s. yes my logon name is rysingsun due to historical reasons. my warrior's name is aerionn.<br />

Aerionn ... the warrior who hates slacking groups. i will stick up and not back down for all you warriors who are not elemental/time equipped that you dont have to have people tell you that you are selfish for wanting to tank a yellow con once in a while and make your group show you if they have learned their classes or not.<br />
<br />
i tanked for a pickup raid last night and i cannot tell you how badly most of them played. if we got a 2-pull they both landed on me when i incited the first and do you think anyone drew agro on the secondary mob to keep the cleric from dying on his very first heal? no sir! when our lone cleric died (we lost the other 2 as it got late) did any of the druids cast a single heal on me in the next 30 seconds before i finally died? no sir. did the ranger puller snare on incoming and kite at least one of them away when he pulled 3 so that the group only had to face 2? no sir. when i needed a heal every 20-30 seconds did i get complete heals? nope. superal elixer chaincast instead. did people kos to the yardtrash stay away from the yardtrash to avoid training the group and making us kos too? course not.<br />
<br />
a few more hard ldons for the masses would teach some MUCH needed play skills. any cleric who tells me i need 8000 hp because there is an ac softcap of 1150ac does not know the game and needs to have the humility to admit she is no more assest to the group than the mt is.<br />
<br />

<br />
no crap sherlock ... i'm referring to what they as a class can bring to the table .. not how hard they are to equip or expensive their relative gear costs.   Mana regen is more important than mana pool size, but youre a fool if you think manapool only matters on raid bosses.  i laff gud ...<br />
<br />
a sub 8k tank doesnt bring too much to the Hard ldon table just like a sub ft6 cleric with only decent mana pool doesnt bring much to the table.  A sub 8k tank CAN do well ... but it usually requires extra help on the part of the healers or whatnot.  argue all day till youre blue in the face ... but i've been there and i know how much you will get chewed up on a bad pull or a hasted mob inc.<br />
<br />
youre not selfish for wanting to tank a hard ldon ... youre selfish for pitching a fucking fit when people who ARE geared for the content say &quot;i'd rather have a beefier tank&quot; to those who aren't really all that geared for the content.  why should they have to pick up your slack?  More can be done with less than 8k hps, but understand that people can choose to not take a lesser tank when a bit of search can yield a stronger one.<br />
<br />

<br />
you have no right to generalize sub 8k tanks as&quot;bad tank&quot; or even as &quot;bad - hard ldon tank&quot;. All the hp questions are for those who want to show off their gear. Tanks themselves can evaluate whatever or not they are fit for whatever they are doing. Why does cleric or anyone else have to decide for anyone whatever or not you are able to tank something? Do you ask any other group members to join this penis measuring contest? I think not. Why let someone who probably has no idea about tanking to decide your worth?<br />

Then be willing for them to reject you. HP is a lame yardstick, but at least it tells you SOMETHING about the players experience and ability to take the beating. I'm absolutely not above questioning clerics ft, and if shamans/bsts have all spells I want them to before inviting them to a hard ldon if I haven't played with them before and noone is willing to vouch for them. If the rest of the group isn't stacked, you can't afford to bring somebody who isn't at least up to par. Trusting these yahoo's to make that decision on their own can easily means lots of deaths and failed adventures, aka a waste of time.<br />
<br />
I tanked hard ldons buffing below 6500hp, but I sure as hell didn't expect people I didn't know to pick me up, and didn't try. I did them with groups of friends who were PREPARED and WILLING to pick up my slack.<br />
<br />
OTOH, Yesterday I had a rog in my group doing consistently less DPS than I did in a normal ldon. As I was forming the group, he had asked me if we were doing a hard! Slowest LDoN i've done in a long while. I'm sure he tries to get into as many hards as he can, but the fact is, he ain't pulling his weight if I outdps him with no offensive aa and a droga combo.<br />
<br />
Whats the measuring stick for a DPS class, anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Torrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">You need to give the cleric some form of information that lets him know how fast he'll be needing to heal you.<br />
<br />
When I started doing high risk LDoNs, I needed to be healed the second the mob started beating on me, or the heal wasn't going to land in time.  If the cleric doesn't know this, and you let him try to decide on his own on the fly, it's already too late.  He's gonna waste mana on quick heals, or you're gonna die.  Chances are when you go down, a few casters are going with you too since they run a good risk of being one rounded before being able to click out of the zone.<br />
<br />
Put it this way... as a pre-8khp, pre-1400AC tank, you can tell them your HPs/AC, or you can tell them that you need to be chain healed as fast as humanly possible.  As a selling point to getting a group, I'd imaging the latter would sound much worse than just simply telling them your HP/AC in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Druids heal plenty for hard LDONs.  I've won them before with a beastlord and a ranger as the only healers.  I wouldn't recommend that with 1300 ac though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People make all sorts of silly judgements based on info out of context.Not too many warriors solo hard ldons it depends on the group makeup.If you got a high end tank you'll need less healing obviuosly.If your group is fresh out from hot farming you'll want a cleric,good slows,cc etc and some decent luck.You just want to balance the group against the content.If the tank has enough hp to not get one rounded then it's possible depending on group make up.<br />
<br />
If I was buffed to 7k with 1350 ac would I tell a pick up group that I'll need a fast ch in hard ldon? Sure...just like I tell people I'll need serious healing in Tipt and they can nuke or something in the sewers.Is it efficient for a 7k to  tank in hard?Probably not,but, it was fun and we actually kept the upgrades.There's no rule here just common sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one day i started to come to grips with the difficulty my groupmates were having performing their tasks. a bard a few levels lower than me would die to bad pulls. the enchanter would have a hard time mezzing. the wizard would do so little damage that he could leave the group and no one would notice he was missing. the same was true of the rogue. so i started recruiting people of between 2 levels below me and 2 levels above me. at first i worried that since i was no longer 0-7 levels higher than everyone else but was now merely average i would be a paper tank. you know what i noticed?<br />
<br />
i noticed the groups were far more efficient. i noticed i was not a paper tank but could actually tank much better with the proper support.<br />

this thread seems to be equally divided between the humble warriors who say they are part of a six man team and the proud who say that an adventure's success depends mainly on the warrior. i imagine those with 10khp who are in the second camp are mighty proud of their uberness.<br />
<br />
we warriors are not that godly. in a six man group we are merely one of six.<br />
<br />
lets be realistic. on a single pull in a hard in most circumstances it would probably be best to just  snare the thing for and let all the casters nuke it to death. the nukes from the cleric would make up for any lack of damage from the warrior. let the warrior tank the unsnareable ones. thats a sad state of affairs and you know its THE reason why my druid in outdoor zones always considered melee to be liabilities to the group. but now my main is a warrior. and only the best of the casters seem to have any concept of kiting off agros and nuking them to death without getting hit as a good alternative for many mobs to mezzing.<br />
<br />
but tell that to a &quot;uber warrior&quot; who thinks he is the reason why groups succeed or fail and it seems we will get nowhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Personally I never tell anyone my hp especially not when the question is coming from some uber_cleric_10kmana_ft999. It’s none of their business. If they want to invite me to do something they state whatever they doing and ask if I want to join. I have a brain I can decide myself if I am fit for this/that or not. <br />
<br />
If that question irques you like it does me then choose not to answer.<br />
<br />
Also clerics who have to ask how many hp you got after you are in their group... I mean CH pretty much tells you that anyways. Why ask? When I am only healer in-group I never ask. After couple of fight I am usually able to adjust to a new tank. Also IMO most important damage reduction for an average warrior is set of defensive the AAs. Once you got those maxed the difference between have and have-nots is huge.<br />
<br />
/salute Brabble fellow troll<br />
<br />
It is there business for the simple reason that there are so many retards out there, you cannot leave it up to them to decide.  If you think your a good enough tank for it then you should have no problem answering the question.  What I do when I get asked &quot;How many HP?&quot;...i tell them unbuffed -- 7k, 1500AC, 252AA, and an aggro lock that would make jesus cry. Why? because they wanna know if I am good enough and they have a right to know! But I am gonna tell them everything that matters not just what they think is the magic number =P<br />
<br />
The reason they have a right to know, is because it takes one retard to waiste the next 90 minutes of thier life with an unbuffed - 4k 1100AC, 23AA, CHoS Def Lightblade wielding suxtank who doesn't realise they can't tank hards.<br />
<br />
BUT, at the same time, a warrior has the right to ask the cleric..&quot;How much FT do you have?&quot; and the cleric should respond that they have FTXX and a 4.5k mana pool with XXXaa's.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people get on to relax for the evening, and just want 1 or 2 LDoNs....those people especially in a Hard LDoN should not have to put up with the latter of the tanks I listed nor a 3k mana pool cleric with no FT and 4aa's. Those types of players can lose at normals sometimes....when enough of them get together =P.  The people who worked their asses off to be able to do hards like most do normals, deserve better groupmates then that. But they don't get them by not asking people thier stats.<br />
<br />
In the end it IS an opinion thing and for each tank to decide, but if your not willing to share your info, don't be upset when a cleric declines you for Pally (/shudder lol).  And at the same time, don't join a group with a cleric who won't share their info, but asks for yours! I never volunteer it, but I always answer it, and then ask the question back!<br />
<br />
I would personally say(unbuffed):<br />
<br />
4k -- 1100AC for PoV/65 normal<br />
4.5k -- 1200AC for BoT<br />
5k -- 1300AC for BoT named<br />
6k -- 1450AC for LDoN hard<br />
<br />
and those are the lower end values you wanna have imo<br />
<br />
never done these but I would guess around (unbuffed)<br />
<br />
6.5k -- 1500AC for ele<br />
7k -- 1650AC for Tipt<br />
<br />
once again at the lower end values you wanna have. correct me if I am wrong on those last two.</div></div><hr />

They certainly have the right to ask you your stats and make a decision based on the answer you provide.   If the stats are lower than their goal, they have a right to look elsewhere, if they're within reason they have a right to ask you to join (to which you have a right to decline), and if you withhold it, they have a right to suspect you lack confidence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are talking 8k buffed, well, that's just insane to think a cleric needs a tank to have that much.  They would have to be a pretty crappy cleric to need that big of a tank.  <br />
<br />
I've only got about 7.5k unbuffed, and I pulled a hard LDoN yesterday with a cleric and no backup healer, and a chanter as mezzer/slower.  I just pulled and let the chanter mezz the adds, and we finished in under an hour without the cleric ever asking for med time.</div></div><hr />

First of all, you don't know me, so try and refrain from making blanket statements like you think you do. A lot of people including myself have worked hard to get their chars to where they were, I started playing in original EQ, and if anything I am a little behind the curve for most players who started then. <br />

Second of all, read the end of my post.  If you aren't willing to answer the question then do not be upset or even surprised when you get turned down for groups. Its a legit question, with an easy answer.  If your not proud of your char, fine.  But don't come to the class boards and call those who are, powergamers.</div></div><hr />

you compare this to a business? i thought we were playing this for fun.<br />
<br />
some of us are.<br />
<br />
some of us group with undergeared players simply because we enjoy doing so. some stick with their uber guilds and play all night and miss work the next day because if they dont they are afraid of being dropped from their guild for not jumping when the gl says jump.<br />
<br />
when my boss says jump i jump. thats because we are under contract. i work. he pays me and allows me to do more work. the day i start comparing /lfg to a work resume is the day i quit.<br />

how spoiled people have become. i remember the good old days when we would look for a group and they would invite anyone and i mean anyone who was of such a level range that they didnt violate the experience level range.<br />
<br />
now we need a resume. we have things like probationary periods. the guild leaders hog the loot of all the yard trash and keep the money on their own accounts like any real life despot while they refuse to /rand on anything that drops. socialism more complete than any the world has ever known. so many of you are slaves to your uber guilds and dont even know it though some of us see right through it. and youve adopted the methods of the people you worship by asking for a resume from everyone you group with unless its absolutely trivial content.</div></div><hr />

Lots of people equate a lost ldon as a waste of time.  XP is better elsewhere so you are there for the points.  These same people equate sub 8k tanks with risk of failure (and for good reason).  Pickup groups want wins.  They want their points ... Ldon is a grind that everyone wants to be done with.  Therefore, taking a sub 8k tank in a pickup group isnt something that lots of people are overly happy at doing.<br />
<br />
Asking hps is perfectly ok imo.  The group has the right to do so.</div></div><hr />

I don't go around asking Shaman, Clerics, and other casters if they have a complete spellbook. I know my argument really isn't about the question, but how and when it gets asked.

Talent is really a luxury.  You can do some pretty amazing things with talent if you've the appropriate gear and you're actually playing with people who pays attention and knows what's going on.  Unfortunately, such groups are rare.  In most normal groups, a minimal level of communication + gear is far more effective than actually being skilled at this game.  <br />

Totally agree.<br />

Just because they have good loot does not mean that they're more dedicated than someone less equiped.  Just because someone is in a guild does not mean that they are more dedicated or even good at the game.  I've seen the opposite far too many times.  In fact, I've seen a number of people ditch the smaller guilds I've been a part of because they weren't willing to put in the work.  They left for larger guilds, so they can get decked out quicker, with less effort put forth.  Officers, core members, and guild leaders of guilds I've been in included.  It was too much for them, so they left for somewhere where they could play follow the leader, instead of make the decisions.<br />
<br />
I did an LDoN pickup group not too long ago.  I rarely do pickup groups cause I've almost always got guildies and friends to chose from.  This particular time I didn't, so I thought I'd give it a try against my better judgement (pickup groups I've had have rarely been any good).  Anyway, one member was a 10khp Paladin from one of the larger guilds on my server.  He inspected my equipment right off, then announced he should be doing the tanking.  10khps, okay have at it, should make the cleric's job easier.<br />
<br />
I made sure I never got aggro as to let him tank.  What that meant though, was that the monk tanked.  This paladin, elemental+ paladin, couldn't hold aggro.  It's mind boggling to me why he couldn't hold it.  No paladin should ever have trouble holding aggro, not with that spell book.  He obviously didn't know a few things about his own class.  I wasn't about to lecture him and tell him what to mem and what to cast, I simply started tanking instead.  No one ever complained that I had taken over, not even him.</div></div><hr />

This was like 3 days after this thread started, so I found it pretty hilarious.  Really, if healing is a problem in a normal ldon, the problem is your healer, not your tank.  Anyway, one easy solution to people asking your hp for an ldon is just to point our your record, the proof is in the pudding and all.  Sure, you could claim that you haven't won (m)any hard ldons because no one will invite you, but until you have the record to prove it, it's nothing but a whisp of air.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the common understanding is get to 65 then do aa, but i must say, id much rather be a surprisingly good lev 64 tank, than a pathetic excuse for a lev 65 one (in hard ldon mind you, im sure i could still tank pov =).<br />
<br />
<br />
Im in a US (mainly) guild and living in Europe, meaning i almost exclusively join pickup groups, or groups of one or two friends and 2-3 random people. Last thing i would like to do is leave people with the impression that im a pointless tank leaching off their supperior gear.<br />

You're missing the total point of the argument, which neither side is correct or wrong. We're not talking about regular XP grinds, LDoN High Risk is considered bit above &quot;average&quot;, when gear and skills play a much greater role than say tanking in BoT/Normal LDoNs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Tooby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">hmm sorry i was a bit unclear. What im saying is, i can do hard ldons now (at 62), sure we fail sometimes, but as you say it takes more skill than the normal grind so it is alot more fun and interesting.<br />
<br />
At 62 i would guess almost all unbuffed warriors are somewhere in the 3.6-5.0k hp range so most people will have the gear to do what can be expected. Getting to 65 means the range is suddenly 4.0-11.5k (?). For those of us who perfer the challenge (and risk of failure) of high risk LDON, but are mostly having to do pick-up groups getting to 65 seems to mean that I would be disqualified - rightly so judging from this thread - to join such groups, which is the reason I say it makes me hesitant to level that far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>Grobie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">well considering they were looking for a tank, they have every right to ask.  You have every right to say no, but sorry if they didn't divine that you were a decent tank, you'll have to excuse them for asking.<br />
<br />
Well sorry, but i disagree - they have every right to ask whether I can tank hard LDONs as in &quot;Are you able to tank hard LDON?&quot; or &quot;Would you mind joining us on hard LDON?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they would get a nice and friendly answer, but i am with DG-Slider here and when asked HP/AC as first question they are out.<br />
<br />
god I swear people like you are one reason I hate most pick up groups.<br />
<br />
Well i dont do pickup groups neither. Never have in my 4 years of playing - and never will. But with your last statement against me and then this:<br />
<br />
I ask for thier best and worst piece of gear (if bard) if dps I ask thier best weapon, and/or attack.<br />
<br />
I think it's really the best that we a) dont group and b) do pick ups. *snicker*<br />
<br />
Next thing you know is that i have to provide my magelo for you before i would get an invite to your group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">&lt;&lt;hmm sorry i was a bit unclear. What im saying is, i can do hard ldons now (at 62)... &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
hard at 62 and hard at 65 are two different beasts. when the average level of the group is below 63 the mobs on normal level hit for something like 240 max. on the hards they hit for 360 or so max. so ok 50 percent harder hitting. now then at 63+ average group level they hit for 360 max on normals and about 960 max on hards. dont ask me why sony decided to make them hit 2 1/2 times as hard all of a sudden. also seeing how close you are to that ominous level 63 cutoff i implore you to evaluate your group (average) level carefully before choosing whether to do normal or hard because if it barely hits that 63 cutoff and you do a hard with a group of 63s you will be in for an interesting surprise :) . id be interested to know if a group of all 63s has ever completed a hard at all. its not just the tanking problems. you will deal with unpacifiable unmezzable unlullable mobs in addition to the tremendous number of hitpoints the mobs have and a high resist rate on slows. plus your group of 63s most likely will not have the latest in quality raid drops or 300 aa each either.<br />
<br />
now there are two good reasons i recommend anyone getting 65 before going for broke on aa. one is because aa progression is faster at higher levels. the other is that like it or not people will consider you a newbie at 63 and deny you many opportunities. my druid is STILL at 63 with about 170aa and he knows full well that many even mediocre guilds would not invite him at that level except as an alt to my 65 warrior. it is not selfish asking for a group with a 65 warrior with only 10aa. after all he is still better than a 62 warrior with the same number of aa and soaks up only a little bit more group experience split.<br />
<br />
nevertheless do not try a hard at 65 even with friends if you have no defensive aa yet. while my complaint was comparing 7750 hp with 8000 hp (newsflash i now have 7800 hp) which i consider is a trivial difference the difference between full mitigation aa lineup and no defensive aa is enormous.</div></div><hr />

Thanks that you are the instance that decides when I may talk or not.<br />
<br />
Personally i think that I can contribute to the discussion by telling my experiences when pick up groups for hard LDONs ask _ME_. That is largely on topic, isnt it?<br />
<br />
<br />
For you to say they have to ask first, then ask hp/ac after you've joined DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF ASKING.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I dont know where you read that I said that they will ask me after I joined. <br />
I merely stated that i dont like being asked FIRST for my HP/AC - and that the question should be rather formulated as &quot;Would you like to tank hard LDON for us&quot; or &quot;Would you like to join our hard LDON as tank?&quot; <br />
 <br />
<br />
if you're that offended by bieng asked, don't turn LFG on, just say lfg in guild chat for hours =p.<br />
<br />
*snicker* Assuming again, are we?<br />
<br />
Not sure, how it does look like in your world / server / guild, but personally I never go LFG, (didnt use that new LFG tool even once) - I rather build my own groups from guildies and friends. If nobody is on for serious groupage I will kill some time threeboxing in Sol Ro for Cash or something.<br />
<br />
In essence: I am more of a group builder than one who gets asked for groups.<br />
<br />
When I am asked by strangers I will answer politely and nice - met some great folks that way (whom i keep in mind [eg friend list] for future reference). But to come along crossing my way with the AC/HP question is surely the wrong way with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you still havent gotten the point here. first of all this was never a rant about me looking for a group. it was a rant about another person looking for a pickup group and thinking that the entire encounter was dependent on the hp of the mt. the person who queried me on this and which started this whole rant was herself lfg not me. and it never even occured to her to ask one thing about the group makeup other than my own hitpoints. im sure she like pumillio would have prefered a group without crowd control or a good puller to a tank with 250hp less than your magic 8khp.<br />
<br />
those of you warriors who think you are the end all of what makes a ldon group pass or fail need to really start looking at the importance of every class in the group not just the main tank.<br />
<br />
i was criticized for suggesting earlier that i just might back away from a snared mob during the fight if i judged it was in the interests of the group as if i had commited blasphemy against the infallible warrior class.<br />
<br />
well ok im now 2 for 2 on ldons attempted in the last 4 months or so. most recent one was yesterday. the only one i failed before that could not possibly have been my own gear's fault since the bard died twice in the first three pulls to failed lulls which she had no idea how to deal with. but i suppose you are going to blame my hitpoints for that one too right?<br />
<br />
what were some of the highlights of this outstanding group? a bard who on his one bad pull of 4 mobs managed to send them all back without having to zone or train us. no clue how he did it. same bard never had less than 4 songs twisted and could not get into range without mannasong being on no matter how important the other 3 twisted songs were. a warrior (me) who almost always backed off when the mob was at 20 percent because he had agro lock and felt it illogical to keep getting hit when by then agro simply could not be peeled off me before the mob died. and it was almost always snared so why the heck not kite it .. (uh oh more blasphemy against the holy warrior class). im trying to impress on you guys who think 8000hp is more important than agro lock but some of you cant get over the dogma of &quot;no it has to be 8000hp nothing else matters&quot;. a necro who besides being a manna machine could mez and snare with such reliability that we never feared pulls of 2 and even handled a pull or 2 of 3. a shaman who though only having less than 100aa is the most skilled shaman ive ever had the pleasure to group with.<br />
<br />
when i invited the bard i told him &quot;i am not a time equipped warrior by any stretch of the imagination and neither is anyone in my group but i can vouche for them all that they are a full group of very skilled players&quot;. he asked me no questions he just said &quot;hey im in lets do it!&quot;.<br />
<br />
ldon hard is not that hard. stop trying to make it into more than it is. clearly when an advanced guild has 5 members who want to do a hard they have a right to hope that they can recruit a sixth who they know also is well equipped. but pickup groups only require competent play not gear that gives you bragging rights. you know by backing off at 20 percent i saved 10 percent cleric healing manna while sacrificing about 1 percent total group dps. skill does have something to do with it. and the cleric also knew she could cast her ch later because she knew i wasnt too proud to back up a few steps to save her a rez and rebuff.<br />
<br />
somebody tell me why on every raid ive been on ive never seen a mt back off for even 1 or 2 seconds to save his life and the possible success of the raid. on these boards ive seen many comments to the effect of &quot;all a warrior has to do is hit attack and then go watch tv.&quot;<br />
<br />
skill &gt;&gt; an extra 250hp.</div></div><hr />

This is one of the things I've always disliked about EQ and Warriors are particularly susceptible to it.  And that's having your class functionality erroded by other classes access to gear.  If a level 65 Warrior with mediocre or poor gear can be out tanked by the 65 Ranger with top notch gear, then you've pretty much taken away the Warrior's reason to play.</div></div><hr />

My guild leader reccommended 8400hps 1500ac and all defensives if one wants to be able to reliably tank hard ldon without causing the group a fuss.  It can be done with less ... but once again we go back to the part of the warrior being selfish in imposing himself on content he or she is not geared for.  It CAN be done with less, but youre nothing but a tax on your healer and everyone else in the group.<br />
<br />
As a warrior you are gear dependant in ways that others arent.  Skill and a level head is importnant ... but there are limitations and there ARE basic understood requirements for content.<br />
<br />
At under 8k hps fully buffed you are a liability that most groups in their right mind just plain wont want to have.  Period.<br />

Monks I'm actually alot less picky about.<br />
<br />
Also, while 8k is not required, it virtually is because any tank that's not going to suck in a tense situation and me EFFECTIVE for the group, will have at least that ammount.<br />
<br />
Someone asking YOU for YOUR hps is not them thinking you're the focus point of the group, (you are but that's a aside), you have no means of knowing if they know the puller, talked with puller, etc.  <br />
<br />
Anyone that's asking a total strangers hps, hopefully smart enough to find out what the other players are around also.<br />

---seperate aside----<br />
<br />
I was referring to pick up raids, or situations where you don't know each other as far as raid leader asking hps etc.<br />

most guilds don't ask the hps because they already know em.  and for most guilds, a few hundred hps don't matter near as much as a half awake tank = p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u170"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p170">I think it's kind of crass to go asking people you haven't met to link their gear to you in an open effort to elvalulate them for a ldon adventure.I've never worried about what a bards wielding I just want him to bring singles or cc the xtras.Yeah numbers define eq charaters in a large degree,but, harpin on it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Constantly reducing everything to numbers takes some fun out of the game.Generally ,I'd rather jump in and give it a shot....it's only an ldon.If you're in some elite club where a loss scares you well i'd recruit from a known pool and try not to press those ideals on the casual lfg.I ma for my guild so hardly a day gos by when someone asks me something like,&quot;Hey do you mind if I ask your hp&amp;ac?&quot;,and I almost always give it because it doesn't matter to me really.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying people shouldn't use common sense when offering to fill a group role or ask questions when in doubt.I also don't mind strangers who want me to tank something for them asking my hp&amp;ac.Mind you, because they're asking a favor people usually deem that kinda question a little impolite and go by reputation ,or ,word of mouth.<br />
<br />
I don't know why backing up away from a mob smacking you is being equated with &quot;skill&quot;.Backing up or evading attack while waiting a ch is something most tanks learned pretty early.Usually on a raid mob the axe will fall too quickly to allow for such a manuver even discluding summoning ,but, I've done it instinctively when we're scraping by ...most would I think.I often back a mob up a lil on enrage to clear it's frontal arc given the right ground and range to healers.Backing  that stupid worm in the deep in circles while the dps trys to drive it up a wall can be a lil trying, but,what the heck.Backing up is the life of a tank hehe.Being situationally aware so you can react is important.That just takes a litle experience I think.<br />
<br />
Anyways,a well balanced group with good cc &amp; pulls will do ok with a tank of 7.5k ,or , a lil less imo.We did fine then.They will also do better than a group without good pulling &amp; cc with a 9k tank.Of course it'll be easier in a good group with a higher hp tank and when stuff becomes trivial like anywhere else you can get by with less of a group.<br />
<br />
Nothing is firm or engraved in these ldon encounters.A 7k tank isn't going to get one rounded, in fact he'll probably stand up as well or better than I do in Tipt.The hard ldon mobs one on one just don't require the raid tank type measuring stick.Their inherant threat is too easily mitigated by the group tank is with.If  you're only saying that a 8.5 tank with ok ac will have a cushion closer to what we're used to in xp groups then I can buy that.You guys who are entrenched on this hardline better not step foot in tipt without a pet to tank before you're 10k and 2200 ac unbuffed though.<br />
<br />
Just like aggro ,encounters are  fluid and impacted by a lot of factors.There's more to it then adding up your members stats and that would be an incredibly dull way to play for me.Yeah most people will probably find it comfortable to enter hard ldon when they are in the approximate content gear level of 8.5k tanks.That sounds roughly reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Um.... a lot more than you! )&quot;<br />
<br />
People don't understand that the warrior is one of the hardest classes to equip.<br />
<br />
Other classes are pretty much linear in how they are guaged...<br />
<br />
Wis casters have to have a lot of wis.  Int casters have to have a lot of int.  Go figure....<br />
<br />
Warriors have to have a lot of hit points.  But then again, they also have to have a lot of AC.  Oh and btw strength would be good too.... And dex..... oh and agility is nice as well.<br />
<br />
And when you go shopping for gear, you better make darn sure you cover all your bases because you can have great hit points, but if your AC sucks... well.... so do you.<br />
<br />
(Yes I know that it makes a huge difference when a cleric has enough hit points to withstand some damage as well, but not so much till later levels).<br />
<br />
I'm totally sympathetic about this...<br />
<br />
However, as one other person noted in the post... just because someone asks your HP doesn't mean that they are filtering you out for your hp.  It is simply good form to let a healer in your group know what your hit points are so they can plan their heals accordingly.  I almost always do this, not to brag, but to let them know where I stand.  And if I lose a significant HP buff that we don't have the right caster to replace, I try to keep them informed of that too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
god syndrome is now a reality.<br />
<br />
people not the mt can tag along with a bored 10k tank on a off day and do group stuff. as long as the healer can hit the right heal key and no one overagros the group will run just fine.<br />
toss in a 5k tank and the healer starts working overtime everyones on their toes waiting for the tank to die.<br />
<br />
not that any 5k tank can do it np people are just lazy and prefer the tanks with more hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Hosein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">/em has done hard with 7800ish buffed hps/almost 1400ac buffed and a bst slower...only guildie in the group was teh bard/puller...<br />
<br />
So, no your tank is not always teh bottle neck,  but it sure helps if he has 7k + hps<br />
