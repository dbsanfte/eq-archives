<br />
 Without going into too much detail, what are the core changes you have in mind for each of the melee class and what role do you see that class playing in groups and raids after the change?  <br />
<br />
The &quot;core changes&quot; are the addition of new skills for melee characters. These skills become available when in combat, and when an opportunity to use the skills arises, there will be several options for melee characters to choose. We are not anticipating any dramatic changes in roles for any class as a result of the melee enhancement. What we're aiming for is improved playability for melee classes (giving them a more active role while involved in a fight) and some improvement on their desirability for groups. <br />
We are introducing other changes, such as an overall mitigation improvement  for warriors, to target specific areas of need for specific classes.   <br />
  <br />
Will guilds that are at the &quot;end game&quot; be forced to return to &quot;old&quot; content to acquire the new abilities. There had been mention that some were vendor bought and high level ones were mob dropped. What's being done to avoid bottom feeding and overcrowding as players rush to acquire skills?  <br />
<br />
Right now we are planning to have them purchasable from vendors. In the future we may introduce quests or NPC drops to gain Skill and/or discipline tomes.   <br />
  <br />
In what ways will the new changes give Warriors some controllable aggro gaining abilities?  <br />
<br />
Several of the new skills allow each of the melee classes ways to control aggro. Warriors should see an improvement in their ability to gain &quot;snap aggro&quot;,  as it's often called.   <br />
  <br />
Are there plans to revamp some of the melee items to augment the new abilities. Or add new items to augment them (e.g. focus items for skills)? <br />
 <br />
There are no plans at this time to add items that improve these skills,  though that's certainly possible in the future. We will be adding Endurance bonuses to some existing items, as well as to new items as appropriate. <br />
<br />
Are the DPS increases going to be from AA skills, Weapon Damage when your window opens, or both? Can you give some examples of the system implementation  for DPS increasing abilities?   <br />
  <br />
Several of the new abilities provide DPS increases for Monks, Rogues and Warriors. The ability to make an extra attack, or to increase your normal melee damage are examples of possible abilities. We're not adding any AA abilities as part of the new melee system, although we do plan on creating AAs in the future that effect the melee system. But adding DPS is not the primary goal of this system. The goal is to add some utility and fun, to get a further away from one-dimensional classes.  <br />
<br />
 The Warrior to Knight ratio is already way out of proportion. How will these changes effect the desirability to play the Knight class over pure melee?<br />
  <br />
  <br />
 The skill system should make playing a melee character more interesting. It should also provide some flexibility to those classes for the player with the skill to take advantage of the system. It probably will not increase the number of people that want to start melee characters just to afk or two-box them in guild raids.  <br />
Good players that learn the value of the new skills will certainly find that they can contribute a bit more to their group or raid, and seeing well-played warriors doing that should inspire others to want to play one as well.   <br />
  <br />
<br />
 If these changes are to add versatility to pure melee classes, why are the balancing guidelines still used, Hybrids have lower DPS due to higher versatility, if you increase the versatility of pure melees, shouldn't Hybrids receive a DPS increase in compensation?   Will hybrids see any of these new moves?  <br />
<br />
 Hybrids will not be getting any of the new skills. This has been added specifically to address a deficiency in the ability of melee classes and the fun of playing a melee class.   <br />
 When trying to balance a scale, do you add weight to both sides expecting that to level the scale?   <br />
  <br />
 How are hybrid disciplines being revamped? I've heard rumors of reduced timers overall and that each would be on its own timer.  <br />
<br />
 As we've said many times, SOME of the disciplines may be moved to their own timers. SOME may be re-evaluated and changed. But for the most part, the only change to disciplines will be that they have been moved to the new system.  <br />
 At this time we don't want to make any more changes than we need to get the system working properly. Disciplines have been fine prior to this... yes, I know, each of you has a few you want to disagree with me about... so we're not planning major changes to them. The new system does give us a much greater ability to adjust such things in the future, if needed.   <br />
  <br />
 Very little has been mentioned of how this change will affect Bards. What is currently planned for them with this melee revision?  <br />
<br />
 Their disciplines will be moved to the new system.   <br />
  <br />
 How will the rumored new Berzerker class fit into the melee changes? <br />
 <br />
 I'll leave rumors to those that deal in such things...</div></div><hr />
