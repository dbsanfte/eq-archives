It's hard to get groups in the mornings so I am looking for some solo exp.  Right now I am killing light blues and a few dark ones in City of Mist.  Anywhere else I could find dark blue mobs with the same amount of HP as these?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are some zones where i have succesfully soloed from time to time the last levels.<br />
<br />
Kunark:<br />
- Veksar<br />
  Bloodgills and some others i could single pull<br />
<br />
Velious: <br />
- Velketors Labyrinth<br />
<br />
LoY: <br />
- Dulak Harbour<br />
  most lightblue now and some already green.<br />
- Torgiran mines<br />
  many light blues too now<br />
- Nadox<br />
<br />
GoD:<br />
- Natimbi<br />
  chance of good loot from trash, but rare as hell, i never got something<br />
<br />
<br />
Some general suggestions:<br />
If you want to solo a warrior at higher levels you need good gear.<br />
If you loose too much Hitpoints you will have lots of downtime.<br />
The most  important thing is high AC in my opinion to preserve your hitpoints. Your AC may be sufficient for groups but for soloing its pretty low. Try to get higher AC.<br />
<br />
Some items that will help you alot while soloing:<br />
- Fungi Tunic + other regen gear<br />
- Truncheon of Doom (50% slow proc)<br />
- snare Weapons for places where the mobs run and you could get adds<br />
  (Silken Whip of ensnaring, Anklesmasher)<br />
- Ornate Gauntlets (30% Selfonly haste clicky)<br />
<br />
If you have lots of money make sure you have AC/regen/ATK from tribute.<br />
If you dont have 41% haste get tribute haste 41% too. You need to do damage.<br />
Use DamageShield Potions &quot;Kilvas Blistering Flame&quot; and Clickies if you have them.<br />
Lifetap procs on your Weapons will help you more then pure damage or aggro procs when soloing.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 Cents :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have Kilva's Skin of Flame, 31% item haste, 30% clicky haste gaunts and sometimes I turn on the tribute.  I think my AC is higher then that, I just forgot what it was, I need to go make a Magelo and come back. :)</div></div><hr />

Just watch out for Transient Patroller who (true to his name) wanders up and down the hallway. If things get out of control, you're close to the zone line for a quick exit.</div></div><hr />

Warriors really suck at soloing.  I mean they really, really suck.</div></div><hr />

If efficiency was the factor, why would he have bothered starting a thread discussing soloing at level 60???<br />
<br />
Soloing as a warrior, as best I can tell, is all about utility tools (Truncheon of Doom, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, Kunzar Ku'Juch, some type of regen or healing gear like Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate, Fungi Tunic, Velius quest chests, etc) and intel (learning zones, spawn points, types of mobs, etc).  Another huge factor is finding places to single pull dblue cons, not necessarily an easy task.<br />
<br />
I like to solo for xp, though more for aaxp now, just to prove that it can be done as a viable alternative to sitting on my duff in PoK, PoT, or an LDoN camp hoping to get a group eventually.<br />
<br />
At level 60, I strongly suggest the Mines of Nurga.  You will need to be able to shrink in order to swim up the waterfall easily to the right of the zone in path.  The harder, experience bearing mobs are that direction for you.  You should be able to single pull the first 'pool' area back to near the zone in path.  Nifty bit of info --- mobs run at low health in this zone, but they can't / won't go up or down the waterfalls.  This means they can't bring friends back to you and you don't need to snare the buggers.  I am pretty sure Nurga and Droga still have a healthy ZEM component, too.  One further bonus:  Can eventually (took me 6 steady weeks) kill enough goblins and gather enough faction items to go from max KOS to max ally inside Chardok.  VERY, VERY nice ring to be had easily and for free as the 2nd of 3 quests.<br />
<br />
Eventually, level 63 will both help and hurt you.  More mobs and zones will green out, though on the flip side, Healing Will actually makes a significant impact on downtime healing.  The mushrooms at the front of The Deep are soloable, but not without significant risk.  Only the first 2 I have found to be single pulls at level 65, though occassionally there are light blues now.  If a 'deepspore mushroom' pops (not terribly common this shallow in the zone), you probably won't be able to solo it without some very fortunate help from the RNG (early slow, big DD procs, lifetaps, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suporma</div><div class="date">10-02-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soloing is really all about the utilities, so even if you have low hps and AC, but good utilities, you'll be ok, as you'll never need ALL of your hps. Still a nice cushion tho. One utility not mentioned is the 8th coldain ring. Not too hard of a quest, you'll need at most one or 2 random people to help you out with some parts. You can do this quest while LFG too, if it takes a long time to get a group, which I'm sure it does at level 60.<br />
<br />
If you DO have time to group however, I reccomend you hang out in zones you like to exp in and build weapon skills on people's mobs.  Just ask politely if you can build weapons skills, and they'll usually say nothing, but I go ahead anyway unless they say they don't want me to. <br />
<br />
There's no way you'll KS them as a warrior, but do be careful not to break mez or proc DoT's on things. Be sure also not to take agro of course, and if you can shrink yourself, that's also a plus as you'll be in their way less of the time.<br />
<br />
The advantage of doing this is that you'll build weapons skills that you'll probably use later (build bash, archery and throwing too!) and the group will be more likely to invite you if they need people, even if they don't need a warrior. Another psychological (sp?) advantage is that their group tank is more likely to leave sooner if he or she see's that someone is ready to instantly replace him.<br />
<br />
This worked well for me back in the PoV days, and I still use it now in WoS. In fact, when I log in, chances are that's what I'll be doing, I have lots of skills to build again thanks to OoW levels!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, thanks for this gem.  Didn't even make it thru the first sentence of his post did you?<br />
<br />
It's hard to get groups in the mornings so I am looking for some solo exp <br />
<br />
Soloing &gt; Sitting on your ass hoping your XP bar will move.<br />
<br />
All of the places in this thread are decent at 60.  Try them all, you should be able to find one you like.  Just make sure you find a snare whip and a truncheon of doom if you don't have them.  They're the real make or break items.</div></div><hr />
