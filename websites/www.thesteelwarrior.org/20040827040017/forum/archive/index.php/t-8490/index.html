thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Next couple of patches will be good. Im looking forward to being able to redo talent points, even if youre only able to do it once without penalty, will be fantastic and let me fix my screw ups with my mage :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm curious to see how many of the &quot;offensive&quot; warriors realize they've gimped themselves once end game content is in...watch them crying for the respecs then. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sure by the time the game is out there will be half a dozen different 'builds' for each class out there.  One good thing is, you can level so fast in this game that if you make a mistake, you can be level 50 again on a new character in a few weeks.   Too fast IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Experience gain being fast seems to come with every new release MMO from my experience. For instance, in SWG a commit player could max a combat profession in as little as a week. Last time I changed professions after it had been a while, even the macro afk professions such as medic and entertainer based ones take forever, whereas before with proper preparation it only took a day or 2.<br />
<br />
It'll be adjusted, I'm sure of it. MMOs get top heavy enough on their own without having the process being totally meaningless and devoid of value.</div></div><hr />
