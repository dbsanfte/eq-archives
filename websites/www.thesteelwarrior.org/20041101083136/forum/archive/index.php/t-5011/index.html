<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently obtained a Cord of Midnight on a late night pickup raid. The only reason I went in on it as a replacement for my belt of dorf slaying is that FIFTY agility. As an Ogre with low Agility already it seemed like it would be a nice AC boost.<br />
<br />
I gained a total of 26AC from this belt...this doesn't seem right to me. How much should raising my agility from 223 to 273 give on AC? It seems to me that 26AC is about the right amount for the raw 15AC upgrade. That tells me that the extra agility didn't affect my AC at all.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azunias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The extra AGI didn't .... it's a ratio of like 6-8 to 1 (AGI point to AC point) <br />
<br />
If that makes sense ......<br />
<br />
Cord has a nice haste but you lose (or give up) something in that return...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What exactly is the ratio of worn to displayed ac? I thought it was ~1.6:1, which would make  +15 raw ac = +24 displayed ac. You would think 50agi would be about 8ish ac though, maybe you get less ac per agi over 255?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If that's the case then a 50 agility boost netted me two AC? That sounds pretty messed up to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Edone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">back in the old days agl between like 215 and 255 was like 2ac,but it was like 1ac per 3 agl before that, never really bothered to look for 256-305</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm willing to bet 256-305 = shit for gains, just like stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also remember that AGI factors into the amount of endurance you have. I would think a 50 point boost would make some difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as I can tell 1 melee stat point seems to be around 2.5 END, so 50 AGI would be 225 END, or basically almost 1 extra /disc Incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AGI is practically worthless in this game.  Apparently it affects your endurance pool though so that would be a reason to want to raise it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it affects how fast you run away from mobs too! (really owned = low agi)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anything over 75 AGI will not affect your runspeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On a related note, I'm sorta surprised they haven't started making the best gear have more HP/AC/mods and LESS stats to encourage and reward people for actually getting the stat AAs.  Why would I bother getting STR/STA/DEX etc when I'm at like 500 unbuffed with gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">for the anual drunken nekked fist fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">rofl I remember the days of trying to run from a mob at like 1 mph...back when mobs didn't 1 round ya ;)</div></div><hr />
