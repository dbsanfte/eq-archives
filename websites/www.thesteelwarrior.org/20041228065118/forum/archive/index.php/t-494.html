<br />
Last night I was I was adventuring with my Barb Warrior in search of the person that dispenses the newbie armor quest. I checked the traning area (the pit), surrounding area as well as the building with the forges - nothing.<br />
<br />
LOL I even took one step further and asked my wife to query the trainers in the shaman area - yet' again nothing. No newbie armor quest's. Granted we have plenty of cash to just go buy armor but where is the fun in that! =)<br />
<br />
I checked Alakazams and found nothing also.<br />
<br />
So whats the deal? did the barbies get bent over when it came time for newbie armor quests?<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they put in some for the other barb classes.</div></div><hr />

Later, 2 wrath orc wristbands to Cindl = piece of rawhide +cash/xp/faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks all for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The newbie armor quests are an extension of the beastlord newbie armor quests.<br />
<br />
So ogres, barbs, trolls and cats had them when Luclin first went live.<br />
<br />
The rest came in spurts ... with Dark Elves getting the first actual set of newbie armor quests.<br />
<br />
It seems that they merely haven't gone back to the BST-usable races and added in the armor quests for those races' other classes yet.<br />
<br />
And don't hold your breath waiting for them to either, heh.</div></div><hr />

Save yer sanity and just go level :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a full set of Steel Warrior plate armor and the Jagged Blade of the Steel Warriors on an alt I made. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ibash</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well this really stinks. No n00b armor quest's and so far there is a shortage on decent armor to buy in Bazaar. I mean decent like barbed ringmail, Cobalt or better yet some nice Fierce Heraldic Plate.<br />
<br />
I can't wait till this weekend when everyone puts up there trader so I can go shopping:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undafut</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually found my best bargains mornings/mid-days on weekdays</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, you can't do the noob quests OR get fierce heraldic?<br />
<br />
I dunno if you have looked at the noob armor, but it's worse than banded.  If you are even thinking about barbed ringmail, let alone fierce heraldic you wouldn't wear the newbie armor for more than 5 minutes anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ibash</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also one thing I forgot about....Fierce Heraldic is lvl 45 only gear. <br />
<br />
BTW- It was not the stats on the n00b armor....it was the adventure of questing for it. It is all about having fun. <br />
<br />
Quest's = Fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cartolis</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree about the quests = fun, however in this game thats not the case usually. The main problem is that sony dosent want us to have the bright shiny toys that are fun to play with because if we did, then we might not want new toys.<br />
<br />
if they made it too easy to get good gear then people wouldnt be able to gloat about their &quot;uber loot&quot; and what fun would that be :P<br />
<br />
in all seriousness I would love to see a set of quests that ran every 5/10 levels from 1 to 65 that would allow you to get armor/weapons/gear with no more than a single group. the rewards should be good for your level, but not as good as uber drops off epic mobs like dragons or pop bosses.<br />
<br />
if they did that it would allow people that are a bit more casual/not in a high level guild to get decent gear and enjoy the game without having to pay some of the absolutely insane prices in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
not only that but it would add to immersion and engourage people to interact with the world in some manner other than killing A_mob_01</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always wanted quests to improve the stats on the original crafted armor to something better, same with Indicolilte.  If they started with the newbie armor quests for the first 10-15 levels, then let you upgrade that set to something better every 10 levels or so, that'd be awesome.   (and keep folks busy, which is what they want anyway) :)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ibash</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye I like the progessive quests idea you mention. To bad they wont listen to us anywho.....</div></div><hr />
