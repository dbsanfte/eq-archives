So, I'm cluttering this board even more, asking something I'm sure has been discussed at length previously, but I'm lazy. Link me the thread if one exists already to answer my question, which is this:<br />
<br />
Where are some good spots for a 65war and 65sham duo to get either good plat/vendor loot, or drops that sell well in the bazaar? I've been doing LDoN groups, but have had average splits of around 125pp, and no named drops to speak of. I don't really care how the exp is, as long as I can get some good cash.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

When I need cash, I generally go to enforcers.  You may get lucky and get several diamond drops, or you may see nothing at all for a while.  There's also a few other sellable items that drop there, a box, a coin, a rock .. all not stackable.  They sell for somewhere between 40 and 100 plat each.  And then there are the enforcer stones, worth around 9 plat, and the occasional peridot, and ethereal parchments.  On a good day I can make somewhere between 500-1000 plat per hour down there, on a bad day somewhat less.  <br />
<br />
It's not great, but it's easy to get to and it's the most reliable cash I have found.<br />
<br />
A guildie, a 65 enchanter, goes to Droga, with a mage/cleric hydra.  The cash drops there can be quite good (up to 15 plat per mob), and if you get a decent camp and can hold it there are decent bazaar sellables down there.  The hard part for me is that the good camps all have more adds than I like to deal with on my hydra team without friends, but maybe it would work for you.</div></div><hr />

Just go at off hours when not a ton of ppl are there and kill everything in sight on and around the plateau.  I'm assuming you know, but just in case you dont, all the basilisks, Lazard Men, Giant Skelleys and Cyclops are placeholders for HGs.   I easily make 1000+pp/hour there when Im bored.  No, you wont get lucky with any nice bazaar drops, but you dont need to 2box (except to carry more loot) and the money is easy and consistant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The people you need to do named camps really depends on what your level range is, however, I think its safe to say that you'll at least need someone to tank, someone to heal, someone to slow, someone to pull, and someone to deal with extra mobs if you ever get more than one pull, and maybe someone to snare, you'd be good. You don't have to bring along a full group, if you can get someone that does two or more of the above (like a bard, druid, ranger, etc...) then that'd work too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geltwip</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone said above, I would recommend Droga.  The mobs there do not hit very hard, and slowed, you won't even notice them.  Pulling 3-4 at a time isn't even a big deal.  They drop like 14-22 plat on average, and there are so many named in there now, there will always be several camps open, even if there are lots of other farmers in there.<br />
<br />
All of the mobs are blue, so you will get some exp, although not a lot, but it makes farming plat more bareable.  With 2 people, it's about 1% aa per kill.  <br />

Open up your droga_1.txt file in your maps folder, and add this to it.<br />

Then pull up your map, and every named will be marked for you.  You can use invis and just move to each named and clear out that room if you like.  Should be able to keep several named placeholders cleared before respawn this way.  Nothing sees invis, so you can move about as you wish.<br />

Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

I thought so too, but I was down in the jail with a rogue friend the other night, and he got waxed while sneak/hiding to look for nameds.  So I put up invis and conned the mob that killed him .. sure enough, scowl, ready to attack.</div></div><hr />
