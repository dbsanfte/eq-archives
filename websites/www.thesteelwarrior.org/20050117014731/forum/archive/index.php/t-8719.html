<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snarlwart</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey gang, I'm a lvl 20 Troll warrior who is fairly well set gear wise at the moment, though nothing real uber.  It's mostly real cheap bazaar stuff and hand me downs from mains.  I'm curious if anyone could suggest some reasonably cheap (under 3k pp max) that is 'standard issue' for warriors.  I guess I'm looking to do some light twinking, without going overboard.  I'm looking for ideas that may last up until lvl 50 if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Microxx</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO, get regen gear till lvl 50. Ikky BP, or if you come up with some cash, get fungi tunic (not sure if troll usable &gt;&lt;). I have no clue what prices are on your server. with buffs and regen gear, you can solo to 50 np and fast.<br />
<br />
not that I recomend soloing to 50, but pointing out that you can, so grouping with that gear can't hurt.<br />
<br />
this is the path I took, but I had no budget since I spent weeks farming for tradeskill items then selling them in bazaar for great twink money.<br />
<br />
maybe a pure war will have better advice. But as a twink, I went regen till lvl 50 something, then needed to group and was concerned about stats.</div></div><hr />

Talisen (i think thats how u spell it? its in my magelo.. heh) would be a good bow considering some decent stats and cost u maybe 50p? wpns seem pretty nice.. basically, maybe sacrifice some of that gothic armor for some calcified/deep cavern armor for the dex &amp; agi... and yes fungi is troll usable but then again its also, what, 140k on the tribunal? imho, with 140k you could upgrade alot more things instead of just that silly tunic....... its too bad ur agnostic snarl, missin out on the inny/cazic/zek armors  :(</div></div><hr />

They are much better ac and hp. Get another 6ac 65hp ring to replace foot soldier one. Don't worry about any other stats besides ac, hp, and stam till stam is maxed.</div></div><hr />
