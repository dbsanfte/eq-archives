<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crushor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just coming back to EQ after a 4 month work hiatus.<br />
I'm not in a guild, and dont' have any guilds that raid at my optimal play time(aka after work) on my server that i'm aware of.<br />
<br />
Just need some suggestions as to where i can go and what i can look for in upgrades considering the above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donbe Mesinwitm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only real suggestion I could offer you in the way of upgrades would to be to get your self to level 65 and work on AA's, The equipment will fall your way after that, provided you can find your self an Honest fun loving guild. It all depends on what you see is your self doing. Velious would offer you many good times and very good equipment, Luclin has lots of quests and a excellent selection of upgrades to get you ready for the Elemental Plains in PoP. I know that’s not what you really wanted to hear but .. 65 and AA’s  is the best way to get what you need.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Biggest thing that leaps out at me is haste.  Get a group and go camp Soulscream belt in Veksar...more haste and better stats.  Other than that, PoTC earing would be nice, replace that Sarnak Bracer(Cultural, Braclet of Fortitute, are both good options, but almost anything is better than what you have).  Not at all bad gear, you are in better shape than I was at level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good advise there so far.<br />
<br />
Belt - You should definitely try and go for a haste upgrade.  Soul Scream belt is probably the best option because it seems to drop fairly often, has nice stats, decent haste and there should be a few people interested in grouping in Veksar.  RBG is another nice option or if you can get haste in another slot (SBC's have nice stats and are coming down in price) a putrid belt of rotten hide is nice HPs and cheap for the waist slot.<br />
<br />
Shoulders - If you are on CoV faction then the Draconic Pauldrons are a very fun easy quest to do for some nice shoulders.  Have a look in the keep for a walk through as there are some good posts on this here.<br />
<br />
Wrist - I'm not sure what options are available for an agnostic Ogre in cultural, but even the non-imbued bracers (eg fine heraldic) are very nice with 25AC, 30hps and 6svall.  Otherwise something like a bracer of defense would be a small upgrade and relatively cheap.  If you are on CoV faction the Bracer of Benevolence can be done with a small group - check the keep for a walkthrough on this one too.<br />
<br />
Earring - I'd definitely look into questing an Earring of the Solstice.  Can get the bits for this for around 3k on tribunal now which is very cheap for a 5AC 5Sta 55HPs earring with some saves thrown in.<br />
<br />
Helm - Helmet of the Radukan is cheap these days too, just add in another 50pp for a dye so you dont have a pink hat.</div></div><hr />
