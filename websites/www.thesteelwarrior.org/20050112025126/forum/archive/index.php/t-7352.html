Here's (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=62268) the post on EqLive for those of you who haven't frequented the website lately. I put this in the outhouse, as I'm sure many of you will find reason to whine or come up with some bright idea about how SOE is still screwing the community. /sigh<br />
<br />
I personaly applaud any effort from the Devs to address player concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what concerns do they say they're gonna address in this 6 weeks?<br />
<br />
Oh that's right, jack and shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think thats some time to address and fix some issues and I like the efforts of the comunity RP guys over at the forums, at least it shows they are trying :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, they have to actually finish OoW first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. Smedley is pushing it back a month.<br />
<br />
I don't know that even that is enough time to make it anywhere near the point where most people won't gripe about it when it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, I say good.  I'm going to give them a chance to realize that their players are right and that they need to put out a good product.  I'd rather have it this way than have them release it in a month and have to whine and cry about how it's buggy, at least this way I can wait a couple months to whine and cry =P Of course I don't expect it to be perfect, but at least it APPEARS they are trying.<br />
 <br />
And as far as the 'Smedley' tag at the bottom, that's just a name, I doubt he even wrote the letter hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully they're really bust'n ass on the collision detection problems.<br />
<br />
I haven't got to play since the patch yet.  Tonights the first time I have the chance to get on, and I'm not looking forward to the constant hassle of trying to control the &quot;wall-mob&quot; from happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Collision problems started with the DX9 patch.  It is absolutely ridiuclous...RI DIC U LOUS that it has gone on this long.  What's it been, 3 months? More?  All I know is that my accounts were canceled in february sometime because of the DX9 patch, and this collision issue has been around ever since.<br />
<br />
I honestly can not believe people are still hopefull that SoE is somehow going to gain some kind of quality assurance department thru all of this.  No matter how much they delay this expansion, it's still going to have shit pushed live that should never have even made it off the drawing board, and for some reason, that's just fine and dandy with a lot of people.  I'm completely shocked by this every single day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty hopeful. You don't sit there and issue a statement like that which goes against all these years of people dealing with sony if you aren't serious. Their ego looks shot down to me, and they want to save the game.<br />
<br />
Whether it's for monetary gain or the right reasons, they are flying people out there who know the game, to help them to that. Atm anyway, you can't say they aren't trying.<br />
<br />
We'll see if they completely ignore everything said at that meeting though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, they are speaking quite humbly. I'd like to see the game actually  work and evolve in regards to player feedback rather than having ungodly timesinks and exponential levels of catassing = compelling gameplay(!).<br />
<br />
We'll see how bad they laugh it out of their development office though. Sorry; but SoE has too much of a history of broken promises and a general feeling of 'we know our game. what do you know? pay us your 12.95 a month and shut up' to sway my thoughts at this stage of the game.<br />
<br />
Good luck to the rest of ya though that are still playing.</div></div><hr />
