<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else had problems with getting Seru reports to drop lately, or know of an issue with them?  I've led several hunts now in Sanctus Seru killing the top-floor guards in the towers (mainly A Vigilum Cohortis from the NE &quot;Eye&quot; building), but with probably near 100-150 kills now, we have not seen a single report drop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seru Reports have always been super rare.  I duo'd most of mine with a cleric.  There was one house that took well over 200 kills to get.  Just keep trying, reporst aren't bugged or anything, you may just be like me and get unlucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you ain't the only unlucky one.....god i hated that more than the ME shard for VT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah seru reports are just really really rare.  I would say that it took me between 30-40 hours to get all 4 of my reports done.  The good news is that the shoulder and heart house can be 2 boxed pretty easily by a warrior and some sorta healer.  The eye and hand houses are somewhat harder to 2 box because there are see invis mobs in the lower levels of the guildhouse that you have to kill before you can get to the third level.<br />
<br />
After you get your reports get ready for the shard bosses.  They are 1 week respawn and seem to be highly contested.  Luckily I was able to finish off my shards this last week when the servers went down for patch 3 times in 3 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry gang, the reports are not that rare.  In my experience the drop rate is somewhere around 1/10 or 1/20.  Judge drop rates by killing Signifieri of the Hand, the only mobs that can't be pickpocketed.<br />
<br />
Yep, that's right, rogues PP the reports in the other 3 buildings.  This means you have to clear spawn generally before you have any chance to get a report.<br />
<br />
I hunted these for myself in the last 2 weeks, I got a report on the second Signifieri I killed.  All others I got in the 1st or second repops.  The Lictor of the Heart seems to drop a little less frequently, because there are a lot more Lictors than the guards in the other buildings, but we still got the report on the 3rd round of kills, took about 2 hours I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well they are definately a lot more rare from my experiences...  I finally got my report from the &quot;Eye&quot; building last night (woot), after about five nights and about 200 A Vigilum Cohortis I'd say.</div></div><hr />

They're not being pick-pocketed.  They are just rare.  Camping reports sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's great that you were lucky Gnomos, but once again people fail to understand the meaning of random.  You said you camped them for yourself, but try camping them for about 10-12 different guildmates at various times for various amounts of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>chingerz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Would those reports be tradable on FV where Gnomos plays?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would those reports be tradable on FV where Gnomos plays?<br />
<br />
Yes they are tradable here, and rogues do PP them.  The guards are under 60 in 3 of the buildings, 5 levels under a 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've run into the same thing.  A guildie and I are working this quest and we've only picked up reports in one building.  Last night we spent 3 hours w/o seeing any drops at all in 2 buildings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Camping in the Heart tower to improve my faction for questing in Katta, i got one report in 14 hours of complete tower killing.  I forget which mob dropped it, but it takes a lot of camping.</div></div><hr />
