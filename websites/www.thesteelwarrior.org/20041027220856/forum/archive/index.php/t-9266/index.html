<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dxkj21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">65 Shaman 55 warrior. I tried PoV and the warrior gets 1.2-1.5 blues per kill, but at 50dps or so it takes a while even with the shaman dotting a bit.<br />
<br />
By my calculations, assuming the shaman PL doesnt run out of mana, that would be at best 12-15 blues an hour in AA.<br />
<br />
Any place at 55 getting PL'd can beat that? Velks is a bit slower and a bit more hectic too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'll probably do a lot better if you put the warrior in a group full of 60+ dps and just let him come along for the ride. You can even keep the shaman outside as &quot;free&quot; heals/slows if you want. Take the inner caves in PoV and he should see XP fly. Theres probably not much out there thats going to be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would think that Veksar first undead area or golem area, or ChardokB entry, would both be better than that.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why you are only doing 50 dps?  The shaman should be able to exceed 200 dps, and can probably tank such mobs better than the warrior too.<br />
<br />
If you're trying to get the warrior ungrouped XP, I'd suggest just group them up; it will be faster to have the shaman taking an XP share but plowing through mobs quickly.  In fact, it would probably be easiest to just sit the warrior on his ass in the corner and just solo low-to-65 blues with the shaman.</div></div><hr />

Hrm that's a thought. I was just not wanting the shaman to take her chunk of the exp out. The shaman can probably do 125 dps plus pet, so combined we could probably do 200 dps. That would cut the time needed to kill down by a lot...<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess im kinda stupid for not thinking about it :P So maybe i will tear up pov a bit like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah outside pl'ing used to work pretty well, but with the new xp bonusess for groups, you can often help more just by being in the group and unloading all the dps you can. I did PoV IC with a level 61 friend of mine with 3 68+ in the group, and a random wizard and rog lfg in the zone. We got a couple percent XP, but the level 61 was pretty damn thrilled with her 20% real xp in an hour or so.</div></div><hr />

I did rhag1 in ssra with a bard singing psalm of veeshan and using Puretone and I had a 200+dmg shield going and was pumping out a constant 250 dps the entire fight. :D Just porcupine everything to death if dps is an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We slow the mobs to keep up with healing so getting beat down to cause more damage isnt going to work for us :).<br />
<br />
I will try the shaman in group tommorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The warrior might lose 2/3 of the XP to the shaman, but with the shaman+pet contributing DPS, you'll probably kill mobs 4-5x faster.  The level 62 pet is probably a better tank than the warrior too. :)  Overall, your warrior will be gaining XP at least twice as fast by having them grouped and utilizing the shaman fully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually the Shaman won't be taking any exp away from the warrior. I tried this out, I solo'ed PoV Outter camp with my Druid, then I put my Shaman in a group with the Druid. The Druid never got less exp while in the 2 person group. Solo exp was nerfed so bad about 18 months ago that duo'ing is the same exp as solo'ing. So group em up.</div></div><hr />

]I just tried this grouped with the shaman. The shaman took over half the exp compared to a solo kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">THe only thing left for you to do then is time the kills with each method.  <br />
<br />
If you can kill fast enough with the shaman in group to overcome the xp loss from having him in group.  Then keep the shaman in group, if you find that you are not making up the xp lost from a non solo kill, then keep him out.<br />
<br />
I would go 4 kills with each method, time each method, and compare how much XP you gained with each.</div></div><hr />

4 Kills with shaman out of group. 6 blues time- 24 minutes<br />
4 kills with shaman in group. 2.9 blues time- 16 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesnt quite balance. To be honest these mobs have too many hps to sit there for 6 mins beating on. I suppose i will find something else for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Try pl'ing a whole group of 55's. Group XP bonus &gt;&gt; all. Make sure they're all dps classes and they'll kill real fast, and your 55 friend will make some friends too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
This whole plan is because of my new work schedule. I have 1.5-2hrs in the morning to get the warrior some AA. I can 2-3 box, and my regular group is a 55 warrior bard rogue, but i cant do the shaman as well and run the rest of them :).<br />
 <br />
<br />
I guess I could LFg, but things are usually dead in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First - find some mobs that are green to your 65 Shaman but dark blue to the warrior - group them and kill as fast as possible with the shaman.<br />
<br />
Bur my real question is why would you be worried about AAs when the warrior has 15 more levels to gain?  No AA skills are going to equal levels for the same time spent grinding exp.</div></div><hr />

The answer to that is easy. The warrior is my wife's the 55 bard is mine, the 55 rogue is my friends. We want to level up together and not have one get ahead of the rest. If we are all going to be the same level, and i have some extra time, it makes more sense to put some work into mitigation for the warrior. CA or ND . Getting ahead of the others isn't an option. And i cant 5 box or I would just do that for a few hours a day. Stupid system :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Quato gave you the right advice.  POV is the wrong type of mob for powerlevelling at 55.  You want mobs that are trivial to the shaman, but worth XP to the warrior.  High 40's to low 50's would be my choice.  Hence my suggestion of Veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Veksar is a good choice but so is Seb.  Seb has a lot of greens to a 65th lvl and the frogs drop some decent coin and gems.  In Veksar all mobs are blue but the goblins at zone are light blue so you will be soaking a lot of exp off the warrior.  In seb you will be just tearing through all the mobs in 45 secs or less grouped.  The frogs do run though but with your pet it shouldnt be much of a problem.  I actually used to let the mobs run and get some friends so I didn't have to move=)<br />
<br />
My choice would be Seb since there is almost no one there these days.<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />

I tried griegs at level 53. The exp was ok but it wasnt insane....<br />

Just got LDON tonight so we are going to try that out :)</div></div><hr />
