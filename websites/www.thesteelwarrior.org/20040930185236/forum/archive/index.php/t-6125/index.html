<br />
My guild is in the process of recruiting and needs, especially, warriors. I know your site to be one of the best online resources and would love to be able to post a recruitment message here but, of course, have no intention of soliciting where it isn't welcome. I did not see any server specific type thread and was wondering if this type of thing would be allowed and if so where?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as i know there isnt such a thread on these boards.<br />
<br />
However, I dont think anyone would take serious issue if you did post your recruiting requirements and a little bit about your guild..<br />
Probably the best place to post it would be in this forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does your server had a message board?<br />
<br />
That is where most guilds put there reqruitment threads, as that is where people looking for guilds are more likely to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mostly I've locked recruitment threads as they've popped up. I don't feel this is the place for them but I've asked the other mods what they think, may have an answer for ya soonish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'm transfering to luclin... i'd be wanted there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mods? Let me know if you approve. Again, I know that some boards really object to solicitation for guilds because they feel it ruins the flavor of the board. I wouldn't want to do that here so I want to make sure it's alright first. <br />
<br />
The reason I would rather post here than on the server board is that I expect we would get a higher caliber of warrior from here than from a general post on the server board. That's the whole point, I guess. I, for one, am a researcher. I try to know my class inside and out and when I played a warrior for a bit this is where I came for info. I have more faith in the warriors that read this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">we're still hashing the idea out .. aka .. we haven't run out of beer yet :D<br />
<br />
it's being discussed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dammit you guys need to run outta beer soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">not sure if this was figured out or not but eqluclin.com has a forum and a place to post for recrutment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh whoops! Thought I PM'd Uira. Either way, a link in your sig to your guild's recruitment boards or whatever is cool, as long as you don't post just to post.</div></div><hr />
