<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Twalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well we finally did it, killed Rathe on our 3rd try ever today, but oh wait what? poeb crashes 1 min after PP despawns. so we wait 2 hours for the GM to tell us they dont have any records of who was there blah blah (we sent in SS's logs etc) and that they couldnt award flags even though some 10-15 of members still got their shields today (he said he couldnt trace when the items were created)<br />
<br />
so grats us 1 tube KY jelly to make it slide in smooth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ouch...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Send tells to xegony.Bakk, he's a master of wrangling flags out of GM's! He manages to get them for people who don't even attend!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hear your pain mate... Solro, my last mob for PoFire access, and I go LD after being rezzed in after he went down.  Show up 20 minutes later after 1018.... GRRRRR... now we can't find him up :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Twalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fulorian that's exactly why they said he could not award flags, since we had no /report of hails and that there was no way to prove who was present.<br />
<br />
so now we are /reporting everything... loot flags you name it, not gonna get screwed again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Norya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Doh, that gotta suck :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We've had poeb crash after we killed all the offtank rathes and 4 mezzable rathes, 2 more to spawn aoe &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought you had all your Euros LD at once with 11 Rathe dead and last one at 5%, with only 3 or so US players staying in, who proceeded to die?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/report everything<br />
