<br />
Anyone do some research or know anything about this game?<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to try it out; but I figure you all here know more about newer games than I do...so I posted this. My major concern is; is this a AO v2.0 or is there any substance to this game ?<br />
<br />
Pro's to looking and considering this game:<br />
1. Sci-Fi is my genre of choice<br />
2. AO would have kept my gaming attention if it worked.<br />
<br />
fire away !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AO works now, yanno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah i know AO works now...but after 2 months of playing it at the beginning; well, funcom can kiss my ass :D</div></div><hr />

You'll have 4 races ( all human ) to give you the basic stats with a choice what you wanna be ( trader .scouter fighter .. ) and then you have a picture of a char you'll never see - except of that picture.<br />
<br />
You then fly around in spaceships in a real huge universe and can do lots of things.<br />
<br />
In the beginning mostly<br />
mining stuff<br />
making agent missions<br />
<br />
a bit later <br />
killing NPC pirats<br />
trade stuff from star to star <br />
mining<br />
agent ..<br />
<br />
more later <br />
Building starships (dunno exactly how, cause I am in a bit later .<br />
<br />
PvP everywhere but some systems have a high security so PvP isnt very good there <br />
Killing other NPC (not Pirates ) <br />
researching new technologies ..<br />
<br />
You start with a Noobship. <br />
You can train skills ( you have to buy) but some you get as a starter and these differ from race to profession (you choosed in beginning ). <br />
Shiptypes <br />
frigate ( smallt to big ) differ per race but you can learn other frigate skills to fly them.<br />
cruiser ( small to big ) same as frigates you have to have high frigate skill to learn cruiser skill<br />
battleship (small to big ) same as cruiser <br />
specialships like Industrals ( skill .. )<br />
<br />
For each stuff you need skills. When you want projektilweapons .. skill. ( small medium large ) <br />
<br />
A new begginers guide is just implemented on eve-online.com.<br />
<br />
The game can be long and can be fun hard to say, but you can download the client for 25 bucks I think with a month free play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uthuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Eve is one of the worst MMOs i have tested.<br />
<br />
All you do is mine ore and shit, at least if you want to be somewhat effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It indeed was one of the worst games I betaed....<br />
<br />
But...now that they have been out for a while, adding and fixing and patching, and have teh rights back from Simon and Schuester Interactive (I think)--who forced them to go live way too early--or less than the price of 2 months of regular EQ, you can get a very pretty game that has a lot of depth.<br />
<br />
At the moment they are setting new on line records every weekend, though I don't think they have yet hit the cirtical mass to really have the game take off.<br />
<br />
While it is fully PVP, it takes more than a bit of time to get to the point where you want to PVP. Though the makers of the game are trying to come up with a place where the lightest ships in the game (frigates) can fight with one another without being stomped by bigger ships.<br />
<br />
At the moment the game is more about economics than combat, as the player density increase, I think the PVP parts will become more important. <br />
<br />
An important fact about EVE, I think, is the original devs are still working on the game, and as dedicated to it as they ever were. The vision in still in the building. <br />
<br />
Since I have come back to EVE, I have mined maybe 3 times. If you do try it, do as much as you can for your starting agent, as he/she will teach you a lot about the many and complicated systems in EVE.<br />
<br />
I would encourage you to try it out, its cheap, in some ways caters to the casual player, and if you find a good corp, very social.</div></div><hr />
