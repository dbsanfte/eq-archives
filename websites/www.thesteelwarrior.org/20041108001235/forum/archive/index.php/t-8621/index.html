<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Clobber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently saving aa for what.. Well I hope thats what I can get help with.<br />
I have WA5 and Sturdiness5 but need to know what else in GoD I MUST get before saving for Oow.  I want to have some banked if I can pull it off.  <br />
However I want to get what I need.  <br />
I do MT in GoD currently... <br />
So Any help would be appriciated.  <br />
THanks :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bank to 30 then spend em as you get em.  Nothing other than sturd/WA in GoD will help you more than the continuation of the mitigation and avoidance you'll see in OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've got 29 saved myself and I'm debating whether to spend 20 on sturdiness 5 or spend a few points on crap just to make sure I have 30 when OoW comes out.  I'll be away for about a week before release and if I spend 20 now and it comes out on sept 14th, I definitely won't have 30 banked by then.  But i'm about to hit 30 now so I need to spend it on something.  I could get hastened instigation 2 and 3 or swift journey 2 or something.  *shrug*  It's mostly crap now.  20 AA is just a lot to pay for 100 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm making that same decision now, too, Callon.  Sturdiness 5 is such a bitch of a call to make...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say you have plenty of time to buy it and save 20 more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NeoKlux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not sure about what u should get but i can tell you what you shouldnt : strenghtened strike !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go for Sinister Strike. It's worth it. I've got crappy 1Hs, Obsidian Battle Sword and Sparkling Shortsword (hey! It was rotting anyway!), and it out-dps my BoW slightly with that AA.<br />
<br />
I do have WA5 to create lots of pets though (max was 5 at 1 time, but that's happened only once these past 4 months hehe).</div></div><hr />
