<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice :D was sorta stumped on 7 through 10</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zeeko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Does the scavanger hunt continue or is the staff the final reward? (effect reduces stamina?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The result is a staff (sparkler particle effect + unique look afaik) that lets you chain cast a fireworks spell.  Cant use it to pull.  There are 5 different versions, with the oldest(by toon birthday) toons getting the biggest fireworks display.  <br />
<br />
Staff of Endless Adventuring or something similar.  Was a fun quest, got to visit old haunts. :)  I got the one with Trakanon's Tail effect, 3 basic fireworks.  A friend got Nagafens Fire which is the same as mine, but adds a blue donut effect when the fireworks go off at altitude.  Another friend got the one with Tormax's candle, with 2 basic fireworks.  not sure what the others look like yet.</div></div><hr />

Yar, was light fun and the risk/effort did equal the reward - the collectible items dropped like rain, really, and four of us did the thing in about 3 hours.  Sparklers ahoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can everyone who gets the pieces get one? Where does it start?</div></div><hr />

I started in Neriak, me home town, and everybody I did it with started in their home cities.  I dunno if you can start in *any* home city (if yer KOS at home, f'rinstance).  Hail an NPC (the name will appear before you in yellow), get a container, grab all the *A Collecter's &lt;__________&gt;* (there are 10), click the combine button, and turn it in.  You get a clue sheet, or the *gimme* is linked above by Xenephex.<br />
<br />
It's a clickie particle effect, I can't imagine you wouldn't be able to do the thing once for each toon on yer account(s) if you like.  Expect to see a bunch of sparkles when raid targets go down, and such like.  :p<br />
<br />
Fun.  Useless.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm doing it at like 10, so it isn't TOO hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got all but the Splitpaw thing in about 3:30 last night, but I was doing it during the dead hours (midnight-3:30 AM).<br />
<br />
Its pretty easy really, all of the peices are fairly common, the toughest being the pieces from Mistmoore and OOT because there aren't that many gargoyles and the sharks are a PITA to find. The rest of the zones (except for WC) are a bunch of static spawns with lots of mobs so its np to find you you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">easy, but i noticed level 10's got 5 fireworks from their sticks because it checks the highest toon on your account, not the account age itself, sadly last week i deleted old dardec(named after D&amp;D basic warrior) and it read my oldest char as 2 years :(<br />
<br />
sucks when i can show the bills for 4 years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not sure if thats right or not Gerick.  My account is pre-RoK (bought it from a buddy), but SS's bday is mar 00 and I got the Traknon's tail effect.  There are older characters on different servers that he had played on.</div></div><hr />
