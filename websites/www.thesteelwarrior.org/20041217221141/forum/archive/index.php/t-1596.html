<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilguri</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im wondering, does anyone else fall under the impression that Sony actually spent a moment thinking when they itemized PoP ?<br />
<br />
What im saying is that there are plenty of new warrior weapons which provide good aggro and are not as difficult to attain as previous expansion gear.<br />
<br />
Weapons that come in mind would be the Cord Hilted Spike Driver, Great Blade of Storms and Great Staff of Thunder, all while compared to their older counterparts such as BF and Hategiver are not as good, but still provide good solution to aggro problem.<br />
<br />
And in comparison to their older counterparts, the new weapons are easily attained by most pepole, Great Staff of Tunder drops in BoT off a lower mini boss which is easily one groupable, it is also tradeable.<br />
<br />
Cord Hilted Spike Driver and Great Blade of Storms are also not as difficult to attain as other weapons, those do require a raid force but most guilds who can do Vindi should be able to get their hands on Xanamech atleast and Eindride Icestorm isnt much tougher.<br />
<br />
I know its not the solution to aggro problem, well not the one I would want, I would take a working skill over almost any weapon in the game, but does anyone else think Sony atleast made an attempt to make up for Warriors ?<br />
<br />
All in all, life as a warrior can't get much worse, so i'd only expect for improvments.</div></div><hr />
