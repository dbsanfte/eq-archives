<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cheshirecat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im a newbie (shame) and just got to 35, I'm using two lammys at the moment and am planning on buying a VAoVB.  Now where do I place it?  Primary for better procs is what I thought but I keep reading to put it in off hand... I'm guessing those are rangers posting but I dont know...  Help!  Also the Lammys a horrible off hand weapon, so they say.  But why is it?  does delay even matter on off hand?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ratio is the primary factor for offhand DPS, since you get no damage bonus for your off hand.   For DPS purposes, mainhand lammy/offhand axe. For aggro purposes, the more procs you get, the better off you'll be, so you might  try swapping them and seeing how you do.  Incedentally, I still use a veno axe offhand alot of the time, it's decent dps and the proc is pretty good aggro.  Nowhere near the best out there, but I'm short of funds most of the time, so I'm still using it at 57 and don't have too many problems unless my groupmates lose their minds and go full burn. (or if they're knights with little man complex) :)   Oh, and the lammy isnt a terrible offhand weapon, it used to be fairly common to see high level warriors dual wielding lammy's.  It's just not nearly as good as gear that drops 4 expansions later. but I remember dual wielding langseaxes at level 30, so my opinion is somewhat biased.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cheshirecat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thank you muchly, i think i will enjoy posting here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, I was never impress with the Veno Ax.  On the old board, I think I tore into with my frustrations long ago.<br />
<br />
For the most part, if I were you, i'd Main a lammy, off hand the axe.  Proc never did much for agro for me.  Actually, I think a yak was better at that time than the veno ax for me /shrug.  At 35 though, your DS is still low, If you can, see if you can spring for a Wurmslayer, or see if folks would be willing to help you out with the quest for it.  I used a Wurmy/Fist of Zek (16/30) combo for a LONG time, until I got my lammy at level 43.<br />
<br />
Best advice:  Mix and Match, see how it does in off hand or main hand.  I even do that now with my current weapons =)  Sometimes one set up will work better one day than the next.<br />

Good luck to ya =)</div></div><hr />
