<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fairly sure it's just 50</div></div><hr />

My chanter could not get some items untill he was 51 and it fits the kunark expansion that introduced the epics pretty well, since it was the one that raised the level limit from 50 to 60, so a level 51 would have to own the kunark expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't rely on what level other classes can do their epic turn-ins but, as Hussar pointed out, go talk to the NPC's yourself. For example, you can't get a rogue epic till level level 50, but you can get a druid epic at level 46/47 (the right-click effect won't work till 50, but you can still get the leaf-blower at 46/47).<br />
<br />
Basically, it's different for a lot of the classes, and to add insult to injury, your own quest NPC may tell you to go hunt rats for a while longer, but they may talk to a like-level PC from another class; he may not give them the item or allow a turn-in, but he'll talk. (BTW, I'm referring to that Redblade guy in Freeport...he told my level 5 warrior mule to take a hike, but spoke at length about broken instruments with my level 5 bard...go figure.)</div></div><hr />
