<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qezkotle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello again friends,<br />
<br />
After much time slugging it out in PoV and BoT I am about to hit level 64.  I fully intend to trudge my way through 64 and hit 65 ASAP.<br />
<br />
However, I often times get only an hour or two to play during EQ &quot;prime times&quot; Which often means nobobdy needs a 64 Warrior :D <br />
<br />
My question is this.  I can often bot my brother's 62 Shaman acccount.  Do any of you who have been her before me know of any good spots to get AA exp for an hour or two??<br />
<br />
I appreciate the help in advance, I dont think I could have made it this far without the help of this website.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmmmmm....Good question. PoD CY's with the warrior solo in group could get you there, but usually camped.<br />
<br />
Same thign with random Mobs in PoV.<br />
<br />
What I would do, If I were you...was offer to tank for people and let them know that you are willing to have your Shaman sit outside of group.<br />
<br />
That way, you could add pure DPS instead of a slower/buffer and the group would make up for your one less level....<br />
<br />
That used to work for me and my 60 druid bot in PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Me and a Shammy buddy used to grind in CoD at the zone.  Easy pulls (for the shammy).  The only problem there is greaters, which are unslowable.  It would be advisable to have a Druid/Cleric there for heals on those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Selucreh Herculian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LDoN can be your friend.  I did LDoN's at 64 for xp, now do them for AAxp.<br />
<br />
Many times with even a mediocre group you can get a regular LDoN done in 35 to 40 minutes (good group we are getting those done in 25).  For reg xp I was averaging about 6 blues per adventure.  On AAxp I am averaging about 13 to 15 blues per.  So if you can get 3 or 4 of those in per night you can get the aaxp plus make some cash and what not.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp's worth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I 2 boxed warrior and shaman through the 60's a lot. At that level you should be able to make decent exp from the Gamite frogs in Valor. Just head east from the zone in to the river and at corner of zone there is a rock with a frog on top and one to each side. I used to single pull them easily with the shaman using Malo. Also there are a couple of the single worm things nearby. You wont make the exp you do in a full group but its better then sitting around making nothing looking for a group. Also the middle frog on the rock is a PH for a named type that once in a while drops a 2 hand sword ya can prolly make a few K from in Bazaar.<br />
<br />
 If those are too tough for the duo, before that I used to do the Hobgoblins in PoN. Set up across river and you can easily single pull the croc and the first three hobs along the river, just have to watch for trains from folks heading to hedge or PoNB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Montagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If i'm short on time I head to Torment with a bot shaman.  Exp isn't great, 3% per kill solo, but it's usually empty and you can set up on the first bridge.  You'll also get bloody tormentor parts for stir fry :)</div></div><hr />
