<br />
Normally I don't have a problem breaking mez but I did a hard LDON yesterday and I would taunt until successful and then provoke.  Smack the mob and it would run to the chanter and then back to me.  It did that 3 times then the next time went through my routine and then assisted the mob before I broke mez, had me as target...still went to enchanter first.  Enchanter sitting override my agro?<br />
<br />
Any ideas or is that just to be expected?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who's able to get to a LDoN hard and still can't figure out that Sit aggro &gt; all, isn't someone you want to be playing with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think i read sit aggro is like 500 or so. dunno if thats right, but it could make sense. lets assume chanter is on top of the hate list, so the actual hate number is irrelevant. <br />
you taunt  you have hate+1<br />
you incite you now have hate+401<br />
chanter sits  she now has hate+500<br />
you break mez and mob runs to her hits her, which stands her and puts her under you on the hate list so mob comes back to you, you quickly make up the 99 point difference in hate and mob stays on you even if she sits now<br />
<br />
has happened to me before and thats as best a scenario as i can figger out with muh little ogre brain<br />
<br />
sounds like you are doing your job. you get a sucessful taunt then use aggro disc before breaking mez, thats what i do. it makes much more sense then the folks who tell you taunt a few times and even if it dont work use incite then break mezz. that is silly since you dont know how much aggro the top person has. incite is 400 from what i read, what if they had 600 hate :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
little sidenote: Mobs cant change their target while they are stunned and mezz is considered as stun in this case.<br />
<br />
Original topic: Enchs have to stand up before you break mezz or right after you change the target to the new one. As an alternative you could wait for a taunt hit, incite it and wait 5 ticks so incite aggro &gt; sit aggro ;p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If their nice chanters they'll stand beside their mez's on breaks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree it sux to wait 18 seconds to break mezz, but thats more of an issue with taunt fail rates/reuse time than anything else. im lvl 65 and taunt is mazzed, i shouldnt get 6-8 failed in a row on a blue mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I taunt once and break mez unless I know it's a hardcore mob.  If it's something I don't think the chanter can handle a couple whacks from I'll taunt till I get a success, but otherwise it's one taunt, then incite and bash.  Even if the taunt fails the chanter won't be that far ahead of incite if all they did was mez and slow, and all you need is one proc or for taunt to recycle and you'll get aggro.  I don't like to have my whole group sitting around waiting for the RNG when I know I can get aggro reasonably fast with or without taunt, and even if I don't the chanter can always root it if they're worried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The modifier due to sit aggro or low HP is temporary, and is not used on the 'highest aggro + 1' consideration for taunt.  So actually a successful taunt will never take aggro off a sitting enchanter because sit aggro is always greater than the +1 (or whatever you believe it to be) part from taunt, barring a proc on the mez break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Normally in exp groups I taunt + inciite (regardless of taunt is success or not).<br />
<br />
If taunt success I break and go on my merry way.<br />
<br />
If taunt fails, I wait for taunt to refresh and hit taunt and break (regarless of taunt is success or not).<br />
<br />
Only time I change this is if chanter seems to always get agro, then I taunt a 3rd time if failures, and then break.<br />
<br />
This is in Hard LDoN's or GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">once had a chanter doing it on purpose because her mindless pet was supper dps or something.<br />
<br />
i think i lost my taunt button for a hour or so after she told me that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">once had a chanter doing it on purpose because her mindless pet was supper dps or something.<br />
<br />
all 20 dps of it, pure ownage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merc</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually Disarm then Taunt.  I think I read here that taunt won't do anything if you aren't on the mobs hate list already.  Disarm gives you a little bit of hate and the taunt puts you on top.<br />
<br />
I definitely notice less pong doing it like this than just taunt alone.  I also never incite until I have aggro.  I wait till taunt/procs/dps gets me aggro then I pop incite to boost me up over everyone else.  If the mobs' going to ping around I'd rather him get it done all at once at the start of a fight than turn again later on.<br />
<br />
Of course in hard LDoN/GoD I'll never break a mezzed mob without a successful taunt.  If someone is getting beat down I'll pop it though in hopes of grabbing aggro before they splat.<br />
<br />
I also wait a split second after I hit attack before I incite, and never incite on inc.  Incite is broken like SK pure hate spells and basically gets voided unless piggybacked to pure dps hate.  But that's another topic........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that and incite makes the mezed mob do a animation and people jump it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, taunt if successful works regardless of your position on list.Disarm if it's fun for you.Better to incite right after successful taunt because incite aggro is low compared to proc aggro ,but ,helps fill those weak warrior aggro moments at early engagement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diron</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i generaly incite then disarm then taunt then use kick to break the mez.  if i was a large race i would use kick or bash.  the stun, at least for me, seems to give a little agro and i for the most part have no problem with the mobs chaseing sitting chanters.  well unless i want them to chase sitting chanters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo disarm is a waste of time and if a chanter is sitting on break the mob is very likely to beeline for him and stand him up.Most chanters are smart enough to stand on breaks which is why you don't have to chase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Straythe</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hit my incoming hotkey when I'm going to break mez as a warning then break mez a second later.  If the chanter can't figure out that sitting during mez breaks gets him/her hit, then they will get sick of playing a chanter soon enough, or go back to ebay and try to trade for a different class character.<br />
<br />
When I play my chanter, if I want my pet in melee, I'll go swing at the mob until it ripostes me.  As it is, my pet usually gets chewed up by a damage shield and I just wave goodbye as he suicides on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i generaly incite then disarm then taunt then use kick to break the mez<br />
<br />
you have it backwards, inciting then taunting would still only put you 1 above the highest aggro, doing taunt then incite puts yu 401 above them</div></div><hr />
