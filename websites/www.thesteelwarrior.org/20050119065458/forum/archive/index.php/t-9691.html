<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a dilemma and i was hoping everyone here can shed some light.  But first a question, which might clarify and simplify my decision.  When you turn in LDoN items to get points back for them, where do the points go?  Do you receive points at the camp you sell it, or the camp you bought it?  <br />
<br />
For exammple, I have 2 pieces of Malevolent Armor from Miragul's camp which ive recently upgraded through OOW groupage.  I want to turn these back in, to upgrade either an AngerIII aug from Miragul's or 10ac augs (x2) from Mistmoore.  If i turn in the armor and get 532 points for each, that gives me 1064 + 129 previously earned points.   <br />
<br />
Should I go for the anger 3 aug (no current anger augs, just a 75dd aug i bought cause i was bored) or try to jack up the AC on a couple of pieces of OOW armor that are a tad weak in that area.  Or is it even possible to get points at Mistmoore camp for armor I bought at the Miragul's camp?<br />
<br />
Situation seems a bit confusing but I appreciate any advice.  Current magelo is to left.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
In order to buy an item from Miragul's for 1492 points, you must have at some point earned a total of 1492 points at Miragul's.<br />
If you then go and earn 1492 points at Rujark, you can spend those 1492 at Miragul's, even though you already spent points at Miragul's.<br />
<br />
Points will always go to the same spending pool, your points are not affected by where you earned them.  The only reason they are tracked per camp is to make sure that you have done enough adventures at said camp before you can buy stuff there.  After that you can earn your points wherever you want.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
Now, to answer your first question, they go to the same pool as all other points, this doesn't affect your spending abilities at any camp.<br />
<br />
To answer your second question, get the Anger III aug or Force of Ykesha aug.  Both are viable choices.  Being able to hold aggro is more important that any amount of AC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you that clarifies my dilemma of what to buy.  indirectly i guess you also answered my question of where the points go.  My initial thought was that selling back an item at a camp would grant me that many points at that camp, as if i'd earned them.  I know how to unlock camps, but i did not know if selling back an item at a particular camp would unlock it in the same way as earning those points by doing adventures.<br />
<br />
I guess i asked the question the wrong way, but thank you for answering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, one final question if anyone can advise me a bit more.  Do i move the glowing permafrost aug (cheapo 75dd) from the hammer to keep it (with new anger 3) in primary?  or should i aug my bloodsworn with anger 3 and move it to primary?  its only 150p or so to move the old aug, but wanna know if it makes a difference which weap (anger 3 aug notwithstanding) is in primary.<br />
<br />
thanks again<br />

If I were in your boat I would prolly sell back the 2 pieces of the 760 EF armor and turn right around and buy Anger II X 2.  Put one in each of your weapons.  Or maybe Anger II x 1 and the 100 or 125 Yak proc for the offhand.  Yes I know Anger 2 is 200 less hate per proc but I used Anger 2 for a long time due to bein half the cost and found them to work very nicely.  Just my 2 cp on the situation.  I know I also opted for the 760 EF armor as it was only slightly inferior to the 1492 No Ro armor but almost half the cost.  Anyways GL on what you decide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my observations the hammer and sword are so close that either one works in primary. I kept the SotBS when I upgraded because the stun lands on the higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
   Another option is if you have OoW to go camp the Ykesha proc aug in Bloodfields. Either to put on the secondary weapon or on the primary instead of the Anger, leaving you the points for AC augs. But the best bet is to have 2 aggro augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My sense is that some majority of warriors with both weapons mainhand the hammer, I think because the aggro generation is a toss up and the hammer in mainhand generates slightly more dps.<br />
However, the stun on the Bloodsworn works on higher level mobs (that is, might interrupt the ones that can be interrupted). Of course, you're in trouble if you're reduced to hoping the the proc on a warrior's weapon will save the day by interrupting a mob at just the right time. Really I'm not sure it matters all that much, other than as you imply in your question, whichever you put in the mainhand should have the Anger III.</div></div><hr />
