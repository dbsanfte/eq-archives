I know that Each rank grants an increased chance to avoid an opponents special defenses such as: block, dodge, parry or riposte.<br />
<br />
And it is worded diferently ingame. But my question is. Does this mean when you try to hit a mob and he reposites. Are you going to strike threw his riposite and hit him and he still hits you. Or are you to avoid him hitting you and you continue to hit him?<br />
<br />
My problem lies with using 2 really low dly weapons and eating 250 riposites in an adventure. Ow sure I am keeping good agro. but cleric is not liking me very much on the hard advenutres.</div></div><hr />

Bypassing special defences = Strikethough  :cool: <br />
<br />
since a specil defence comesinto play if you would have otherwise hit the repost dosent work and you hit him repost message should never come up you got around it<br />
<br />
and yes its saved me when a mob enraged and I forgot to turn off atack  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will still get hit like normal when attacking an enraged mob. The only difference is that with TM you will actually do some dmg back to that mob.<br />
<br />
You will not take any less dmg when getting TM.</div></div><hr />

TM just lets you land the hit, you still get the riposte but your hit is not blocked, mainly an offensive AA like everyone said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can, get a 2h for hard ldon.  I switched from dw quickly as it is easier for my druid/shammy to keep me alive.  It also minimizes the number of ripostes you will gather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have all of your defensive AA (LR5 especially), the number of ripostes you take will not be a huge amount more than if you use a 2h weapon.  It isn't going to make a huge amount of difference in hard LDoN and with a 2h you might have more agro problems which usually means dead casters.  If you die its a minor setback, if the cleric or slower dies its a lot more of a hastle.<br />
<br />
I dual wield in elementals and my main hand weapon is 18 delay and I haven't died to enrage in months since I got LR5.  Occasionally I will miss turning attack off because of lag or just forgetting but the mobs miss me a lot and it isn't normally fatal.  I have TM3 and it is worth getting but make sure you have LR5 and ID5 first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a word NO, parse it and then decide if the higher aggro is worth the higher damage taken.  I take about 5-8 more dps damage in HARDS then normals with one handers.</div></div><hr />
