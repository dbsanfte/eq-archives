<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just recently completed mine :)<br />
<br />
I'm curious to find out how many warriors on each server have acquired this or are bothering to try for it. I was surprised to find out that everyone and their dog who's close to elemental status is going for it. However, I only know of 4 warriors other than myself on Xegony who've completed it. <br />
<br />
I've always thought of a warrior getting their signet as much more of a challenge than most other classes. Starting out with my pimp 167 wis for pottery/tailoring/brewing was just painfull. Jewelcrafting/fletching/smithing weren't to bad due to useing a melee stat for its skillup check. In the end, it felt as if I had a bit of a disadvantage, but it was worth it. What are your thoughts on the earing? Is it worth the time it takes (I swear I could have gotten another 100 aa in the months it took me to finish it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My GF is almost completed with the earing also. We worked super hard on her skills until tailoring got above 200, now its slowed down obviously. Very nice earing and something you should be proud of.<br />
<br />
A few of our guild warriors have it done and probably 10 people total in my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tailoring is the only step that made me hesitant, rest is easy imo. Too many start it tho just cause they look at the stats, and don't look at their resources / time commitment it takes to get the drops then cry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tailoring fails on the fire tunic SUXXOR big time- I finally succeeded after 4 attempts with a 240 skill (&gt;250 w/ modifier).  Beware the air bow also, I nailed that first try, but getting the parts seemed to be totally raid dependent, nobody seems to camp air for tradeskill stuff...<br />
<br />
Anyway, 6 or 8 or so people in guild have finished em, bout 2-3x that many more working on em.  As expected, smithing and tailoring are the real blocks, the rest you can just throw plat at and finish in one or two days.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Watching and helping my guildmates on that quest is enough to convince me that I will never have a Signet of Might.  Good luck to anyone that want to try it, and congratulations to those that finish it, but I have other things I'd rather do with my time.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I've got mine, but seeing as I'm pretty damn sure you know that already, pointless to post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yet you do it to bump your postcount!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, Postcount is yum yum !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can someone post a link to a walk-through, or at least basic information, for this quest? Allakhazam's doesn't seem to have a signet of might quest in its databases and EQ Traders just says the item exists, but not what trade skills are needed to acquire it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">... EQ Traders has the most thorough walkthrough I know. Take another look at  quests. PoP section. Aid Grimel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, I wasn't doing it to bump my postcount. I MQed Tarean the stone to finish his Signet of Might...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks, Wychway, I was looking at it from the finished product side and that's why I couldn't find it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Graffe's has a pretty good summary of the quest.<br />
<br />
All my skills 220+ except for Tailoring now. And GOOD LORD does tailoring suck, just looking at the recipes and such... I've gathered lots of components but haven't had the balls to do any combines beyond 187 skill so far, just a mule full of supplies taunting me. I don't even want to think about how bad it's going to suck when I start failing the fire tunic, haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Been saveing up cash to start on the skills needed for the quest. About to start dumping the needed AA into it as well. Already bought 20k in WIS gear to get me to 224 unbuffed. Not going to try any harder than that, hehe.<br />
<br />
I have about 1/2 of the needed supplies already, and I did hear that getting the PoA drops can suck. Not really a EXP zone. Hope Stone in hand though, got it my first kill ever in PoE (how lucky can you get).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>DiomedXegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I honestly hate the hell out of tradeskills, but I love quests that require insane effort for mehy rewards.  So I subjected myself to this for that reason and that it was a free upgrade that wouldn't have to spend raid points on, the only truly redeeming factor of this task.<br />
<br />
I got mega lucky and completed all the combines @ 220+geerlok.<br />
Good luck to those crazy or bored enough to bother with this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Camric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm down to just tailoring, skill is at 187 and slowly climbing.  Still in need of the hope stone, no luck as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I finished mine just over a month ago I think now, I also made a second one for my other ear.  Takes alot of time and money to complete all the skills, I am 250 unmodded in all 7 normal tradeskills now as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Muldoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Diomed is insane in the membrane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tailoring was a nightmare. After 187 I must have spent near 200k to get it to 220. <br />
<br />
Luckily I got my fire robe and air bow on my first try of each. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ohh, and Fulorian has testicles the size of oranges (thanks a ton for the hopestone :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Finished mine Friday night :)<br />
<br />
1 for 3 on the darn robe though, and 1 for 2 on the bow.  My tradeskill guru/best friend Ralaini was 1 for 1 on both those.  Thanks for all the help Ral!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Finished my Marked Runed Signet, but still need a Hope Stone. Unlucky for me, I have to random against everyone and their sister who doesn't even do fucking tradeskills when one drops, when it's the last piece needed for my Signet of Might. &lt;3</div></div><hr />

Get a group that kills memphits in any of the planes and you should get one before too long- I've see 2-3 drop in one night in memphit town in pofire (and many other days with zero, ymmv).  Seemed to be about as rare as the saps from the spiders...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks for the tip. Everyone I know swears first castle in PoFire is the best spot for one. I must've done a dozen 4+ hour sessions there though, and I've never seen one drop in that spot.<br />
<br />
BTW, anyone ever seen Hope Stone drop in PoWater? I've seen many in the other 3 elemental planes, but never water.  Camped frogs cave and surrounding areas today for a few hours with a few groups and killed many mephits, again no stone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Saps was easy, bow strings when you've not attempted dust yet was the hard part. 3 grouping that island was the gayest thing i've experienced in eq so far.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tanise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Any tips on getting the saps to drop? <br />
<br />
Yeah Kill everything. And find bottled patience and get drunk on it. Unless you farm in the middle of the night you will be dealing with around 3-5 kiting farmers. 1 of them may actually be doing the quest the others are just farming saps to try and sell at overbloated prices (don't buy from them please, let the saps rot on their trader mules~).<br />
<br />
The biggest problem you will have is most of the farmer ted crew is rather unintelligent and will only kill spiders. When you kill a spider it only has at best a 1 in 4 chance of repopping as a spider. It's actually lower when you look at all the randoms and the fact that Flame Lord/lordlings have the highest spawn chance. You also have the DC pets and named which can spawn - all on the same table.  But the farmers only being there for saps will only kill spiders and thus the spider population will drop. You need to kill spiders and other mobs to keep spider spawns flowing.<br />
<br />
There are exceptions to the intellect of the farming crew, some actually will kill other spawns, just as some of the people kiting are just there to get exp and don't care what they kill but they unfortunately are the exception, not the rule.<br />
<br />
I normally would dou there with my cleric for a few hours late at night while I was working on the spawn of satan (tailoring). It was doable with wavecrasher.<br />
<br />
Btw I don't mean to flame the people farming the saps but when I watch these people sit on their butt for an hour or more waiting on a spider to pop and then they get up and go rush to it, it gets frustrating. Kill spiders first, but don't forget to kill other things so you keep the spiders flowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Camric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I've been able to acquire one sap so far from farming.   Bazaar prices runs 40k to 60k per sap on Mith Marr so I don't plan to buy any at those prices.  Tailoring is now at 210 and climbing shouldn't be long now before I'll be ready to make any attempted.<br />
<br />
As for the air bow i'm all set for one attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Blackmoonx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I finished mine a ways back. I really hate tradeskills and it took forever it seemed 1-2 months free playtime and about 350kpp.<br />
Two warriors in my guild have it that I can think of, including me. But alot of other guildies of different classes completed it as well.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Camric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Finally got my earring.  Got lucky on my first attempt on the robe and bow.<br />
<br />
Nice to have that out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Still working on mine.<br />
<br />
2 fails on the robe (220 + Geerlock), I have the rest just waiting on that combine to actually work....</div></div><hr />
