<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shreana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi im a level 60 warrior with almost 5 aas now i figured i would get my first six before going on to level. would love some advice about this idea too many are telling me to get alot of aas now . but some are telling me to get my level and then aas.i know my armor is weak so i worry about getting to high level in this shape . i dont have lots of plat i have been farming but never seems to be enough  as you all know im sure.if you could take time and look at my magelo and give me some ideas and prices i would love it. im not up on all the abbreviations of things so please keep that in mind when you tell me what to work on getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shreana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">magelo doesnt seem to want to load from my computer i hope it works for you let me know if doesnt</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try this.  Note the missing &quot;num=&quot; part...<br />

1) neck - spider fur collar. cheeeep.<br />
2) face - crystal spider eyes<br />
3) rings, wrists, arms, and gaunts all decent<br />
4) shoulders - draconic pauldrons, easy quest in WW. I'd be wearing the Shawl of the Firewalker in your BP, might be better than what I suggested...<br />
5) legs - cobalt legs, allows you to go invis!<br />
6) boots - champions or myrmidon's. I'd sooner wear the Cobalt in your inventory than the Incarnadine.<br />
7) Might replace the helmet with the one from UP.  The Champion's (Thurg) is nice too.<br />
<br />
I'd be wielding the Tortured Slave's Charred Staff in off-hand - nice HPs and ratio!<br />
<br />
You have some nice stuff.  Everything listed above is only an opinion of course.  Hit the bazaar and use the search feature to find exactly what you need and can afford.  You can prolly do better than the Spider Fur Collar I listed above, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say the general consensus is get level 65 first, then AA's.<br />
<br />
Oh, and your Haste item is pretty low. But you could do some LDoN adventures and get a nice item you can stuff a Haste augment into, like the 36% haste augment from Mistmoore which needs a type 3 slot and fits into Head, Back, Range and Waist slots. Not to mention you can aim a bit higher on those since they do not cost pp, but rather adventure ponts.<br />
<br />
Now, since you already have fair items in back, waist and range, that really leaves the Helmet ready for an upgrade.<br />
So lets make an example :<br />
<br />
Helmet (duh) -- Royal Attendant Helmet of Sand (1492  Takish points)<br />
Haste (36%) -- Gravestone Fragment of Flailing Dead (1150 Mistmoore points)<br />
+40HP -------- Aug2 Glowing Saphire of Courage (1150 Takish points)<br />
+10 STA ----- Aug All Peerless Sphere of Fortitude (357 Rujarkian points)<br />
<br />
And you'll end up with a helmet like this : Augmented Helmet (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=44301&amp;slot1=42214&amp;slot2=42167&amp;slot3=42165)<br />
<br />
Offcourse, it's the helmet and the haste augment that will make the bulk of it, so that what one would go for first ... ie. first Helmet, then Haste.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you could put in a Glowing Prism of Brawling (+5DEX +5STA +20HP) from Guk instead of the Glowing Saphire of Courage (+40HP) one. They cost the same amount of points though and you'll hit the STA cap eventually.<br />
<br />
And even if you got a better haste item, it would still be a very nice helmet. :)<br />
Not to mention you get some exp while doing adventures.</div></div><hr />
