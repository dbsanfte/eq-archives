Remind me what benefits paladins get from the pure melee enhancements.<br />
If you think we haven't gained much ground at all, you don't know wtf you're talking about.<br />
Oh, and do you mean the berserker class that comes out in the next expansion? Remind me how a class that doesn't exist yet is competing against us.<br />

<br />
Unlinked disciplines, and hey we got that too :)<br />
<br />
New spell effects also kick ass and don't lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rheven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi.<br />
<br />
Well. I got this loaded and tried out. Odd looking little box, I thought. I don't seem to have much of an endurance pool. And it recovers very slowly. I'll study it some more. I've been concentrating on my cleric that last couple days. She's about to get her 96% rezz. But I think I am excited about the changes. Hope it all goes well for us.<br />
<br />
Rheven</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just reactivated my account to try the new changes and spent 2 hours in BoT with guildies. IMO, the new changes rock.<br />
<br />
Getting and keeping agro was not a problem. I only lost it once, that was after the shammie maloed, then bounced 2 slows before landing a 3rd (he always maloed/slowed on incoming). Other than that, getting agro was easy, fast, and solid.<br />
<br />
The agro discipline is also a help, and nice to have even if unnecessary most of the time - the 30 minute timer on it is not a problem.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm happy with the changes, exp groups are looking to be fun again and that's all I, as a casual warrior, really care about. SOE really came through and has my money again for the forseeable future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I didn't get to play with them much in a group situation, because I uh<br />
<br />
spent 28k in the casino<br />
<br />
but I played around with them a little bit solo, and like what I saw so far.  Defensive takes about 40% of my endurance start to finish, and that seemed to regen appreciably fast.<br />
<br />
and I got beer goggles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm going to hold off on my opinion about the changes overall, because there's still more stuff that's going to be added (although most of that is directed towards the monks and rogues, with only the &quot;openings&quot; system, whatever it ends up being, directed towards warriors).<br />
<br />
I will say that the agro boost is wonderful, from what I've seen.  Knights still beat Warriors, but now Warriors actually have a leg to stand on.  I still believe low level stuns should be looked at and tuned, tho.<br />
<br />
The ability to use Offensive and &quot;Oh shit&quot; disciplines without losing the ability to go Defensive/Evasive (providing you still have the Endurance) speaks for itself, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still think some tweaking needs to be done with discipline costs, but overall i am really happy.  Knight stun costs prob need to be looked at, as well as aggro produced, but i can;t complain beside that . . . oh well and fix the bugs please . . . i was so wanting to disc mighty strike . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am very happy with the aggro line. Its not aggro lock (which I like that it isn't) and its at least a fighting chance. Thats all that I really wanted to be honest. The rest is gravy.<br />
<br />
You can also do some cool things with it that a warrior could not do before (switching and casting it on a mezzed mob so you are ready when the one you are on drops for example). I am also happy with the taunt fail message, its suprising how often it does actually fail now that I see it in writing.<br />
<br />
 Some of the discs seem to have very high costs, but hey I barely use most of em anyway when I want my bar for taunt (except defensive). Nice for when the shit hits the fan.<br />
<br />
Pretty happy overall, don't care about openings I think it sounds stupid. Haven't personally tested it though so I could be way off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fix Knightemization...<br />
     Been beat to death on this subject...<br />
<br />
Fix Taunt...<br />
     It fails way more than 50% and EVEN when it doesnt fail, it does NOT always give aggro. That is not the way they told us it worked, so if it is working as intended its broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, I think I am happy. I haven't played enough to be 100% on it, but I don't think we have any grounds for complaint. Our agro is NOT supposed to be as good as a knights and I think SoE as come up with a very good solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lykke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Happy as hell, but taunt-fail random generator is still the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bajnok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am happy with the changes.  Incite seems to fit a specific aggro hole in my groups and raids, specifically on INC and after slows.  A successful taunt + Incite almost always got me aggro.  If not, it was often just a proc away.<br />
<br />
The mitigation change is not really all that noticable to me at this point.  The unlinked disciplines are pretty neat, but I still need to retrain my mind and remember that I actually can do damage once in a while.  I was in Growth last night, and we needed a runner dead immdiately, but I forgot that I could actually do a /disc and help finish them off quicker.<br />
<br />
Oh, and adding the Taunt failure message makes me sad, in RL.  Are any other skills besides Intimidation that crappy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Where's the ok but could be better option? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The changes make me happy in pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm holding final judgement until I can work with this more but so far I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Now that there are failed tant messages, I too am noticing that a supposedly successful taunt does not always get the mob to swing around towards me.<br />
<br />
Also, is it just me or does taunt seem to fail a lot more frequently right after another player has been summoned?  I noticed that if I currently had aggro I could hit taunt and most of the time it appeared to be successful.  If I hit taunt right after someone got summoned (the slower, a big nuke lands, etc) I noticed that it was common to fail a taunt at least 1 time and frequently 2 times.<br />
<br />
Generally I am pretty happy with Incite, and the discs being unhooked is nice.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the emergency patch will fix a lot of the issues with discs being on the wrong timer, discs fizzling, discs being broken, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mhila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">From what I saw of the changes Soloing in Velks just to play with the new system it seems ok.  The mitigation increase was noticable, Healing will was good enough to gain me about 1500hp relativly fast before I ran out of mana...  I MEAN ENDURANCE! (sry&gt;&lt;) Defensive seems to work about the same as before and leaves me plenty of endurance to use another disc afterwards and Stonewall was just crazy mitigation verses Blizzard hunter Spiders in Velks...  dropped hits for 80 down to hits for 13...  can't wait to try that one on something that can throw a punch.<br />
<br />
As far as agro increase goes though, I was LFG for about 2 hours and as is pretty much standard, watched a dozen or so knights zone into BoT, shout once and disappear to the groups that summoned them so I have no idea how my agro control is now.  I didn't really have any trouble holding agro in XP groups before with a GBoS and CHoS so add in an extra 400 hate every 30 seconds and the occasional agro disc and it should be fine...  maybe I'll be able to get a group today and see for myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok, shaman posting here.  Grouped with a warrior last night in PoV, at outer.  Hit them with malo on inc, and slow right after, never ever pulled aggro.  The chanter did pull aggro with tash tho, but everyone knows that tash is crazy aggro....why she was tashing is beyond me, as I didnt have even one slow bounce the whole time.<br />
<br />
The mitigation change was VERY noticable, even in exp groups.  A similarly equipped knight would have dropped hp MUCH faster.  The cleric healed him with a small HoT at the end of every fight, and that was it, no other heals at all.  He commented &quot;This is the easiest time I have EVER had healing at this camp, and I spent 56-64 here 90% of the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
All I have to say, is Knights are SCREWED.  Why get a knight at all now? Aggro? Nope, warrior aggro is sufficient, not as good, but good enough.  Tanking abillity? Nope, warriors SMOKE knights tanking ability by a SHIT-TON.  Utility? Yay, more shitty recourses to click off my already full buff bar to allow me to torpor myself.  Group heals?? Sorry, I don't exp on mobs with an AoE...<br />
<br />
I put my LFG up when I was getting a group....the message I added was the usual, with a new addition &quot;Full Spellbook - War Tank ONLY&quot;....got a group, they needed a slower, and I was the only one lfg...so the 65 pally got booted and replaced with a 63 warrior, YAY.<br />

Thank you Steel Warriors for this forum your efforts have obviously brought a lot of attention to SOE about the pure melee classes in EQ.  I have been reading this forum for the past year and from what has come out of this last patch I be leave that Sow has been paying close attention to the ideas and complants posted here.  Although it is yet to be seen what the impact of this patch is going to be on warriors at least it looks like all our issues have been addressed to some degree.  A system has been set up so that abilities can be added and tweaked in the future to improve class balancing for pure melee characters.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for this forum  <br />

NO max skill of ANY class should fail as regularly as that does...  Numerous little weird things happening...  All in all the IDEAS are great, however, the implementation and coding of those ideas is pitiful.  SOE ought to be ashamed of this patch instead of laughing all the way to the bank.  How code this buggy got pushed Live is beyond me.<br />
<br />
The ideas are great... The patch itself leaves ALOT to be desired.<br />
<br />
I would say that the changes are great, however, 3 of my discipline timers are stuck at 15+ hrs now which leaves me the offensive discipline timer as the only one working :D<br />
<br />
Like I said... the changes are great... IF they work... IF your timer refreshes correctly... IF it wasnt such shoddy code... and why the hell didnt they color code the timers or give us the ability to change the colors of each timer?... small thing but would have been nice heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The changes are 80% garbage and a very very marginal upgrade at best.  Innate mitigation makes defensive less useful than before, stonewall is 100% useless on raids and marginal exping at best.  They put all of the offensive discs on the same timer which was a huge nerf off of test because that was the one upgrade we got.  All in all the only good thing we got was the ability to use fearless outside of other discs, and incite for a small part but aggro isnt an issue end game.  So all in all it helped newbies with aggro and didnt do a god damn thing otherwise other than give me a retarded hotkey box on my screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I generally like the changes.  I have found that for me, my agro is still dependent of the group(some commenting on my 'unreal agro', some where slower was still getting hit alot), but definatly much better.  Disc changes where not bad overall, could be better, but not bad.  Endurance was rarely an issue for me, tho in one high DPS(with no shaman for buffs) LDoN, I did run out a couple times just casting Incite.  For now I am pretty happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Funny on how I posted months ago on taunt, saying that taunt doesn't go top of list + some small amount as was generally accepted, and had many people jump on me saying I was all wrong.<br />
<br />
Seems that I am finally shown to not have been wrong, taunt really isn't that way after all... now the question is, do we just misunderstand how taunt works, or is it broken? I don't seem to recall any SoE employee ever saying it was top of list.<br />
<br />
Anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the first bit of melee changes. The Provoke line was badly needed, and is a good fix for the warrior snap aggro issue, which I believe was the biggest issue facing warriors today. Furious being on its own timer also helps quite a bit with tank transitions on those hard hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Still looks like it works that way to me. What's making you think it doesn't? The only time a mob hasn't turned back to me on a successful taunt is when it's either casting or stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I got to agree with Fenring.  Sometimes mobs don't turn immedietly(casting, stunned, low health agro), but they always do turn.  Only time I have broken mez after not seeing a taunt fail message and had the mob go for a caster when one who was sitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I'm *constantly* seeing taunt succeed, and the mob not turn to me like it should if it was top list.<br />
<br />
And when it's, say, a militis in BoT, you have spell effects on and you don't see any stunning happening, and your group is all at &gt;80% health, there's no reason for it not to turn, if that was the way taunt always worked.</div></div><hr />

Aggro control seems a lot easier even at my level being MT for higher level pallys and rangers.  Only probs i had were timing of &quot;Bellow&quot; to draw aggro off caster critical hits.<br />
<br />
Haven't had a really good chance to experiment with weaponry combinations in addition to this, but overall, I'm quite happy with the changes even though a piece of my gear was nerfed in the process.<br />

<br />
There are other ways a mob can be stunned, something like bash wouldn't have a spell effect or message when it stuns a mob.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you're wrong but I've grouped enough since the patch to get about 9 AA's (all in BoT except a couple LDoN adventures)and I haven't seen anything to show that taunt doesn't work the way we've always thought.<br />
<br />
Since we're getting info from the devs about what our new abilities do it might be nice for them to tell us exactly how taunt does work once and for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I like the changes so far. Compared to what we had, its definetively an improvement. Over a year due, but its here at last.<br />
<br />
I think it does need a bit more of tweaking.  The cost in endurance seems a bit high when you consider we still have the refresh timers and no endurance items/buffs. <br />
<br />
For normal exping its fine and dandy. The endurance regens by the time you need to Incite/provoke again.<br />
<br />
But on a raid setting for the &quot;Oh shit&quot; moments you can come real close to being OOE(out of endurance)<br />
<br />
For instance, last night MT droped during boss fight:<br />
 I AE taunted, hit Furious, Incite and then Stonewall(as soon as furious expired).<br />
<br />
That chain ate away like 80% of my endurance.  If I had used an offensive discs prior to that, I would have lost Stonewall before its normal duration time. <br />
<br />
Is this bad? Not really when you consider we would have not been able to pull this off on the old system. But this situation would have been even worse if the opening system was active and I had been using endurance on the special attacks that are linked to openings. <br />
<br />
The last thing warriors need is not being able to use opening skills in fear of not having enough endurance when shit hits the fan :/<br />
<br />
*Add endurance regen spells/buffs.<br />
*Add endurance mods to melee gear.<br />
*if none of the above, then at least give us an ability to regen endurance faster when we decline using melee opening skills.(i.e an ability called Insight, which we would activate when an opening occurs. Allowing us to regen a small chunk of endurance.)<br />
<br />
 Adding a lvl 65 ability for the provoke line with more hate would be great. Right now Incite seems no different than an Anger 2 proc during a raid fest. More hate wont trivialize anything nor grant us aggro-lock while having a 30 second refresh timer. <br />
<br />
The hate on low mana cost spells that knights use for aggro MUST be fixed.  If this is not fixed, then give warriors more hate on the provoke line and lower the re-use time to 15 seconds. <br />
Taunt still fails too damn much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Not happy yet - I love the stuff so far but Im interested in the opening abilities and what they are going to do with the endurance pool and regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Did some testing tonight. I went from 100% to 0% endurance by doing: <br />

Defensive<br />
6 Incites total( these were done while defensive was up). <br />
<br />
Had 305 sta/305 str /298 dex/ 238 agi<br />
<br />
Thats too limited :/  It does not leave room at all for offensive disc or opening based skills.  So atm you have to stay away from offensive discs/Healing will/ Spirits of Rage if you plan of taking over MT during emergency with the Furious/Defensive combo.  <br />
<br />
Either we need a larger endurance pool, or endurance regen items/buffs. Do not forget opening skills will eat endurance too.</div></div><hr />

And, I thought Bellow was nice, until I realized the Paladin wasn't taunting. **sighs**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">i just like the idea that i can go furious and chase it with defensive. it makes for a powerful agro generation off the pull on named mobs and it allows the slower to get a slow in just before i start getting hit .. without me having to sacrifice defensive to accomplish that. so manna is saved and i get an extra one or two thousand damage in besides. again i like that when i accidentally get a big pull (say 4 or so in a exp group) i can go furious and lock agro on the whole thing get big damage in and ... still not have to give up defensive to do it. good deal.<br />

taunt still stinks. the difference is when my group member asks me if im having problems taunting i can say &quot;yes i just failed 5 in a row thank you&quot; and blame that instead of me.</div></div><hr />

Consider the fact of human nature: which is that 30% of the people are never completely satisfied by anything at anytime, and will find something to complain about even should they win the MegaBucks lottery...including the Bonus Ball.<br />
<br />
Based on these poll results, it would seem the changes were awesome enough to make inroads even in to that group, by a full third.<br />

Pretty impressive.</div></div><hr />
