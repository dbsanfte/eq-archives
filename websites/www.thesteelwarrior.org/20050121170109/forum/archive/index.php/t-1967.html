Hair tests are easier, require less care/sanitation, and are much tougher to trick.  Tell them to come into the 21st century.....and people call me an uncivilized barbarian.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you don't get wee wee on your hand!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hair tests are much more cost prohibitive than urine tests. Most companies dont want to shell out that kind of money on someone they may or may not even hire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did a piss test last week, they had my results in 7 minutes there on site at work.  They have new cups out that test for some crap or another when you fill it up, twist on the top and shake it.......set it down and results are in 7-10 minutes later.  Hair tests are not only more expensive but they take longer.  I work for a large resort that has a ton of employees, more are being hired every day.  And with them spending money every day of your training it costs $5,000 per employee before you ever see a day of work.  So, they want your test results the same day so they can put you to work quicker.  This is from the housekeepers in the hotels, to the people that sell cokes at the water park, to the dealers on the craps games to the waitresses in any of the 11 resturaunts.  That comes to a large expense for a very expensive industry.  Less they have in overhead, more they can pay me.</div></div><hr />

Not when our aim is off:)<br />

Hope you get the job!</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you hit the side and it swirls up accross the bottom and around the side and sprays all over your hand.<br />
<br />
Not that that's happened to me or anything..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is doing a urine test for drugs like a standard part of the job application process in the US ?<br />
<br />
Cos to me thats like ..... scary</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but if you work overnites like I do, employers realize that if they do drug tests they'll lose 90% of the workforce so they don't bother.  Not like it matters anyway.  Drink enough water and you can hide gold in there.</div></div><hr />

PC muscle =P<br />
<br />
Control and ye shall not splash =)<br />
<br />
I've done two drug tests this month in the job hunt, not a spilled/splashed drop.<br />
<br />
Men have it too easy for that =)  I respect a woman who can squat/hover over a toilet and mange to get any pee in the cup with out making a complete mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, just about any decent job in America requires a drug test before they hire you.  Most of them have a Random Drug Test policy, where they randomly select people out of the work force once a month or so and have them fill a cup.  Of course I worked for a company for 5 years and they randomly selected no one I'd ever met.  They said they did random checks, but never did.  Most places are like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also even if they don't have random testing, insurance makes them test you if you get hurt on the job. Fail the test and not only do they not pay the medical bills, but you get fired aswell.</div></div><hr />

Called a F.U.D.(maybe a second &quot;D&quot; also, not sure), fits in a purse.  Don't know where you would get one, but just remember some family members talking about it.</div></div><hr />
