That fool said bazaar knights are just as worse off as bazaar warriors.  Thats the most laughable statement I've heard in a while.  Bazaar warriors are worse off than time geared warriors.  Do I need to explain the value of being able to slow mobs before they even get off a single round?  How wizards will barely be able to out dps the bazaar warrior w/o getting aggro?<br />
<br />
His numbers are bullshit too.  We get 8% more ac?  what?  I can't use a shield.  God knows knights wear the same armor I do.<br />
<br />
We tank 15% better?  Do I need to quote the parse of RZ doing LESS dps to the knight due to us having to dual wield to aggro worth a shit?<br />
<br />
We aggro MORE than knights?  Why do my guild wizards say otherwise?  Why couldn't I taunt off my knight tanking CT without holding back, when I have darkblade + eoe (both anger 3ed) raex bp and 25 combat effects with a bard?</div></div><hr />

Opps, did I forget to mention that Tana uses a shield when not defensive vs. RZ...  So no the knight didn't take less damage b/c of dual wield, knew I left some tid bit out.</div></div><hr />

Reading Rant threads like that where everyone steps in and bashes a whole class as whiners etc makes me sick though. Shows what to think about these players as persons</div></div><hr />

1) Shadowknights as a community are shallow, self righteous, brainless, and extremely selfish - Of course, when has anything good ever come out of that forum or from an SK in general? Right, never.<br />

<br />
Between personal experience, and what I have read, i find its hard to find many situations where I can not do what a warrior does.  In fact, do it better in a lot of cases....  even in the cases where I might not perform as well, i dont perform much less better than.<br />
<br />
I guess i should add that I am in a time capable guild.. and most of my peers have time gear etc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I have only tanked one god in potime.. which is Cazic Thule.   Due to my fearless ability, being able to have just shy of 10k hit points, easily having over 2k ac with buffs, and my consistant agro, i am a pretty good choice for this.   Add in the fact that I dont even have to turn on attack the entire fight (no, not once) to keep agro and still get nice save my ass effects like divine intervention... its a pretty fun time.     <br />
<br />
Enough about raiding though...  I like to xp too...  I've always had it lucky in xp groups.   Finding a group as a tank role is easy for me.  Always has been....   My agro spells are many, and keeping hate off of any dps class is just a given.   Not to mention I have the taunt skill, which i'm pretty clever at utilizing.   It's great knowing that if i want to do an easy mission in LDoN all i need is a competant cleric and any 4 dps classes (gear is not a factor usually).  Even on hard missions, I never seem to find myself grouped with a warrior.....  why?    Inconsistant agro, 1khp, and a defensive disc never seemed to keep people from tkaing me over a warrior... anyway<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not always easy being a shadow knight, thats for sure.   to be good at it takes skill just like any class... but I definately have an easy job.. at least compared to warriors. <br />
<br />
<br />
That is really the part that irks me, I guess.   I am overpowered as a tank class imo, and I do love it... and it makes me wonder why we have warriors at all now?   <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe I have some more examples of this thought...<br />
<br />
<br />
During raid time, i seem to do a lot of work.   When we do any event where adds are a variable, I am there tanking adds (along with other sk/pal).    Sure, mezzable stuff a knight seems a logical choice for pre agro cc.. since we can do it with non dmg.   But even beyond that, my agro is reliable, so even when unmezzables come I am in there again.   using my way superior snap agro to control a mobs hate.  (yeah, rangers help out on stuff that can be snared/rooted)   Where is a warrior you might ask?    Doing what they can i'm sure...  just not much compared to what I can do.<br />
<br />
<br />
I read that since the introduction of LDoN, wars have had the amount of hate they can generate increased... due to anger procs.   and that, given a long enough time, war agro would exceed a knight.    This is probably true in a long enough fight.  Like a god or elem boss mob...    but this leaves out two equally important things...      <br />
<br />
One  being that not everything is a boss mob.    Time trials come to my mind... when I am in time trials, i tank and hold agro.. simply because warriors just cant keep it over nuke/melee dps.  half way thru the fight someone is getting summoned.. or the mob turns...    Sure, tell your casters to learn to watch agro better when a war is tanking.. but why have a war tank when i can hold agro 100% of the fight and never have someone get summoned from over damaging?       Same applies to trash clearing pretty much anywhere.     Where are you Warriors?<br />
<br />
<br />
And secondly, sure.. on a boss mob a warrior could eventually get enough agro to where I wouldnt be able to take it short of taunting probably...... but if you let me start getting agro first that same warrior will never see it short of using the same taunt.  I dont care how many procs you add to how many weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
okay, enough rambling<br />
<br />
I could go on and on about all the spells I get.. (like my neg 500 resist lifetap.. even necros dont get one that good), and all the focus effects I have access too.. (detremental and beneficial spell haste, DD focus, dot dmg focus, shielding, accuracy.. wow long list)......  <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure the things i've listed wont be enough to convince any other knight that warriors are getting fucked in the ass at the PoTime level... but just so yall know at least one SK knows:    <br />
<br />
<br />
I know i'm overpowered, and I like it. <br />

Stfu, ok? I'm well aware of my state of retarded overpoweredness even in this gimpy state with FT1 and 50 AA points. I would mop up any equally equipped warrior in record time versus Mobs/In groups, etc.. etc... etc.. <br />

What was your fucking point? You had none. You made another false statement, full of misinformation. I made a post in retort that you were full of shit. That not only does an SK at any level have it better than a warrior, they have it better than MOST classes.<br />

How about you get up off your ass and try and level up a warrior and tell me how it goes, ok sport? Until then, shut the fuck up. That was MY point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off my post wasn't addressed to Furor it was addressed to Arex, but I can see how that was unclear as it was directly below Furor's post.  <br />
<br />
Second off I said play a melee based hybrid... IE ranger or beastlord for a while and then come back and say SK is overpowered.  There really is no difference between a beastlord and SK tanking in most situations, you get more DPS and even fewer aggro issues out of the deal as well since the beastlord gets to handle the slows.  The beastlord is more useful when he doesn't happen to be tanking as well.  <br />
<br />
Warriors are underpowered, as I said in my post, retorting that SK's are overpowered because his does better than a warrior doesn't matter at all.  You need to compare SK to their backside competition which would be rangers, beastlords and to an extent monks.  These are the classes infringing on their role the same way knights do warriors now.  Throw enough gear on these classes and you make knights look useless just like knights make warriors look useless now(though I agree not quite as bad because of the aggro issues).  This exact same thing happened in Luclin as well, eventually itemization messes up to the point where any melee class can be MT if they can hold aggro, when that happens plate based tanks become obsolete, only its worse now since mana regen is so insane these days.  <br />
<br />
My entire point is, comparing something to a warrior which is obviously underpowered right now and saying because its more powerful its overpowered is looking at the problem the wrong way.  If all Sony does is make warriors as powerful as a knight you guys are still getting the short end of the stick.</div></div><hr />

LOL!<br />
<br />
Monks aren't your competition! Monks have it shitty like warriors do! And if you're feeling threated by a LEATHER-WEARING class compared to you PLATE-WEARING class, you should really get your head checked out.<br />

I also like how you advocate that beastlords should be nerfed before knights do. There's NOTHING wrong with beastlords. <br />

Monks have it shitty like warriors do!  Which is why i said to an extent they are competition, they are an inferiour tanking class that is capable of getting the job done and have in some rare cases more use outside of tanking.  I agree monks have it bad and need help but they are the backside competition for knights, they just are the one that happens to be worse off of the 3 I listed. <br />
<br />
Warriors should be the best tanks in the game.  When a knight can do a warriors job things are out of whack.  Knights should be the 2nd best tanks in the game, when a melee DPS based class can do their job, things are out of whack.  Right now a 3rd rate melee can be MT just fine in the majority of encounters... thats how broken things are.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also like how you advocate that beastlords should be nerfed before knights do. There's NOTHING wrong with beastlords. <br />
<br />
I never suggested Beastlords should be nerfed... but if you really think beastlords are balanced and knights are overpowered, well you've never seen a high end geared beastlord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I PLAYED a high-end beastlord.<br />
<br />
Second off I said play a melee based hybrid... IE ranger or beastlord for a while and then come back and say SK is overpowered. There really is no difference between a beastlord and SK tanking in most situations, you get more DPS and even fewer aggro issues out of the deal as well since the beastlord gets to handle the slows. The beastlord is more useful when he doesn't happen to be tanking as well.  <br />
<br />
Remember this? It wasn't too long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And how does that mean I think Beastlords should be nerfed?  Do I think at the top end of the game Beastlords are more powerful than Knights, hell yeah I do.  Doesn't mean I want the class nerfed.  I'd like to see them fix the tanking gaps, that most likely means nerfing every class except maybe warriors but there may be other ways to go about it. <br />
<br />
A warrior should noticably be a better tank than anyone else, when a paladin/SK steps in they should have to be using mana just to keep up with the warrior in the tanking department, that means they aren't doing much else and healing them should be a dicier preposition.  A group should be able to exp with the knights but should prefer the safety of a warrior in higher end exp zones.  Outside of tanking is where there mana should elevate them above a warrior.  A Beatlord or Ranger should only be tanking when the #$%@ hits the fan, they shouldn't be fill in tanks when you can't find a plate tank, they should be fill ins when your plate tank goes LD or dies and you should be worried about getting that plate tank asap when those situations do happen.  This is generally how the system works when a new expansion comes out but as time goes on things slip closer and closer to not even needing a plate tank around ever and PoP really messed up the warriors.  Thats just how I see it I guess, maybe you disagree.</div></div><hr />

Insert Ranger in for Beastlord and I feel the same.  The point is don't go from warrior to knight and say knight is overpowered without comparing the knights to the next step down the tanking rung.  The exact same thing from a pure tanking standpoint applies there, just warriors have their aggro issues to boot to make things even more bleak.</div></div><hr />

I know you're hinting at whole hybrid nerfing; do you really want to drag other people down with you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude I'm not hinting at anything.  Casters &gt; Melee based dps &gt; Tanks in power imo but I don't care about the caster side all that much.  If I had control of the game I'd nerf every class's survivability in the game except warriors.  Here is a balanced game imo from a tanking standpoint.<br />
<br />
1) Warrior - 10k hps, steadiest taunt but worst snap aggro(but SOME snap aggro unlike now).  Mitigation such that they take steady damage over time, you could set a watch to do your healing with a warrior tanking.<br />
<br />
2) Knights - 8k hps, snap aggro which is required to keep aggro.  Resisted spells would not cause aggro.  snap aggro would actually cost them significant mana to maintain.  This means as a caster you are never really sure how often you can cast, whereis with a warrior you could cast on a timer.  Mitigation such that they could main tank exp mobs but their dmg curve would have more ups and downs.  Could easily keep them up with CH but you have to pay attention while healing them.  Knights would have significant ability to save another party member who caught aggro, either through snap aggro or spells<br />
<br />
3) Melee DPS classes including hybrids- 6k hps, strong aggro generation which they actually have to pay some attention to to control if they go into all out DPS mode.  Probably can't always use CH to keep them healed.  Realistically require 2 healers to spam smaller heals on them to keep them up against a real exp mob, meaning you do not want them as MT.  These classes are mostly DPS with some added utility.<br />
<br />
4) Healers - tanking ability like #3.<br />
<br />
5) Casters - 4k hps.  Go splat in 2 rounds unless they use their own avoidance abilities such as root etc very quickly or someone saves them with an ability or aggro.  You do not want aggro ever as a caster.<br />
<br />
This leaves you with groups that might actually want a warrior AND a knight, in addition to the healer and DPS classes instead of the more standard knight, healer, slower, dps, dps, dps group of today.<br />
<br />
Then again I'd also nerf most buffs to be always on group only and fade if casters leave the group.  Have MGB make them AE for raids so you space out buff classes to cover everyone.  Woudl nerf slow hardcore.  My changes would not be popular with most but would make the game fun again imo.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the hollow, balogna LIP SERVICE ...<br />
<br />
BUT ... as a monk, I see through your B.S.<br />
<br />
You don't think monks need help.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because everytime someone suggests an IDEA for getting monks help ... like ideas to pull better, tank better or do better DPS ...<br />
<br />
Someone like you, who doesn't advocate nerfs, and who thinks how monks have it bad and really need help, comes by to say how OVERPOWERING an idea that is or how that idea would NERF your class.<br />
<br />
If monks NEED HELP ... and then GOT HELP ... then wouldn't this class, which you feel is nipping on your HEELS, suddenly NOT be nipping on your heels?<br />
<br />
And thus need to be nerfed again?<br />
<br />
Right. Monks need help ... but not too much help! <br />
<br />
Howbout, innate 200 sense heading! Yeah, that'll fix monks!<br />
<br />
It's the same logic being applied to warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors need help.<br />
<br />
BUT ... not actual help that could ... you know ... HELP the class.<br />
<br />
Nooooo ... that'd INFRINGE on hybrid melee superiority.<br />

<br />
I admit, my main is a cleric. But i can still see what is going on. <br />
It doesn't help to nerf anyone, that just upsets people. It always does and always will. What is the better solution is to improve on warriors and monks, so they again become very useful.<br />
<br />
What i have seen so far is that the warrior has become obsolete. SK and Pallies are great, and i wouldn't nerf them for the world. They are great and can fill out alot of roles. And as of this moment they are more wanted in xp groups. True warriors are still most wanted in raids, but where is the fun in that? and now it has just been proven that even a pally can do his job on raids? what is a warriors second job? And they are not ever preferred in xp groups.... i would say that kind of sucks if you are not in a raiding guild...<br />
<br />
One solution to the warrior problems in my oppinion, would be to improve alot the warrior damage, and redefine his role, not as much at MT but high end damage dealer on par with wizards.</div></div><hr />

- Nerf knight is not solution IMO : knights are great as they are, because as all other classes in EQ, they were IMPROVED. as all other classes except pure melees.<br />
- Improve warrior HP, AC is not a solution, because il will not change a thing and will just trivialise even more the tanking game...<br />
<br />
<br />
The solutions left :<br />
<br />
Give warrior an innate visible mitigation advantage like a permanent shielding.<br />
<br />
Increase warriors abilities, or add new ones.<br />
<br />
Change discipline system. either unhook them, or make the other disciplines useful with a short reuse time.<br />
<br />
The most important : Find a way for warriors to have RELIABLE aggro generation. Not more, but reliable. Actually warriors have :<br />
- RNG procs.<br />
- RNG sucess taunt (60%).<br />
<br />
of course only 1 of those will not do. I am convinced warriors need a large lateral UPGRADE with some &quot;war only&quot; stuff added. the Brainstorm post sticked in the war house have some very good ideas.</div></div><hr />

Knight tank too good compared to a warrior.<br />

Warriors are doing ok compared to environment (if you ignore the aggro generation bit) so upgradeing warriors isn't possible without gimping the environment. The only possible way to keep a resemblance of balance vs enviroment is to nerf knight tankability.<br />

The biggest gripe is the itemization that's fubared. <br />

SKs were useless back then, to the point where I was replaced as tank in my normal group by a monk and I was dealing less damage than anyone but the cleric.  Nerfing SKs back to that point is absurd.<br />
<br />
Here is how I would attempt to fix the current situation:<br />
<br />
First, increase warrior agro so that they are viable exp tanks.  SKs should still get slightly better agro abilities but warriors shouldn't have trouble holding agro over wizards, monks, etc.<br />
<br />
Second, nerf knight mitigation at the very high end.  This needs to be balanced so that knights can still tank well in exp groups but so warriors have a significant advantage over raid level mobs.<br />
<br />
I feel that it is unfair for SKs to take over the warrior roll on raids.  However, I also think that it is ridiculous for warriors to suggest any changes to SKs that make them useless in the normal exp group.<br />
<br />
I just hope that the displays that are being put on by Arch Overseers and the antics that I'm sure Furor has planned when his baby SK gets a bit bigger lead to real balance for tank classes, not to warriors simply being the best in all situations like they were during Kunark.<br />
<br />
Are SKs currently overpowered compared to warriors?  Yes.  But come up with a fix everyone likes, not just the warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know how everytime a monk says that they want to tank better, a warrior or three will step up and say that monks already tank good enough and that to increase their tankability would inadvertently nerf warriors?<br />
<br />
The same applies to making warriors viable DPS on par with wizards.<br />
<br />

<br />
PoP was the expansion that saved casters.  Kunark (to a large extent), Velious, and SoL (cringe) were horrific for casters.  High end SoL got a little better, but melee were the gods then.  People fail to take you guys seriously because you do not ever present a reasonble outlook on anything.<br />
<br />
There was plenty of potential to do for melee what was done for casters in pop, but they failed to do so at the outset and that made implementing them harder.  To fix the three pure melees, you *have* to go back and fix content afterwards, there is no way to do so without doing that (Is it going to be fun, when you nerf the tools you've relied on to get you through PoP, to still fight there?).  Casters just got the same spells they always did, but better versions, for the most part.  Melee could easily have gotten new, better versions of their old discs from 61-65.  Increasing the stat caps could have helped with balance aswell (by limiting who could do the increasing) , but it didn't.<br />
<br />
The problem some of you are missing , though, is that while you, perhaps, only advocation nerfing paladins, the train of your logic will become evident when the other two pure melee need fixing.  If nerfing is the approach for paladins/shadowknights, it will have to be for casters aswell.  This will make PoP fights much harder and will not really benifit you at all in the end.  Either those fights will become unwinnable or the entire expansion will have to be retuned to be easier.  You are looking at a huge reworking of PoP regardless of which approach you take.  In my opinion, it is simply easier to bring Warriors, Rogues, and Monks in line with caster types and upgrade content then it is to nerf EVERY other class and then nerf all the content along with it.  If I were a warrior, I'd rather get something then have someone else lose something.  <br />
<br />
There should be some happy medium that we can come to.  Extremists from both groups are useless.  There are many ways that both warriors and knights can get what they want, so long as they both do not want *everything*.  Balance is give and take.  Knights may have gotten to take more then their share, but if you really want balance, you cannot advocate some of the things you are.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
You can't be serious. SoL was one gigantic melee nerf, and a huge caster upgrade. KEI made its appearance here, along with focus effects -- all hugely important to casters. Luclin mobs in general were notoriously difficult to hit with those in the key zone Ssra being expecially bad (my dps is reduced probably 50% in Ssra). In fact, melees were unable even to hit the Emp without hours and hours in the Ssra mines camping ores (and then having to train blacksmithing up to 175 just to make their no drop weapons). Many people nowadays barely bother doing that, since it's possible to kill emp without any melee dps at all. <br />
<br />
Moreover, many of the zones were very well suited for caster soloing (ME and UP at least, where, by the way, druids for example can solo farm very excellent class armor), or caster grouping (AE groups before various nerfs). Luclin also introduced new sets of spells for all casters, to use with all that new mana regen and those focus effects. <br />
<br />
What did melee get? Nothing.<br />
<br />
Any idea that Luclin was anything other than a huge bone to casters and a pretty big hit to melees has history turned upside down.</div></div><hr />

What you basically want is a complete item overhaul, coupled with warrior special abilities, and tradeoffs for gaining insane amounts of aggro in lessening tanking abilities.<br />

What I answered with is &quot;Here ya go, FF X1&quot;<br />

Sarcasm or not, it's said enough that I'm sure there are people besides me taking it seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />
First - You're level 57. You're still in kunark bud.<br />
<br />
Second - Even if by some twist of fate you've been playing since pre-kunark and have only managed to get to level 57, what level were you in kunark? 12? 13? Please.<br />
<br />
<br />
My SK isn't my &quot;main&quot;, he's just the character I'm most interested in playing right now.<br />
<br />
I was level 52 in Kunark, I stopped playing my SK and rolled a rogue because the SK class was so bad off.  Now I play my SK almost all the time and purposely keep him at 57 because I want to be the main tank in LDoN groups and know that I'm not supposed to be tanking on raids.  I'll probably level him to 59 when he has all of the 55 AAs but my goal with my SK is to own LDoN.<br />
<br />

<br />
Warriors are due for ability upgrades, such as new discs, AAs, and possibly other innate combat skills.  These won't be &quot;spells&quot; per se but they should add utility.  But don't say SKs shouldn't be viable tanks; SKs are tank first, caster second.</div></div><hr />

Let me clarify...<br />
<br />
Right now, I spend almost all of my time in LDoN.  I like the fact that I can play for a set amount of time with a single group of RL friends and not worry about all the BS that comes with raiding.<br />
<br />
Rather than trying to be the biggest I can be compared to people who are raiding, I am trying to become as big as I can at My current level.  I want to win as much as possible on the hard setting.  Therefore, I am staying at 57 (the top of the current LDoN level bracket I am fighting in) and getting all of my AAs and the best gear I can find at this level (without raiding).  When I max that stuff out, I'll level to 59 and start again.<br />
<br />
I know none of this is particularly important to the current thread, I only posted it in response to the guy who thought I was lying about playing my SK in Kunark.</div></div><hr />

Knight tank too good compared to a warrior.<br />
<br />
Warriors are doing ok compared to environment (if you ignore the aggro generation bit) so upgradeing warriors isn't possible without gimping the environment. The only possible way to keep a resemblance of balance vs enviroment is to nerf knight tankability.<br />
<br />
No this doesn't work, you are missing the big picture.  All classes except maybe warriors tank too well vs the environment.  If all you do is nerf knights you just put them where warriors are now.  They would be worse tanks than melee dps hybrids and do less dmg, how do they get groups then?  They either need to pull warriors up or nerf everyone's tanking except warriors down.  You can't just target knights because they aren't the entire problem.</div></div><hr />

You have GOT to be kidding me... Flowing Thought, Focus Effects, Horses ALL came into the game in Velious and Luclin... and they did far, FAR more for casters than those 5 levels of spells in PoP ever did. Not to mention the TEN new levels of spells that came into the game in Kunark. KEI and Aego have only been replaceable with the new level 65 spells in PoP, but they were DAMN powerful compared to the level 50 spells... look for yourself. You're talking about us presenting a reasonable outlook on anything, look to yourself first.</div></div><hr />

This is true to an extent.  The only real fix to the problems right now would be a complete overhaul to the combat system.  If knights are nerfed and cannot get the job done, then rangers and maybe even BST's can step in and offer agro lock and reasonable tanking(and I have seen some clerics tank in exp groups, just to have fun).  I truly think the first thing that needs to be done is address mitigation for all  classes, and either tweek mitigation or mob DPS to make warriors significantly better able to take damage than knights, who take damage significantly better than rangers, who take damage significantly better than BST's, etc.</div></div><hr />

I'm making an assumption based on his post's title: &quot;something like this?&quot;.  He was proposing a model of a fixed defensive combat table for discussion's sake.  And it's a reasonable model, although IMO slightly flawed.  How flawed depends on how one imagines EQ should be I s'pose.</div></div><hr />

You know, I don't even care about how classes were balanced during Kunark anymore but I does bug the hell out of me that you all think I'm lying about having played a SK during Kunark.  How the hell do you know when I started playing?<br />
<br />
If you want a detailed history of my time playing EQ, I played a barbarian warrior during the original EQ.  When Kunark came out, I started an Iksar SK on the first damn day I had the expansion because I thought the Iksar race was cool.  I don't know if it was the first day the expansion was out but it was during that first week or two when the servers were up and down with a billion patches because they screwed the release up so bad.  I really liked my SK at lower levels but when I hit level 52 and saw myself getting owned by Wurms and Scoraie Hornets in burning woods while the friggin' monk in my group tanked them easily, I rolled up a Rogue.<br />
<br />
I have always said in my posts that warriors are due for an upgrade.  I can understand what it feels like to be underpowered because I WAS THERE ONCE.  But significant knight nerfs is not the way to get what you want.  Neither is calling me a liar for no reason at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is a lie.  <br />
<br />
During Kunark, the all/all gear you see today didn't exist.  SKs couldn't get the massive hp they can get today.  Not only that, I was an Iksar and couldn't wear Blood Ember so I couldn't even get respectable AC.  The Iksar AC bonus helped some but it didn't make up for wearing crap armor.  And no one killed the mobs that dropped Iksar armor when the planes came out.<br />
<br />
In my group, the monk had a T-staff, 28/30.  I had a Noctivigant Blade, 18/26.  I was outdamaged to the point where I was lucky to hold agro even when chain casting.  And the only spell I could chain cast was my level 9 disease cloud because all my other spells wiped out my mana pool if I cast them more than 3 times without taking a med break.<br />
<br />
SKs didn't have nukes back then.  Lifetaps and DoTs were all underpowered, producing so little damage they weren't worth using in a group.  We didn't have the group buffing taps.  If a group could find a warrior to tank, they took the warrior, and the SK was left lfg because his dps wasn't good enough to be a dps class.<br />
<br />
Warriors are bad off today and need an update but don't whine like you're the only damn class to ever be underpowered.  Just state what's wrong over and over until SOE gets the hint and updates you like they did everyone else in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were several others from Velious; the necklace from the 10th ring war, a couple of Tunare drops, the 7th shawl (of course) and one of the Doze quests.  Nevertheless, I don't think the existence of a FT cap was known in Velious; it was unachievable at the time.<br />

Eh?<br />
<br />
Pure melee were absolute gods in Velious.  It was all about sticking one big fat warrior backed up by 4+ clerics in front of the monster, and then the rest of the encounter came down to how many monks and rogues were behind it.  Pure melee were to Velious what casters are to PoP.<br />
<br />
Luclin... it hurts me to say anything good about that expansion, but Luclin DID help the caster/melee balance a good deal.<br />
<br />
As for only casters soloing, I've seen rangers, bards, and even SK's soloing just fine in PoP.<br />
<br />
Monks and paladins have effectively lost the ability to solo.  Warriors and rogues didn't really have that ability to lose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't the shawl have at least have FT on it back then? Or was that added to it when the shawl was boosted up later? I honestly don't remember.<br />
<br />
And did Sal'Varae's Robe of Darkness get FT added to it later? I know a lot of Velious items have been tweaked since Velious.</div></div><hr />

It's not like we couldn't kill Wurms, its just that I was supposed to be a tank class yet I ended up being a mana sink for the healers anytime I tanked them.  The monk in our group, on the other hand, took far less damage while tanking them.</div></div><hr />

And there's the problem. My son knew SK's aren't supposed to Tank like a Warrior. It's all about NOT tanking like a Warrior and tanking like an SK. Don't get hit. Let the Warrior get hit - It's why he exists in the Game!!!! Make it run away slowly, DoT it, let your pet hit it, sit, med.<br />
<br />
He told me I was the best pet an SK ever had. How is it possible to play this game and not know your role????<br />

The roll you just described is the roll of a necromancer.  SKs are part necromancer but they're also part warrior.  That means that part of their roll is to be like a warrior and take hits....not as well as a warrior but certainly better than leather and cloth classes.</div></div><hr />

At level 56 - He, I, and a Cleric beat 12-15 mobs at CT's Temple as the sole survivors of a raid. He played the heck out of his  Shadow Knight and we won. Thank goodness he didn't try to play it as if it was a Warrior.<br />
<br />
A part of your skill set is the ability to tank. This does not necessarly mean that you should be The Tank in a raid or in a group. My son would've let the Monk tank in a heartbeat - then again he knew what his class was all about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your CT example is one insolated case where tanking didn't make sense.  It does not apply to normal experience groups.  Try going to a normal pick up group zone during Kunark (say DL or KC) and convince them to fear kite for exp.  You won't find many takers.<br />
<br />
You say your son would have let the monk tank.  You know what?  I did let the monk tank.  A cloth wearing class as MT over a plate class by itself is a hint that something was wrong.<br />
<br />
The group didn't want to fear kite because it was horribly inefficient.  Chasing runners lowered DoT spell damage and melee damage anytime one of the melee characters got out of range.  Plus the casters either had to stop medding and chase or the group would end up out of casting range (not every time, but often enough to be a problem).  We found that it took twice as long to kill anything when fear kiting.<br />
<br />
SK melee damage was lousy back then.  That was before the 2hs damage bonus and the 1hs weapons that were available simply weren't very good.  So while I could contribue dps, it was miserable compared to most other classes in our group.<br />
<br />
Your son might be the bomb-friggin-diggity when you are willing to run the group around his abilities.  The fact is though that in most groups, especially pick up groups, people are going to insist that a normal tanking method be used.  During the kunark era, SKs were weak as tanks and just as weak as a supplemental dps class.  If you spent any time at all /lfg in DL or KC during kunark, you would know that SKs were one of the last classes anyone wanted for a group.</div></div><hr />

Good lord, I don't know how I got caught up in this discussion in the first place.  Every post I've made on this thread other than the first one was about SKs during the Kunark era and was a direct response to something someone else said.  Now I'm getting flamed for discussing my opinions on the state of my class three years ago.<br />
<br />
In today's EQ world, I use my SK as the main tank for a group primarily focused on LDoN.  I brought my SK out of retirement because we wanted a tank who could generate massive aggro so that our dps classes could really unload, making us more efficient at winning LDoN missions.  Since aggro is what the SK class was revamped around over the last couple years, I would say that I use my class EXACTLY the way it is supposed to be used.  My group has won every one of our last 30 adventures except one collections mission where we didn't get any drops from the last 12 mobs we killed and we got the last drop we needed 2 minutes after time expired.  Given that much of our strategy revolves around my SK, I would hardly say I'm &quot;worthless&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the flame though, it's nice to know someone is paying attention.</div></div><hr />

??!! Owned by Wurms. You've got to be kidding. There's a burned out spot that nothing paths in. My son (52 SK at the time) and I (then 52 Warrior) used to fear kite those Wurms continuously. It was the easiest early 50 experiance in the game.<br />
<br />
I used a J-Stick (tash), Silken Whip (snare), and Polished Obsidean Great Axe (Instill Fear) and ToD (slow) to be a perfect fit with his fear kiting. With my Paladin parked there to ocassionaly log in and heal him it was soooooo a no brainer.<br />
<br />
4 hours a night for a month with about 6 deaths and very little down time.<br />

<br />
Yea, Tunare had some nice FT stuff.  But as you mentioned, she was considered unkillable for most of velious, and only died for the first time a few weeks before Luclin came out as I recall.  Vulak's robe also had FT3 and I think the 7th shawl (FT1) was in before Luclin at least. <br />
<br />
Point is though that FT was rare enough that it wasn't an issue.  By the end of velious only the most uber casters had more than 2 or 3 flowing thought and nobody hit the cap, or even came close.</div></div><hr />

I never mem fear when I'm tanking.  I use Voice of Death and Terror of Shadows regularly, both of which are &quot;specficially crafted&quot; to generate agro.  I also use Spear of Plague on pretty much every single pull, which generates only dps based agro.  Here is my normal spell lineup for tanking:<br />
<br />
Mental Corruption<br />
Torrent of Hate<br />
Voice of Death<br />
Terror of Shadows<br />
Spear of Plague<br />
Clinging Darkness<br />
Banshee Aura<br />
Feign Death<br />
<br />
I use darkness because I am in charge of snaring for my group as we don't have a druid or ranger.  All the rest of my spells are geared towards tanking.  I don't see why anyone should have a problem with how I use my spells.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone cares how you use your spells. Be thankful you have the option. I think that's the point. Additionally, as you'll notice, the other SK posting in this thread uses Fear religiously, and has gone so far as to foolishly ask for an upgraded Fear that works past level 55. <br />
<br />
Two things, 1) As has been pointed out it is a level 15 spell being used inappropriately, namely because it generates massive aggro for 40 mana; and 2) There is a reason you don't have a working level 55+ fear, the game is gimped enough without adding in new imbalances. Now whether or not you'll realize that Terror is completely worthless except for a few encounters and situations is irrelevant, it's a waste of a spell slot at the moment with the other OPTIONS available to a Shadowknight. Your own inefficiency means very little to me. It's a choice you make. Which is the second point, Warriors don't have that choice - they have no choices period.</div></div><hr />

I listed my spells in response to a post that questioned whether I was using spells that were &quot;specifically crafted&quot; for agro and I am.<br />
<br />
I agree about fear being an inappropriate agro spell.  I don't use it and don't care about it at all (other than using it for fear kiting, as it was intended).  SKs have plenty of agro options without using some stupid exploit.<br />
<br />
I've already stated that I only use Terror situationally in another discussion with you.  It's a fast cast way to pull mobs off the casters in my group when my other spells aren't available and taunt fails or when I don't have enough mana to cast a spear.  You obviously don't agree with me on this and never will so it's not worth discussing further.<br />
<br />
Warriors should get more options.  New skills, new AA, new discs, whatever.  I think most SKs agree with you on that point.</div></div><hr />

However, because I'm usually willing to take advice, I'll try things your way. Anything that results in more mob corpses and less Arathena corpses is a positive thing. <br />
<br />
However, and I expect I may be being blind, I don't see the major issues that you're seeing with a functional high level fear, especially if it's high mana cost. Outside of soloing, which I'll grant, I can see many here not liking, the primary use in a group is analogue to mez or root, with some very ugly risks attached, especially with the lovely 'Your target is immune to changes in its movement speed' flag.</div></div><hr />

oh yeah, Agro kiting is actually better, as you can control the way the mob moves..<br />
