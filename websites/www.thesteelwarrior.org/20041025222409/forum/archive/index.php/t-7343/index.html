<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Logged in for Vex Thall clearing and we are having to circle mobs out in the middle of halls.  Mobs go right through walls, corner tanking is impossible.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having problems, or is it a symptom of something in Vex Thall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilrik77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did RZTW tonight were clearing mobs before Fake RZ and me and the ST got ported to ZI mob got pushed in the wall and we got ported. <br />
Pulled RZTW to the corner in the pit pets went in early and walled him no one could hit him when i tryed to pull him out got ported to ZI again then to Kedge right on top of Phinny same thing happend to ST too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep same thing on Mith Marr too, got ported to ZI and couldnt hit anything if it was touching a wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ssra was hellish tonight, we did Cursed cycle and Emperor, mobs being pushed completely through walls into the next area/room.  Twice tanks were dragged into the walls with the mob then fell to basement (once on first level, once on Blood).  We had to tank everything standing away from walls.  Multiple trash mobs were shoved into walls and then became untargetable in the narrow corridors. <br />
<br />
You can see through walls again as well.<br />
<br />
new filtering stuff is broken all over the place, people and NPCs *still* show up halfway in the ground, and the PoK freeze-up crashes were happening in Luclin tonight as well, plus I've never seen so many mass LDs in one evening, and several times folks got sever wide &quot;quick freeze&quot; lags lasting up to 2 seconds then everything went back to quote normal unquote. <br />
<br />
Grats, SoE, you're driving folks away in droves. . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killed RZ last night pre-patch no problems, wiped on grummus today cause he summoned everyone into the walls. Thanks SoE, awesome patch  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">None of the Fire minis were cornerable tonight.  Hell, I could actually corner Babnoxis and Blazzax against the castle walls at the bird prep on Tuesday night, but they waltz right through to the other side now.  Oh yeah, I also have problems running up stairs now.  Doesn't anyone ever TEST this horseshit?<br />
<br />
Improved fucking collision detection system my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe yeah, we had to CR after pushing a boss into a wall in qvic; it warped(not to bind spot even) and brought a lot of friends.<br />
<br />
Amazing how their &quot;fixes&quot; actually make things worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It took less than an hour of playing to experience these problems. I have to wonder if and how SOE tests stuff before they push it to the live servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ever since the initial dx9 patch we've pretty much taken the approach of keeping everything out of corners. I'm glad we didn't decide to test out any corners after the patch yesterday. We did have a cleric drop under world for 20k in Qvic out of the blue, and it was easy to tell that collision is just as bad as it was on the initial dx9 patch day... I mean I only got stuck on the hillside about 35 times running from the wayfarer camp to Kod`Taz stone, and climbing stairs in every zone was completely funky. You'd think that, sooner or later, they'd realize pushing shit live that they're fully aware is broken might just be a bad idea, and stop doing it. You'd think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ever since Dx9 was implemented Vt has been a real problem. My guild is no longer raiding there until something gets fixed, so probably never. We have petitioned and also Bugged it numerous times, so they definatly know about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did a tak and ef ldon last night...in both cases mobs disappeared into the walls...it definitely seems worse since the last patch.  I never had the &quot;disappear into the wall&quot; problem before last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>IgneousKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since no one has mentioned it yet, yes PoTime is also fubared after the patch. Cannot wall or corner.<br />
<br />
Rallos freefight in the open, fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valdir Omnicide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ran in to the same type of problems in GoD. Trash mob pushed into wall at ZI in Ferubi (grats us) resulted in mob being out of range. Best of all it led to autopulled aggro mobs all the way thru the zone to Smith Rondo. Smith Apprentice in Rondo event pushed into the wall led to tank being tl'd to the zone in. Yay Sony!<br />
<br />
Players are leaving the game in large numbers, Sony realizes they have a problem and push back release of OoW to &quot;address&quot; players concerns, then in an apparent total loss of sanity release yet another buggy patch. Mind boggling to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raramooga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PoTime phase 4 was a complete mess after this patch.  Saryrn got walled and summoned players either into the wall or under the world where they got promptly ported to GY.  TZ was basically impossible.<br />
<br />
It's really awesome when a lack of quality control and testing results in people wasting a night of their time.  Who gives a sh*t as long as Soney is getting their $$$!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">someone needs to be shot because of this patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Amazing how their &quot;fixes&quot; actually make things worse. <br />
<br />
Incompetence and mediocrity have become the one consistent staple of any new SoE patch.<br />
<br />
I hope in smedley's new &quot;round table&quot; he includes someone from Steel warr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Supernatural Guardian fell into teir 5.  We waited an hour and a half for a GM to show up.  He never did, but later told us there was nothing he could have done anyway. (Probably got stuck with that massive tutorial patch).  Redid 1 and 3, tried to wall Saryrn in tier 4.  She summoned the MA into the wall where he was ported to GY, same with SA and TA.  SA ran back and tanked her in the open.<br />
<br />
We walked Tallon Zek in circles, heh that was kinda messy but he died.<br />
<br />
Won't even bother cornering anything anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I hate you sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh we did AoW yesterday.... that non-cornering was total bs hehe. I think I said &quot; TURNING &quot; atleast 5 times.<br />
<br />
also got Seru kept getting stuck in the wall and nobody could damage (was bad enough only a few people had bane weaps) so we waste mana/time as he gets stuck in the wall and everything from outside came in to aggro.... killed those and he finally popped back in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did cursed aswell. Kicker wasn't being able to cornertank because I knew I wouldn't be able to due to earlier situations. but we had glyphed and runed up at the same time...split the two, killed glyphed, runed was still up... killed exiled, runed was still up.... killed cursed, runed was still up. So we killed runed, Banished spawned, killed banished and cursed spawned~ yay 6 drops in an hour and a half or so!    circle of smokex2, chain bp, leather bp, crystalized serpent eye and cloak of mourning.<br />

<br />
<br />
Why do they change things that aren't fuckin broken.... (like collision/corner-tanking)<br />
<br />
<br />
   Well enough bragging and bitching from me. Hopefully they fix this collision shit soon so I dont have to tank anymore mobs in the middle of rooms where people get to snag ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">if you got 2 curseds in one day you forfeit your freedom to complain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">someone needs to be shot because of this patch<br />
<br />
Actually, someone should get fired because of this patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, someone should get fired because of this patch.<br />
<br />
it's not so bad, just can't corner anything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow real odd, another cursed today - circle - monk/bst claws - caster pants...<br />
<br />
Oh and there was no cornertanking once again /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I saw a new .DLL file was downloaded patching tonight (5/27)  I haven't tanked anything yet as I just logged on.  Heading to Mith Marr and wondering how cornering / walling is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lilrik77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Did RZ again tonight 05/27 same thing again tryed to Pin him got Ported to the zone in then back to Kedge. Fake RZ was fine he went in the wall a few times pulled him back out and got back in the corner never got ported to ZI. Real RZ had his arm in the wall in the pit and no one could hit when i went to pull him out he booted me to zone in then to Kedge. They need to fix this we need BoW's!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The biggest problems seem to be with multi-floored zones.  When something ducks in the wall it seems to aggro everything over / under it.  This means places like Vex Thal are a special brand of infuriating.<br />
<br />
I agree with everyone here.  This patch is awful and its insulting that it wasnt rolled back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I ended up in the wall on one of the ramps in PoAir tonight when Pherlondien summoned me there.  Nobody could cast on me or hit me, /dueled pets could hit me but not move me, I could not stand up to cast my gate necklace or anything else.  Rewind was useless.  I went to the stuck channel and they moved me to East Commonlands.  Great.  Needless to say, when we finally got to the Avatar, we kept him in the middle of the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">In Vex Thal tonight it was all choas.. no walling no, no cornering or anything like that.. when a trash mob got pushed in.. he would repop out but with 10 of his buddies.. was soo crazy, on one account i was ported to some place right after we killed a Name.. and then i got my asshanded to me. I must say Sony is really makeing it easier for players to move to WoW or some other up and comeing game. MAYBE if they work on the bugs they might keep their subscribers... just maybe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wow real odd, another cursed today - circle - monk/bst claws - caster pants...<br />
<br />
Oh and there was no cornertanking once again /sigh<br />
<br />
Who cares what dropped =P. We want the damn collisions fixed.<br />
<br />
I think this has to do with client/server being on the same page as to where a mob is and where the walls are, and SoE fubaring it. However I could be wrong. Hopefully it is patched by tommorow.<br />
Our guild normally makes it to quarm in one night, tonight we got cockblocked at VZ, due partly to wall crap. In some situations, this can severely limit your DPS options. I dont really want to think of doing RZ, Inny, or really any other time mob with this in place. Thanks SoE, more impressive every day.<br />
&quot;Collision improvements&quot; my arse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My guild had was doing the wind ring in PoA last night, so we trigger the event etc etc, go to pull wind, get's stuck in the wall and disappears. This was about 33 mins after he spawned so I know it wasn't a time issue. He didn't warp anywhere either, he totally despawned, really burnt our asses on that one.</div></div><hr />
