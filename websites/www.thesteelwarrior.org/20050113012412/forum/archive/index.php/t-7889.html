<br />
If i sold Windblade i could probally get a WMBS and i'd be wielding a Split blade+ Copper hammer of striking whats your advice?<br />
Epics or Split Blade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tribute</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't buy a SBoD!  See the many threads on the over-priced PoS.  Keep the Droga Combo.  Sell the Windblade and pick up a WMBS, also a GSoT for when you hit 55.  You should have enough money left over to  pick up some Horn Spiked Shoulders.  Or you could check out the Strength of the Elements quest.  Link to those are in my profile.  Don't waste your cash on a SBoD.</div></div><hr />

If you have the cash for that, look around for a BoC (Blade of Carnage). I would also not bother with an Anger 2 augment and save for Anger 3. I know you want to have it NOW but it's worth the wait for more aggro and you will not regret having waited.<br />

<br />
The ONLY reason to own an SBoD, that i can even imagine, is that you rikee teh ubah graffic... In which case, you may want to keep that a secret. :)<br />
<br />
Now, if SBoD had a built-in yak or stun proc...sure. Hell yes. Otherwise it's just pretty and not much use - rather like a supermodel.<br />
<br />
Stick with a Droga combo or a BoC/BBoTE (not sure how much PP you aquired)... Aug's are always a good idea (if they're anger 3 or Yak, in that order.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wouldnt be 1100 hate, the 2 procs don't go off at the same time it would be a proc for 600 hate and a proc for 500. I'll also go ahead and agree with everyone that the droga combo is better than SBoD and better than epic.</div></div><hr />

A CHoS and a Red Blade could be a good combo.<br />
Btw, adding an Anger III doesnt mean the proc becomes 1100 hate, it's just two separate procs :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I got one loooong ago I gave it back to the guild soon after I discovered how it looked, never mind how terrible the aggro was.<br />
<br />
And really, using a recommended lvl 60 weapon at level 52 is just nuts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats to like about the weapon?<br />
No aggro and not really DPS if you have a decent 2 hander.<br />
<br />
Why would a warrior use it when there be 500PP weapons that destroy it in aggro?<br />
<br />
Its not that I hate the weapon, but what use would I have for it?<br />
<br />
Looks like you spent a lot of money...<br />
For a down grade.<br />
<br />
You could have got a Yak aug.<br />
Why did you go Anger II!?<br />
<br />
I really dont understand your logic.<br />
It almost appears like you want to spend as much money as possible to lower your aggro.<br />
<br />
EDIT: *Blinks*<br />
Just looked at your Magelo.<br />
Is you warrior really wearing FH armor while being agnostic?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i had to spend or trade i would prefer this http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=63185 atleast it can be used for dps.</div></div><hr />

I guess its what ever suits me lol Sk's can no longer take Agro off me with Split+ Combo combo where they could with sword of bloodsworn/copper</div></div><hr />

and a SotBS is twice as good once you got an agro aug stuck on it.  fancy Ratio and DPS wont make a mob hate you the way Procs will and 2 procs are better than one.<br />
<br />
Its your plat and time and as long as you are happy then thats cool, just don't expect the community to congratulate you on your decision after you asked for advise and then did the opposite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, agro based on DPS or fancy ratios alone is nowhere better than a lil worse ratio but a good stun proc (or raw hate, or debuff, or...). SBoD has maybe some sorta good stats, sure, CHoS has almost the same amount of HP, 14 / 19 might be a good ratio, true, but 12/ 19 + (75DD+65/0 Stun) is much better, because it's the stun that will snap the mob on you, rogues have better ratio weapons that deal much more damage than a 14/19 weilded by a warrior, so it's a waste of time to try to use a fancy ratio in hopes for DPS agro. There was a reason of why Weapon Affinity was introduced in GoD, because warrior agro is based on procs. On a side note, I think SBoD graphic is ugly as hell :p<br />
If you got it with your main, I would sell it to some poor soul that thinks its a good agro weapon and buy you new upgrades for armor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daylenia Soulstar</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">welll the question i auctally asked was epic or SBoD? i got told both where crap so i went with the less time consuming one and because i felt the SBoD was good<br />
<br />
I personally like the  graphic on SBoD also you say i should sell the SBoD so if i do sell it should i get wind-worn blade instead or what <br />
<br />
Still i'm happy with my SBoD and i don't get Agro stolen from me unless i want it <br />
to be  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also someone said gettign better armour? ok i auctally probally would of done that because the price of stuff is so wacked on Bristlebane the next ugrades hat are worthwhile i see for me are ornate which every piece except plate helm and gaunts are 50k+ so no much upgrades for me there  :( <br />
<br />
Either that or get 65 and start investing everyday in ldon's but i don't see the fun in that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry but :<br />
1. they almost all told you the SBoD is crappy aggro, and explained why: Warrior aggro at high lvl is based on proc or very hight DPS. but War DPS is only relevent (from an aggro point of view) with the top GoD 2Her, and DW allow you to get 50% proc thus Having DW combo of 2x 2procs weapons is the best for high lvl Warrior.<br />
2. very few express themself on the epic weapon. the reason is that SoE update it so often that it's hard to say something on a weapon that you did wield in its last state. Currently it appears that the 2H epic (which before was the best of the three) is not better than other 2Her availlable at the same lvl, thus it's not not such a good weapon when you consider the time needed to get it. But the red epic (Blade of Strategy) has been greatly improoved and now it is sa goog as a CHoS. So yes the red epic is very good for its lvl as aggro weapon. But once again it's much easier to by a CHoS. Morover if you managed to complete the whole epic quest (including the tricky turning with mag blade) you get a great unaug combo, but you can aug only one of them thus you get only 3 procs at best. <br />
<br />
Thats why everybody tell you to go for the Droga combo : because it's the best Time/Money/aggro ratio that can last you very very very long time when fully auged. You have to wait for more time (Bloodfrenzy/Hategiver) or Money (BoC) or PoP and GoD to get better combo.<br />
<br />
But if you want some uniqness, go for a Honed blade of ykesha combo (crafted by troll). They are lesser DPS version of SotB (with its stun remaining)  but are much cheaper and have a nice look (and have no lvl requierment if I remember). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daylenia Soulstar</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True but its not crappy with A2 aug i personally am gonna use splitblade until i get the hammer from PoI which is going to be soon hopefully my guild are going to start killing lower lvl PoP Bosses or Mobs what ever you want to call them<br />
the Dragon in Poi will probally be one of Top prioitys for Agro<br />
<br />
Just gotta get 65 i guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True but its not crappy with A2 aug <br />
<br />
thus you have a 14/19 1HS with a 400 aggro proc. and now imagine a 12/19 with a 400 aggro proc, it will be the same isn't it. now imagime this same weapon (or yours) with a second 400 aggro proc on it : how uber from the original it is !  that what you get with a SotB auged with anger II...<br />
<br />
But if you really gonna have the CHSD then we (and particulary me) should stop bothering you since it's as good as the CHoS. thus you will finally get something equivalent/better to our propositions with a little investissement at the beginning (a SBoD auged anger II is ok pp/adv. pts.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daylenia Soulstar</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ty the CHD has been on my list for a longtime i been on 2 of his raids and i have seen one hammer drop which was given to a lvl 65 warrior also i should have a BoC around 65 as my friend might be giving me his old one when he gets better<br />
so BoC + CHSD at 65 which will be pretty cool:).<br />
<br />
Until then i'm happy with split and +ChoS and who knows by time i go to sell split ornate prices might of gone down so i'll be able to get more armour upgrades:D there going down in price as it is the ornate i mean but still way to much for me atm really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering the same thing, Varalla.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not 14/19.  Daylenia is too low level, it's 13/19 (and was 12/19 when she asked).  Thus it's not even giving a DPS advantage.  It just .... looks ... different.<br />
<br />
Next time you feel happy with your aggro, remember: if you'd chosen a SOTBS, then your nukers could've finished off every fight faster than they currently do.</div></div><hr />

also is it just me or does magelo not add hp and stats from food i got over 200 sta and 3600+ hp (only cause of stat food though)</div></div><hr />

Correct.<br />
It then becomes... Mediocre<br />

erm no i'm auctally a 19 yr old female and it is hard for sk's to get agro from me once i've got it i've never noticed me loosing agro probally cause i'm only lvl 55 anf the sk's are grouped with recntly are poorly equiipped to me Svarjjin plays on same server as me so he can comfirm i have the stuff <br />

kk thx<br />

i did it try it out agro wise v a friend of my yesterda<br />
most the sk's did try nick agro through fight if they could but by then my anger augged had procced enough usually i group with a shaman and just HoS pretty much maxs my Dex so i get 3-4 Hate procs + 3 copper hammer procs per   fight roughly:)<br />
<br />
 i did  try it out agro wise v a friend of my yesterdahe was an sk similarly equipped and we had an agro test i won :)<br />
was close though i have to admiit it he gained agro once or twice but then it pretty much nearly always  went back to me with in 5 seconds or so</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, maybe your rogues can go all out DPS, with their aggro-evasion abilities.  What about your mages and shamans and necros and wizards and rangers?  Do you have any clue how much more DPS they could do, if you could only generate more aggro?<br />
<br />
It is a simple fact that more aggro = shorter fights = less healing/death and faster XP.<br />
<br />
Splitblade&amp;anger = less aggro than SOBS&amp;anger = longer fights = more healing/deaths and slower XP.<br />
<br />
Maybe looking good ranks higher than those things to you.  I wonder how much importance your groupmates would place on your good looks, as compared to their safety and XP rate. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my level has zero to do with the aggro my weaps generate<br />
<br />
stun proc=400-450 aggro<br />
anger2 proc =400-450 aggro(i forget the exact numbers)<br />
<br />
so 4 possible procs for 450 each is just going to be better aggro than your 2 procs for 450 each, its really simple math hun 4 &gt; 2 <br />
<br />
the only way a warrior can hold aggro off other classes is by A) having a headstart on aggro (remember how warriors like to solo the named mobs for a bit then call engage) and B) the other classes manage their aggro well or C) the other classes have zero clue on playing their class for dps/aggro<br />
<br />
sk snares=aggro on demand<br />
pally stuns= aggro on demand<br />
<br />
sooo since taunt works the same for ALL classes lets give you the benefit and say you get a headstart and work on the mob for 20 seconds before the knight steps in. knight taunts off you, then chain stuns/snares and you never see aggro again<br />
<br />
even if you taunt off him, he will get aggro right back, there is no way to win against a knight since they can generate all the aggro they want on demand. no matter what you say, if you think you won an aggro contest against a knight because you are better at aggro generation, you are sadly deluded<br />
<br />
if you have taken advice this well all your eq career maybe its better if you left</div></div><hr />

FH shoulders is a very good choice as well. 15 raw ac and 5hp. Clicky haste from the gloves DOES stack with item haste, but it does NOT stack with other spell haste cast on you. I'd probably start working mostly on ornate gear, replacing your FH as you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes the clicky haste stacks with the worn haste.<br />
stacking rule for haste:<br />
Total_Haste = Min( Worn_Haste + Spell_Haste , 100% ) + Song_Haste<br />
all clickies are considered as spells and thus stack with worn but not with another spell (like another clicky or a Shaman/Enchanter haste).<br />
<br />
thus the ornate gauntlet is very worthy if you don't group often with a haster caster.<br />

<br />
hourra !! a new warrior that has understand the main pb of tank balance !<br />
<br />
because I don't want you to reroll a knight I will give you a little memory refresh (I now that all theese blow mobs gave to us tend to clear our head).<br />
1. if we define the tanking ability by a passive dimishing of domage input then  the tanking stats are AC, shielding, avoidance (thus AGI but...), dodge, parry, riposte, block, resists.<br />
2. to know if a toon can tank versus mob_01 you must calculate the time he can stand under mob_01 fire (counting at max possible) without getting healed. if this time is big anougth to let the group heal you up full at the same rate, then you can face him till the healers get out of mana.<br />
3. within this time limit, you must generate anougth aggro not to let mob_01 srews your healers.<br />
4. within this time limit, all the dps team has to output the max domage to mob_01 they can, but without generating more aggro than you.<br />
5. thus if the dps of the total team multiplied by the time limit of your survability (from point 2) is bigger than mob_01's health then your team might be able to defet mob_01.<br />
<br />
if we are the best tank, it's because at the tanking stats (see point 1) we have between 1 to 7%  benefit from innate bonus (depending if you face a greeny or a strong opposent). Plus at same game lvl progression (ie same zone) we get gears with around 5% better tanking stats (thus knights need to progress futher to match our tanking stats). Plus our HP is generally bigger (by less than 500HP) at the same tanking stat giving us a better point 2 than knights.<br />
<br />
This is only from passive tanking !!!!<br />
<br />
from active tanking all the three tanks splits in different battlefield. <br />
a Paladin has a strong set of stun that let him reduce mob_01 domage by 60 to 70%  , moreover he is a decent healer allowing him to help futher the healing team (see point 2).<br />
a Shadowknght has fear and snare to make mob_01 stoping his attack but it's less powerfull than stun. he also has powerfull lifetap and manatap to help healers (both fron point 2 and point 3 view).<br />
a Warrior has mainly his defensive discipline that smooth melee domage. thus if we face an easy mob we get almost no return, but the more powerfull mob_01 is bigger the benefint from it we get.<br />
So understanding that in big raid event, the boss at the end is ussually immune to stun and fear and is a big bad mofo, we are the last tank standing that can do his job, even if in a general maner we are not the more efficient. <br />
<br />
We are are the best tank in general,  not the more efficient in particular cases.<br />
<br />
hope this will give you more insight of our class, and understand why all the three tanking classes are fighting for balance. and Why we are still usefull.<br />

<br />
  Whatttt????? Sk have fear and snare but these dont make the mob_01 stoping is attack post 55 (fear is useless post 55 to make one mob run from u). So, if u want to say that sks have anything that help to tank, only get lifetaps and ZB, not that great.<br />

sorry for this missinformation, I must admit SK is not my favorite (thus I tend to skipe what they can do exactly), because Paladin got improovement to they stun (to be able to keep stunning past 55), I thought sk got something similar. I understand now that my description of SK tanking is even farer from what I thought, so fell free to develop your post to fix the breach from mine.<br />
<br />
dear Daylena,<br />
you either try to make joke of me, or you play a class in a game from which you are unaware of his (un)balance history...  at the begining of EQ gears were weak (compared to the current one), and war where not so powerfull and needed lots of human resource to make somthing viable. with Kunark we got defensive and we turn to be the Boss Tank. this is our speciality. after this gears never stoped to improove putting our skills and stat to a second importance (see on top end warriors, more of the half of their HP, STR, STA, DEX, ... comes from gears).<br />
<br />
thus, yes warrior are less appealling for exp group or LoDN group (except if they are high in they progression toward the top).<br />
 yes warrior are unmatched agaisnt tought MOB (especially agaisnt the ones called &quot;high DI mob&quot;) because we are the only one class to be able to cut in half mob'DI. that's why we protect our defensive discipline from knights for heavily.<br />
yes top end warrior are defined by their gear.<br />
<br />
to condensate it, I will use the warrior score of another member of this board :<br />
success dependancy goes : Communication &gt; gears &gt; toon skills &gt; human skills<br />
explanation:<br />
you can't solo, thus you need a good communication within the group to not mess up everything (remember that EQ is a game meant to be played together not alone).<br />
top end gears more than doubles your toon's power<br />
if your toon as the proper skills, AA and gears you can't mess up exept if you do it on purpuse or if you forget the fisrt point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, warriors are about 90% based on their gear. We don't get spells. We get a couple of disciplines that'll only save us if we have good gear. That last 10% that we're based off of is AAs. Skill is a surprisingly small portion of a warrior's job. It's kinda sad, but very true. It doesn't matter how well I know how to play my class, when I tank a mob that just hits too hard. The mob will kill me if I don't have enough hp/ac/AAs. The majority of skill that comes into play for warriors is CHOOSING the proper gear and focusing all your energy into upgrading your gear. <br />
<br />
  Casters get spells as nearly an automatic update every few levels, which work even if they're neked. A warrior on a corpse run can easily die to green KOS mobs, because we simply don't have any way to defend ourselves without gear. Skill comes into play mostly for those with utility... Knowing when to root a mob, when to mez, when to debuff, when to kite. A warrior has the lowest utility of any class; all we do is aggro a mob and tank it. Our entire purpose is to do our defined job and be the best at it.<br />
<br />
  People are not always kind when you choose inferior weapons or armor because it's showing that you aren't good at being a warrior. When the warrior community makes suggestions, we really know what we're talking about. I've been playing a warrior for a long time, and if I tell you that the SBoD is shit, for example, it's based off of many parses and years of personal experience combined with the endless experience of the other warriors here. We are gear driven, we know our shit, and if you ask for advice and ignore it, we will rip you apart.<br />
<br />
  Lastly, here is why warriors matter in an experience group: We DO take less innate damage. We generate *enough* aggro to do our job. If a named pops, we can tank it far better than knights. Lastly, we have a couple of very powerful &quot;oh shit!&quot; disciplines and abilities to help keep us alive. AE taunt + furious + defensive (when furious ends) has kept me alive a ton of times when a knight would have still been taking full damage.<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, sorry for the long winded post. We are the warrior community, we know what we're doing and ignore our advice at your peril.</div></div><hr />

I know from experience that a pally / knight can generate a ton of aggro on demand (thus they are able to tank the aggro-debuffing TZ). <br />
<br />
However, I also have fought alot side by side in exp groups with both classes. Many many times I have had knights and pallies OT the add when we don't have proper CC in group.<br />
<br />
And, when I'm done tanking the friggin Armadillo in Earth or the Steelslave Slayer in Rujark, I jump on the second mob and begin to taunt, proc, incite, etc...depending on endurance / disc availability and whatnot.<br />
<br />
What I have found is that at least 75% of the time I get immediate aggro and hold it for the fight if my first taunt succeeds. And I'm fairly certain that the knight was snaring, dotting, taunting and that the pally was stunning, rooting, etc.....Now, I'm not saying that all of the SK's and Pallies are high-end-geared to begin with, but I have noticed that even in EXP groups, I have no trouble holding aggro even with a knight or pally trying to hold on to it.<br />
<br />
I also notice the same thing on raids when I am a designated OT and the MT happens to be a pally (this is a rare occasion)...but I tend to hold aggro when the pally / sk jumps off the main mob to try and steal aggro back from the add that I am tanking. <br />
<br />
The thing that makes my day and why I keep playing this game is that occasional /tell from a pally or knight in a raid / exp group saying &quot;damn, you can pull some aggro!&quot;<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
So, does anyone else experience this or am I just constantly livin some freakish dream / illusion / smoke &amp; mirror fantasy?<br />
<br />
I wanna hear some comments from Time+ geared tanks who tank beside similar-geared knights and pallies....and some comments from others who are at the stage where I am at (Ele flagged for 4 weeks now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If taunt succeeds, you're at the same aggro level they are. If they don't cast for more aggro than you proc, you will hold aggro. If you're the MT, any knight worth anything at all will stop casting their high aggro spells as soon as the mob turns on you. That's what knights are SUPPOSED to do if they're not MT. It sounds like you generally group with knights that know how to keep the warrior with aggro... which is a very, very good thing.<br />
<br />

<br />
  They have to successfully taunt, or the aggro you've built up will take a whole lot to overcome. They have a lower taunt cap, as I recall, and especially on raids will have trouble succeeding taunt. Therefore, they have to keep pumping out aggro spells until they've passed your aggro level. If you're not turning off attack when they're trying to take aggro, it'll take some doing for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I land my successful taunt on the mob, and BOTH the knight/pally and I drop attack, I won't necessarily keep the mob on me right? Because DOT damage and Stun effects can have a time-effect ratio correct? Same with snare? <br />
<br />
And furthermore, if a warrior and Knight / pally are similarly equipped, is it true that the knight / pally will NOT lose aggro if they don't want to? Because I would like to do a few experiments of my own on this issue.<br />
<br />
Was wondering this because I have seen a few occasions where I land taunt and the mob will only turn for a second or so....and on rare occasions not at all =o<br />
<br />
Also, any input from the Time+ geared tanks who tank side by side with pallies / knights?<br />
<br />
--furo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I land my successful taunt on the mob, and BOTH the knight/pally and I drop attack, I won't necessarily keep the mob on me right?

<br />
  Only dot damage adds aggro over time. Stuns work once and leave no buff icon, and any debuff that has no dot component will only generate aggro when it's first cast. So unless you're taunting off of a shadowknight that has an active dot on the mob, you should keep aggro. Do note that proximity DOES play into aggro, and if the knight steps closer than you the mob may turn.<br />
<br />
  And furthermore, if a warrior and Knight / pally are similarly equipped, is it true that the knight / pally will NOT lose aggro if they don't want to? Because I would like to do a few experiments of my own on this issue. <br />
<br />
   Well, that's true and untrue. Knights can use low level spells for aggro, which they can basically cast indefinitely due to the low mana cost on them. Warriors simply cannot compete with the on demand aggro generation. Think of it this way: Stuns and pure hate procs are what warriors use to generate aggro, coupled with incite. Knights can cast similar aggro spells whenever they want, more times per minute than we will proc. I don't speak for the time+ crowd, but warriors simply can't compete with the aggro generation of spells cast as often as knights can cast them. If they don't want to lose aggro, they won't.<br />
<br />
  That being said, taunt means that we can, on a success, match their aggro no matter how ahead they are. A successful taunt + incite will take aggro from them for a few seconds. Warriors are the KING of pingponging aggro; it doesn't matter how much aggro someone can generate, we can steal it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/endorse Fitemore heartily.<br />
<br />
I think of taunt as a hate grenade, Furo. When it blows up (i.e., lands successfully), there I am at the top of that aggro pile. For that one split-second, I am the king of hate.<br />
<br />
What happens after that is, well, more of the same. <br />
<br />
Each person in the fight is doing something that pisses off the mob, and each person therefore has his or her own running (and growing) hate number. If your mages continue to send their pets while sitting, if your wiz goes spastic and hits his heaviest nuke over and over, if the rogue is using some bad-ass GoD piercer with an anger3 aug, well ... you're going to have trouble staying on top of the hate list, because what THEY are doing is likely to generate more hate than what YOU are doing.<br />
<br />
Keep your taunt ready for when your group mates pass you on the aggro list, and then drop that sucker in there to put yourself on top again.<br />
<br />
(And hope your weapons proc a lot.... but taunt is something YOU can control.)</div></div><hr />

More control over than when your proc goes off (though you can predict it fairly reliably based on your dexterity).<br />
<br />
If you aren't a mindless taunt masher, you can have it ready for when the aggro passes away from you for a 60% chance of instant recovery.</div></div><hr />
