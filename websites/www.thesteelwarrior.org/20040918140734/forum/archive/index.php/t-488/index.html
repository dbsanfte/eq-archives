<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wagdork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow Warriors,<br />
<br />
  I know this has been gone over many times but I decieded to ask anyways.  I have the wingblade, hand, red scale, and Ball of everliving Golem left to get in my epic.  Iam decieding on what to get next, my guild is currently able to do most of the above but I had some questions about some things.  1) How hard are the wingblade, hand and Ball compared to the epic peices that I have already gotten?  2) Of the above items what should I get next? <br />
<br />
Thank You in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
P.S.  After camping a dr00d in EJ for the past 3 months I said the hell with it and bought it for 15k.  They REALLY need to make the Scale a No Drop.  Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">15k? for the greenscale. you are lucky. and if they did that they would just sell the mq. but get hand first before they revamp hate. fear and spiroc are pretty easy if you have 24 55+ with good gear. red scale can be bought or drops from naggy nortlav the scalekeeper talendor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont see what good making the scale no drop would do; they'd just sell the mq.<br />
<br />
Buying one for 15k was a steal, they're rarely sold on Veeshan and go for 125-200k when they do sell.  Fortunately I belong to a supportive guild and we went on a Sev rampage and picked him off 4 times in 3 weeks (thanks patch's)<br />
<br />
The sad part is I have Cord Hilted Spike Driver and Blade of Carnage now so my epics rarely get to come out and play.  It doesnt change the fact though that in my four years of playing its the item I&quot;m most proud of obtaining since I was there or MT'd every kill.<br />

wingblade:<br />
     with 3 groups of 55+ you can get to the spiroc isle usually in about 6hrs of raiding (give or take an hour or so).  Just be prepared to have to kill the spiroc lord a few times to get the wingblade.  It took me 6 trips to PoA before the spiroc lord actually dropped the blade, then he dropped it 4 times in 6 kills.  If you have a couple groups post 60 you could probably do it faster. Just besure to leave up the mob that keeps the lord respawning if he doesn't drop it the first time.  while your there might as well get all your warriors the blade.  He also drops the blade I think SK's need for their epic.<br />
hand:<br />
      really should do this like someone else said before they revamp hate.  Maestro or the hand he spawns always drops this and can be done with a single post 60 group, or 2-3 groups 55+ if you are careful.<br />
red scale:<br />
      by the scale or kill Nortlav in the Hole.  Scale generally sales for 7-9k.<br />
Ball of everliving Golem:<br />
      The Golems are kinda a pain in the but since fear sucks breaking in.  The golems are a 3day spawn so they are generally taken out pretty quick after a patch.  The ball will normally drop from one of the three Golems.  Any of them can drop it.  I don't remember a time when one of them didn't at least drop the ball.<br />
<br />
So imho I would go for hate first, then either it is a toss up for PoA and PoF since there are a few epic drops needed from each place for a multitude of classes, it might be easier to see which ppl in your guild need what pieces from what plane and pick that way.  The scale would be the easiest to get of the three since it can be bought.  Btw, if you got a green scale for 15k you are one lucky warrior.  When i was trying for my scale, i couldn't find one for under 120k.  Anyways that was my 2cp worth.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok Quick question here, I read in another forum here (Battlefield) that Hate had already gone to Hatev2, can anyone clarify if this has just gone live on Stormhammer or has it filtered down to all the rest of us yet?<br />
Any advice on this greatly appreciated because we are setting up to go to Hate and have been using information from the previous post in Battlefield to get ready for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's still just stormhammer atm.<br />
<br />
And about Spiroc windblade: as many said, 3 groups will get you to it, and more will get you there faster.  But be sure you don't bring too many; last time we brought 5 groups, and we ended up killing so fast we bugged the script... and GMs wouldn't help.  That was about 2 weeks ago, so they might have fixed the situation, but knowing sony I doubt that's the case; just fair warning.</div></div><hr />
