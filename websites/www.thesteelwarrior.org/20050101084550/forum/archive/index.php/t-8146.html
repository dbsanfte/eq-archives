I am honestly a warrior newb and I don' t have any idea about how to suggest he fix his problem, if indeed he can.  <br />
<br />
Basically what seems to be happening is that if / when he dies, the reuse timer on the incite will go to about 40 minutes.  Even I know that is not right.  Has anyone else heard of this happening?  I did a search, but didn't come up with anything.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

so if you find the warrior you have grouped with ask him if his time is correct or if it has a difference with his local time (usually it's few minutes), if yes correct it and it should be good.</div></div><hr />
