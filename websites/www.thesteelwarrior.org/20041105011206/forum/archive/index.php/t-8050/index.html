<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like augments are being bought back for 70% of their cost, was offered 357 points for my Brilliant Blood Ruby of Prowress and 805 points for a Glowing Sapphire of Courage by the ldon merchant.  Also, was offered back 1045 points for a RA bracelet of sand, but merchant offered me no points for pre-nerf RA sleeves of sand.</div></div><hr />

Since the +6 and lower augs can't be sold, I'm assuming other droppable augs can't be sold either.</div></div><hr />

I had made a mask for my cleric that was full of bought augs, got almost 3k points back for the whole thing, didn't have to &quot;dismantal&quot; it. :)</div></div><hr />

Been said a number of times, if the item doesn't have an &quot;adventure point&quot; cost, you can't sell it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am not sure if this is the same as what was reported from the test server, but with 105+ charisma, here are a few of the costs to remove augs:<br />
<br />
LDoN normal dropped augs (+6 stat) - 25pp<br />
510 point cost aug (brilliant blood ruby of prowess, etc) - 500pp<br />
1150 point cost aug (marble sphere of ire) - 1000pp<br />
<br />
These were the only ones I bothered checking, but at least gives an indication of the final costs for some aug removals.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">who do you sell these back to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On each ldon adventure merchant, there is now a &quot;sell&quot; button next to the  &quot;purchase&quot; button.  That is how you sell back augments and ldon gear.  <br />
As a pointless side note, it cost me 150p at 110 CHA to move my 12hp dropped augment. =p</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they're change this, currently they still aren't being bought back.  Looks like augment values have adjusted some, when i was switching around my augs I noticed that the 12 hp type7 augs that drop in ldon were class VI and the pre-nerf ones that were type all were IV.   Now the type7 ones are class IX and the typeAll ones are class VI.  The type8 version that Dible in sro traded out (not sure if he still does this after changes) are also class IX, not sure what they were before.   Kind of strange that in each case the all type aug is lower class than the others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Andrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Uh, they are No Drop, dude. You can't sell them to another player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The solution to which of course, since they can't reassign a point value to prenerf RA and similar armor or else it'll pop back up on vendors, would be to allow turning in an unaugmented prenerf version to an NPC (Dible in sro works) and getting back a postnerf version to sell.</div></div><hr />
