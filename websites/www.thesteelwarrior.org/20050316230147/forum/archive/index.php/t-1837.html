<br />
what i want to know is what mobs are the best to kill for the silks i need? keep in mind i dont have track, so i need a place *crawling* with em <br />

*bad pun noted with stars :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turgan7th</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try East Karana, those Crag Spiders have up to 7 Silk on them if my memory is correct. It is crowded over there from time to time at least on 7th but you might get a lucky day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned above, EK is great.  You can also do Upper Guk which is good if you can't track.  Respawn is kind of long though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is currently no better place to hunt spider silks than in EK.  Crag spiders can drop up to 8 silks per spider, and the carrion spiders can drop up to 6 silks per spider.  Just keep running the loop from the bandit camp up over the back of the mountain (the one with all of the named gnolls, etc), then around to the front of that hill and back around.  Just about everything is a PHer for spiders, so if spiders are slim pickings, you can other stuff to help with spider respawn.  Biggest problem is that there is almost always competition for the spiders.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can make bandages form spider silks right?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know, go to eqtraders.com, but I cant!  I cant get to it while I am at work.<br />
<br />
Hmm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bandages are made from combining 2 silk threads, threads are made from 2 spiderling silks.  If you go to East Karana to hunt the spiders, you can load up on cat pelts by killing all the various lions running around there also.  I went there with a friend one night and ended up with 3 stacks of silk and 2 stacks of cat pelts each in less than 2 hours.  Just keep an eye out for the griffons, I can't remember what lvl they are out there.<br />

<br />
I think I'll farm silks and pelts tonight.</div></div><hr />
