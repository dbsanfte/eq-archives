I think it would be stupid.  Would you have fun doing it?</div></div><hr />

Dont think I made millions, but got a lot of AA and am hoping there will be droppable OoW gear I can buy.<br />
<br />
I think it is better to play at good camps then to just buy sell in bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, while its your world, it is your $13/month (or whatever the monthly is). The question truely is would yo enjoy playing the game like that.</div></div><hr />

For the past 2 or 3 years i've been over a mil in pp and I haven't bought/sold in forever... I did it back in the nfp days, my motto was &quot; buy low, sell high &quot; - i've got nothing to spend plat on besides my guild, soooo I can fund guild events, buy people a lifetime supply of regeants and other stuff to that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do, go to FV where nothing is no drop. That way you can buy and sell stuff that people normally wouldn't be able to see without a really strong raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

I would have been right up there where my friend is at 400aa's because we started at the same time and play about the same hours a day, etc. Instead I just sat in the bazaar for a long time. I regret it. I wish I was uber =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
The key is, don't not play the game in order to buy and sell. Keep the bazaar channel running while you fight. Learn the market, and then buy and sell before you log off and right as you log in. Then keep a trader up when you aren't playing. You won't make as much money from the actual buying and selling this way, but you will make plenty, and you actually get to play the game. Plus you will make a good amount of money from the drops you get while actually playing the game. Not to mention all the other things that come along by playing instead of chilling in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

Yes, defenatly.<br />
<br />
He's a few things to consider before you start:<br />
<br />
1. To make money, you must own money. If you feel uneasy having lots of plat in the bank, you're not trader material : )<br />
<br />
2. Buy and sell only things that you know. If you play warrior most of the time, concentrate on warrior items.<br />
<br />
3. Buy items that has a certain amout of prestige attatched to it. Here I mean items like CHoS, Ornate and weapons in generel. Rule of thomp is, that people look to replace weapons before armour and weapons always sell faster.<br />
<br />
4. Buy items that can be used by many classes. Here CHoS again is a good example, since it can be used by many classes. It improves that chance of selling the item.<br />
<br />
5. If you have time, hang around in bazaar and look for desperate people. You can always recognize them, since they auction a single item in the public channel and usualy want to sell here-and-now. They are easily pressed down in prize. If they refuse to alter their prize, just walk away (there will be more). Some of them already know that they need to sell cheap to get rid of an item, so dont blow a good deal by applying too much presure on an item that is alreay cheap.<br />
<br />
6. If you're not the &quot;trader material&quot; type, there's a middle road. Buy items that you can use, but live without. That could be an expensive set of weapon, that you put up for sale everytime you hang out in that bazaar. This require a back up item for the item you want to sell. In the case of the weapon set, that could be a cheaper set of weapons that &quot;do the job&quot;.<br />
This trader style is not as good as the first one, but easier to manage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps : )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iv made way over 3million pp (I have 7 guys to equip). <br />
<br />
Warriors are much more gear dependent then other classes that is for sure.<br />
<br />
Yur weapon is very very important and the first thing you need to spend money on.<br />
<br />
I would just level up and sell what you get and don't need when you are sleeping, and use that money on weapon only (BoC is yur main target here). Make sure when you raid/group that its clear you can roll on tradskill items just like everyone else and get your share of saleable items. It will take time but just hoard your pp until you have enough to get what you need in weapons. People with JC skillz might claim that diamonds and blue diamonds should go to them but you have to be firm and say you are entitled to your share.<br />
<br />
You can play the buy low sell high game but you need a base of income flow to really do that. And a wrong move can be costly. A plat dupe can throw all the prices off... or saturation of the market in a particular item... <br />
<br />
If your going to do that check the bazzar at like 6AM thats when most traders are online and you can price items at that time. If you see a good item offered at 1/2 or so what it has sold for recently you can buy it hoping it to sell slowly, but there is risk involved with that. <br />
<br />
I have a stong income from basic Jewlery supplies as my chanter is max Jewel Craft, no one bothers with BDvelium brancer, JacVelium rings BSvelium necks... but at 1K plus a shot it adds up as they sell fast. Also valor rings, iron amulets and the occasional bloodear (just got the gem for it for 10K and if I succedd Ill sell for 30K easy) are all stapels. <br />
<br />
But my advise to a single box warrior.... level ups and just save for weapons only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd do both.  Exp alot and leave a vendor up over night.  When you exp if you see an item that says &quot;can be used in tradeskills&quot; shame on you if you vendor it...over time these can add up.</div></div><hr />
