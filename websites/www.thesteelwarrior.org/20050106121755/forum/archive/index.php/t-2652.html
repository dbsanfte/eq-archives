<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried this guy last night for the first time. We had very little knowledge of him and saw a red con and thought, hey, lets try him.<br />
<br />
The AE rampage was a surprise. We had zero range attackers, which made the fight very difficult. <br />
<br />
We tried him a total of three times. First attempt we got him to 60 and I was ST so I was on his back. I only took rampage once. Second attempt I took rampage the whole time. Third attempt all melee (except MT) tried to get at max melee to avoid rampage. It did not work.<br />
<br />
I have three questions. <br />
<br />
1) Does he have normal single target rampage in addition to his AE rampage?<br />
<br />
2) Is his AE rampage limited to a certain number of PC's? We fought him with 9 people total (1 cleric, 1 druid, 2 warr's, 1 BST, 1 rougue, 1 SK, 2 shammies)<br />
<br />
3) Is there a small window between max melee and his AE rampage range? I was at normal melee range during the first fight and did not take rampage. During the third fight, I tried very hard to be at max melee and took rampage only when I was in range of hitting him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) I don't believe he has a standard rampage.<br />
<br />
2) I've seen him drop 16 people in a single ramp, don't think there's a limit<br />
<br />
3) Well, hate to be giving away secrets, but there is a point at which you can avoid AE rampage, and still hit the mob....just have to play around with it.  Make sure you pay close attention to your actual damage spam when you're trying to find that sweet spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) No, it's AE rampage. Even if you set up like a single rampage, it makes no difference because it's AE.<br />
<br />
2) No, anyone within range will get hit.<br />
<br />
3) Most AE rampages I have encountered do have a fine line between max melee and the rampage. Until the mob is stationary it sometimes is difficult to find this line. I have not fought the Overseer this way, so I can't say if this is true or not. <br />
<br />
Pets are very good for this encounter. Take note of the pig pen near by.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
its really a little stupid how little margin of error there is between between being able to hit him and not take rampage. helps to push into corner.<br />
<br />
single group can prob still kill him if you got an enchanter and druid in group. its little harder than before at least since you cant pet tank him. can still single group glykus too. great source of chain bps. glykus drops the robe but its less common. troll mini drops plate bp, but again not as common as the chain for some reason.</div></div><hr />
