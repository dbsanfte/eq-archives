<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyfin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a gear question... thanks in advance for any thoughts you have on this matter.<br />
<br />
First a profile...<br />

<br />
My plan, such as it is, is to develop CoV faction and work on Skyshrine (Myrmidon's) armor quests.  As I've started my faction work in Kael, it occurred to me that I'd feel pretty foolish if I did all the work and then, once I learned better, found that I should have focused elsewhere.  So... is this a good plan?  I've noticed on the rankings site (Url escapes me at the moment) that I seem to be rather lacking in HPs...  for this reason, if the whole concept of SS armor is flawed then let me know... its the stats not the quest itself that I am interested in.<br />
<br />
Once again, much thanks ahead of time... <br />

&quot;what was I thinking... agnostic... geeeze&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in the scale of things these days Skyshrine gear is pretty poor and at best a stepping stone.<br />
<br />
Usually I would recommend cultural ahead of Skyshrine with the exception of the Gauntlets and BP, even the non-deity specific stuff is superior to Sky Shrine in most cases, however as an agnostic ogre I think you are somewhat screwed in this department.<br />
<br />
Really unless you are making XP and getting the things you need to quest your armour for free I think you are pretty much wasting your time focusing on Skyshrine.<br />
<br />
The best bits:<br />
Myrmidons Gauntlets - 27AC, 90HPs.  The best bit of the whole set.  Alternative's to these for comparable gauntlets are Ornate (less hps, more AC, clicky haste), Warlords Steel Gauntlets (more AC, same HPs, more stats) or those other tradeable ones from Velious - Velium Gemmed Gauntlets? (75HPs, more AC but overpriced usually)<br />
<br />
Myrmidon's BP - 54AC, 90HPs.  A decent BP with a clicky heal.  Unfortunately theres a quest that requires a Velious BP that makes a FT4 caster/priest BP/robe so MQ's for this are getting even more expensive than they already were.  Considering how easy Vindi is these days getting a Vindi BP should be much less painful, or an Architect's Bejeweled BP costs next to nothing and is perfectly servicable.<br />
<br />
The rest -<br />
Helmet of the Raldukan is pretty much the same stats and costs bugger all in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Bracers of Benevolence will give more HPs from a quest in Cobalt Scar (does require CoV faction though).  Manathreaded Bone Bracelet from Hard LDoN or Ornate Bracers are far superior.<br />
<br />
Boots of kingly splendor have considerable more HP, Barbed Dragonscale Boots are another option, the Hard LDoN boots are excellent (bloodied boots of dark rights)<br />
<br />
Legs - Greaves of the orcish master are on par with Skyshrine.  Kylong Shinguards are a respectable alternative.<br />
<br />
Some other options which I would consider much better use of your time would be either LDoN - either the EF plate (Malevolent xxx of Suffering) at 700pts a piece of the Tak plate at 1400 points per piece would be far superior to Skyshrine, or you could try XPing in Veksar, alot of the Kylong gear is also comparable to Skyshrine and you will get better XP while you farm it and you can sell it on for profet when you upgrade it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greyfin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow... that's what I was worried about... glad I asked, and even gladder someone answered.  Thank you very very much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree.  Don't waste your time factioning.  Just do LDoN adventures and get armor that way.  Kinda kill 2 birds with one stone, leveling to 65 and getting points to buy the armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">definately what these guys said...Myrmidon's these days is basically an item gotten if your guild hunted there.<br />
<br />
you'd be better off getting them LDoN points and/or kylong gear for now. don't fuss with Velious quest gear at this stage of the game. you'd only be handicapping yorself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup, velious armor is good if that's all you are doing is hunting in velious. I got my warlords way back when there was nothing to do but ToV. Took a break when luclin came out and I can still hold my own against most stuff, but I find that it really lacks in the resist department. As for AC it's only 1 or 2 points off of ornate/ldon armor.<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, skip myrmidons unless you get it for free.</div></div><hr />
