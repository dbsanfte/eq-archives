That spell exists to remove the hp difference between paladins and warriors, I'll go out on a limb and say there's no way you can argue differently.<br />
<br />
When I first saw it, I didn't mind them getting a self-buff at 64.  I mean why not....clerics get a self buff, fine.  Shadowknights receive versions of their necro parent Lich line, so a self buff for Paladins isn't totally out of the question.  Then we find out it stacks with every hp buff in the game except Pot9/PotG due to the mana regen.  There's no other reason for them to have it that way except to remove the hp difference.  Shadowknights don't get it, we get Cloak of Luclin/Akheva, but that's the hybrid line.  And none of the other hybrids get anything similar.<br />
<br />
All the benefits, barely a penalty...</div></div><hr />

Since the difference is so small, a spell like Aura of the Crusader really seems to stick out.  It only gives 51 HP more than the SK buff, but no one complains about that.  When you compare it to what Shadowknights and Rangers get for self-only buffs, it makes a bit more sense.<br />
<br />
Aura of the Crusader (PAL)<br />
342 HP<br />
30 AC<br />
3 Mana Regen<br />
<br />
Protection of the Wild (RNG)<br />
125 HP<br />
130 ATK<br />
30 AC<br />
34 Damage Shield<br />
<br />
Cloak of Luclin (SK)<br />
279 HP<br />
18 AC<br />
10 Damage Shield<br />
<br />
Each of these spells works with the idea behind the class in question.  The Ranger spell is more an ATK buff than anything else.  The SK spell gives considerable HP and a decent damage shield.  The Paladin spell gives a bit more HP and minor mana regen.  <br />
<br />
So I wouldn't look to rebalance HP due to Aura of the Crusader.  I would look to rebalance HP in general.  If the HP levels were correct, the HP from Aura of the Crusader wouldn't seem like such a big deal.  <br />

Protection of the Nine does other things besides give HP.  So does Aura but in the end Nine is more attractive.<br />

The bonus I see in Aura is that I can better cope in group cases where Nine is not available.  Beyond that the HP level is a wash.  It certainly won't save me from death against anything substantial.</div></div><hr />

A 30 AC self buff and a few huge AC shields that can be worn on the back close the mitigation gap.<br />
<br />
The real differences are:<br />
Warriors got Defensive<br />
Paladins got a spellbook and superior aggro contol.<br />
<br />
Because these are the only real differences:<br />
<br />
In raids Warriors get to MT hard mobs and Paladins add tank, MT lesser mobs, and MT hard mobs that require their abilities.<br />
<br />
Paladins are greatly prefered in exp groups, but there are enough healers and lower level players around that well equipped high-level Warriors get groups too. (Thanks goodness for that level 63 average to get 51 AP's).<br />

1.  remove ALL +hp granting aa's rom all non warrior classes and refund the aa's.<br />
<br />
2.  make it so that hp gained per sta scales with level, for warriors only.  thus, a 305 sta lvl 61 war would get, say, 7 hp per sta, while a lvl 65 305 sta warrior would get 10 hp per sta.<br />

these 2 changes alone would restore the hp gap without any reitemization.<br />

Alone, it is. But, Aura is never alone. However, Cloak of Luclin and Warders protection are always alone. Brell's does not stack with any of these. Further, in the case of Warders, it is a composite buff that replaces Strength of Tunare, Call of the Predator, and Call of the Rathe, all of which the ranger may or may not be casting on the group. Cloak, meanwhile is not only self only, but it is exclusive of all other hybrid HP/AC buffs, including all Call of the Rathe and Spiritual Vigor.<br />
<br />
It is far more proper to compare Aura of the Crusader + BSS to the other buffs, for a total of <br />
<br />
672 HP<br />
30 AC<br />
3 mana regen<br />
<br />
+ <br />
<br />
330 x 5 HP. <br />
<br />
And the only spell that won't stack is Bot9. Gee, Aura is awful nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All protection of the nine gives is 5 more mana regen over Aura...that's it.  Everything else you get with it can be given in larger quantities with HoV + Aura.<br />
<br />
Boleslav, you're wrong.  You're comparing the Ranger and Shadowknight Hybrid line with Paladin self buff.  Paladin hybrid line is the Brell's line, not AotC.  Shadowknight hybrid line is 279hp plus AC and DS, but Paladin hybrid line is 330hp.  You have largest hp, and sacrifice other effects.  The Protection of the Wild buff for Rangers is the same line as their hybrid buff, the Strength line.<br />
<br />
AotC does indeed stick out, but it's because it stacks with every hp buff in the whole game useable by a Paladin except the Druid ones because of the mana regen.  It is the only buff that does.  Paladins have Brell's line to rival the SK/Ranger/Beastlord lines, none of the other hybrids have anything even like AotC.  That is why it sticks out.  <br />
<br />
Only comparing self-only buffs would be great if they were actually the same line.  Yours stacks with your own hybrid buff, giving you ~670hp total in addition to cleric buffs.  SKs are the highest after that, with 279hp that doesn't stack with Brell's (Same line).<br />
<br />
Put AotC hp on shaman/shielding line.</div></div><hr />

The raid MGB Nine and Symbol then has to use extra mana (1000 iirc) and a peridot for each Paladin that wants it.  That seemed wasteful so I stopped asking for it.<br />
<br />
I seem to use Aura more in LDoN than POP these days.  If a Cleric is present but a Druid is not, then Virtue/Hand of Virtue is probably used so I use Aura.  If a Druid is present but a Cleric is not, then it is probably Nine + my symbol.  If both are present then we use Nine + cleric symbol.  I really don't think burning more peridots and mana than necessary is helpful in any of those situations.<br />
<br />
IMHO...YMMV.  I don't mind having it but these days I wonder what purpose Aura was supposed to fill.</div></div><hr />

As to the guy (sorry failed to note your name) that asked if VT geared Warriors should end up with elemental type HP, don't forget elemental gear is stuffed with mana too in the non visible slots. <br />

I still feel that some mana-HP conversion would go some way to redress the HP differential of pure melee to their hybrid counterparts. It is also a way to address the issue without a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it's supposed to, but it doesn't actually work like that.<br />
<br />
The only credible comparative AC parse I've ever seen for a cleric appeared to show that over ~1100AC, an increase of 500AC resulted in a difference of ~3% extra damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
Clerics might have plate graphics but they certainly don't have plate class mitigation.  That's reserved for knights and warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't blame them. From a strictly efficiency viewpoint, 1755 (aotc + virtue) is 15.5% more hp than 1522 (9 + symbol), while 42/tick is only 12% more mana regen than 47/tick. Not to mention staying alive would probably be more important than casting.<br />
<br />
Note to paladins about to post that you don't always have VoQ + bard, so how can I make such ludicrous comparisons: in raids, you do. This post is about raids. It would probably vary in exp groups, but everyone knows paladins are the best exp group tank, bar none. So it's a moot point anyway.</div></div><hr />

I am a rogue and with a combination of Elemental and Time gear I have 1675 in + mana.<br />
Assuming that warrior gear would have a similar quantity (we use similar items after all) would an extra 1500-1700 HP to a top geared tank make a game unbalancing change? Personally I think not.<br />
<br />
It would also redress the absurdly small HP difference between Warriors and Paladins. Warriors should be the absolutely highest HP tank in the game.<br />
<br />
Taking a measure like this would go some way towards redressing the balance between pure melee and hybrids who benefit from focus effects, essentially unlimited mana and powerful spells. I still think 1-1 for warriors, 1-2 for monks and 1-3 for Rogues would be appropriate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One second here, isn't the real issue the reduction in gap in hp's when grouping anyway? Paladins are onto a win win, unless they group both a cleric and a druid (then they only drop the hp gap by just under half :p) - Pot9 + mini cleric buffs &amp; Brells vs. Virtue plus AotC and Brells. Shaman plus the lot. Unless you have a paladin in group buffing a warrior the warriors durability advantage (not that it was much) just isn't there.</div></div><hr />

I especially value mana regen over HP regen.  That is just the nature of the class: Paladins convert mana-&gt;hp nicely.<br />
<br />
But that is my opinion.  230 HP or better regen?  I go with better regen since 230 HP is in the margin of error for surviving against a raid monster but sustaining heals is more important to me.  Plus as I mentioned before, it eats a peridot and mana to buf me out of line of 99% of the raid.<br />
<br />
Any one who is playing to just max HP isn't playing as smart as they could be.  Don't get me wrong: every class should try to get to high HP levels.  It is blindly ignoring useful effects just for a little more HP is bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides if paladins were smart they would form an all paladin group and have HoV cast on them to save 50% of the mana and 4 peridots, besides the fact that HoV lasts ALOT longer than Kazad...<br />
<br />
but that still completely goes off topic.<br />
<br />
Converting Mana on items to HPS for PURE MELEE is a very good way to rebalance the current situation where casters are fed everything with no drawbacks. This still doesnt take into affect the elemental class armor disparity... where warriors get 10 extra hp to the paladins 130 mana... but thats another fight.<br />
<br />
Warrior 1m ana = 1 hp<br />
Monk 3 mana = 1 hp<br />

I've become very cognisant of how much peridots cost these days and how much mana is burned doing extra buffs.  You want to spread Paladins through out the raid.  Jumping through hoops just to do &quot;buff catering&quot; is time, money, and mana spent.  It bugs me more than ever to be wasteful.  It doesn't matter if its an easy cost to bare. ^_^<br />
<br />
The topic is how do rebalance 230 HP.  I'm wondering &quot;Why bother?&quot;  Twiddling 230 non scalable HP is peanuts.  Just by the margin of error all of us can mitigate away 230 HP.  It does doesn't make or break Paladins for tanking.<br />
<br />
To your credit, I would consider this a different issue if the 230 HP scaled.</div></div><hr />

But when the difference between a warrior and paladin is around 800 hps, this closes the gap to 600... so if 230 doesnt make or break, does 600? And dont pallies always use our superior HP totals as arguments against warriors for balancing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly why I feel that pure melee and Warriors in particular should have mana to HP conversions. At the moment the only time you absolutely have to have a Warrior is when Defensive or Evasive disc is a must and frankly that is damn rare. Yes in my guild Warriors MT all the gods in Time, but that is only because we have good Warriors and we simply have never had to try a Knight. Plus in most fights Defensive runs out and the Warriors survive with no problems. Apart from raid MT situations there really is no motivation to select a Warrior tank over a Knight (apart from friendship obviously).<br />
<br />
Warriors in particular should stand out in some way and the only really viable method is via their HP bar.<br />
<br />
To highlight this a week or so ago a guild group I was in was looking for a group healer for a Takish adventure and we settled on a Paladin guildmate, had no deaths, noone even came close to death and we had to wait over 10 mins before we could get the next mission as we finished in plenty of time. Paladin was the only healing class in the group.<br />
<br />
Plus of course pure melee are all long overdue a tweak as there are so many mana regen/saving/spell improving items around that the hybrids and pure casters really have shot ahead in most respects.</div></div><hr />

That may put how much some Paladins value FT into perspective for you.  Same way I chose narandi crown over Tormax crown back in the day.<br />
<br />
Anyway its really too late to fix HPs but the easiest way would be to give warriors 20% bonus HPs that works on every hp they get from every source and give Knights a 8% bonus and give casters a 15% penalty to total hps.  Not the greatest balance method but it would spread things out a bit more like they should be.</div></div><hr />

Because without that, it would stack with Pot9, which combined with symbol would mean 100 more hp, 5 more mana regen.  And there'd be no need to click off the MGB'd 9 and symbol and ask for virtue on raids.  Like I need 3 mana regen when grouping anyway.<br />
<br />
Adjusting hps upwards solves nothing.  CH isn't complete anymore.  It does nothing to change aggro.  When you consider it, a warrior in defensive already has considerably more effective hp than anyone else.  Yet people choose to use knights in many places.  That sort of indicates that the hp on the knight matters, the hp on the warrior doesn't.  The suggestion of tweaking casters downward is dumber still.  Anytime you make casters weaker, aggro lock becomes more important.  No, if you're going to tweak some hps, the short term solution is to tweak knight hps downward for the high end.  And the reason I say that's a short term solution is because the ones with the best gear will still do fine in many situations and, since CH already isn't complete, give it another expansion and we're right back where we are at.  So there's really no point to doing that either.<br />
<br />
I don't agree that a 1-1 ratio of mana to HP would be unbalanced for warriors. I am a rogue and with a combination of Elemental and Time gear I have 1675 in + mana.<br />
<br />
That's one level of the game.  For my warrior at 60, she'd gain 600 hp from current gear.  In that range, most warriors still have a sizable hp advantage over knights.  A lot of class only armor worn at those levels, lower total hp gotten from gear, that sort of thing.  At that level, it'd be a bit unbalancing.<br />
<br />
The second problem with it is what happens when warriors start to regear themselves?  Can't look at the current mana.  Warriors aren't gunning for it.  If they get some, they get some.  But it's not something they consider at all.  But make it matter and that all changes.<br />
<br />
The third problem relates to that.  Current gear isn't based around that.  Which means many items that are warrior usuable would suddenly be nerfed or made non-warrior.  Warrior only items would all have to be adjusted, otherwise they are junk.<br />
<br />
And the fourth problem...can you hear the whining already from the raiders about how the takish 1492 plate bp has 200 hp and can be aug'd up to 240?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way I could see mana on armor becoming useful for pure melee is if they gave pure melee special abilities that used up a &quot;mana&quot; or energy pool, and it was based off of stamina, and mana on armor would increase that pool slightly so you'd be able to use those abilities a bit more often (depending on costs of the abilities, I'd say a 10mana to 1energy ratio?  It'd have to be decided).  Of course, then they'd have to make sure melee didn't have to stop and &quot;cast&quot; (like make them all bard-like in their use, or even instant) and you wouldn't gain benefits from mana regen buffs, and perhaps even not sitting.<br />
<br />
Or something like that. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Well a quick 'FIX&quot; to fix their LAZY ASS itemization policies for the last 4 expansions that have given more and more to casters and hybrids than to melee, may not fix everything, but would at least be a bone they throw to us poor sods who play melee.<br />
<br />
I mean honestly, Its EASIER to find 100hp/100mana caster gear than it is to find 100 hp warrior gear...  Thats a HUGE glaring error on their part, and they need to fix it. <br />
<br />
Making Mana==HP is not the best solution to the problems, but It would be a hell of a lot easier to implement than going through and re-itemizing every singe item in the game.</div></div><hr />

Friendship... and tradition, because if warriors don't MT in raids, why use them ?<br />
In fact most of the time we use warrior because more than any others the warrior class is a raid class... but things are changing and when people will admit knights ARE as good as warriors tanking in raids, we'll become half-monks for DPS and &quot;3 minutes bots&quot;. <br />
<br />
The Warrior need something but I dont think a 1hp -&gt; 1 mana conversion will do. It must be something more than hp : because the game is balanced to have 8khp tanks in VT and 10k in elemental, do you imagine that ? suddently you have 500 or 1000hp and the environnement doesn't change ?<br />
<br />
So maybe 3mana -&gt; 1hp, ans something else. Unhook disciplines, rework the useless ones (it means most of them), add new tanking abilities to warrior and not some crap like &quot;spend 15 AA to be able to protect your group from fear during 8 seconds, and you can do that once every 36 minutes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The other way I could see it working out is give us 1sec defensive bonus for every 2-4mana. So for a 100hp 100 mana item warriors would get an extra 50 secs worth of defensive. It doesn't fix the aggro issue but that's not what the topic of this thread was about.</div></div><hr />

You want to keep the mana regen because its a useless buff if there is no Druid around.  You can't use it when a Druid is around.  It serves no real purpose if there is no Druid around.  SOE might as well remove the buff from the book if you take away the regen.<br />
<br />
Ender is right.  The AC and HP on Aura are interesting but marginal.  The reason to get this is to gain more mana regen in cases where no Druid is available.  Screw the AC/HP...I love the mana regen.<br />
<br />
Which goes back to the point of the thread: What is there to balance?  Whether the gap between Warriors and Paladins is super wide or super narrow doesn't seem to have a baring on realitive ability to tank.  If Aura disappeared tomorrow Warriors wouldn't be improved.  If Warriors got something to give them another 230 more HP they would still not be improved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You like the mana regen.  I like the hp.  Between KEI/VoQ and some FT, I've got sufficient regen for groups.  If I felt like I needed more, I'd get more FT, more MC.  About the only time I don't is on raids, if I'm group healing a lot.  But there's druids at those.  So, given a choice between more hp when I don't care about mana and more hp and mana when I do care, to me, it's a pretty obvious choice.  That may change in time, but with my current gear, I like the hp.<br />
<br />
I know I'm not unique in that.  There's far too many paladins that don't want Pot9 because they want the higher hp total from virtue + crusader.  They pass up 5 more mana regen for a hp gain that's about 100 less (the ol' virtue vs 9+symbol dif) than the raw hp the spell gives.  Pretty sure they'd be pretty annoyed if the hp on crusade were to go poof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry but the only really 'dumb idea' as you liked to call mine I have seen in this thread is your idea of leaving everyone's hps alone and dropping knights hps.<br />
<br />
The gap in HPs is too small between every group of classes.  Rangers to Paladin hp is way too close as is paladin to warrior as is druid to ranger as is enchanter to druid.  It all needs to be spread out.  The right way to do it is to make items give percentage based hps or make classes only get a percentage of the base hps on an item... but that is much too complicated and sony would not go for it.  You could completely rework all existing itemization but of course thats not gonna happen.  You could do it through AA but thats another stop gap method of balance as the problem occurs early than the AA levels.   What you have left to bring the gaps back where they belong is simply class based modifiers to hps and thats about it.<br />
<br />
As for aura of crusader, I'm sure its different for each paladin.  Not everyone just cares about raiding, not everyone has a lot of FT.  On raids I never have mana issues but in an experience group with my FT3 and MC1 I always had problems with mana, especially if no Enchanter or bard in group and KEI fades/dispells.  I was simply stating how much influence some Paladins would put on that mana regen, there are a lot of sacrifices made in gear for a Paladin before raid levels, especially for FT and focus effects.  300 more hps would almost never save me, 20 odd AC doesn't really matter to me but keeping my mana levels up in a group so we can pull faster is priceless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might want to check out what the gap over time then.  Percentage-wise, it's about the same between warriors and int casters.  That's just for hp.  In terms of how fast people drop, well, casters drop a lot faster than they used to.  So defensively speaking, casters have lost ground.  Clerics used to sometimes use CH on my enchanter, in combat situations.  Now, never.  Even Arcane Rune is pathetically weak compared to other runes in their own day.  Yes, that's right, the mighty arcane rune is weak compared to Rune V or Rune IV.  It's the low aggro, no component, and better ratio that make it good.  So all you've really got that makes an int caster seem like a decent is the overpowered nature of high percentage slows.  Please don't make me explain why lower max percentage slows would be good for tanks, really don't want to have to spend the time.<br />
<br />
To add to that, the whole entire reason aggro lock is such an issue is because casters can't take a hit.  Do you really think that boosting warrior hp while lowering caster hp in anyway will make things better for warriors?  Yah, I can see why you put in the 8% increase for knights...after all, you've just boosted your demand as a tank even further.  (And that, by the way, is why it's a dumb idea.)<br />
<br />
As to reworking itemization, it actually is the easiest way to fix the issue.  It's really only for high end raiders that things break down.  That's when the gap between knights and warriors shrinks to nothing.  Everywhere else, it's not that big of a deal.  Only once the majority of hp comes from gear, only when the classes share a lot of stuff.  So you remove knights from a few items there, tweak some of their stuff down, or put in some warrior only hp augs in LDoN raids.<br />
<br />
However, the real question to ask is what good would it do?  When Complete heals aren't complete, what's a higher hp total really mean?  The warrior vs knight equation can't be solved by upping hp.  You can, however, make it worse by suggesting lower int caster hp, higher knight hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a paladin that joined my group routinely that at the same level (60), no aa beyond runspeed, in comparable gear and with virtually identical buffs was less than 200 hp behind me.<br />
<br />
Add to this disparity his aggro lock, utility spells, heals, marginally useful crowd control and his LoH and then try to tell me how he paid a price for that spellbook.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No and I never said it would.  This only talks about the hp balance which has almost nothing to do with warriors issues.  You could give warriors 5k more hps at the top end and it wouldn't fix warriors.  All nerfing knights hps does is gives paladin/sk's ranger/beastlord level hps and make them the tanks of choice which they are already becoming.  An 8k hp beastlord is a better tank than a warrior, SK or paladin as it is.  Casters survive just fine, there are enchanters in our guild that don't get worried when an elemental level mob is beating on them, that is just wrong.  I see casters with 7k+ hps buffed walking around, thats just wrong.  The entire system is just poorly done and there is no way sony is going to spend the time to fix it properly, what they will look for is a quick and dirty fix with very little coding.  To me a class based hp modifier would be the best way to go for them.</div></div><hr />
