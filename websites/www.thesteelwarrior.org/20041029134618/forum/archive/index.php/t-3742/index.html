<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dual wielding Bloodfrenzy with yak aug and a Blado of Carnage atm, but looking to upgrade.<br />
<br />
I really like dual, so I have chosen not to take a BoW, but instead go for Dark Blade of Warlord when we get one to drop. The question is what should I use as combo with it?<br />
<br />
Should I keep the BF with aug (maybe switch aug to anger III) or should I grab an EoE and aug that and just drop the BF?<br />
<br />
Soo...BF/DBoW or DBoW/EoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd check the DBotWL thread in the Overlord Sanctuary for people with opinions on it that already have it. I'd Switch the BF aug to Anger III when you can, 600 Anger &gt; Yak Stun. Most people would suggest still going for the BoW, and I would too. Its a great weapon from what I've heard, and I played on a warrior with one and I felt what paladins feel with aggro.. was fun :p</div></div><hr />
