<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read that twohanders with a delay under 28 can overcome their low damage bonus issue when your ATK rating is high enough.<br />
My question is at what ATK would my ornate greatblade (35dam/23delay) start to outdamage my basalt greatsword of the protector (45dam/35delay).<br />
If those two weapons had the same ratio it wouldn't be hard to decide which I should wield (clearly the one with higher damage bonus), but with the better ratio weapon being the one with stunted damage bonus I can't decide. <br />
Keep getting the feeling the greatsword outdamages the greatblade, seeing other warriors using the greatblade outagro me when I use the greatsword etc. but the greatsword has better stats (and looks sexier).<br />
Never did any parsing myself and was hoping on some advice so I can decide without spending a few hours parsing the two somewhere.</div></div><hr />

You can use one sword one fight, and the other another, and instantly see the results.  2h is quite random though.  I use a greater poleaxe of sorrow (35/24) when going for low aggro, and from behind the mob with standard buffs (1450 attack for me?) I get in the ballpark of 100 to 110 dps on average (with most offensive AA's).<br />
<br />
I have heard your theory about high attack discounting the damagebonus problem on weapons with less than 28 delay.  I think probably the issue is your attack vs. the mobs AC.  If a mob has high enough ac to mitigate alot of your hits, then a high damage bonus is really going to help you.  If your attack is enough to penetrate a mob's AC, then the lack of damage bonus isn't as significant.  At least, that is my guess of how it works.  You really are probably just gonna have to parse for yourself.  My guess is that the 45/35 will perform better.</div></div><hr />
