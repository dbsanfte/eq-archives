I have about 95k saved up and not sure of where to start. Please help me... Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you want to go hunt some armor, fix your faction with SS and get myrmidion armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JagdDoga</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What faction is needed to MQ the SS armors?  I've heard max ally and I've heard lower is fine.  Been beating on those ugly giants in Kael quite a bit and I think I've made it to.....amiable maybe?  Haven't checked in a while.  Anyhow, what's needed to be able to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ally faction is required in order to do the SS armor quests.  Max ally is not required but normally once you hit ally it doesn't seem to take long before it maxes out anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darkwood bow of suffering(1-2k maybe), two mosquito leg earrings(about 20k each maybe less if you find a deal), heavy rubicite girdle(not sure on price), chokidai hide pauldrons(15k maybe less if you get a deal also) and the rest save for whatever ornate pieces you can buy.  Those are lanys prices.  If you want a cheaper shoulder upgrade look for bonespur mantle(seen it for 2-3k before)  Small upgrade would be dented kunzar war helm, lose some AC for 4 more sta.  Otherwise hp is good enough to lvl to 65 probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">devlok</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really dont want to invest time into getting SS armor that is upgradable to Kizrak's. If the SS upgrade is better than the Kizrak then I will get it. I am looking more into finding out what is better from everyones perspective and which areas you think I need the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing you need to do is either get a BoT key or ding 62. Either should be pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Next, get enough food and drink to last you the next 4 weeks. Camp your ass in BoT and farm away until you either have some chain/silk/leather ornate to trade for plate or you get lucky and win some plate. You should be able to get at least bracers, gaunts, and arms from BoT. Legs, boots, and helm you might have to go to Tacics or Sol Ro to get, but with enough BoT farming you'll be able to just buy/trade for Kizrak's.</div></div><hr />

This will require at least 2 groups to do, then you will of course have to win the roll.<br />
Kizrak's greaves drop off named Deep south camp mob ( Garukn? can't recall his name )<br />
<br />
I wouldnt waste the time to get Skyshrine armor at all. What you are wearing is argueably as good.</div></div><hr />
