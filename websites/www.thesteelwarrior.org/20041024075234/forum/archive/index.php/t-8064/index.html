<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay my guild jumped onto this today, here is what you need to do. <br />
<br />
1) To the best of my knowledge, and according to everyone I've talked to, you have to do the OLD VP key quest. Before you can get your new VP key, you must have Key of Veeshan. Once you've completed that quest, you are really almost done. Apparently you can also collect 3 essences from 3 Kunark Dragons. I'm just posting the method that about 25 or so people used today to make their new keys.<br />
<br />
2) Go to Skyfire with a raid force. There are 4 orbs in Skyfire that when you click on them it gives some text about you feeling a power, blah blah blah. Once all have been drained, you go to the VP zone in, there is a new big dragon there, say &quot;I am ready&quot; and Suled Dar's Shade will spawn right next to the lavalake in the middle of the zone. <br />
<br />
3) Kill the Shade Dragon. We did it with 40 people, and he has very few hps, though his AEs are pretty mean. Was mainly just a zerg, but at a *guess* if you have good tactics and competent people I'd say you need at least 20 or so to do this. The info we have on him is only that's he KoS, redcon, perma rooted, mitigates slow, low hps. No loot on him.<br />
<br />
4) Loot one of the Tomes from the 6 ancient chests that spawn around the dragon. I think there were 6 chests with 8 tomes each, so that's 48 tomes for your trouble. <br />
<br />
5) Go back to the huge dragon at the VP zone in and give him the Tome. He'll hand you back Brood Dragon Blood. <br />
<br />
6) Go NW some of the VP hall in Skyfire until you find another named drake, who is indifferent to all surrounded by some guardian drakes who are KoS and hit hard, for Skyfire mobs(300, 400ish). Kill those guards, hail the named Drake, and say &quot;like to know&quot; and he will give you a 4-slot container, Drained Cipher of Veeshan. <br />
<br />
7) There are now 2 ways to make the Ciper of Veeshan, which is an any type 30/30/30 augment which will go in any gear. It is the new key to VP, and once you zone in, it's on your keyring. <br />
<br />
a) This is the way I know, that was used today in my guild. Take your old Key of Veeshan, put it in the Drained Cipher of Veeshan with the Brood Dragon Blood, combine, and you get it. <br />
<br />
b) This is the new quest, which is as of yet unconfirmed. It involves gettign 3 different dragon essences, from god knows who, but there are definitely 3, since it is a 4slot container. Combine those 3 essences in the Drained Cipher of Veeshan along with the Brood Dragon Blood to make the Cipher. <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, that's all I know. Sorry for not including any locs or anything, but this is my memory from doing all this stuff this afternoon, and I'm too lazy to get the specific details for spawn locs and stuff, but this is all accurate as far as it goes. As I type this a bunch in my guild are working their way through the new VP atm, all of them using the old key, and getting their Brood Dragon Blood from the kill this morning. <br />
<br />
But I don't have my key done, so I get to be bored and post stuff :P <br />
<br />
GL on the new and old quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scrabler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where are the 4 orbs in the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would suggest you have a druid port you in and then look really hard for an orb-like thing.  I think you will be able to find it :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sargeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">4 orbs = the 4 giant statues showing Norrath's formation with Veeshan towering over it. They rotate, but will stop when you click on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the essences are in old seb, howling stones, karnors. off random trash. then you do the raid to get the blood when you turn in the book.<br />
<br />
or you do the old key then do the raid for the blood and get the aug.<br />
<br />
peeps who killed him today said he was like xana in poi. just a bigger aoe and some nockback.<br />
<br />
as i currently understand it. and yep 48 keys max it looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rulan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What do I do if I just want the container to put the essences in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What do I do if I just want the container to put the essences in?<br />
<br />
Go talk to the drake near the VP zone.  He has a bunch of kos wyverns in front of him, so bring a group to kill them or a kiter to get them out of your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thx zhakran, good info!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you do not.<br />
<br />
There is a totally new quest that you can do for the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I am EP geared, and have my old VP key (recently finished b/c of the revamp) but because of my job I am not on during raid hours. I would like to express my displeasure to any SONY that it takes a raid encounter to get the new key when the old one was easily accomplished solo. Someone like myself can find pick-up groups in the zone or even a pick-up raid on my days off but the chances of finding a guild doing a Shade Dragon raid on one of those nights is slim. Very typical that they once again did not consider the small guy. I guess it was too much to hope for that they would put a zone in that was EP calibur and accessible to the casual player. My irritation stems from pure disappointment... b/c I was looking forward to seeing the revamped zone, especially since I have never been there.<br />
<br />
ANY GUILDS ON CAZIC-THULE that are doing this raid during the day or on a Tues/Wed in July please look me up so I can tag along if you have room.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sargeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I didn't even have to kill the mobs around the drake. I just hotkey'd the phrase to say to him, ran in, hit they key, and ran out. I had the drained cypher on my cursor. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">bah theirs a chardok essence dunno were i got the zones messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sargeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We went to go get ours tonight, and the orbs were drained. I wish I had known that before I had everyone run over, kill the wyverms, get their containers, buff, and then get ready to move to Saled Dar's Shade. Dry Sapara should tell you that the orbs aren't ready when you say you are. We had no idea till someone went to click them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">there's much fun to be had with pickup raids too... especially when your raidleader lets 52 people join in and after all is done someone goes on a bitching frenzy about how they clicked one of the orbs and without them the raid would have failed horribly.<br />
<br />
comedy gold people, comedy gold. i'll make sure to join as many pickup raids as possible :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I actually got to attempt this today and unfortunately, we failed. Going to have to review the tactics to get past Shadey =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doh!  Don't worry you'll get him.  You just have to be ready for those AEs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just checked Alla.. and I thought the essences would be rare or uncommon off of junk mobs in chardok, seb, or howling stones. Noooooooo sirree.  Turns out the HS essence is off trash, but the chardok and sebilis essences are off of &quot;Echo of _____&quot;s.  Lvl 68 mobs that hit for 789, AE for 2k every 60 seconds and have 55khp.  Now, if they dropped 48 essences or whatever, that'd be super. But guess what, they drop 1! 1 Goddamn essence each.  What the hell.  I guess Sony wants us to spend 10+hours on keys whether it's old school trak tooth way or essence way. =(</div></div><hr />

Sony has always had long drawn on quests.  This one, however, has some exceptional rewards if you are on the right faction.  /shrug</div></div><hr />
