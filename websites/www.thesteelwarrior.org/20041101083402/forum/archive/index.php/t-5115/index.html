<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some people say being riposted is a small amount of the damage we take.  Others disagree, saying riposte damage is ebil.<br />

I did something novel.  When in Hard LDoNs, I asked my normal exp group clerics.  They said that 2h made their jobs a lot easier, and that they prefer that I use my 2h weapons then.<br />

Someone else said that riposte damage is only like 18 extra DPS.  Doesn't sound too bad.  The problem is, however, that it isn't 18 DPS.  It's 950 damage Right Now Dammit, and maybe 0 extra DPS for the next 30 seconds.  And this is what makes the clerics nuts.  When you get tripled, then riposted twice, you can see 4700 HPs disappear in one round.  If you weren't full up, and if you cleric fizzles a spell, you could be pushing up daisies in short order.</div></div><hr />
