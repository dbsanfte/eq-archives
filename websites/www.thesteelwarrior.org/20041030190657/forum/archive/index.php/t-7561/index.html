<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anakun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay i am seing a few diffrent recomendations on this idea.  My guild mate Tells me that now that AC cap is not 1300 that 1AC = 11 HP when deciding on peice of gear to spend raid points on. What is the consensus on this issue please?  Have things changed now to where the old belief of 1AC=5hp?  When chosing gear should i go for more AC or More HP?</div></div><hr />

Go for both if possible, common sense suggests that a 100hp 35 ac item would be more valuable than a 115hp 15ac item if you were less than 2k AC. unless your given slot was such a terrible item that you needed the pure Hp right then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still go on the basis that 1 AC = 5 HP when looking for gear. From most everything I have read here that is the general opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1ac = 6hp = 1sta until capped, in my world. The ratio can vary, especially depending on where you are mostly at. Anywhere pre-PoP is still basically soft capped for ac around 1200-1300.</div></div><hr />

 I am Assuming that you meant 6 hp instead of ac. I appreciate the input so far.  I am more concerned with PoP and GoD content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well fortuantly at 65 you should stop having to make the AC vs HP dicision as everything will have both. About the only place I have to decide on the two is Ornate vs Sands armor. And at this point I would strongly recomend saving the points and having them around for a second or 3rd peice of elemental+ armor... that I think we plate types will get from the orcs (or at least they are due the next set of plate armor...and Kailyn with a whopping 2 wins there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oops, of course. Editing it to be right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am more concerned with PoP and GoD content.There is no known AC cap from PoP forward. The deeper in to GoD you get, the more important AC and shielding become. I would say that 1ac = 5hp or so once you get to PoP. On an item that is pretty close using that ratio, I would take the AC item first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">that makes PoP, ykesha, ldon, GoD, and soon OoW in that order. that sounds like the very large majority of the content most level 65s would do. in other words it sounds to me like the &quot;AC cap&quot; is a dead concept. indeed even for the level 20 there is ykesha and ldon making up a large percentage of the content many of them do as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
personally i'd go with 1AC = 5hp formula till you hit 1850AC (current soft cap?)  after that each AC is only worth maybe 1 to 1.5 hp I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Softcap??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No one has found a real soft cap for PoP or GoD. It naturally depends some on the mob, but more ac seems to be pretty much always better. At least I've never seen any reason to change my formula.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get all of both you can hehe.The determing factor will likely be opportunity more so than adding up a wish list of stats.AC is always important ,but, early in the game raiding in velious hp is often the determing factor in tank order.You need enough hp so one- rounding with proper heals on any particular mob  is unlikely.Once you have that plus a cushion ac begins to weigh more heavily.<br />
<br />
Generally,pre elemental raid tanks have to chase hp and try not to neglect ac to ma.Once you hit ep's the best upgrades are usually visable slots namely raex so your choice's are to some degree pre determined if you seek the best bang for buck.Often it is more  important in knowing what content will best up grade which slots for how long and being able to afford it.And erm luck!Sorry if I made it worse<br />
hehe. :)<br />
<br />
Yeh ,more ac is always better.I've noticed a huge differance in substancial ac leaps when I duo with my wife ...shammy heals.</div></div><hr />
