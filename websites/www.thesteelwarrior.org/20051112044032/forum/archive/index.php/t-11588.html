<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got my first epic, the Wall of the Dead shield, level 45.  Its better than my level 54 green shield, but not by a whole lot.  I am not a protection warrior and while I could get some use out of this shield, I would get more out of it by selling it.  <br />
<br />
My problem is, what to sell it for.  I was originally going to auction it for 20g, 100g buyout on the AH.  My guildies told me not to, that I could get a lot more for it.  They talked me into 100g start bid, 300g buyout.  I do not think it will sell for that though.  What are y'alls opinion.  It purple and to me not worth that much, but people seem to spend a ton on minor grade purple upgrades.<br />

<br />
I did manage to get an offer of 60g and 80g, so if I cannot sell it for at leasst 100g, I should be able to get decent cash.  Dropped off a Firegut Ogre by the, random world drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I will say that if the server is old and you have allot of 60's with epic mounts and whatnot running around it would be safe to assume that they have some twinks that they would part with a few hundered gold for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the problem with our server may be that it is just coming of age.  People are just starting to hit 60 and haven;t had the chance to level and twink alts.  If I can get 80g for it, I would be happy.  That would make the path to 60 so much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krelm</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if the AH fees aren't TOO high, list it once for the crazy money. You never know.<br />
<br />
wowecon.com might have sever specific data, but its a little spotty. <br />
<br />
PS: I got one the same way, but was foolish enough to equip it! =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">got 100g for it.  Worked out fine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pff, a guy I knew got 500g for a purple shield. <br />
<br />
Shouldda tried for more at least once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a level 45 shield, when there are blues that are better and eassier to obtain?  It was already sold when i got home last night and I am happy with it.  Getting all my skills and upgrading armor will make the road to 60 much easier and PvP better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People are fuckin crazy.<br />
<br />
I see level 45's all the time with Purple weapons that I know damned well they didn't see drop. <br />
<br />
There's money out there.  A lot more than people think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WotD is one of the more common purple/shield drops, plus it's at a low level. 100g isn't a bad harvest.<br />
<br />
Skullflame Shield is another story (even though I think it blows).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZsGohan</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i saw a Woth sell for 190g yesturday even though my severs econ is like going down badly.... were getting alot of new people but stuff like breaths of wind or large glimmering shards are instead of 6g 1-2g enchanting prices had gone down! it just when u want to buy but not sell</div></div><hr />
