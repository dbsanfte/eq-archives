<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Artificial</div><div class="date">03-27-2004, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been on and off casual for 2 years now, levelled this character as well as a cleric to 59, and I'm trying to decide which I want to keep playing(or if I want to keep playing either of them at all). Anyway, spent a whole lot of time in the bazaar, buying low and selling for profit, as you can probably tell from my gear. Been told I have decent numbers for my level(and race) but I know I could use some upgrades. Got about 20k in the bank and another 15 or so in items, if they sell. Trying to get out of the bazaar scene for a while, so I'm going to spend my money on upgrades. Bloodmetal seems logical, but they're 25k a pop, at least. Would I be better off going for a better haste item? Or 2 cheaper earrings? (mosquito leg and lupine frenzy maybe?)<br />
<br />
nm bought lupine frenzy earring and new mask. thanks though</div></div><hr />
