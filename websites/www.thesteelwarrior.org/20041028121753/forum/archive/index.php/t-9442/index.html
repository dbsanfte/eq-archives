<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would xp in OoW zones or GoD zones be better at 65?  I currently spend most of my time in BoT since I am not flagged beyond that.  I need to get some AA and am getting frustrated at the rate they are coming.  I can usually throw a group together pretty quick and BoT is a little to easy at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my opinion OoW is better. The mobs are higher level, have a bit more hp and hurt alot less thus far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think BoT xp is better than GoD xp, heh.  At least in my limited GoD experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where were you fighting in GoD? Barindu/Ferubi, Sewers, Vxed, and Tipt are WAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sure, OoW is better, if you can tank it and your group can support you efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you have a regular group of friends that you play well with WoS shouldn't be a problem at all. pickup groups might be a little harder there depending on the caliber of whatever healer you get. with your gear and aa i can tell you that WoS and the DH expiditions are both very doable, perhaps not easy but a far cry from impossible.<br />
<br />
in the right group i have found them to be far better xp than BoT and a bit ahead of GoD easy grinds like pool of sludge. this isn't 100% accurate, but i think it's probably close enough. if your group could chain pull kreigers for hours with no problems, you'll probably have few issues with grinding nice xp anywhere in the easier OoW zones.<br />
<br />
something else to mention, if you're looking to grind AA and planning to stay at 65 till you round out a few more defensive ones, and you're having trouble tanking in OoW, you might be able to round up some folks for the easier instanced trials in whatever the hell GoD zone they're in. i got faster AA in there than bot before oow came out, and hell, even if it was the exact same xp, it would still have been worth it to just not be in bot. loved the zone...but the people...jesus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oow is nice. I boxed with my shammy last night in the east cave in WoS, and was getting 7% aa per kill on my warrior without shaman in group. Ferans, chimeras, dragorns, and bazu can all be killed by me with ~9k / 1720 partially buffed and a shammy in sub par gear.<br />
<br />
Draniks hollows expeditions aren't as good exp as MPG or even WoS unless you get a 68+ group killing fast, but rune drops are very common and easy to get. Vxed/tipt with a good group (charmed pet or two) are still some of the best AA exp i've had, as are the pofire camps, but oow exp is almost as good, and can be done with pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya we almost always have 2 mobs in camp in BoT one about to die and a second so we don't have to wait on the pull and we do that non-stop except to replace people here and there.  We keep our pullers on the run.</div></div><hr />
