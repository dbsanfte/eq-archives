Invis looks cool, Breath of Ultor looks bad ass, nukes look like nukes and so on...but god damn it, Enraging Blow still is white/purple globes that make it so you can't see. When you get a few back to back procs you really can't see anything.<br />
<br />
They did an amazing job with Sanity Warp, (Don't know what other spells use the same particles) it has red fancy symbols that flash around the mob. I just wish EB was changed to something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I agree would love to see a new effect for EB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice?  They're not nice.  They  look like shit my 2 year old drew on MS paint.  They're fuckin spammy garbage.  Fuckin regen COMPLETELY envelops the toon you cast it on.  Aside from that fact, been in a group with a bard yet?  Warsong of Zek now has a goddamned sound effect -- the one that used to be for the cannabalize line.  It spams every 18 seconds and drives you fucking crazy.<br />
<br />
I really fail to see the reason for changing the fucking spell effects every couple of years.  THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE.  I really miss the days when you could tell what level someone was by their spell particles.  Buffs used to be just green particles, then at 24, they added orange, then at 39 you get blue particles too.  Fire spells at level 1 looked like you were trying to burn the mob with a lighter, but by 39, not only did a massive fireball envelop the mob, it also lit the ground on fire too.  Those were the glory days of EQ.  It's quite obvious the people they have doing artwork now have no more than 1/10 of the talent of the original people.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, the old spell effects caused tons of lag, the new ones hardly lag me at all, even if they looked like crap it would still be a good change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the new spell effects are no different.  The original spell effects were fine, and it was the knuckle draggers that decided that Luclin needed to raise the system requirements that caused all the problems in the first place.  Heals, Regen, resist buffs are all fuckin ridiculous..it's like looking at the sun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Turn your opacity down to about 20% haass - it helps the blinding quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think that the fact that they changed the SOUND on the spells sucks.  I multibox always, usually just twoboxing, but from not constantly looking at a casters monitor I've come to rely on the audible cues that the games gives.  Completely changing those cues for no good reason really erkes me.  Particuarlly things like Ethereal Elixir now has the EB/shielding &lt;ding&gt; sound!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Force shock is this huge white pillar of lightning now.  Looks really cool in third person but it is really hard to see anything in first person when it goes off.  Turning opacity way down helps a lot but usually on raids I don't have spell effects on anyway so its no big deal when it matters most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Force Shock on 3rd person looks really neat :D<br />
<br />
Like a sky lighting strucking the mob down, much better than the &quot;Red Light District&quot; lights :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the new effects, a bit bright tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venz</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree with haass....the new spell effects are nothing but a distraction. i was on my rogue, duoing with a beastlord, who's pet proc (something having to do with vermin)  now looks like a darkness spell. It goes off constantly, and before this wasnt an issue because it was like a transparent green that you could easily see through. But now, its this thick black smoke that hangs in the air forever and covers the whole damn mob. I kept getting &quot;you are too far away&quot; or &quot;you cant see your target from here&quot;. Also, i keep my spell effects on low, and its still ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they are pretty rad looking, but goddamn I still can't stand to have them on while meleeing. It's even worse now. Not only are they distracting, but some of them are downright obstructive. Losing mobs in smoke sucks. I will try turning opacity down and see what that's like, but even at low the new spell effects cause a lot of problems for me. I turn them on when I'm not in a group though so I can go, &quot;ooh ahh.&quot; heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">spell effects are ok... but sounds, SOUNDS !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the new spells effects to an extent. Alot of them are very well done, however the necro spells are annoying. Whoever thought up of a super thick ring of black smoke can go to hell. There is a another spell that is deep red and is thick as hell also. Those cover up the mobs half the time, but other than those 2 stupid spells, the rest are really nice.<br />
<br />
I would turn them on for a regular group, but in a raid, forget it. It's way too much to  look at when you have 50-60 people casting spells.<br />
<br />
They did a good job, but no one will leave them on for raids. why would you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think that spell effects do look better, but the thing is with insane mana regen and all the amount of different spells/ clikies/pets/whatever ppl have these days they are totaly distracting. Half of them are so sparkly whoopy do that you can't pay attention to anything but the spell and it takes up all of the view. So I have them off most of the time and dont miss them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had spell effects off since about 3 weeks before PoP went live. I don't miss them.<br />
<br />
I turned the new spell effects on for about 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
They're shit.<br />
<br />
I agree, OLD spell effects rocked. I think that spell models should be simple.<br />
<br />
a little floating skull for fear. a little flame wisp for nukes, or whatever. Not these horrible random messes of shit that take up my screen.</div></div><hr />

I can now actually turn them on my shit computer without immediately going LD.<br />
<br />
Not only are they less laggy, but I think they look spectacular.<br />
<br />
Of COURSE spell effects wouldn't be considered an issue to a bunch of warriors.  But by and large the casters are extremely pleased with the new changes and they enjoy ooohing and aaahing over it.  We needed an upgrade to our spells - you could date EQ by the spell effects alone.  And maybe some folks like the old glory days, but I like feeling like I'm playing a game that is up with the times....at least marginally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the are less laggy and they look great but they need to fade faster dangit.<br />
<br />
black smoke a red ring effects are bad because they hang in the air so long, it would be ok if it was a quick bing bang boom but no, its got to linger and linger..... that is the problem, because while red effect 01 is still linger spell effect blocksmog 01 and brightbluepulse 01 are also going at full strenght.<br />
<br />
<br />
if they went away fast it would be perfect</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I turn particle effects back on just to oooh and aaah over my beastlord's epic flames.  But it always catches me by surprise when I'm triple-hydra with my druid on the other computer, and I glance over, and she's got spell effects on, and I'm all &quot;Wooo!  Little flying bugses!

If I leave them on too long, even on a low setting, and I find myself getting very dizzy.   I guess you could say sensory overload. =(  <br />
<br />
From what I saw of them (all of 10 minutes before I started getting dizzy), I hated them.  I won't get into the changed sound effects , that drives me nuts!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I also agree that the EB proc effect needs to be CHANGED.  It sucks and having it look and sound like MEZ sucks even worse.<br />
<br />
I do almost always play with spell effects off, and when I do turn them on they are at 30% opacity and LOW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the new effects. Lots of people are complaining about the black smoke but that is one of my fav's.<br />
<br />
I would have to agree that the regen spells need to be changed big time, i can understand heals engulfing you but regen, please!<br />
<br />
It would be nice if they toned them down a bit for lower lvl toons!<br />
<br />
Over all a huge thumbs up. Raids i still turn them off (mainly because i have peeps names off and spell effects makes it difficult to find people) but as soon as i am off a raid they are right back on and my group is saying, &quot;alright already we %@# get that you like the pretty sparkles!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with the smoke ones. I was able to play with them on in an exp group until the smoke came out. I'd like to filter it down to where only my spells show up, and perhaps adjust the fade speed like the chat windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will say this about the coolness of the effects:  SOE managed to make the most worthless fucking spells ever have the coolest effects.  For my chanter, Uproar is bar none the coolest effect I have.  And I will use the spell when SOE's server connectivity issues are actually solved.<br />
<br />
Root and snare are awfully cool, as is lightening - it's just crazy neat to see a caster actually blow lightening from his hands and onto a mob.  When I envisioned the spell as a D&amp;D player over a decade ago, that is exactly how it looked. <br />
<br />
As for the black flood shit...I think its a nerf on Shadowknights.  Makes it so no one wants to group with them now so as to avoid spell lag. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Enchanter was awestruck and didn't do anything but stare at pretty colors for a while (In her own words, she got mezzed) , and the shaman said WOW and begin to chaincast every spell in his inventory to check out all the effects :/ I couldn't get agro off him with Spirit of Rage or Incite for 5 minutes :P <br />
<br />
The effects are awesome, from the single globe running ontop of your head with sparkles coming down when you get healed by Tnaggs' mending to the writhing lightning cascading up and down a mob from a beastlord proc. I like the enchanter line of nukes best, where you get  !@$@!!@@ symbols flying around the mobs head $$$. <br />
<br />
True, they aren't the best, you might have seen some better elsewhere, but I seriously disagree with you if you say they suck outright. They are nearly lag free, and even at 15% opaq I enjoy them.</div></div><hr />

The lightning spells are super cool, as are the fire.  And the root effect just rocks.  The ice spells are also very cool, with the snowflakes flurrying around.  Sometimes you can't see and it hinders gameplay, and some of the effects just last too long, but otherwise I like them a lot.  I haven't played with opacity, maybe I'll turn that down and see if that helps.</div></div><hr />
