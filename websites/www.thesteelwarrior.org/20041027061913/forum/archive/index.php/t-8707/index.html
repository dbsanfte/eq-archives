<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im on to your secret warriors! Due to the info from an insider at TSW, lets call him Clatius to keep his anomninity, I have learned the truth! You dont wear all that gear for its armor, or stats. You wear the plate because its the only material that can keep your huge PAUNCHES in check! Admit it! You are so ashamed of how out of shape you are in comparison to us super sexy monks (who proudly show off their 6 pack abs) that you wrap yourself in about 30 pounds of steel (the other 100 pounds that you claim is from the steel is actually your beer bellies) just to hold your massive spare tires in check! Chain would leave unsightly marks, leather would tear and coth would explode, so all that is left is the mystical, magically strengthened steel!</div></div><hr />

 Listen you blithering idiot, nobody was talking to you, I was playing around, and obviously the repeated falls on the head you recieved as your mother kept trying to kill you has left you without the mental capacity to understand this fact. Here, maybe this will get rid of you. I heard there was a scratch and sniff panel on the bottom of your local pool. Why dont you go and check that out?</div></div><hr />

 Yeah I just couldnt resist. Im not surprised in the slightest you have been asked for kei, I think every class in the game gets asked for buffs, no matter how uncaster like they appear. Oh and Isk, double :( :(</div></div><hr />

your sentence should have been &quot;Whens the last time you saw a wizard in pijama melee a dark blue to death ?&quot;<br />

BTW my little contribution to this topic :<br />
Dobbanz, your mother is so hairy that when she goes out with your dog, that she's whom one cherish.<br />

Like them or not  warriors and tanks in  general  have  zero too  do with  monks other than to  come here and vent.   And  it makes the  people at SoE sit back and chuckle cause as long  as   retards  from both  classes are picking  at each other like a couple of BITCHES then maybe , JUST maybe they will  forget  about  who makes  the descisions that effect  all of our gameplay.</div></div><hr />
