<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FarlanderB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tank's charisma or the cleric's? I know there is a recent post that mentions this I just can't find it. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tank's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sux0rs to be an ogre~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenakha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh yup, gotta love how Ogres used to be the best tanks in the game.  Slam stuns, oh nerf that now kick does too, nerf it further neither one intertupts casters in PoP.  No frontal stun, now there's an aa you can buy to do that.  Great combat stats, oh those are trivial to cap by the end game.  Oh wait now how many years after I chose my race you make cha the most important stat for warriors and there's essentially no +cha on warrior gear?  Greeeeaaaat.  heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, as a barbarian I'm not exactly Mister Charismatic either. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya mean to tell me that I didnt totally mess up as bad as I always thought when I started my Ogre warrior ?  <br />
<br />
See back in those days, before Luclin and when I had only been playing a short time, faction seemed to be a big thing and I actually put points into Charisma :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thats funnier than this dude I know who made an erudite wizzy.  He saw his stats and thought &quot;he's got sweet int, but his wis is real low.  Better put my starting points there&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems BOTH have some effect. <br />
But warrior charisma is much much more important.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ketel kaotic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hrmm interesting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most mobs in PoP can still be stunned by kick/bash.  There's a point where kick/bash stun stops working and seems to be around 63 or 64 but it's hard to verify (since 64- mobs are all blue)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I usually have no problem slaming trash mobs to interrupt casting.. prob is they seem to &quot;regain&quot; their concentration an awful lot hehe....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they regain concentration then you didn't interrupt their casting with a stun from kick or slam, one can NOT regain concentration after a stun, only after x/y movement.<br />
<br />
I've never once seen a mob stunned in PoP with warrior stunkick or bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If stun works the spell will be outright interrupted the moment the kick lands.  <br />
<br />
I have stunned obsidian tree spiders/spiderlings with kick while my friend is kiting them so mobs are definitely not immune to warrior kick/stun.  It's just a matter of level.  Kick stun doesn't seem to work on BoT giants... at least not often enough for me to tell the difference betwen stun working or just an interruption due to getting hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've had kick stun work on BoT giants and Tactics pit mobs.  Though it didn't seem to do so until I hit 65, but I might not have been paying much attention previously.</div></div><hr />
