<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, Saturday my computer gets some sort of Generic Host 32 Failure message or something along those lines.  I think nothing of it and press on with my daily activities when suddenly the computer comes up with a box that cannot be closed saying something about a remote connection failure and your computer must restart.  Again, didn't think much of it and pressed.  It hapenned about every hour and then it didn't happen again for another 10 hours or so and on monday I get a rash of phone calls at work from friends (since we usually play EQ on mondays all of us together) and all telling me they have a similar problem. I'm thinking DAMN how is that possible... well how is it possible?<br />

<br />
Incase it happens to you here is the solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is another worm going out since monday.<br />
<br />
run your windows update to close the vulnerability it exploits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">indeed folks, keep an eye out for these</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted this on my guild's messageboard, but after reading a post here from someone who got hit with it, I thought I'd go ahead and post it here as well.<br />
<br />
Just a friendly (and hopefully completely unnecessary) reminder.<br />
<br />
Keep your antivirus software up to date!! And, if you are on a persistent (i.e. &quot;always on&quot;) connection like cable or DSL, you should have some sort of firewall up.  There are freeware ones available that will stop most &quot;script kiddie&quot; attacks.<br />
<br />
I'm writing this because today my corporate network is under attack (garden variety denial of service stuff) and also I've heard from 3 different friends in the past 2 days that they got nailed with a new variant of the mblast virus.<br />
<br />
Here's a scary little tidbit... You do not need to do ANYTHING for this virus to run.  Don't need to click an executable, open an email attachment... nothing.  This is from the Mcaffe site:<br />
<br />
The purpose of the virus is to spread to as many machines as possible. By exploiting an unplugged hole in Windows, the virus is able to execute without requiring any action on the part of the user. <br />
<br />
When run, it scans a random IP range to look for vulnerable systems on TCP port 135. The worm attempts to exploit the DCOM RPC vulnerability on the found systems to create a remote shell on TCP port 4444. It then instructs the system to download the worm to the %WinDir%\system32 directory and execute it. (The target system is issued a TFTP command to downloads the worm from the infected host system [TFTP UDP port 69]. <br />
<br />
Just as another personal note.  My firewall detected and stopped over 1400 scans targeting port 135 just yesterday alone.  (Of course, I have the update to windows that prevents this guy from working anyway, so it wouldn't have infected me even if I didn't have a firewall to block the incoming queries... but it's still a good indicator of how much activity is going on.)<br />
<br />
Also... download and install those &quot;critical updates&quot; from Microsoft.  Most of them plug security holes like the one that allows this worm to get into your system and run itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Perhaps someone reading this or you can answer me something.  I want to get a firewall going but I do not want it to interfere with Everquest or Neverwinter nights.  And, I don't really want a firewall like zone alarm which I don't consider a real Fire wall (maybe I'm wrong).  So, what do you GAMERS out there run as a firewall that does not interfere with gaming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use the Mcaffe personal firewall.  LINK HERE (http://us.mcafee.com/root/package.asp?pkgid=103)   It allows you to add programs to an &quot;authorized&quot; list and then grants things on that list full access to connect to the Internet.<br />
<br />
The only problem I had was the first time I played after I set up the firewall I got:<br />
1) a permission popup asking if I wanted to allow everquest.exe to access the internet - so I told the firewall to add it to the authorized list.  No problem.<br />
2) after the sign in screen, my game froze.  EQ had started a different executable (eqgame.exe if I remember right) and the firewall blocked it and asked me if I wanted to allow it... but the full screen thing kept me from seeing the popup box.  So I had to go in and manually add all the different executables that EQ uses (for patchers, etc...).<br />
<br />
Overall it took me less than 5 minutes to find everything I needed to set permissions for... and EQ has been running like a champ through my firewall ever since.<br />
<br />
The same applies to the other online games I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't run a software firewall, spring the hundred bucks for a Netgear, 2Wire, D-Link or similar home user firewall appliance.   Installing any of these Software firewalls will impact EQ and other applications, additionally they are complicated for normal end-users and often not configured correctly and lastly even when a network person like myself configures a software firewall it can still be compromised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A software firewall isn't going to keep a good hacker out of your system if they decide to break into it.  <br />
<br />
However, it WILL block the types of things you generally encounter (script kiddies playing with their toys).<br />
<br />
And a good hacker won't bother spending the time working around your software based firewall.  Why bother?  If they are going to have to break in, they might as well break in where there is something more interesting than your EQ password or your pron collection :)<br />
<br />
It's kind of like locking the door in your car.  It'll keep the teenage joyriders out but it won't do anything to keep a professional thief out.<br />
<br />
However, your home PC is kinda like a Yugo.  A professional car thief isn't gonna mess with breaking into a locked Yugo.<br />
<br />
And the good software firewalls aren't hard to set up and configure.  I play EQ, UT2003, PlanetSide, etc... all with firewall active and no issues.<br />
<br />
Is a hardware firewall better?  Sure it is!  Does the average person need one?  No.</div></div><hr />
