<br />
If not bezerker, which is better from a dps / efficent use of endurance?  I know the different duration times, but, when you just want to add dps, which do you use?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think generally Fellstrike is better. Unless of course you can hover in the berzerk range, which means your most likely doing trivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer Fellstrike for Situation like this.<br />
Mighty strike looks cooler of course, but i think i'm doing more damage with Fellstrike (havent parsed though).<br />
If mobs have high AC or your ATK is low so you hit for little damage often then Fellstrike is definetely the way to go because it adds a fixed damage bonus  to your hits.<br />
When you crit you get a damage multiplier (1,5 or 1,7 ??? im not sure) but little damage multiplied with 1,5 is still little damage :) Named Shissars in SSRA for example, i'm hitting like a baby against them :p<br />
When i know i will be berzerk for more then the next second i will use MightyStrike.</div></div><hr />

Fellstrike does more damage even without any mods.  The new mods make it's outperformance even greater.  It still irks me that our highest level DPS disc from that era is useless.  Aggressive should be our best DPS disc and it's not even remotely close now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only time I use mightystrike is when soloing + berserk, or berserk in the arena PvPing and I want to cut through 6 or 7 noobs in under 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fellstrike is all I use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what about the new OoW DPS disc, Savage Onslaught? where is it ranked among these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morf</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use savage onslaught when fellstrike is down and need more dps, also it seems that it results in a crip every time with the throwing skill so I guess it could be useful for stuns in certain situations (works good in the arena).  It is on a different timer from fell/mighty and does less dps.  But can add some when they are down in situations like MPG trials when you need to squeeze out all the DPS you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only situation I can imagine using Savage Onslaught is when Fellstrike has already gone full duration, you have plenty of END left over, and you know you won't need to use a defensive disc for any reason so you might as well have another 5 dps.  In other words never.<br />
<br />
As the proud owner of both Aura of Runes and Savage Onslaught, I advise everyone to roll on the greater rune and let the casters have the rest of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Savage onslaught, imo, is kinda dinky.  According to lucy, iirc, firing off the disc not only turns crits to crips, but also increases your chance to crit/crip.  when i use it however, i dont see a difference.  Plus i usually only use this disc when im screwing around, and use my PLGS (75/65 from powater) .  The duration on the disc is so little however, that im lucky, with such a slow weapon, to land more than one crip, which is kinda disappointing, not to mention using it causes your endureance to drop faster than a prom dress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.  I don't have any of them yet but I have no intention of rolling against a caster for anything other than Bazu Bellow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree savage onslaught is kinda &quot;dinky&quot; as termed above, but it still adds DPS so I use it occasionally, mostly for stuff like MPG single group trials(Weaponry) where every bit counts. I dont use it in exp groups though, the endurance drain is too big long term, but for 10 min trials its fine to burn it all. I am looking forward to them fixing Cleave effects in the next patch, that way it might become a tad better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Savage Onslaught is good when you need things dead fast in an xp group, which happens a good deal in the instanced zones.  OoW mobs generally don't hit so hard so you end up losing due to running out of mana, and it's really hard to heal slower in a mess just because you're disced.  In those cases any offense you can do helps.<br />
<br />
It's also decent DPS that stacks with Fellstrike, which is still our best offensive disc unless Veteran's Wrath raises crits to more than 100% (at 100% Fellstrike still wins because it also raises minimum damage modifier).  The endurance cost on Savage Onslaught is pretty prohibitive though.  You should only use it in situation where you'd be likely to die (then the cost doesn't really matter) and Fellstrike is down, or in situation where you don't need to worry about what happens after the fight (like most ubers).</div></div><hr />

I always use fellstrike and savage when I want to do some damage, always enough endurance leftover on especially raids ^_~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fellstrike makes Lion's Strenght and Spirit of Might drop, the new direct + melee damage buffs from druids and shamans. So the questions is does 30 seconds of Fellstrike outweigh using Mighty Strike and having the buffs last an entire fight. Veteran's Wrath also increases the damage from Mighty Strike of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody parsed its &quot;decent dps&quot;?  Decent seems generous.  The word I would have used is &quot;insignificant&quot; but I haven't parsed it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebast</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Mighty Strike when the cleric has cast the CHeal too late and I want to stun the mob...ie just for another defensive disc.  I'm grouping with Clerics that still use Cheal as their main heal though, shouldn't be an issue for you at level 67.  Though I like the crips I get with my FAE :) when messing around with trash 900ish is my max I think LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know Mighty Strike works with ranged attacks, do any other offensive disciplines? I have been using MS on ranged fights, but otherwise it's FS on raids. I did use MS while berserk once in a LDoN when the healer went LD and the crips saved my bacon. :)</div></div><hr />

I absolutely hate using Fellstrike and seeing the disc do shit dps because if mobs dodging, parrying, riposting. I havent parsed it either, but I feel it is worth mentioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheb</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes offensive discs work with most if not all ranged attacks, i generally use fellstrike on ranged fights, and with a stonewood, most hits are 150 to 300 damage</div></div><hr />

My guild has alot of extra Wars and I have been working with them so we can time the use of Fellstrike on boss mobs to help with the burn down.  Needless to say 6 Wars using Fellstrike isnt huge but a noticeable increase in Dps on a raid mob.  Kinda blows Fellstrike removes Lion Str and SoM when you use it though (  About FS not cutting thru and giving nice Dps... Then you need to work on your Offensive AA that allow you to bypass the mobs defensives.<br />
<br />
As a side note I have to watch usin FS on raids as sometimes I pull agro from the MT when using it.<br />

Scaring the shit out of your cleric:)  My nightly partner is a terrificly fun cleric, and I cackled all nigh tlong when she kept getting shocked I was about to die and couldn't figure out why.   :)   :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have a shaman in the group it isn't to bad, I use Ms every time it pops unless we seem to be getting adds on a regular basis then i like to use FS to kill one of them asap. But then I Box a shaman when im bored and can run him to me to rebuff it when needed. <br />

&quot;I use Mighty Strike when the cleric has cast the CHeal too late and I want to stun the mob&quot; Kebast <br />

I like to use furious when cleric is late, but that just might be me.  I have noticed that when I use MS, it appears that I take more damage. Could just be lucky rounds on the mobs part.  Crit hits are judt more dmg, &quot;Savage Onslaught&quot; does crippling blows which also stunns the mob. and you appear to swing slower, hence reducing repostes.</div></div><hr />

What I meant was Low Health + MS = Crip's...which stun the mob.  But yes, on a three pull or something where I'm really in trouble I also use furious.</div></div><hr />
