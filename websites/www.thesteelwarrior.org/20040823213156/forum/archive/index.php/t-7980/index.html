<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tribute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to post this as bragging rights.  If you've never seen Aten Ha Ra or VT here's your chance.  The movie is okay, kinda dark.  The story behind it;  This was only our third visit to VT.  After a couple hours of clearing and 4 named kills we got our first shot at AHR herself.  We took our 41 member force into her chamber for the first time.  The fight went flawlessly without a single death.  Gratz Gathered Might on finishing Luclin.  Check out our other movies as well if you haven't seen those fights.  Also, I'd like to give Horrabull Demize a big pat on the back since he's been our MT for two years and counting.  P.S. I'm the blueberry in the yellow robe with the water pet.<br />

On a 3 meg cable line the 52 meg file will take me right at about 5 hours to download. As a compairison, I can get a meg every 3 seconds on a good server. I think I'll download it tonight while I'm asleep. ;)</div></div><hr />

Only took me about 20min to d/l the high rez version.  Traffic has prolly bogged it down, but its a good movie to watch if you've never seen Vex Thal.</div></div><hr />
