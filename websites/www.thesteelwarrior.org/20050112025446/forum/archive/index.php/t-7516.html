<br />
I have been playing the old man on Firiona Vie since the server went live, having a blast doing so.  I think I have become a pretty damn good warrior over time, and part of that success has come from the advice I have gotten from reading these posts.<br />
<br />
But my questions were getting a bit more specific over time, so I decided it was worth my time to get an account here and &quot; put myself out there for folks to mull over&quot;<br />
<br />
Details about Draugos?    Well, my guild is not a large one, it is one of those &quot; family&quot; guilds.  My work schedule and projects around the house make it difficult for me to play as much as I would like.  Consequently, I wind up missing raids and events and things during the weeknights.  We don't seem to raid like we used to months ago, and we normally wind up either forming planar groups or doing LDoN's ( which I am a huge fan of).   <br />
<br />
As far as raid targets, we don't do much, if any, planar raiding, although some of the guild members belong to guild-alliances and such that do that, I don't normally do much of that myself.  The last really fantastic raid we had where we did something I had been itching to do for a long time was taking out Derakor the Vindicator and King Tormax.  <br />
<br />
As far as buying much gear, I normally don't have a lot of money ( less than a few k...as I am a dedicated NBG guy...I know..foolish...but that is just me ) but recent upgrades have allowed for purchases such as my cloak, which I would normally not be able to either afford or win as a drop.  <br />
<br />
I am getting to the stage where the Fierce Heraldic stuff is just not &quot; enough&quot; for me, I see the lack of saves on that armor and just wince...I am starting to have serious amounts of stress figuring out what to do for new pauldrons, as what I wear now are really, really bad, in my opinion ( I switch back and forth between GPS and Bonespur Mantle depending on the availability of a STA buff)...my haste belt is needing to be replaced, and I have some friends with whom I intend to camp a Taelosian Runed Girdle at some point...not to mention the Spined Turepta ring as well...I am sick of Valorium...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I feel like I am at a point when I need some advice on what I should think about replacing &quot; next&quot;...I have around 500 LDoN points saved up and I am not sure what I should do with them, it is very tempting to get a pair of Royal Attendent Bracers, but I am also hesitant to do so without putting +40 hp into each of them, they are not a &quot; huge&quot; upgrade over the FH ones I wear now<br />
<br />
As far as AA's and such, I know this is not the place for the question, but I am almost done buying ID ...which will &quot; finish&quot; my ideals of &quot; Defensive Max&quot; off...I was thinking seriously about just slogging my way through Weapon Afffinity to maximize proc-aggro ability.   And with that, I have to say that I am completely satisfied with my weapon setup, and don't plan on changing it at present, irrepsective of something being better than the epic is...I always wanted to earn that, and since doing so, I would not put it down.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow, take a look over my Magelo and see what you all can come up with, a fresh perspective would be most welcome.  Please bear in mind that I am probably around the following percentages for grouping<br />
<br />
80% LDoN<br />
10% GoD<br />
5% different planar things<br />
5% guild stuff that would not normally have much to offer in the way of gear <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance <br />

Warlord's Steel Gauntlets drop in Ruk hard I believe.<br />
Loyalist shield quest for your back is a nice ac upgrade.<br />

And I know you said you were happy with your weapons but phew you can easily find a slew of upgrades over the epic in the bazaar for cheap.  CHoS with anger3 on it would go main hand and drop the split blade to the offhand and you'd see a nice jump in dps with more agro too.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a GBOS in main atm less it was changed, that's a great choice which should last you a long time.I would aug that with a3 before spending any ldon points elsewhere(got into your magelo-done! hehe).I like the CHSD off of Xanamech in POI.It's not a lot more aggro than the easily aqquired CHOS,but,it might run more to your taste and be fun getting with your guildies.Aug one of those in offhand next and aggro will really pick up I think especially with WA aa.<br />
<br />
For shoulders there's the strength of the elements quest a lot of people do.Also a fun thing for you guys to do might be to take down the mounted shade in PON at the end of the goblin tunnel.He dropped  some 30ish ac 65 hp shoulders for my group once.<br />
<br />
If you guys are doing HOT atm can look at some of the quests involving Doz and stuff.<br />
<br />
The first few levels of WA and Sturdiness in the GOD aa would be very nice for you to get next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With all of these high risk LDoN drop suggestions from Gorlab, since you'd be in high risk LDoNs anyway if you try for these, I'd also add:<br />
<br />
Trueborn Elite Ring from MM hard<br />
Lost Ancient Elven Ring from Mir hard<br />
<br />
...and save the 60k+ that would be shelled out per Earthen Resiliance ring.<br />
<br />
Great Blade of Storms you have in primary is pretty nice.  But like Gorlab suggested I'd replace the epic in your offhand.  Copper Hammer is cheap, and is &quot;faaaaaar&quot; better if you ask me.  Especially when Anger or Yak auged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DraugosGurdson</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice, guys, it pretty much tells me that I am dead on in my thinkings.<br />
<br />
With one exception. <br />
<br />
The epic stays offhanded, the GBoS with Anger 3 is more than sufficient, I have found, and as I buy into WA, I will get more procs and better aggro control ( I am regularly complimented on how well I do with the present setup).  Once I got it, I just did not like the idea of putting it down, and I don't plan on it.<br />
<br />
I appreciate you taking your time to look things over and give me a few ideas.   After mulling things over at work today, I decided that most/all of the upgrades that I could think of and that were suggested were not dramatic upgrades for things, and that I had neglected my neck slot for far too long...I am thinking, once again, that I might turn to EC Hard LDoN to pick up a Necklace of the Troglodyte.<br />
<br />
I am also not seeing a slot of Royal Attendent armor that is a large enough upgrade to justify buying just yet, so I think I am going to solidify my mask slot and back slot a bit more with a couple of +10 AC augments, the overall addition of 32 &quot; worn&quot; ac on two slots that I don't see myself upgrading for a good long while should be a fine use of the points ....for 1020 AP..I don't see an upgrade out there that will produce results of that caliber.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time<br />

On the matter of the Loyalist's Shield of Honor, well..yeah, that would be a nice back slot, but I will take 26 AC and 110 hp over 51 AC and 75 hp with no saves, the plan is to make up for NOT having that shield on my back with a couple of AC augments form Mistmoore.   I will spend far less time earning the augments than I will doing that quest.</div></div><hr />

Forgot how pricey those can get, I got mine from the guild so maybe not the best suggestion...oops. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
AC &gt; HPs &gt; all else<br />
<br />
So you are taking 35hps over 25ac which is a bad trade regardless of the saves.  Saves are essentially meaningless, with buffs/bards you can raise them plenty high.  Now not wanting to spend time to do a quest I can understand but if you ahd both items i'd have to sit on you (and I'm an ogre fyi) until you agreed to wear the 51ac back slot as it is so clearly better. :)</div></div><hr />
