<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, I figured that since the melee damage and shield blocking had been on the site for at least 6 months now, and the new expansion is out of the way, I had kinda assumed that they would actually have started to look at these things.<br />
<br />
While looking more closely at the upcoming updates and future plans sections of the EQ site, I'm come to realize something.<br />
<br />
It's been six months, and they haven't even *STARTED* the development cycle for these fixes yet.<br />
<br />
On the upcoming updates section:<br />
<br />
Here are some things we're working on for the November update: (Please note: my producer is making me tell you that in addition to this list, we'll still be bug fixing and maintaining the live game and that, while we hope to get each of these features in, nothing is certain. But this is what we're working on at the present time.)<br />
<br />
Self explanitory. This is what they're working on. The fact that they're not sure if they can get all the features in shows that that's a high load list... there's no dev time left to look over anything else<br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.<br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.<br />
<br />
In other words: We haven't started the development cycle on these items yet. We're too busy with the Upcoming Updates lists to spare any time for the Future Plans. We'll get around to this eventually... maybe... but don't hold your breath.<br />
<br />
It has become clear to me that all the Future Plans list is, is another one of those carrots. It's something to keep the player's interest and hopes up about what MAY happen. Not only that, but these plans that they have may just disappear with no explanation or reason, such as the upgrades to the drops in the lower tier planes, and the upgrades to the lower tier god's drops... that plan quietly disappeared, and I don't seem to recall ANY upgraded drops in the Planes that they stated. To top it all off, these plans rarely reflect actual priorities or plans for the game. For example: how many items on the Upcoming Ipdates list actually appeared on the Future Plans list at any time? The targeting, /consider, newbie help, they obviously have had plans to put these things in, why was it sprung on us instead of being put in the Future Plans list before they started the development cycle to get it in in an Upcoming Update?<br />
<br />
So, to sum up:<br />
<br />
Future Plans is only a carrot... a ploy to keep players hopeful about needed changes to the game. These Plans do not reflect their priority on the development cycle, and in fact may very well be the lowest priority of anything they're working on. Not only that, stated plans may disappear without an explanation or reason given, and items that are changed in the game rarely appear in it... items such as making the game more friendly for newbies, or targeting and /con changes don't even show up on the Future Plans list at any time... they usually go straight to Upcoming Updates, so they are extremely unreliable as to determine what actually is going to happen in the game. <br />
<br />
Future Plans is just another example of poor communication with the customers, and something that instills false hope. It HAD a lot of promise when it was implemented, but it's shown to be just another waste of time, especially since they can't be bothered to update it with ANY new information, they just copy and paste it.<br />
<br />
I have NEVER seen another company with worse customer service than SoE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 And the gist of this post was well known 6 months ago, for that matter. The only people who said otherwise were the deluded and the deluding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi this is the same shit we've been hearing for the past few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Melee balancing never had anything to do with warrior aggro.  It's most likely not even about warrior damage.<br />
<br />
It's not their fault you thought you were promised something that was never promised.  The recent parses showing up seems to suggest that melee DPS isn't as out of whack as people think it is.<br />
<br />
As for shield using, unless shields simply don't work with Knights, it'll be a nerf not a boost to the warrior class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please point out where I said warrior aggro had something to do with melee DPS balancing. In fact, point out where I brought up warrior aggro control in this post AT ALL. That's right, I didn't. That's because while it SHOULD be up there, it's not. Future Plans has never even mentioned warrior aggro, and therefore (obviously) has never promised anything about it. Altho I find your comment that warrior aggro having nothing do with melee balancing rather amusing... because it's ONLY one of the two biggest considerations when talking about the tank classes. You should probably clarify if you were talking only about melee-caster DPS balance, and no other facet of melee balancing.<br />
<br />
As for the parses, they are showing that it is indeed &quot;out of whack&quot;... but in regards to the actual differences that you're claiming are less than what people think they are, I for one am not surprised by the difference I'm seeing so far.<br />
<br />
Your claim that it would be an nerf and not a boost to the warrior class if shields didn't work with the knight classes is BS, and an extremely narrow minded view. While they DO have to be careful in implementing it, they don't have to be nearly as extreme as you're claiming. A simple restriction along the lines of limiting hybrid block rates to a moderately low amount, while warrior block rates can be significantly higher, would work just fine for balance purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want to know my idea of all this?<br />
<br />
They're taking so long to check out melee balance because they actually have to find some devs to get off their casters and hybrids and play pure melee for a while. :D  Apparently that's hard to find, there might be a couple warrior trader gimps tho...:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you people sure do not seem to understand why anything that remotely improves the Knights hurts the Warriors more than it helps.<br />
<br />
More narrow mindedness. As long as it's implemented properly with knights properly penalized in blocking rates to make up for their incredibly good 2handers, nothing could be farther from the truth. IN FACT with Furious Bash shields and a proper blocking rate, 1handers and FB shields could become a very good and powerful MT option. You're too closed minded to realize any of the positive implications of a properly implemented system though, so I won't further waste my time explaining it to you.<br />
<br />
I suppose next you'll say if you give warriors 400 more hitpoints, and you give hybrids 100 more hitpoints, that it hurts warriors more than it helps.... because those 100hitpoints remotely improve knights. /em snorts in disgust.<br />
<br />
 SoE only said they were going to look at the damage dealing aspect which, as far as anyone can tell, is fine.<br />
<br />
As far as anyone can tell? Who empowered you to speak for everyone? How do you magically know what everyone's thoughts on melee vs caster DPS is? Come off it buddy, speak for yourself... I, for one, think that melee DPS could be adjusted up some... which proves your statement to be false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Melee balancing has been synonmous with warrior aggro on these forums.  I see no reason to assume otherwise.<br />
<br />
The parses from Overlord's Sanctuary do not show anything wrong with pure melees as far as I can tell.  Just where is the pure melee damaging lacking on the high end?  <br />
<br />
For a class that has been crying about lack of aggro since aggro &gt; all, I'm surprised you don't realize that in any encounter Knights can tank at all, then they are better than warriors no matter how little damage the warrior takes.  Increasing the value of shields just means there are that many more encounters Knights can now tank and Warriors will not be needed for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron I forget are you one of the ones who thinks warriors are just fine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Phantron has been disillusioned for awhile now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axterix EnObelix</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it rather silly how blind many people are.  Look around, melee tweaking isn't being put off.  It's already happening.  Just go to the bazaar to see it.  Do a search for piercers, see how many are currently for sale that come from the likes of Veksar, the revamped Droga.  While you're there, look at a few of the new weapons designed for warriors as well.  Then stroll over to an LDoN vendor.  More rogue piercers with backstab modifiers.  And anger and yak procs for warriors, procs you can put on weapons that already have procs.<br />
<br />
Monks are still a bit left out, of course.  I'm thinking that's because SOE isn't quite sure what to do about them yet...nerf pacify/FM, make monks better than those abilities, or redefine the role of monks?<br />
<br />
Of course, people also like to talk about utility.  Anything powerful here isn't going to happen.  So this will really just be eyecandy.  Like if they put disciplines on seperate timers.  It won't be a huge power increase.  It'll even include a nerf or two (evasive and defensive would get longer reuse timers, guarenteed, to balance out the fact that you can use both).  But it would also free us up to use things like furious more freely or mighty strike for the fun of it.  Not huge power increases, but definately useful sometimes, fun at others.  Would be good changes, but they'd be minor in the overall scheme of things.<br />
<br />
Then people have zaney ideas, ones that aren't thought out.  Like the idea that warriors should have more hp.  That just leads to mobs that hit harder.  Which means caster that get hit die faster.  Which means casters don't want to get hit.  And that means...knights.  It's self defeating.  The only way warriors come out ahead that way is if warriors have more hp and so do the casters...basically everyone but the knights.  And that's better done by just nerfing the high end knight only stuff a bit, rather than mudflating most everyone.  Shields are another example.  Warriors don't have an issue being the best tank.  They are that already.  So even if a shield blocks, big deal.  You still lose aggro over it, which is something warriors don't like.  Unless of course knights can do it also, in which case as Phantron suggests, it'll just make knight tanks more appealling.  Now they can tank more mobs.  Added to that, if it's useful outside of raids, it has the same issue as more hp.  Warriors tank better, mobs hit harder because of it, non-tanks die faster if they get hit, non-tanks want to not get hit.  Unless, of course, non-tanks can also benefit from shields, to keep them in balance with how they are currently to warriors.  Which winds up being about the same as nerfing knights, while taking a chunk out of warrior dps at the same time.  Still self defeating.<br />
<br />
Anyway, except for changes to help monks, I'd expect more of the same, some itemization changes.  And maybe, if we're lucky, some eye-candy that won't really change much but might be fun.  And why would that be the case?  Because classes are not that out of balance.  That doesn't mean no changes.  It doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes.  It just means don't expect anything major or rushed.</div></div><hr />

After reading a post on concert hall about how rare bards used to be i went online and checked a bit.<br />
<br />
/ all shadowknights 65 - 11<br />
/ all paladins 65            - 8<br />
/ all enchanter 65         - 11<br />
/ all shaman 65             - 12<br />
/ all bard 65                  - 7<br />
/ all warrior 65              - 4<br />
<br />
Going to check the next days as well, but i guess its more like a trend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I don't give a damn about the new itemization trends that you are calling &quot;melee fixes&quot;.  Aggro proc = crutch.  Even the devs at the fain faires have said that.  Fix the CLASS, not the gear.  And for that matter, melee DPS may well be close to where it should be if you're 65 with 200AA, but where does that leave warriors for the other 64 regular levels and 190ish AA levels that they have to work through before they're &quot;balanced&quot;.   This stuff needs to be addressed from the ground up, with things that are innate to the character, not the armor he wears or the weapons he wields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even people who thinks warriors are worthless (like ourselves) don't have much to complain about our DPS which is what this topic is supposed to be about, considering the only thing relevant to warriors on the melee balance future plans is the DPS issue.  I have no illusion about shields being helpful for Warriors, and for a board that incessantly whines about how Warriors suck, you people sure do not seem to understand why anything that remotely improves the Knights hurts the Warriors more than it helps.  You should be praying that the shield improvements never go in because it will make you all that much worse compare to a Knight who uses those all the time versus you who normally have no reason to use them at all.  And it makes you do less damage than a Knight too.<br />
<br />
But like I said, melee balancing in this board is synonmyous with lack of aggro, even though the two have nothing to do with each other.<br />
<br />
It's up to you to believe whether our aggro is worthless or not.  SoE only said they were going to look at the damage dealing aspect which, as far as anyone can tell, is fine.  Therefore it is normal to expect no action on what isn't broken.  SoE never even said they'll look at the aggro issue beyond some generic 'we'll look at it' response from Fan Faire and I think that's also what they say about things like tradeskills.  At any rate, any realistic fix to the current aggro situation would not involve improving warriors in any way because it really doesn't matter how good you can do your job versus someone who will never mess up.  But feel free to keep on cling to the hope that there's some magic fix out there that will make you more attractive to a Knight that simply never messes up ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I agree with phantron, agro isnt the problem here.  I think that if anything the melee balancing will be looking at the damage dealing and utility (or lack thereof) of pure melees vs hybrids and vs casters.  Right now I would say that warrior agro is right on pare with where it should be.  What isn't in balance is the fact that knights have lots and lots of spells while warriors do a tiny bit more damage and tank about the same when not under /disc.  It just isnt a fair tradeoff.</div></div><hr />
