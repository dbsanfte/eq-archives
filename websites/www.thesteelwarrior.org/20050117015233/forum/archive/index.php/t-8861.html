I only have about 500p in the bank, but I'm in a pretty strong guild.  We've taken down TT, Saryn, Bert etc. and we are working on getting everyone SolRo flagged.  I'm not flagged yet though.   Compared to our main tankers my ac/hp are low.  I only get to about 1300ac/6400hp raid buffed.  I'd appreciate any suggestions.  Oh I do have a 59 necro who I could 'send to the store' for me so to speak..  Also I have some ef ldon points, but I'm saving them all for the anger3 aug.  About 6 more trips and I can buy one.<br />

Thanks.<br />

If so you could camp the piglet make about 10k a kill on my server with him not bad cash. Bloodmetal ears are like 15k each on server so about 2-3 hours on piglet could bag ya some nice HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nightfo0l</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">like I always say camp the named at BoT tower to get some named drops especially ornate which you can sell the ones you don't need, and use the ones you do.<br />
<br />
or solosek ro drops lots of ornates too i think</div></div><hr />

<br />
or solosek ro drops lots of ornates too i think If he does do Bot towers I'd assume it's with his guild and I doubt his guild would just give him ornate he can't use, it would go to the class that could. If you're talking about mini named then he has to actually win rolls for it because there is a lot of people who need ornate too or are just greedy. He's not Solro flagged either.</div></div><hr />

I asked a friend and they said that little pig is in the middle of a herd of them in some pit.  Can he be pulled solo? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice everyone.</div></div><hr />
