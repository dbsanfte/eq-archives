<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah, this sucks.  Part of the good that is GoD is that tards don't train you in those zones because they are too stupid to live getting there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yay make the game easier.......it's sad that enough people have feedbacked the difficulty of running through 2 zones with invis as being to much work or effort for them. :(<br />
<br />
Making people not depend on themselves for traveling to point A to B sucks, just more dumbing down of EQ i guess.... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Who here besides me died the first day of gates running to barindu 5+ times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Look at it this way: it's not a PoK stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can see a Nedaria POK stone coming real soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making the game easier indeed...but for whom?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why surprise?  This is standard end of the expansion stuff.  Access to older content is always made easier.  Velious port key requirements went away when Luclin opened.  Luclin origninally had no ports other than Nexus.  PoP flag requirements got downgraded a couple of times to let the unwashed hordes into places like BoT.  Hell, even the Kunark evacs got changed so that you no longer had to be in a Kunark dungeon.  Anyone else remember those runs from the druid circle to Karnors so that you could get to CoM?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Has nothing to do with Uber/non uber people, the content is there for anyone (gates 1 group trials). <br />
<br />
If players are too &quot;scared&quot; or worried about not being able to get to the zone safely, why bother going.  How hard is it to have invis potions available in your inventory, insta cast potions cost 12p, most classes have self invis, group invis, or an item that can be purchased or obtained. Being equipped with simple utlities to get past simple solutions is in my mind...being a smart player.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes..this was something to expect to happen towards the end of the expantion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So who exactly are all these petitions for a Barindu port coming from...<br />
<br />
To be honest I imagine this is at least partially an attempt to appease all the wizards and druids that scream that they need more ports to make money from.  Lord knows I heard enough complaining in PoK when the stronbrunt requests went belly up after to the stone addition there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">oh for the love of GoD (:p), stfu about &quot;more dumbing down of the game&quot;.  Every time the devs do the slightest thing to ease a time sinks, even such a simple change as this one, there's always a few people that say, &quot;this sucks! The game is being dumbed downed!  Damn newbs can go anywhere!  wah!&quot;  You probably lubz waiting on the boats too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Every time the devs do the slightest thing to ease some time sinks,  <br />
<br />
Running through a zone = a time sink?<br />
<br />
please refrain from the stfu bit, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If it makes it easier to fill a slot in a GOD group im for it. Lot of people still too intimidated to come fool around in GoD because of PERCEIVED travel dangers.  This might make it seem more acccesible and could liven the place up. <br />
<br />
But hell, I still want a PoK book right next to an LDoN adventure camp to speed forming up LDoN groups, hehe.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do remember a time when buying my first pieces of bronze meant running through 10 or 12 zones to get from Halas to EC. These trips were dangerous/exciting and really made the game fun, but now I guess Im kinda spoiled by the books and just like to get where im going and fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's amazing what people will whine about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, sounds fun and safe to group with a person who can't run through 2 zones invis....  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>TheHuzMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We did a GoD sewers expedition this morning. On the way out there, our BL went LD and died. When he came back in, it took 20 minutes for the druid to locate his corpse, get him rezzed and get the expedition. That was 20 minutes of me standing around doing nothing. <br />
<br />
No I'm not afraid to run through some invised mobs. At the same time though, I don't think this game is ALL about running through invised mobs. I'm sure you guys don't want to hear me brag day and night about my &quot;leet invis running skillz&quot;.<br />
<br />
For me the real game starts when we finally zone into that sewer. Making it so my druid can get us straight into the REAL action is going to be a positive thing. I'm sure I'm never going to miss that run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A better fix would have been to make the instant cast invis potions into 10 sec cast improved invis potions so you could have a full 10 min without it breaking.  I have personally used up to 7 invis potions running through the maze in Barindu before and that is just rediculous.  At 13 plat a piece thats a lot of plat to spend on stupid unreliable invis potions every week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just wish there was some way to avoid Natimbi in getting to KT... Natimbi lags my cleric bot out bad for some reason =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
doh' ! <br />
use invis, so the game stops calculating the probability of popping CBQ on your head while running through that zone!<br />
<br />
(j/k, Natimbi lag is worse than PoWater back than..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Natimbi and Qinimi are the easy parts.  It's Barindu itself where I see most folks die, on that long run to get out of the building and next to the sewers or the mts.  Invis. is a crapshoot, and there is nowhere to duck into for a quick re-invis.<br />
<br />
I don't find &quot;random death&quot; amusing in a game even when it doesn't affect my character significantly.<br />
<br />
Expect to see a chain of bodies stretched out before you, and trains to the zoneline to where you port in when the new port goes in.  Btw, is that port easily purchasable, or is it gonna be another 100K+ spell to be found in GoD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">GoD lore says that this new continent is a death trap ... dev tried to make it real ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">yay for lazy people</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yes, everyone running through the same zones over and over again to get to the fight gets to be a time sink, particularly when the zones like Barindu require that you be invised at all times and if invis ever drops, you are most likely dead.  Instant click invis potions can keep that problem from happening.  So personally I think Barindu was designed mainly as a plat sink by making those of us without invis burn potions constantly.  :p<br />
<br />
I've made this run enough times, thanks, and I'll still do it because I don't want to sit around waiting for a druid/wizard.  But for me, like another poster said, the real game starts when the group is together and we can actually start something.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'll try to be nice.  I'm just so sick of people wanting long travel times.  Go sit on the boat.  Enjoy.  I'll stick with as many PoK books and port spots as I can get.  Maybe the books should have had a minimum level to use them or some way to restrict access like the Velious port circles until you've been there without it, but other than that, they're great.  One of a number of reason GoD sucks is how inaccessible much of it is.  No ports, no binds... bleh.  Maybe they'll get smart and add some bind spots now too.</div></div><hr />
