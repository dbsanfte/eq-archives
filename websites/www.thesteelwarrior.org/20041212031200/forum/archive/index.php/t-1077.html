<br />
Now that we got that out the way, and avoiding all the other complaints about the warrior class (taunt, class balance etc)...what bugs me is that compared to other classes, little effort seems to have gone into the warrior class.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of the additional code for spell casters and hybrids ... bards and their song effects, casters spell books and spells effects, spell messages etc. AND, in the next patch all the new information that will be available (in game!) for them regarding spells, being able to save spell sets, shammies getting messages about just how much damage their dots are doing..<br />
<br />
... sweet mother of god, i dont even get a private let alone public flurry message after pumping 18 aa's into it!<br />
Another gripe.. even tho accepted as the most equipment dependant class, warrior equipment (or warrior only equip) is just not deliniated, remarkable or exceptional in any way.<br />
What do we get thats exceptional and different to other classes...? Disciplines and abilities of which so far (mid level raiding) I have found only 1 or two useful. <br />
<br />
A number of &quot;tools&quot; are given to ALL the other classes which not only defines them but allows them the freedom to develop strategy, to vary gameplay. Does a shammy root rot, or fight IN TEH FACE, does a BL mellee or nuke, a wiz nuke or kite ?..you get my point. The is no fundamental variations available to the warrior and perhaps there cant be..but dammit give us something to compensate, to make us not feel like second rate exp tanks. (Caveat - the one area where I hear warriors are essential and unique is in defensive tanking very high level mobs..fine and dandy, but what percentage of warriors get to do that...?)<br />
<br />
The more I play a warrior the more I get the feeling that it is an unfinshed class..or one just left by the wayside. In some ways I feel the solution lies only partially in &quot;fixing&quot; the class but what is more needed, i think,  is to give warriors something new and something defining.</div></div><hr />

The devs just dont seem to care.  Although Absor did pop in to plug the new non-transfer server and ignore all the threads on warrior problems.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chilly</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, well I have lurked here for years but mostly ignored the broken warrior posts in search of the useful tip ones. Its only after feeling very frustrated the last few weeks that i posted here.<br />
<br />
I do think tho that - based on what we have seen from the devs - there is more chance of them adding content than re-evaluating or fixing. In fact with the recent expansions and patches content addition has been fairly substantial.<br />
<br />
So a solution, if any, is more likely to be additive rather than a reworking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The warrior class has it's issues,  taunt being the main one.  Totle depended on euipement being another.  Is balance an issue?  yes.  Is class defining skills lacking?  yep.  <br />
<br />
However a group can tell a good warrior from a so/so one within the first 30 mins.  Macnair will be 4 years old on the 28th of this month.  I have seen the very best and worst of times as a warrior in EQ and even though we never got the sizzle,  we are still the steak.</div></div><hr />

Not sure why you said you don't even get a private message. Rampage on the other hand gives nothing to note it's use other then mass broken mes msg's at once ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the topic of the effort gone into warriors , i have just one beacon of light im holding on to ;) , if there IS a nice melee patch comeing  they might be adding these minor convenience's to casters to lessen the backlash when the melee patch comes.<br />
<br />
*fingers crossed*<br />
