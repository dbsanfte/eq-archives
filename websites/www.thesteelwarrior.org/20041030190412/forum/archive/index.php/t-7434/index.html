<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quartz428</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok guys i have a question for yah... <br />
<br />
I would like to pump my AC/HP up a bit and i feel a sheild is the way to do it... i think i will be able to keep aggro just fine with my one weapon and provoke (i know the effect of Furious Bash is broken). so i have 2 questions...<br />
<br />
1) Should i get the stormrider carapace (it's in the inventory)???<br />
<br />
2) If i do use said sheild... which weapon should i use?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance all... oh and Here is my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1030709)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sword of the bloodsworn isnt enough aggro to be using a shield with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarhl_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recomend getting the Loyalist shield of Honor (50AC 15STR 15WIS 75hp) and wearing it in your back slot - that will boost ac quite a bit and still let you dual weild/2HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, do not equip a shield like some knight. Any shield you put in will be much less aggro and dps than your average weapon, Just say no the shields.<br />
<br />
P.S. Furious Bash is not broken. It is working the way Sony intended it to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why do you want to bump up your ac?  You are already twinked beyond belief for your level.  Bumping up your ac I assume is so you will take less damage.  Equiping a shield will cause you to take less damage per second but your aggro will go in the toilet.  Now that your aggro is in the toilet your group will have to lay off the mob some which will cause the fight to last longer since your group is doing less dps to the mob.  Now the mob does more damage to you in total, just less per hit.  At level 48 one rounding a warrior isn't possible with experience mobs you should be fighting.<br />
<br />
I have a Stormrider Carapace.  When one drops all the warriors in my guild /random and the loser has to loot it if that tells you anything.  I use it ghetto bashing to interupt casters in LDON.  I also RARELY equip it if I am tanking a mob that pops adds during the raid script and I cannot damage it too much before the adds are dealt with or it will spawn more.  I also equip it once in a blue moon when a raid boss is about to enrage and I want to cut down my ripostes that I take until I can get attack shut off.<br />
<br />
In short, say no to shields for a warrior as it defeats what you are trying to accomplish.  I cringe everytime I see a warrior using a shield in an experience group or LDON other than to bash a caster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IF you are going to do it. Try a BoC and SRC. I don't recommend it btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a Blade of Carnage and a Stormrider Carapace.  I find the combo to be not enough DPS for XP groups, not enough aggro for Sol Ro/Tactics named, but occasionally useful for tanking lesser named when I'm feeling lazy.  I had great fun in PoSky with it, as MT for a couple dozen mid-fifties folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When i am tanking a mob that hits hard and defensive is about to drop, if i know i have sustantial aggro sometimes i throw my SRC into my secondary to cut down on damage taken - but that is about the only time it gets to see the outside of my backpack.<br />
<br />
For everyday use SRC is crap.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you are still 48 (says your magelo) and at this lvl you can hold aggro fairly well with a shield like this (I toyed with a FB2 shield around this lvl).  Id say play with it at your lvl and get your bash up, but enjoy it while it lasts for the higher you get the less use you can pull out of it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and id use the Yak with it ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've used it after all discs were spent, and i'm still tanking the named (read as rare occurrence).<br />
<br />
By that point, only the worst kind of asshat will take aggro off of ya and taking that much less damage to stay alive to keep the mob from raping the group/raid is your only concern.<br />
<br />
Great stats on it though.</div></div><hr />
