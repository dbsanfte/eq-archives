<br />
Certainly someone must have done these all and written up some base information.  Anything would help.  Of course I don't need info on Exe..  I know how to do that one.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Ive perused the threads and havent seen any threads recently that discuss all 6 trials and strategies to win, so I thought Id share the info Ive learned over the last few weeks working through these.<br />
<br />
To get the Mark of Justice, which is the key that allows access to the 7th Hammer, you must successfully complete all six trials and have all six marks in your possession. Walk up to any Tribunal and hail him, then say &quot;what knowledge&quot;. You will recieve the Mark of Justice and gain access to the 7th Hammer's room.<br />
<br />
Now thats alot easier said than done, so to try to make this easy, I will give a rundown of each trial (as best as i can recall) and hopefully make your run through the trials easier.<br />
<br />
Trial of Execution<br />
This trial requires you to kill all the mobs before the Executioner reaches the condemned prisoner and beheads him. Four waves or four mobs spawn, every successful kill resets the executioner and he has to restart his walk to the gallows. The Executioner will begin to walk faster and eventually run as you complete the waves, thus increasing the speed of you must make your kills.<br />
The rock mobs are unmezzable, razorbeast type mobs are mezzable. Be ready to cure slows (counteract disease or radiant cure works best)<br />
Boss: Easy kill. Hits for up to 720 and has an unresistable ac debuff called Armor Break which will lower your ac by 270 approx. Kill him, loot the mark and return to the Tribunal area.<br />
Strats for the Trial - If ya dont know by now, Im not tellin ya.<br />
<br />
Trial of Hanging<br />
In my opinion, the Trial of Hanging is the easiest or all trials. Three prisoners are bound on three separate pedastals ready to be hung. Mobs come in four waves, elemental type mobs which are mezzable and razorbeasts that are unmezzable. Each wave will be two regular mobs and one Spirit of Suffocation. The Spirit must not be allowed to reach the prisoners, kill it immediately. Once it is dead, another Spirit will spawn, you will have 3 mobs up at once, no two spirits will be up at the same time. Kill all four waves and prepare for the boss.<br />
Boss: Hits for the approx. the same as the Executioner boss, but rampages instead of having an ac debuff. Beat him down and recieve your Mark<br />
Strats - This trial works best with two tanks, preferably a warr and pally. The warrior tanks the unmezzable normal mobs while the paladin and other dps kill the Spirits. If the two normal mobs are mezzable, then the warrior can lend a hand on the Spirits. This trial is pretty straight forward, control the mobs with mezzes or split tanking and you're in good shape.<br />
<br />
Trial of Lashing<br />
This trial is really fun. The battle area consists of a large room, 2 alcoves on each end of a wall and some stairs (behind a door) in the middle of the same wall going up. Again, four mobs will spawn, rock mobs which are unmezzable and razorbeast mobs which are. At some point during each wave, a Scourge of Honor will spawn. He is untargetable and will aggro the person usually closest to the stairs. In each alcove a spirit will spawn. Kill the spirits asap, one spirit will be the &quot;real&quot; trigger and killing it will cause the scoure to despawn.<br />
Boss: Hits the same as the other bosses and I dont think he does anything spectacular because whatever he does is escaping me at the moment. Just apply beatdown.<br />
Strats- Again, taking along a paladin will be an immense help on this trial. They can split tank, lend the group heals, and kill the spirits when the Scourge spawns and allow the main tank to stay on the current mob. On the Fourth wave, it is imperative that you do NOT despawn the Scourge, the boss will spawn upon the Scourge despawning regardless of whether the other 4th wave mobs are still up. Just let him beat on you until you kill off the other mobs then spawn the boss.<br />
<br />
Trial of Torture<br />
The Trial of Torture is just that, a pain. Its not too hard persay, but the fight takes place in a confined area and it gets rough with alot of unmezzables. When you enter the trial, youre in a hallway, run around to the left (i suppose you can go either way, but i always go left). Enter the door you come to and youre in a round room with prisoners in stocks around the room and untargetable mobs called &quot;Pain and Suffering&quot; beating on them. Once again, four mobs spawn for four waves. Razorfiends are unmezzable and the Specters are mezzable. Also, randomly each wave a Wraith of Agony will spawn. Get on the Wraith asap, once he dies, an ae complete heal fires off healing the group and all mobs that might be up still (usually all the mobs are dead by this point).<br />
Boss- This boss is a pain in the ass. He has a point blank ae knockback, you dont fly too far, but its enough to interrupt spells. try to pin him against a wall and beat him down.<br />
Strats- Do NOT use complete heal on the boss. Fast heals are the key. Killing mobs fast in each wave seems to have an effect on whether or not the Wraith of Agony spawns, so kill as quickly as possible and enjoy a free ch.<br />
<br />
Trial of Stoning<br />
This is the second most difficult trial. The fights take place in a large room, plenty of room to move around. At the back of the room, prisoners spawn against the wall. On the opposite end of the room spawn 2 untargettable archers who will continually pummel arrows at the group, usually the cleric. Again, four mobs per wave for four waves spawn. They come in from doors on each of the other three sides of the room (not from the wall will the prisoners). Rock mobs are unmezzable, Spectres are mezzable. Kill the mobs and the boss pops.<br />
Boss - This boss is just plain annoying. He has the ae Gravel Rain, which is an ae snare that hits for 250 or so when it lands. Put him into a wall and keep him there, also try to keep the group remotely close so if the cleric or nuker pulls aggro you dont have to chase him far.<br />
Strat- The archers tend to aggro the closest person to them after a sec or two, so to keep the archers tied up, pet classes need to make pets and run right up into the faces of the archers. When they pull aggro, the pets will aggro the archers even though they are untargetable and they will go into melee mode beatin on the pets and will stop shooting the group. The waves are timed and an enchanter can charm a mob with CoD and keep it throughout the trial. This will also allow for med/recover time before the boss by keeping the charmed pet alive.<br />
<br />
Trial of Flame<br />
By far the most difficult trial, you have to have a tight group that works well together to succeed on this. You are in a round room with a large pole in the middle. Four mobs spawn per wave, Elementals which are mezzable and Imps which are not. If a mob reaches the pole, a 400pt ae will fire off, the ae also dispells the first buff in your lineup. There is also a 200pt per tick dot that fires off every minute or so (didnt time it so im guesstimating). Kill the mobs and the boss will pop.<br />
Boss: Nothing special, if you can get through the annoying trial, you should be able to kill him easily.<br />
Strat- Bring along extra healers, one of the best group lineups for this was warr, pally, cleric, druid, chanter, and any random dps class. Split tank imps if possible, the paladin Wave of Marr/Prexus will help offset dot damage significantly. Clerics and druids should alternate firing off Radiant Cure to dispell the dot. Keeping the dot undercontrol is fundamental to succeeding. Make sure you have a clicky buff in your first slot, jboots worked great for me. At some point during the trial a mob WILL reach the pole and you dont want any of your good buffs dispelled. The waves are timed so an enchanter can use CoD to charm an elemental and add to dps. This also helps by allowing you to clear all the waves, then everyone can sit and med and recover before killing the pet and spawning the boss.<br />
<br />
Overall info: A recurring rule of thumb ive noticed on the trials is, if a mob is mezzable then its unrootable, if its unmezzable then you can root it. Use that info accordingly to control the mobs if you get overwhelmed. Even though high dps is a key factor in succeeding in the Execution trial, good mob control and healing are the main focuses of the other trials.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alot of the info is good and will give ya an idea of what to expect, the group make ups can vary a bit more than was said above and strategies can be adjusted according to your gear and dps.</div></div><hr />
