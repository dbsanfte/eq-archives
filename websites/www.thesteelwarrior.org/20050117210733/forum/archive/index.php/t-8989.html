I decided to do a few ldons todday thinknning i was gonna make some fast xp. Boy was I ever wrong......<br />
<br />
Started of the day with 40%xp when first ldon started. It was a normal ldon, I was the lowest at 51, and had a bst, cleric, ranger, chanter, and wizard. We picked a gathering adv and we were successful. Prolly did it on a bout 35-45 min.<br />
<br />
Only gained 15% xp on the at one but hey thats closer to the next lvl right. Well bst had to go so we picked up a lvl 58 Pally. The rest of the group thought that was just great, more dps and a better tank right.....NOT #$@% likely. <br />
<br />
Group leader decided we should try a hard ldon seeing as how we did so well on the last one and we had this UBER TANK now. Well to make this a short tale, the cleric died 3 times, i died 2 times ( once was from that stupid unicorn in Lfay ), and our so called UBER TANK died 4 times. he said he went from half a yellow to 59 down to half a yellow from 57. ( I snicked the whole time I was off tanking the adds he pulled )<br />
<br />
We failed our adventure and got absolutly nadda because we had to wait for the Pally to come back. Why do these dumbass Pally's think they can do things so much better than us.<br />
<br />
I learned a good lesson today when I started at 40% xp and after 2 ldons finishing with only 65%xp. PALLYS ARE DUMBASSES THAT CANT TANK WORTH CRAP</div></div><hr />

There is no reason at all you should have had ANY adds at that level with a level 58 Paladin.  They get this wonderful spell called &quot;Pacify&quot;, is an aggro reducer/calm spell.  We did adv as a 3 man team (WAR, ROG, CLE -- CLE get same spell) and the ROG pulled (shows more time lapse from cast of Pacify) well into the 60's with rarely having adds at all.  I personally would put this down to a learning experience.... &quot;friends don't let friends EBAY...&quot;</div></div><hr />

I love how ebay is always the excuse for stupidity. No fool would buy a 58 (or hell anything other than an EP flagged 65) anything :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteniteslayer</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry i said the xp part wrong. when he started he was half a yellow bulb away from dinging 59. when he fifnished the adv he only had half a yellow bulb in 58. had he died one more time he would have dropped to 57.</div></div><hr />

You need to give more information as to why this was the paladin's fault because nothing you wrote implied that you all died because of him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkgecko</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's kinda hard to compare doing a normal ldon without this paladin to doing a hard one with him.  I assume you wanted to do the tanking, no problem with that, but just because you guys died alot, doesn't make it the paladin's fault, you were doing a much more difficult encounter ;)<br />
It's quite possible that this paladin was a complete twat, but the info you've supplied doesn't cut it :(<br />
Yes, Paladins get Pacify, but it only works on mobs that are level 54 and below, I'd think that this adventure probably had higher level mobs then that, though root pulling is a great tool as well.<br />
It sounds to me like that group should have ditched the warrior and got a mezzer! (I'm joking btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my view, you have a case of cascade failure. Several things happened when the bst dropped out and he pally came on.<br />
Number one, you went to a hard adventure.<br />
2. You probably lost some dps, though how much is hard to say.<br />
3. Whatever was going on with pacify, the same stuff was happening to the chanter, or adds would have been locked down (unless you were breaking mez as offtank).<br />
4. It's possible that the Pally wasn't very good, although of course that hardly condemns the entire class.<br />
5. It's also possible his gear was average, pac didn't work, and he was having trouble getting spells off while getting pounded on by 3-4 mobs. If he can't stand up long enough for the chanter to get things under control before the cleric has start healing fast, then nasty stuff will happen to the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paci doesn't really work reliably on hards, it's failure rate is on the order of 50%, at least at 65, not positive how it works at earlier levels. Hard LDON mobs have a special additional check to lulls, that's why you really want either a bard with Fading Memories or a monk with their unresistable lull to pull if you want singles in a hard LDON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question, how good would a 51 warrior do in a hard ldon adventure, when the highest level guy is 58? Wouldnt that make the average mob level higher? Ive never actually done an adventure, so please dont laugh too much if I asked a stupid question. Arent the 50s the worst possible level range as a warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alting my now 54 rogue I have discovered that hard LDoN can spank you starting about 50th.<br />
<br />
Any idiot can do a hard at 15 or 20. You begin to tell the men from the boys (or women from girls) in 40 hards...I think there is a range in there where hards are undoable unless you really have heavily twinked for level alts or AAs.<br />
<br />
After all going from a 63 normal to a 63 hard is a huge step. Considering you were no more than 3 steps down (58, 53, 48) and on a hard, its quite possible you were dealing with 55+ mobs. <br />
<br />
I would lay this one at your leaders feet than the pallies. Its even conseivable you went from a 48th normal to a 53 hard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats what I was asking. Is the level of the adventure dependant on the level of the guy who gets the quest, or the highest level in the group? Or is it an average of the levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Average of the levels. There are instanced zones in OoW (I have read) where the level is dependant on the level of the requester. LDoNs, on the other hand go by the group average without reguard to  the level of the leader, who zones in first, join last or had pizza for dinner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Average group level.  But I have heard that level 66+ characters can only get a level 63 hard. If you want a normal you have to make a level 65 or lower character request it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteniteslayer</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tanked a hard at level 50 with 54 being the highest lvl in the group and we had no problem getting thru. Mind you we just barely pulled it off with a bout 2 min to spare but no deaths at all.<br />
<br />
Would I have been a better tank than the pally? Cant say, but I can say ym DPS was more than his( he even admitted this ), and i would like to think I could have held agro better ( maybe ) than him. Would I have been a huge mana sponge due to the 7 lvls difference between us? Probably.<br />
<br />
I'm not coming down on the effectiveness of all pally's ( even tho I am a little bias against them ), just this one in particular. Maybe i'm just jaded and need to look with wider eyes next time we ask for a hard LDON. ( but the points are nice, aren't they )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cant say, but I can say ym DPS was more than his( he even admitted this )<br />
And this has what to do with tanking?<br />
and i would like to think I could have held agro better ( maybe ) than him<br />
Not unless he forgot how to mem spells.<br />
Would I have been a huge mana sponge due to the 7 lvls difference between us? Probably.<br />
Then he definately should have been tanking. What exactly are you bitching about again? Unless he was a complete idiot (entirely possible), or your gear totally outclasses his, they were far better with him taking than you. You got a bad group, or a string of unlucky pulls. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteniteslayer</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i forget what my main point was. been a very long week. too much studying. just ignore me for a while till I come up with another stupid post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in White's defense, he was probably touching on dps because I brought it up. I brought it up not in terms of pally vs. warrior, but in terms of switching a bst for a pally. I think the importance of melee dps in some 50s groups is under appreciated, and I've noticed that in experience grinds where the composition of the pick up group changes over time and goes from high melee dps to low dps the fights take longer, which means the mobs do more damage, the adds are up longer, mana falls faster, etc. It's not like there's a magic point at which this happens, but you can get situations where the group members change and (in this case) the mobs get harder and suddenly you have to adjust fast or die. In a pick up group, that often means you're dead.<br />
In that narrow sense, a group's melee dps has an effect on the tank/tanking. Any given tank will look better in a high dps group assuming the tank can hold aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nokatsu</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unmanaged adds are far more of a problem in hard LDoNs than they are in normals. This problem gets worse the higher the level you are. Successful groups for hard LDoNs require limited (ideally no) adds on the pull and a good plan for managing the adds (Enc or Bard mez, root park, whatever).<br />
<br />
Tanking 2-3 normal mobs is far different from trying to tank 2-3 hard LDoN mobs.<br />
<br />
That said, there are some weak paladin tanks. Playing my berserker alt I had one adventure where no matter how hard I tried not to I was stealing aggro from our paladin MT. The paladin was using a 1HS/shield setup, and didn't appear to be using much in the way of aggro spells or taunt. Even using Diversive Strike my DPS was enough to take aggro.<br />
<br />
Communication before and during LDoN adventures is important, especially for pickup groups of players with different skill levels. Avoiding problems in the first place is great, but correcting problems so there are not repeated is necessary. If you see a problem, try to propose a solution while making an effort not to alienate your teammate.</div></div><hr />
