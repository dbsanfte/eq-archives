<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if any of you could share some information from a Tunare fight.  My guild is eyeing her up for a romp (no not the sexual kind you filthy beast).<br />
<br />
Effects / damage output / cheal rot  / hitpoints<br />
Slowable / resistant to anything<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quad 800, but doesn't swing fast, doesn't hit max often, and casts a lot.  Single target root, very very often, so have a plan for dealing with your MT being unable to move.  I've never seen slow land on her, but last I knew she didn't give an immune message, just had high resists.<br />
<br />
Whatever rotation you use for your MT vs. Vindi should be sufficient for Tunare, though it needs to go about twice as long at a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also have fun with 6-10 hours of clearing Tunare is a good way to get people to quit the guild. We always kited Ali the elder his loots not worth the pia to kill him. Tunare herself is easy it has been to long for me to remember specifics though sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since Tunare is permarooted, her Root Spell is a non issue. What she does as well is pushback.<br />
<br />
We usually debuffed her, memblurred her, then did mad aggro with an SK to her while staying out of range... then moving the tank behind her, positioning a bunch of Casters on horses behind the MT, so he can't be thrown back, and whack away. Tunare herself is really easy when you keep to this strategy... she's kinda the reward you get for enduring to clear the plane for hours and hours (depending on your raidforce, prepare to start before lunch and expect to kill her in the late evening).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Decaillin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">positioning a bunch of Casters on horses behind the MT <br />
<br />
Instead of messing with positioning a bunch of casters, its much easier to just use one mage when needed /hint /hint =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You guys are amazing....thank you.<br />
<br />
So 6+ hours to clear...no wonder she is always up lol.<br />
<br />
Vindi chain - TY - good, useful info<br />
<br />
Hmm, how to make the clear fun....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, how to make the clear fun.... <br />
<br />
Its been scientifically proven that there is no possible way to clear pog &amp; have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Awww, you can't AE it? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nothing to add on Tunare herself but there are a couple of encounters while clearing you need to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Ail the Elder: Will probably give you more trouble than Tunare, he roams so keep an eye on him until your'e ready, he has an AE silence and if it lands on your healers you could be in trouble. If you keep him moving with push it will keep him from silencing everyone, just kill him fast as you can. Silence is avoidable with high MR.<br />
<br />
Guardians of Tunare: 2 panthers, one has AE silence and one dispells. Kill them seperately and they aren't too bad but if you get them at the same time it can be rough.<br />
<br />
Thifling Focusers: Not bad but a pain in the ass, don't pull them at all, they have a million HP and a small hit box so dps sux against them. They don't assist Tunare so just avoid them altogether.</div></div><hr />
