<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barmoz</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having some problems, all relatively new, somewhat corresponding to the DX9 changes, but I can't say for sure that they're related.<br />
<br />
The first is that on two of my computers, I have a problem where the spacebar will stick or won't register at all when pressed, it happens only in EQ not with other programs.  Makes carrying on a conversation a huge pain, and the frequent unplanned jumping is a major annoyance as well.  I've tried removing and installing eq repeatedly, used to make a difference for a while, then the bug would return.  I've resorted to moving my fastest computer to a backup role because it's basically unplayable for EQ.<br />
<br />
The second is with discipline timers, and is why I've put it in this forum.  If I use a discipline and die before the timer has refreshed, it adds approximately an hour to the refresh time.  For example, I use defensive, as long as I don't die, the countdown continues as normal (e.g. you have x minutes before you can use the defensive discipline message), and it will refresh as normal.  However, if I die before the timer has  expired and the discipline is refreshed, I get a message saying I have an hour or more until I can use the discipline.<br />
<br />
No custom UI, all updated drivers, no virus problems detected or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing these kinds of things?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To start with, rekey your space bar to Con stuff, and put jump on the letter j.  Have fun rekeying stuff in general, there are much better configurations than the default. <br />
<br />
Your other problem may be related to your clock.  Reset your clock and make sure it's not lagging or off of daylight savings time, etc.   There is a bug with the clock (and a more subtle one which I'm not qualified to talk about with your BIOS clock, contact customer service) which results from your computer's time and EQ time not corresponding correctly, which often results in timer problems for discs. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barmoz</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, remaping the jump key takes away that problem, but it's just a bandage rather than a solution.  Having to retype 3 out of 5 tells because the space between the /t and the person's name and having spontaneous groups of 5 to 500 spaces show up when I'm typing is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice on the clock thing, I'll check into that. <br />
<br />
Edit:  I think that fixed the discipline timer issue, I checked the clock settings on that computer and for some reason it hadn't registered daylight savings time.  Which explains the hour differential between what the timer should be and what it is.  Thank you a ton for the help with this, it was becoming a real issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">leave it to sony to go six months without fixing that clock thing. all they have to do is stop using the client clock to calulate /disc refresh and that would not only fix the bug but prevent exploits as well. do we need anymore evidence their programmers are clueless? shouldnt they just assume the client clock cannot be counted on to be set correctly? /boggle<br />

try this experiment. swap keyboards between your 2 machines and see if the problem moves to the other machine. if it does i think you know what to do next. if it doesnt help .. well .. at least it only takes a few minutes to try and is risk free.</div></div><hr />

Two of the computers have the same problem with the spacebar and EQ, the other two do not.  There doesn't seem to be a link to operating system either as I have a different system on each of the 4 computers.  Additionally, the two that are experiencing the problem have no issues with the spacebar and any other program, Word, Excel, Internet Explorer, etc.</div></div><hr />

What type of KVM switch is it?  IE: hardward swapping only, or keyboard shortcuts to swap?  I used to use one that had both, and the problem that occured (primarily in games, rarely outside of games) was that the KVM switch would essentially steal keyboard signals and then certain characters wouldn't show up properly.</div></div><hr />
