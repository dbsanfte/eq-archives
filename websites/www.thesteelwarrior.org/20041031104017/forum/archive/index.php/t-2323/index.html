<br />
I used to be the Main tank for my guild before it went under so I was given first crack at most of the good stuff. Give me your suggestions as to what I could do for more AC / HP / Aggro if you would.<br />
<br />

Thanks for reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">FBSS is the main thing that stuck out to me. I'd definitely work on upgrading your haste item. Even an RBG would be nice but try for RBB, CoCW, CoF if you have the cash for it. Earrings could probably use an upgrade too.  Mosquito Leg Ear is pretty cheap on Rodcet now, not sure about your server. I'd look into doing the Earring of the Solstice quest. <br />
<br />
You have some decent gear for your level, you might want to concentrate on getting 60 first and then see what slots need upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RevlinXevlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the suggestions. I got REALLY lucky on gear in that last guild. I never considered the Earing of the Solstace, I'll give that a look.<br />
<br />
Thanks agian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ChrystianVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i suggest ditching the Glimmering Mithril Torque and replacing it w/ a Clattering Bone Necklace and replace the Champ's bracer w/ a Bracer of Benevolence.<br />
<br />
Also look into the Strength of the Elements quest when you get a few more lvls on you, or get friends to kill the shit for you, quest is easy for the reward</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with both the above posts; a very vital part of getting and maintaining agro is your attack speed, so a haste upgrade would benefit you quite a bit.  They might be too expensive, but at your level you should be able to camp one fairly easily, and a Soulscream Belt (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=65570) would give you 31% haste and some fairly nice stats for the slot as well.<br />
<br />
The Earring of the Solstice (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28771) quest is a great idea also (eqtraders.com has a good guide) and pretty cheap nowadays; I've seen sellers offering all pieces for 4k on Veeshan, but I'm sure you could get it cheaper buying the parts seperately.  Second earring slot would be well served by a Mosquito Leg Earring (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27820) or an Iron Scream Earring (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6470) depending on the prices on your server.<br />
<br />
For the necklace, I'd suggest a change for sure towards more HP; a Ribbon Choker (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=7138) adds a nice deal of HP/AC/SV Magic and is quite cheap nowadays (500pp on Veeshan).<br />
<br />
Your mask, helm, rings, and gloves look great for some time.  I'd also suggest a Bracer of Benevolence (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29686) (or two, if you can manage to do the quest twice).  For arms I'd suggest you look into getting a pair of Light Chain Vambraces of Deceit (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62167), they drop from the new Droga from an easily one groupable mob.  And while you're down there, try to get to the king and get a Copper Hammer of Striking (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62186) from the king; also one groupable, and as I'm sure you've read numerous times on this board, is a very good weapon in conjunction with your Sword of the Bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
Shoulders aren't bad, but you may get a minor upgrade from a Matchless Dragonwing Mantle (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27151) (or Peerless, or Worked; 10 hp less for each lower down.)  You can probably find one or the like for 2k or so.<br />
<br />
Although some may suggest sticking with more AC, I'd personally suggest a Cloak of the Maelstrom (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25023) for your back slot as they're quite cheap and add some pretty decent HP (unless, as mentioned, you can afford a CoF or similar.)<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest a pair of Steel Wrapped Leggings (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=40202) as it'll give you a fair number more HP, as well as better saves and AC.  About 1500pp on Veeshan currently.<br />
<br />
And finally, your primary slot and bow look great too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just some suggestions, ignore them if you want =)</div></div><hr />
