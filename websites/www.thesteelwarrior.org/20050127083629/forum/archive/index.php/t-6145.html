<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terk</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...it's kind of the end of the road. I used to enjoy passing through the bazaar and looking at the cool upgrades I wanted to get some day. Now, with a full set of FH armor, there just seems to be nothing left to upgrade...Even ornate armor doesn't seem very impressive in comparison (and considering what a price jump it is for it..)<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is kind of a stupid post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm....   You should've been agnostic?  :P<br />
<br />
I have a nice set of mix and match armor as an agnostic, but sadly although I paid more, it's not as good as FH.  However, I've recently added some ornate to my gear, and it IS definitely significantly better than FH.  It's better AC, better HP's, and much much better in terms of other stats and effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real issue here, imho, is that the ceiling for buyable/droppable armor hasn't advanced from PoP.  If you want better than Ornate or FH, you have to either join a raiding guild, or do a lot of grinding in LDoN.  Enough LDoN points will suit you up in stuff thats very comparable to VT gear, which is pretty darn good.<br />
<br />
But no, you can't just keep buying your uberness in the Bazaar.  There comes a point when you have to actually invest time and effort into getting better stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the key: if you are not raid tamking or tanking LDoN hard, you don't need anything beter than FH; if you are, the upgrades will come.<br />
And ornate is a marginal upgrade to FH in most slots, the boots and bracers are actually less hp, considering the relative costs.</div></div><hr />

Tho they are noticably my worst bits now...got 2 raex drops in 2 days, so hopefully I can replace all soon...<br />

but FH will do most warriors well into PoP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">03-13-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate isn't far better then FH really. The difference in price is much bigger then the difference in stats. If you're not in a raiding guild, search for warr, hit points, 30k/50k+ in bazaar. There is some neat stuff you can buy that would be upgrades to FH, such as hard LDoN droppable things, farwater n such, ya know. Of course this stuff would cost you alot. <br />
But heh...FH isn't that bad, it will last you through BoT and LDoN type stuff. I'm still wearing 1 FH and 2 kizrak's pieces(they're my worst 3 atm) in eles.</div></div><hr />

Ornate only costs money if you want it too.  500pp is the most you HAVE to spend on it.</div></div><hr />

So he's stuck doing mostly BoT for ornate. And it doesn't exactly drop all the time, and he's not the only person in the group, so it will take some time to get ornate.<br />
<br />
Besides...why does it matter if you work for 50k to get a piece of ornate or if you work for a piece of ornate? It's the same thing. And when using an ornate mold you camped you're pretty much spending money, because it's 50k in your hands, whether you sell it or use it to make the armor. <br />

So gonna have to disagree with ya, Haass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking as a worshipper of Lord Agnos, I end up putting in literally ten to twenty times the effort of a FH-wearer to get equivalent stats, when it's even possible to do so.<br />
<br />
Specifically, if you look at the non-visible armor slots, FH armor is on a par with the best tradeable armors out there, the ones that cost 50k to 100k plat per slot.  While FH costs 5k to 8k per slot.<br />
<br />
It's...a little frustrating.<br />

I love how most people on this board act like the only way to get gear is either in the bazaar or in pickup groups.<br />
<br />
How about joining a guild that does stuff or making some fucking friends huh?  I can't remember the last time I rolled on a piece of loot I needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what are you doing that you need better than fierce heraldic to kill?<br />
<br />
new expansion was geared towards raid guilds it looks like, serious mistake imo. maybe they will add in quests to get into the planes now that the expansion is out, i dunno. i would think ppl would have got tired of the single group content a long time ago. there are single group mobs you can do in planes, but its real limited.<br />
<br />
couple of good raid mobs that dont require any flags in ferubi, but not sure how much is available for pickup groups with camps like sebillis or velks anymore, its kinda been phased out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well for one thing haass some of us dont enjoy guild raids. some of us find it boring boring boring. some enjoy it. for those who get their strokes raiding may they enjoy their game. for those of us who get our strokes on ldon may we enjoy our game. but im not going to submit to someone else's playstyle just because its THE way to get the best gear in game. its not worth it if im not enjoying the game because i play it only for my enjoyment or to put it another way .. im not getting payed for this. those who are likeminded with me are rightfully curious to know how within the confines of their playstyle they can better their toon.<br />
<br />
my gripe with sony is that they dont seem to think there is any post 65 game out there except the raid game. while i applaud them for wanting to &quot;fix&quot; groups, that is to make grouping experience competive with solo experience (which for a long time it was not), i strongly object to their apparent phasing out of the viable concept of any soloing whatsoever in the high end game. to those who point out correctly that its possible to solo at 65 i remind them that they are phasing out your soloing by making it impossible for you to actually spend the money youve made doing so as expansion after expansion leans more and more strongly toward no-drops as the only &quot;serious&quot; gear out there.<br />
<br />
so those like me who find raid groups to be more boring than just going back into work at night and sneaking in free work without pay will eventually just quit as we have hit the limit and there is no content left for us.<br />
<br />
no no no this isnt a rant. please dont stick this in the outhouse or call me a troller. im only trolling on haass and he is fair game if anyone is :)</div></div><hr />

For many people, that would be the case. I doubt he'd be posting a question about where to go from FH gear if he's in a raiding guild. <br />
<br />
It's funny how you assumed that it's the case for me when i'm just trying to give some advice. If he has a group of friends he plays with - assuming they have about the same gear as him - it would still take him a while to get ornate or LDoN gear etc. <br />
<br />
I seriously doubt you have alot of 'fucking friends' with that attitude though :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Did I say that you needed to actually do things?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, there seems to be only two types of guilds in this game...piece of shit green chat guilds and raiding guilds.  Not my fault you can't find a happy medium.  I found mine, and it consists entirely of my &quot;fucking friends.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm just trying to help someone who needed advice. I don't see why you're talking to me like i'm not happy with my guild, or don't have friends to play with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything else after that is fabricated in your mind.  I don't care what the fuck you're wearing or who the fuck you play EQ with.  You're wrong and I called you on it and now you're trying to change the subject.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, because raiding guild would be perfectly happy still raiding emp and AHR as main targets =P. Sorry but I have to disgree with ya there.<br />
<br />
As far as FH, yes, it seems to be somewhat of a cap for tradeable gear. But like several people have said, that quality of gear, especially with added AA, are adequate for the stuff you would be tanking. Also, if you can score a Vxed/Tipt group in GoD there is some really nice VT-Elem quality stuff that can drop for 1 group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Errr... maybe because the camps where ornate drops are mostly XP camps that are usually taken already?<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the droprate on plate ornate sucks (at least, for me it does) in Tactics and BoT.  I've seen 1 plate bracer (which I see no reason to use over FH) in the pit in Tactics and I've been camping them for months and killed probably 50+ nameds now.  My guild grinds together regularly, but even that hasn't magically conjured up Orante drops.  Oddly enough Ornate BPs seem to be the easiest piece to get, and we have quite a few of those already.<br />
<br />
Course seeing as we're farming Ssra (and Seru) and working towards VT, I don't really care all that much about Ornate.  Certainly not enough to blow 55kpp on a set of Vambs.  If nothing else, you can get a little upgrade from LDoN.  Most of the FH armor is good enough, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate isn't far better then FH really.<br />
<br />
Let's start with the BP.<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic Breastplate   <br />
 <br />
Weight: 3.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Slot: CHEST  <br />
AC: +51 Str: +10 Dex: +5 Sta: +5 HP: +80  <br />
Classes: Warrior Bard  <br />
Races: Human Half Elf Wood Elf Halfling Barbarian Dark Elf Gnome Troll Ogre <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
Deity: Rallos Zek <br />
<br />
Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 20.0 Size: LARGE <br />
Slot: CHEST  <br />
AC: +63 Str: +10 Dex: +9 Sta: +15 Agi: +6 Disease Resist: +15 Magic Resist: +10 Poison Resist: +15 HP: +115  <br />
Classes: Warrior  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
 Required: Yes<br />
 <br />
Effect: Shield of the Arcane<br />
 <br />
Type: Triggered <br />
Charges: Unlimited <br />
 <br />
That is +12 AC, +4 Dex, +9 Stam, +15 Agi, +35 hps, lots of resists (note NONE on FH), plus a nice effect.  I'd say that's significantly better.<br />
<br />
Now, let's move on to the gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic Gauntlets   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Weight: 3.0 Size: LARGE <br />
Slot: HANDS  <br />
AC: +24 Dex: +5 Agi: +5 HP: +50  <br />
Classes: Warrior Bard  <br />
Races: Human Half Elf Wood Elf Halfling Barbarian Dark Elf Gnome Troll Ogre <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
Deity: Rallos Zek <br />
 <br />
Kizrak's Gauntlets of Battle   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 5.0 Size: SMALL <br />
Slot: HANDS  <br />
AC: +33 Str: +4 Dex: +5 Sta: +8 Agi: +3 Fire Resist: +6 Cold Resist: +3 Poison Resist: +6 HP: +60  <br />
Classes: Warrior  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
Required: Yes<br />
 <br />
Effect: Miraculous Visions<br />
 <br />
Type: Triggered <br />
Charges: Unlimited <br />
Level for Effect: 50 <br />
<br />
Ok, that is +11 AC, +4 Str, +8 Sta, -2 Agi, +10 hps, and also resists (again none on FH).  Not to mention a nice effect when you have no spell haste available.  I also consider that significantly better.  <br />
<br />
Look at the increases from those two slots alone, it's huge.  I'm not going to take the time to go through the increases in every slot, and certainly the increases vary by slot, and in some cases the difference is negligable.  But overall, complete Ornate vs complete FH is a significant improvement.  The effects are also very nice, regen, attack, sta, haste, shielding...  And while you work towards upgrading to Ornate you are hopefully playing with people you enjoy playing with, who you don't have to roll against, and you are gaining xp at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay let's look at bracers, 55hp vs 45.....  screw vengence 2 = p<br />
<br />
also if you want a place to get one group upgrades -2 groups, check out cazic thule.   I have like 5 slots from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, let's look at the bracers.  :p<br />
<br />
See below.  With Ornate you gain +3 AC, +4 Str, +6 Sta, Vengeance II, and you lose some resists and 10 HP's.  If I had to pick, I'd take the 6 AC increase along with the other stats and take the 20 hp loss.  However, I will grant that considering the cost, I'd go with Fierce Heraldic in the bracer slot.  The reality is that every piece of Ornate is an upgrade from FH, some upgrades are significant, some are not, but AS A SET, Ornate is a significant upgrade IMO.<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic Bracer   <br />
 <br />
Weight: 3.0 Size: LARGE <br />
Slot: WRIST  <br />
AC: +25 Dex: +5 Fire Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +5 Cold Resist: +5 Magic Resist: +5 Poison Resist: +5 HP: +55  <br />
Classes: Warrior Bard  <br />
Races: Human Half Elf Wood Elf Halfling Barbarian Dark Elf Gnome Troll Ogre <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
Deity: Rallos Zek <br />
 <br />
Kizrak's Bracer of Battle   <br />
MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 4.0 Size: SMALL <br />
Slot: WRIST  <br />
AC: +28 Str: +4 Dex: +5 Sta: +6 Disease Resist: +3 Cold Resist: +3 Poison Resist: +4 HP: +45  <br />

The 100hp drops in CT have appropriate time/risk/reward investment, that's all I'll say about that.  Whether Scalecracker and Crystallized Acid Bracer are raid loot to you or not (given that the discussion is hinging around heraldic armor) is something I'm not gonna touch, given the climate of this thread. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without a doubt, FH is nice armor. But I don't think it's all that at all. Playing dwarf probably makes me a little biased, but every piece of gear I have has come from the bazaar or small under 3 group raids. There are tons of items you can get that are considerably better than FH, all with just a handful of friends. If you take the time to farm Doz, you can get some very nice items. Ferubi and Tipt drops some elem+ quality items and the sewers even drop a few nice items. Once you can beat Tipt, you can at least go for the random Kod'Taz named drop some very nice elem+ gear as well. It's not as easy as buying it the bazaar, but it's a hell of a lot more fun.</div></div><hr />
