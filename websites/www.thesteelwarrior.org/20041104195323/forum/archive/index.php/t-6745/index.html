<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey, again i have questions about weapons,<br />
i have been told GBoS is better aggro than a BoC, so wat would make the better dual weild?<br />
BF and BoC or BF and GBoS, atm im currently in no position of getting a BF but was just wondering, and i also heard from someone that 999 hate is max you can get out of a weapon, is this true? thanks :) and btw if you got a BoC on Bristlebane and want to sell for 300-400k drop me a tell.<br />
<br />
thanks, Seraz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So, just to clarify ...<br />
<br />
You have no shot at a bloodfrenzy?<br />
<br />
You are in the market for a blade of carnage?<br />
<br />
Do you at least have the Greatblade of Storms? Maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol, i have no bloodfrenzy,<br />
i'm looking for a Blade of Carnage,<br />
i dont have a Great Blade of Storms but can organise a raid to get one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ack!<br />
<br />
So, uh, what are you using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sotbs and chos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't have the parses or the weapons to prove which would be better.  However, I am currently using the BF/BoC combo (both aug'd) and have no trouble controling aggro.   <br />
<br />
I have heard that the BOC/GBoS is a good aggro combo.  You could always make it better with auging anyhow.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen to many BoC for sale on BB.  Not many guilds are in that area of progress atm.  Therefore no guild banks are selling them only those individuals that have retired them.  <br />
<br />
Good Luck on obtaining the BoC as it is really a nice weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BF &gt; BoC &gt; GBoS for aggro.<br />
<br />
that having been said the BoC and GBoS combo is very strong for aggro.  a bloodfrenzy is optimal, but i wouldnt count  your luck on it seeing as mr. cursed is a stingy bastard with BF drops (not to mention he's a highly contested spawn).<br />
<br />
BoC and BF is the best aggro setup of the 3, with the BF in mainhand.<br />
<br />
i have no idea what this 999 hate is about .. never even heard of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EQLiquidslow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use BoC/GBoS combo... BoC in mainhand is better agro than GBoS in mainhand, this has become obvious to me. Both my weaps are anger2'd... I haven't heard of a 999 hate max either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't heard of a 999 hate max either.<br />
<br />
If there is a max hate; this isn't it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BoC is definatley better than the GBoS but the BoC is generally kinda over priced<br />
<br />
and the bloodfrenzy isnt that rare, just kinda streaky, my guild has 5 cursed kills and 3 of those yielded a bloodfrenzy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All 3 of those weapons are far better than the weapons you currently have, so there is nothing to debate, just use whichever 2 of those 3 weapons you get first.</div></div><hr />
