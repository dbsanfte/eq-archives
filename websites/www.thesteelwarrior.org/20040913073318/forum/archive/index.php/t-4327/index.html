Well with all this talk from SOE about these stances and whatever else they are thinking about.  Call me cynical or call me silly but I see us going to have to pay for class balance.   I truely beleive that these new stances will be only available in the next expansion.   It is not like they heard our frustrations it is not like they ever cared in the first place.  Think about it for a sec and it make sense why would they give this out for free when they can bundle it in the new expansion as an incentive for us to purchase it.   Casters get new pretty spell effects for free and we get to pay 29.99 for something that should be in the game a long time ago.   Also another thing that makes me beleive that this is going to happen,  the next expansion is basically being downloaded without us knowing that it is,  the names of the new zones,  that new zone off JPF all point that it will be coming soon.   And poof we get word of the &quot;possiblity&quot; a HUGE change in melee.  It is kind of a concindence huh.  I don't know it smells fishy to me folks and if this is true than this is so fucked up it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rzal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Screw that, I'll cancel my account before I pay to be fixed.  Absor made a bold statement that it wouldn't happen that way.  And if it does then fuck it.  There's no hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye Absor did state that they said they do not use expansions to balance classes.  But think about it, they decide to talk about it the Nov. 24th how much you want to bet that day they will announce the new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't be surprised. SoE's actions as of late (cough, Full Equipment Transfers, cough) have finally proven to me that they're just after my money...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FyreStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aye, that equipment transfer thing almost made me quit right then and there--and i thought armor dyes cheapened the game back when LoY came out...wow...sony just keeps screwing us over...:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SOE mentioned stances?  Not flamming or trolling just wondering where its at so I can read it too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't seen anyone from SOE mentioning stances.<br />
In fact - I haven't seen them mention anything specific at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In the mini-interveiw that absor did with Ledipus he mentioned that the melee aspect of the game might go through a complete overhaul.  This is my assumption in what it is the retooling is going to be....stances and that is it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In other words - It's your interpretation of it.<br />
<br />
They may come up with some drastically different .... like, ripping off DAOC or WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As if they've never done that before...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I think at this point I would welcome a rip off than what is currently in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldn't mind another rip off if it was actually implemented correctly.</div></div><hr />
