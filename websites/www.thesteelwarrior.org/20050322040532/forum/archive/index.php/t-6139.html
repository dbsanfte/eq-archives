Right now we are 35 but Im seeing the need for a tank. Would a warrior. Monk, Shaman(or cleric) trio work well, or better as opposed to adding a hybrid tank .??</div></div><hr />

monk dps, shammy dot and heal, SK snare and tankablity = win</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bottom line? For day to day exp groups SK utility beats War tanking.. (snare, single pulls, snap aggro)<br />
<br />
Only time you are going to &quot;miss&quot; a warrior is raids, hard LDoN and some PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
IMO Warrior is still more fun, due to the challenge and the pure tanking ability.. for us it's more about skills than spells.<br />
<br />
Play what you think would be more fun.</div></div><hr />

Our spellbook is worthless and rez is meaningless. <br />
<br />
j/k and rant off<br />
<br />
Play an SK for their superior utility or Paladin in a small group setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">venimous</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am playing a Warrior, so the group will be<br />
<br />
Shaman(or Cleric) Monk , Warrior.<br />
<br />
Hybrid tanks have nice utility, but I compared a 30 SK to 30 Warrior takes hits MUCH better, and Since I duo box I find it easier(more simple) to bot the tank and play the shaman, or bot the Shaman and play the tank depending on aggro shifts.<br />
<br />
Suprised I didnt get more warrior votes on a warrior board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
coming from warriors who've played for years giving you a straight answer i think is prett damn good.<br />
you don't want to be a warrior unless you're willing to put up with the consequences of being one of the most underpowered ( group-wise) and time-and-money costly class out there.<br />
<br />
Warriors ain't fun if you're looking for a quck fix to grouping; etc. it's dedication to investing a LOT of time and paitence into....and to save a lot of people the hassle; most of us here just tell the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could go either way.  With a shaman healer you're going to be a little low on healing for most of your career, and you don't have rez.  For that reason I would go Pally.  If you see yourself leveling up to high levels and wanting to do mini-named you're going to have a hard time doing it without a cleric.  If you decide to swap your shaman for a cleric, then go warrior and get him a ToD.  LFG stuff doesn't matter much because you have a regular group already.  <br />
<br />
If you do the monk/cleric/warrior you will be very low on utility, but as someone that 2-boxed a warrior and cleric to level up, it's annoying to have no invis, ports, sow etc, but with some potions it's not too hard to live with.<br />
<br />
Don't mind Shik, he's just a bitter old fart.  Warriors own :).</div></div><hr />

At 65 it really depends what you're aiming for.  If you want to duo/trio most of the time then the sk/pal would probably be 'better' due to more utility functions in the regular xp group.  If you're planning on doing hard LDONs and GoD trials, then a warrior will make a much better tank assuming the same aa/gear effort.  In the long run with 500+ AAs any of the plate tank classes will work.  At the same time, a shaman would have a hard time being the only healer on a hard ldon for the first 150 AAs really.  It can and is being done, it's just not efficient at all.</div></div><hr />
