<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shrikeavatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 63 war.  My red seems to get resisted a lot even by blue cons.  Is there any stat I can raise to reduce the number of resists?<br />
<br />
Will getting the last two lvls make a difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rage of Vallon has no resist adjustment, it's also fire based. There are a lot of mobs highly resistant and or immune to fire based spells. Being level 65 will help a little, but overall not much.</div></div><hr />

You can't do anything about it, but shamans(Malo/sini), mages (Malosini), bards(harmony/occlusion), and druids(ro) can all reduce the ability of the mob to resist it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, it gets resisted a lot.  That is one reason the epic is not well liked.  There is nothing much you can do but debuff.  I would suggest trying to upgrade it as fast as you can.  I got mine and used it for a total of a month before upgrading to a CHSD and GBoS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Offhand a journeymans walking stick.  It procs Tash and will help lower mob's resists.  If you do this, more than likely by the time you realize it doesn't help much you will have a weapon better than the epic to wield :)<br />
<br />
Tash is decent aggro though, so it isnt a total waste of time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boomlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I may be wrong (speaking from a wizard main, warrior twink point of view), but it may cause just as much agro on a resist.  I know that concussion (wizard deagro spell) has been tested to work just as well on a resist as if it lands, and I also know from the beatings I took in my lower lvls that resisted spells definately cause agro, seeminly at the same level as if they landed.  I suspect that this should work the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, the +hate portion of the proc adds a good deal more hate if it lands than if it doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tash only reduces MR, the proc is FR.<br />

I dunno, I think epics are pretty solid aggro, especially if you aug'd them.  I've pulled aggro from a DBoTWL/EoE combo before(while using the 1hs, and 2hs), all in all it's about how lucky you get with the RNG.<br />
<br />
I definatley which I would have gotten my epics alot sooner than what I did, they're really great if you're an up and coming tank.</div></div><hr />
