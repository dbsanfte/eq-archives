<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thats about an hours worth for me if that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dobbo, you're like 12.  You'd be out before the first shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And besides, do you realize how HEAVY Guinness is.  It's almost like drinking oatmeal. (which is why in many cases it's cut with Bass or Harp to make a black &amp; tan, which rules).  Drinking that much Guinness in an hour would kill me, just 'cause it's more than my stomach could comfortably hold. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Light beers are what I piss when I'm done drinking Guiness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Light beer is like softcore porn; life is too short for either.  If you're gonna drink stouts, you have to alternate between beer and shots of good whiskey, that way you don't fill up so damned fast and still maintain a decent buzz. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">6 guinnesses is like eating 4 loaves of bread.  I have yet to meet somebody that could get really drunk on that stuff.  Guinness is fine if you want to sip it, but if you want to drink an 18 pack, you're better off with Bud Light.  You don't taste it after the first 6 anyhow hehe.<br />
<br />
Course getting drunk isn't the only reason to drink beer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">but if you want to drink an 18 pack you are doing it to get shit faced so why drink light beer at all?  <br />
<br />
then again, all yank beer is like sex in a canoe (f*cking close to water) anyway so whats the difference?<br />
<br />
I enjoy a guiness as much as anyone, but gotta say a nice lager is the way to go when you're putting a few away with your mates - Heineken, Steinlager or Stella Artois are the way to go~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">fellas...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well then he still ain't drinking age Isk :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He's probably taunting him...how old are you Isk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ain't you forgetting something peeps?<br />
<br />
Happy Birthday sHORTY ! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yeah, but we still don't get Isk's odd sense of humor? AFAIK the drinking age all over the US is 21....<br />
<br />
Happy Birthday man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so misunderstood...<br />
<br />
first post = I hope sHORTY is drinking beer today, being a year underage is immaterial in this case<br />
<br />
second post = don't focus on the beer that drinks like a meal and wish the man a happy birthday =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Doesnt it say he turned 20?<br />
<br />
Legal drinking age is 18 where I am, don't know where shorty is, but hopefully its not somewhere that thinks you need to be 21 to be able to handle a drink or 2.<br />
<br />
Either way have a good one mate~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">this definately is The Steel Warrior. Masters of the Blatantly Obvious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sorry guys, I still have a year before I get to drink.. I'm going to be married before I get alcohol legally =)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">so sad... makes me glad to live in the land of beer and footy.<br />
<br />
So like that means no keg at your stag party?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If sHORTY was a drinker, we probably couldn't get new features for the board within 20 minutes of requesting them most of the time.<br />
<br />
Regardless, happy birthday to the admin of the best board on the net....Cheers :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">haass plz i have a shirt with tequila on it.<br />
happy birthday sHORTY. if you really wanna drink go to canada where it's like 19 or mexico where it's like 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have a shirt that says SLAYER on it, doesn't make me in the band.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wonder why dobbo has tequilla on his t-shirt yet never bothered to throw it in the laundry.<br />
<br />
ewww</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Shikarii....master of the bad joke :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Happy Birthday Shorty.  And since when did you have to be the legal drinking age before drinking?   And if you're married before you can legally buy alcohol, you're either really doing something wrong, or really doing something right, and I'll be damned if I can figure out which. :)</div></div><hr />
