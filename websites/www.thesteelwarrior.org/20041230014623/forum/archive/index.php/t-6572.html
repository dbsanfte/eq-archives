<br />
Once your stats max out with buffs (in your case, at 305, which I think you could make with SHM buffs and VQ) then you don't need to worry about the +6 stat augs, and instead focus on the +12hp ones (although rare) and the nice 5ac aug from Permafrost that only costs 150 points (see my magelo)</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt say AGI is useless, STR is, it's much more easier to cap than any other stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Parses have shown otherwise.  Whether it goes towards avoidance or mitigation ac doesn't matter, as parses have shown no real effect of having more agi.  As Mokor said, the differences were smaller than the margin of error for having increased agi by quite a bit.  There is no evidence that the difference was caused by agi, and not just from the rng.  What numbers you attribute to it doesn't matter if the end effect is absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />

Parses I have seen show AGI = Avoidance AC = higher percent misses by mobs.<br />
<br />
My memory told me the ratio was 6 AGI = 1 AC (avoidance AC).  I could buy 8 AGI, as there isn't much difference between 6 and 8, both are high numbers.<br />
<br />
Other parses have shown 10 Avoidance = 1 percent less hits, so with 8 AGI, that would mean you would avoid 1 percent more hits per 80 AGI.<br />
<br />
Say your AGI is 150 normally, (305-150)/80 = 1.937, or about 2 percent more misses by the mobs to max out AGI.  I think 2 percent matters, and considering it is SO easy to max all stats including AGI, you should do so.<br />
<br />
I would not sacrifice AC10 augs from BB, HP40 augs, AC15 x 2 from ferubi, and possibly even HP25/END25/MANA25 x 2 from Ferubi, and the many HP30 assortment from GoD for an AGI7 aug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tasdamon</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the amount of ac gained per amount of agi scales on the current amount of agi.  for instance, if you have 50 agi, you will gain much more ac per agi then if you have 290.  by looking at these figures and forming a graph, there is a plateau at around 150 agi.  after that point the amount of ac gained by boosting agi is very minimal.<br />
<br />
as far as agi going to an obscure &quot;avoidance&quot; form of ac, i doubt it.  sony has already stated that each class type (silk, leather, chain, plate) has a set basic mitigation and avoidance.  each class then has a modifier that sets its place among those armor types.  this is why a silk class with 1000ac will not mitigate as much as a plate class with 1000ac.  this is also why many classes avoid better then warriors.  in addition to this, different mobs have different hit percentages.  GoD mobs hit a lot more then PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
someone stated that agi has to do with defensive skills like riposte, dodge, parry, and block.  heh, thats just wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explain how magelo has a seperate AC value for avoidance and mitigation, the avoidance based upon your agi.  +avoidance effects from time increases the frequency in dodge/parry/riposte/block skill checks fire..</div></div><hr />
