<br />
First and foremost thanks for the help with the Disarm Question.  I have already improved vastly following your all advice.<br />
<br />
My next question is........is the Earring of Solstice a viable ear piece for a warrior??<br />
<br />
I like the +5 STA, but can't use the flowing thought effect.  On Innoruuk you can buy the stuff for about 3500-4k plat.  It seems a bit high for a +5 STA earring.<br />
<br />
Anyway It will be awhile before I can afford a bloodmetal earring of engagement.<br />
<br />
Thanks as always for the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">might want to check into an electrified earring of tempests ( 7AC 35 hp/mana, FR/CR/MR 12 .. might be about the same price as the solstice kit.<br />
but the solstice ear ain't too bad; it just sucks when you upgrade all it can do is sit in your vault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It also has 55 HP and you are leaving that out.  That is the most important part of the solstice for warriors.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is a viable earring until you can afford the bloodmetal (or *gasp* get something even better).  Imo it is superior to the electrified earring because of the increased raw hp and the stamina hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a good earing, good stats, good HP, good resists...  if you can't afford lizard tooth or mosquito leg (getting damn cheap on Quellious) then it's a good stop-gap.  I used to whip mine out for resists until I augmented my lizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't see how any warrior could have a problem with the solstice earring in the price range. You mean there are other 5sta 55hp earrings for 3k? It's a great value to hold you over while you save for bloodmetal ears IMO.</div></div><hr />
