<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ocide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">only change i noticed from my Matchless Silvery Claymore is that they nerfed the 330 mana it had on it  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All that tells me is that the knight epics need more AC.  =P<br />
<br />
If you want to compare the Matchless Silver Claymore to a comparable weapon, you should use Bonecleaver, the non-warrior version.  They have comparable ratios, both have high aggro procs, and the MSC has more AC.  All 2handers in OoW so far with superior AC have inferior ratios and procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">msc only had mana removed, nothing else.  considering lack of mods, proc mod, and AC, it's really not much more than a toy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think you are overestimating the AC of the average 2hander.  One of the biggest disadvantages to using a 2hander over a dual-wield setup is that the user will usually have a lower AC and lower hp than they would, otherwise.  A 2hander with 60+ AC is the exception, not the rule.  OoW has shown us only two of these that I have seen.   The Fang of Feratha has exceptional AC, but is inferior in every other way.  Crystallia has decent AC, but is eclipsed by the weapons from the MPG raid trials, by far.<br />
<br />
A warrior who is dual-wielding 1handers which are not warrior-specific are not likely to have more than 35 AC on either weapon.  Even Thunderclap stays true to this.  55 AC with hard-ass innate proc aggro versus 70 AC (20-33 per weapon more common than 35 on both) with mostly DPS and augment aggro... I dont see how it would be a difficult choice.<br />
<br />
Edit:  For warriors that already have a DBoW or BBoB, this would be a toy.  For warriors using a bag full of A3 augmented weapons that are neither of these, it is a beast.</div></div><hr />
