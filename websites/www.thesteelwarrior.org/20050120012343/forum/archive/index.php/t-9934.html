  Just got a new dual combo and 2hs in Edge of Envelopment.  In the short term should i plop my first Anger 3 in the EoE or save up the points and put two in the dual?  I know this goes back to the long 2hs/dual debate but... for raids sake which will benefit me the most NOW?   Hitting EP's and blackflag PoP targets and I am cracking into the guild tank rotation.  Is the dual combo with one aug more aggro than the EoE auged?<br />
  NOTE: it will take maybe 2 weeks to fully anger 3 aug out all slots since server pops have dropped of severally for all groups not just LDoN's<br />

<br />
P.S.  Any items that I should be Bazaar upgrading BTW?  Price not much of an issue as I can make upto 200k a week in WoS drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groggle</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aug the dual. 305 dex @ 65, wa5, and you will get 2700 hate (maybe 3k, but I believe its 2.7) from anger procs alone. the boc will bring that up to 4800. EoE proc is pretty low aggro, I don't see how 4800 in proc rate not even counting the offhand proc will be less aggro than EoE's ratio,shitty proc, and half the anger augs provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be more inclinded to A3 that BoC and use your anger aug'd CHoS.  However, I must admit that that suggestion comes because I am a die hard Dual Wielder.  I have been using anger aug'd BoC and GBoS and have no complaints.  However, I am not quite elemental yet.  Lacking a Rallos kill for that.  <br />
<br />
As far as upgrades, I'd get yourself 5 of the 10ac augments from Mistmore Ldon.  If you do hards there, you have a chance at Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites dropping, which would be a hp/ac upgrade.  They also run about 60k in the Torvon bazaar, not sure what they go for on Vazaselle.  <br />
If you're feeling adventurous, head to MPG and pick up a war clasp earring and ground murkglider eyes (20ac aug).  <br />
If your guild still farms AoW once in a while, you'd be quite happy with the Ring of Destruction if you're looking for more ac.  <br />
<br />
Other than that?   Get your defensives and you'll be sittin' pretty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
work on getting a second A3 for your offhand weapon as well.  use the EoE only for dps purposes -- throw a ruj poison DD aug on it someday once you have two A3.<br />
<br />
I'm not familair with your current offhand weapon -- is the proc listed have a stun component?  If not I would lose it for tanking purposes in favor of your SotB + A3.<br />
<br />
other options are to A3 aug your GSoT.  i have heard many ppl use that combo to gtreat success for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">to improve your aggro get a dual ykesha or a dual A3 augs setup and WA5. Untill then, put your A2 in the BoC and put the CHoS in offhand.<br />
for you in offhand (no aug, no WA, 61% self haste, 255 DEX buffed, no ambi, no furi, ...) GBoS &gt;&gt; MoM &gt; RH-SH &gt; FH &gt; SoM'sV &gt; CHoS &gt; BB'sC &gt;&gt; DES (yours) &gt; SotB (with around 20% diff between GBoS and SotB).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yoda... I know most of the acronyms on the list except for RH-SH and FH... these are baz upgrades or groupables?<br />
<br />
<br />
  KK thanks for all the input guys... will put CHoS in second and then throw aug on it after I anger 3 the BoC.  Then it is on to finishing my defensive aa's while trying to grab those ac upgrades and items from MPG.</div></div><hr />
