<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilis</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone, I've got a question.  I've seen this old list on Alla about what PoP planes are what tier, and I'm curious where folks think the new GoD and OOW zones fit into the list.  In part because I'm curious to see what zones are looming in my ( hopefully ) near future, and what sorts of places I'm 'supposed' to be able to hack it in.  I've been lucky enough to pick up some new gear lately from OOW and the old AoW hate and can finally hack it in the sewers with some AC tribute and some occasional ghetto bashing with the shield when the golems come up.<br />
<br />
Here's the pre GoD list.  ( I couldn't find any updated information on my searches here )<br />
<br />
Tier 1 = Justice, Innovation, Disease, Nightmare <br />
Tier 2 = Valor, Storms, Torment, Crypt of Decay, Lair of Terris Thule <br />
Tier 3 = Halls of Honor, Bastion of Thunder, Tactics, Tower of Solusek Ro, Temple of Mithaniel <br />
Tier 4 = Fire, Earth, Air, Water, <br />
Tier 5 = Time A, Time B <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

~GoD = Ferubi, sewers<br />

<br />
Tier 2 = Valor, Storms, Torment, Crypt of Decay, Lair of Terris Thule <br />
~GoD = Vexd, Tipt<br />

<br />

<br />
Tier 5 = Time A, Time B <br />
~GoD = Inktu'Ta+<br />
~OOW = Anguish+<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just off the top of my head, im sure someone has some edits for it, but its a general idea.<br />
<br />
EDIT: these are based on the difficulty between god or oow zones on a tier 1-5 range, simply against themselves. if it were comparitive with the rest of the expansions, GoD (ferubi) would start with tier 3 in POP, and Tipt/Vxed would be about tier 4 in pop. likewise, oow would start in about tier 2-3 for pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Armugol</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just based on difficulty level lets say the following, with the tier 2 and tier 3 GoD zones still being a bit more difficult then their PoP counterparts.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 = Barindu - The Hanging Gardens, Natimbi - The Broken Shores,Qinimi - Court of Nihilia,Riwwi - Coliseum of Games<br />
<br />
Tier 2 = sewers<br />
<br />
Tier 3 = Ferubi<br />
<br />
Tier 4 = Vexd, Tipt<br />
<br />
Tier 5 = Ikkinz, Yxtta, Uqua, Qvic,Inktu'Ta+</div></div><hr />

I think the mobs in Ruined City is much more difficult than those in WoS (even at f2), and way more difficult than BoT. Perhaps you mean the named mobs.. quite lot of lvl73+ raid-mobs in WoS.. while not so many in Rcod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suurge</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind what baash is saying.  He's not comparing Halls of honor to KT.  His post was a little uncler in that regard, but hes not comparing say a tier 3 PoP to a tier 3 GoD or OoW.  Hes just ranking them as tier 1-5, but not comparing difficulties of the different expansions.  <br />
<br />
If i were to rank the expansions, they would look something like this:<br />
<br />
PoP --&gt; OoW --&gt;GoD<br />
<br />
in order from easiest to hardest, AVERAGE DIFFICULTY.  Meaning average group AND raid encounters.<br />
<br />
Really, the main focus of the discussion should be between GoD and OoW.  PoPower, since the level cap increase and new loots etc from GoD and beyond, has really become much less difficult.  Quarm, at least on Fennin Ro takes a pounding whenever hes up, and All of time A and B are being cleared in a 4 or 5 hour push.  that is every boss dead.  The majority of OoW seems to be geared towards not necessarily the most hardcore guilds on a server, but those 3-5th ranked guilds.  Granted Some of the RS bosses and Raid trial bosses are meant for those 1 or 2 really strong guilds, but epic bosses, as well as most other encounters are doable by the less gung-ho.  <br />
<br />
High end GoD zones however, seem to still give players more of a challenge then the OoW.  Granted, no guild on Fennin is actively hitting Anguish, and for all i know that could be the hardest zone in the game, but, from just watching the top guilds on my server, I would have to say that top GoD is worse than what has been reached thusfar in OoW.<br />
<br />
Groupwise, I STILL think Kod'Taz is worse than PG, and to some extent RS.  Before you flame, hear me out.  Mobs in KT proc, just like the crap in PG.  However, KT tends to proc for more dmg, and also seems to hit 1-200 dmg harder.  Rares in KT, at least for me, a 12k tank, usually require a Furious disc lead in to stonewall.  PG rares i tank w/o using stonewall.  Also, KT and other GoD mobs tend to be more tightly packed together, spawnwise, making for more difficult pulling/splitting.  Prob i find tanking ANY of the muram mobs is that their dmg output is very streaky i can go a few rounds takiing only 400 dmg total, then have the monster hit me 4 or 5 time, proccing every round, for a good 3k dmg or more, and I tend to think the GoD have a great dmg output than anything ive faced in OoW.<br />
<br />
anyway, thats my opinion.  flame on!</div></div><hr />
