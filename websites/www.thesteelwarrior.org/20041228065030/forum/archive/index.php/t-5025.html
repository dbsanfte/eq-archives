Can anyone give me a group recipe that might make it that isnt Elemental geared up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For starters, you shouldn't try level 65 Hards at level 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the tank is by far the most gear dependent for a group.  Anyone else can get by with crappy gear but the tank needs to be able to withstand hits of up to 992 from normal mobs and 1200 or more from bosses.  Elemental gear isn't required for that but you will get your ass handed to you if you walk in wearing Thurg armor or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal mobs can 2x992 + specials + 75% slow effectiveness<br />
<br />
Bosses are touch and go for me at 9500+ hp until they are slowed (i cant pop a disc :p), normal mobs can grind you down easy if you dont have decent gear + smart healer (read: brains &gt; gear)</div></div><hr />

The cleric couldn't heal me fast enough and ran oom after a few mobs.  We never even got past the first room when we wiped.  It was awful.  I can tank 2 or 3 normal mobs at once easy and hardly ever lose agro and the hard adventure kicked my butt bad.  I have pre-VT gear (5800 hp unbuffed) so I would think you would want at least 9.5 k full buffed to even think about a hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a hard LDoN with a just over 9k tank recently and we made it through.  Only one death and it was me so I think things went pretty well.  :)  <br />
<br />
Had a druid backup healing.  Asked him if he saw me spam casting remedy (fast heal) to please jump in and cast his fast heal so we could get caught up and I could CH.  Don't think I'd want to try this as the only healer.<br />
<br />
Even a 9k tank though I was casting CH at 80 health.  Ducking a few but mostly letting it go through.  Damage is spiky they are hard to heal.  We won the one where we got a charmed pet only a couple rooms in.  When we tried the second dungeon, we lost because I could NOT keep up on heals when the mob was living as long as they do without really good dps.  With charmed pet I was using one CH per mob with occasionally another.  Without charm pet I was needing 3 CH per mob and running oom.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Misread something.  I totally agree with people who were saying not to try if under 9k HPs.  Maybe if you are really close but on a 9k tank I was starting CH at 80 and although sometimes it would hit at 50%, I also did a couple 7500 HP CHs in there as well.  <br />
<br />
To the original poster - at 62 you CAN do hard IF you make sure you are doing hard 60s.  Get a group that the average level is 62 or under and you should be able to do hard no problem.  But I wouldn't try hard 65 adventures without a full group of 65s and 9k HPs (although I did do it at 63 but a cleric can usually get by with being lower... as the tank you will NEED those levels and your defensive AA to tank 65 hard).</div></div><hr />

I have no problems with singles (bout 9Khp, 1950AC while doing adventures) but i wouldent do one without  good puller and CC.</div></div><hr />

3. Enchanter (DPS)<br />
4. Cleric<br />
5. Cleric<br />
6. Druid (usually. HoR is god on slow mitigaters, and patch healing is great)<br />

You can swap a cleric for either a bard or a shaman.<br />

Slot 6 could be a variety of different classes, but this is what we have and use, and it works well.<br />

The rest of the group was worse geared than I was.  You need a highly skilled group that doesn't care about losing or dying.  We lost a lot, but the wins were sweet.  The minis dropped loot that for us pre-VT people were nice raid-level loot.  Avoid Assasinates as the boss is too tough.<br />
<br />
You also need to have a 2nd or 3rd healer and all the other bases covered including DPS.</div></div><hr />

A good tank and a good Cleric.<br />
With good I mean skilled(most important),well equipped and a fair amount of AA.<br />
I've won 90% of em and was at 8600ish hp with 1500ish AC when I did my first,closing in on 9k now.<br />
Personally I think you can tank there with 8K+ as long as all yer defensive AA's are done and you have a good Cleric</div></div><hr />

ATM, I only have ID2+ left for defensive AAs. Of course, the cleric was astounding, and we had an SK pulling. We only got doubles twice I think. Chanter slowed, and BST was preslowing iirc.<br />

Extremely fun, triples for 950 sting a little :)</div></div><hr />

Named in the first seemed to be the easiest fight of the night actually but probably because everyone unloaded on him and killed fast. We actually tried another one but the zone in was right at a crossroads with about 8 static and one wanderer and we kept getting our butts kicked by adds so we left and got a better map.<br />

group was:<br />
65 warrior ( no brells so 8400 or so )<br />
65 Necro<br />
65 Necro<br />
65 Cleric<br />
65 Chanter<br />
65 Shaman<br />

We had a couple deaths on each one so I'm pretty sure without those we can win, we did get partial credit for both and still had time to run around opening boxes.</div></div><hr />

I just completed a hard LDoN with a paladin tank with under 7500 HP and 100 AA, and nobody in the group from any e-planes guild - the only slow we had was bard slow, who was pulling as well.<br />

<br />
I took a quick peek at your magelo. The problem wasn't hp, it was ac.<br />
<br />
Try doing hards again when you have ~200 or so more unbuffed ac.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the original poster. I'd suggest you get at least 1k more unbuffed hp and 300+ ac. After that you should be gtg.<br />
<br />
Once again. Past 8500 hps (or so), the key will switch to high ac, not higher hps. By around... oh... call it 1650 ac you should be mitigating enough for any decent, luclin-geared cleric to keep up.<br />
<br />
I still have problems with 11000 <br />
<br />
Sorry, but this I just do not understand :). Would you mind putting that into context? Like, do you train yourselves for fun, etc?<br />
<br />
Only possible way I could see an 11k war having problems with ldon period is if his group was pulling 3+ mobs at once and leaving them un-cc'd :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are doing pre-Ele Hards with an enchanter for dps (hasted charmed pets really make the difference in winning) you had better have a paladin in the group.  My friends will win Hards with a 8.4k paladin as the only tank.  They flat out told me that if I was the only tank, no way in hell would they do hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard is still hard no matter how much HP you have if you don't pay attention.<br />
<br />
Even hasted normal mobs deal out plenty of pain for a 11k HP warrior.  <br />
<br />
I find it's more important to get haste off mobs as opposed to being able to slow them right away (because you could fail to slow something, even if aggro isn't an issue, whereas you can't fail to dispel).  <br />
<br />
As long as your cleric CH conservatively you should be able to get away with having fewer HPs on your tank.  There's no better heal than CH on Hard for a tank on just about any circumstance anyway, even if you have to start CHing at 90%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said - we did a hard adventure, with no charm, DPS consisting of a bard, 2 paladins WITHOUT slay undead using the creator 2hb, and a paladin with 4400 hp unbuffed tanking, missing most of his defensive AA and a bard as the only slow.<br />
<br />
All it takes is a great bard pulling singles, and some quick heals from the druid if the CH won't land.<br />
<br />
Good gear can compensate for bad play - and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Melee DPS is by far greater than caster DPS on Hard missions.<br />
<br />
My most damaging non charm Hard group was 2 warriors, 1 paladin (not undead dungeon), and 1 bard as DPS.  This outdamaged the 2 wizard 1 warrior group I had by quite a large margin.  Now of course I could've had rogues/monks instead of warriors/paladins doing damage but it already takes too long to find people willing to do Hard, so it's not really practical to wait even longer for the right DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only done two or three hard ldons but the key to them was a very skilled bard pulling like mentioned above.  He never really would pull more than 2 and by the time the mobs were to camp he'd have the add already mezzed anyway.  Need a bard with good FT though, he had to fade every once in a while.  Damage is just so spikey in hards though, couple of rounds you get minimum hits which are like 154 or something and your hp is barely dropping so the cleric holds off on the CH a bit then you eat a double for max + riposte for max and thats like a 3k chunk of hp very fast.  Another key I would say is having a cleric with Divine Arb3 or at least Divine arb.  Good for those times when you eat a few bad rounds and CH isn't gonna land in time and also good just as a free CH every 3mins or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the dungeon and how many enchanter mobs are in it really. The occasional 5 pull will hurt, or tons of mobs running around with wondrous rapidity will hurt more. Have wiped to that kind of thing a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just went through a hard EC adventure in 40 minutes with 8450hp/1630AC, no deaths - we had a ranger pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the hell?<br />
<br />
I don't know what to think.  My normal group is all pre-elemental, with under 100AAs.  I have common AC (about 1350 buffed), typical gear, common HPs (7300 exp-buffed), and about 80 AAs, mostly defensive.<br />
<br />
We win more Hard missions than we lose.  And yes, the cleric has to work hard.<br />
<br />
If you can't win missions without 8500HPs and elemental groupmates, perhaps some analysis is required, 'cause something is wrong.<br />
<br />
As a previous poster said, you have the be willing to die a few times, and lose sometimes too.  If these things bother you, then don't do hard missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilwee Beasty</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with several other posters. It is the SKILL of the entire group, and most especially the cleric, enchanter/bard that will make or break your group.<br />
<br />
Gear quite obviously makes it MUCH easier, but I can wipe easily at 9400 hp and 1900 ac in a shitty group, and win with 8900 hp and 1850 ac easily in a good group.<br />
<br />
Of course it preobably helps that I sit next to my cleric, and she has an effective FT 23 before any kind of enchanter/bst/bard mana regen~<br />
<br />
**because I know people will wonder how the hell you get that FT number...FT 15 + 3 from AA + 5 from Emp shawl = FT 23~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LorikTremere</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thank you all for the info it has helped greatly, I am going to work Lighting Reflexes since I got my Sta AA up to par. <br />
<br />
I am currently working on getting more of the Takish Plate as well, alredy have the BP going for Arms and Helm next.  After wich I will spend Points to fill the slots with Buffs,<br />
<br />
Aura of Battle<br />
Aura of Courage<br />
Guard III<br />
+40 HP<br />
+10 Sta<br />
+8 to Str Dex and Agi<br />
Plus some other stat buffs in there, once I have the helm and Arms my AC should be much better.  Also plan to put Anger III in my off hand epic wich will give me +1400 hate in procs alone.  Atm I think I could do a Hard Adv if for nothing else to get a feel on how to MT it, win or loose its a good learning experience either way.<br />
<br />
Again thank you all for the wonderfull advice its been extremely helpfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just did a Hard mission with this group to see if it could be done:<br />

65 shaman<br />
65 cleric<br />
65 monk<br />
me<br />
<br />
All were pre-VT, pre-Sol Ro.  The 6500 buffed hp warrior was in NToV gear and had recently returned to the game.   He tanked the whole thing except for 2 mobs.  We won with more than 30 mins remaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard missions vary greatly in difficulty.  I don't see how the last group mentioned can possibly beat a 'hard' hard mission with that kind of time left, such as a bad assassination or a slaughter 60.  To be safe your group should at least be able to win a slaughter 60, which isn't trivial to win.  <br />
<br />
Pulling on Hard is easy unless you're feel like having punishment and you're doing Tak or Guk.  I can pull almost any Hard mission on the remaining 3 themes and get singles the majority of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a hard just two days ago.<br />
<br />
Group was:<br />
<br />
Me and my best friends. Been wanting to try my first hard with them for a few weeks now. The make up looked like this:<br />
<br />
65 monk (me)<br />
65 SK<br />
65 Ranger<br />
65 Rogue<br />
65 Cleric<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
<br />
We won.<br />
<br />
It was slow and steady. Me and the SK pulled together, like we were raid pulling. Tags and what not. SK tanked. And the DPS was there. I died twice. The SK died once. That's it. Chanter was able to handle two in camp, but probably not three (we didn't test that).<br />
<br />
We didn't fight any nameds (There was only one and he was in the opposite direction of the way we went, so would have taken a long time to clear to afte we finished).<br />
<br />
It was HARD. No mistake there.<br />
<br />
But it was also some of the most fun I've had in EQ in ages. <br />
<br />
And I knew if I had any chance to win a hard, it'd be with that group. Not becauase of class makeup or design. But because we're all good friends. They're my RL friends. We hang out together all the time. And so IN GAME we work really well together. And that kind of team-work helps when EQ gets hard, or challenging, like the high risk adventures can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done 30+ hard missions over the holidays. I've done one where we finished with 1 minute left (slaughter and had multiple deaths), and one where we only had 5 people and finished with 13 minutes left.   Another time we finished with over 45 minutes left.<br />
<br />
A lot of how they go depends on if you have a good puller (bard is probably best suited) and good crowd control.</div></div><hr />

Ive noticed that they all had Bards in them as well as a chanter.  Most of these adventures had chanters for dps (they were outdpsing everyone else), even had 1 group with 2 chanters to CoD =).  Ive won one hard with a cleric as the only healer, the rest had cleric + druid or cleric + shaman.  <br />
<br />
I think pretty much Hard LDoN adventure minimum requirements are:<br />
<br />
 - an awake level 65 group with skills<br />
<br />
* you do not need mez to CC, root works well.  Ive had some bards pull well, and some just constantly train the group, make sure you know who you get, or maybe that good bard i had got ebayed :(.  PS, make sure your chanters have CoD before you invite them, Ive actually been invited to a hard ldon adventure with chanters asking what CoD was, then both saying they didnt have... luckily I had the spell on me and gave it to one of them, but they never used it for some reason.   True however that it is easier with skilled people, and a lot better when they in VT or better gear.  If you are new to hard adventures, best place to learn/start is in Everfrost adventures imo.<br />

Just did a Hard mission with this group to see if it could be done:<br />

I am in awe - what's your secret ?<br />
<br />
Even with a guaranteed single every single pull ( which you certainly didn't have with that group ), that's still an impressive amount of dps for 2 warriors, 2 shamans and a monk ( unless you want me to believe the cleric was healing a 6.5k tank AND nuking *grin* )<br />
<br />
For the people hassling the 11k warrior - all sorts of nastiness can go on when a pull goes bad - for instance 3 miragul's spiders can potentially do more than 9k damage in a single round of attacks.</div></div><hr />

I know the one I won, if it were a different mission type, may have had a far different result.</div></div><hr />

Ench pets are TEH DPS in hard advs. A good ench  with a bard as assistmezzer and a good cleric can use dual wield pets with haste which alone outdamage the whole group.  If you really feel ur pulling 3 and are below 8k hp, let the mezzer target one, get an elixir and tell the cleric to CH right after your inc message... The worst thing imho are assasinate missions with 3 adds in the Boss pull.</div></div><hr />

I think my group has won hard missions in 30 mobs before.  Average is probably about 40 mobs to win.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is just me, but the low-number-collect missions also seem to have sparser mob layout, which is a big deal for pulling hard missions.<br />
<br />
As for how pre-VT groups deal with bad pulls on hards -- there's a simple rule, never have a bad pull.  Puller is always prepared to die to avoid aggroing the group, and is always given space to do so.  Targeting is done by eye-of-zomm or some other aggro-free method.  Evac classes and second healers help too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did 5 hards in a row 2 nights ago, all collections between 22 and 24. Won all of them, fastest in 35 mins.<br />
<br />
Group was (all 65) :<br />
<br />
Warrior (me at max defensive AA)<br />
Cleric (my bot)<br />
Bard<br />
Pally<br />
Rogue<br />
SK<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, Bard was slower and puller. I died a few times, pally died twice. Bard died 3 times in all. If one tank fell another just took over. Used CH most of the time, even on the pally.<br />
<br />
Was not all that hard, but all guildies helps alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had:<br />
 <br />
Time-Guild Chanter<br />
7630 hp SK (Pulled)<br />
65 Monk<br />
65 Mage<br />
65 Warrior (7777 hps) - me<br />
65 Cleric<br />
<br />
We thought SK had 10k hps because he was in Time guild. Turned out he had only joined a week ago hehe. Good guy though.<br />
<br />
We didnt get a CoD mob till late in adventure. Monk died twice during pulling, and Whole group died when we were rushing at the end. We got down to 9 mins left and 8 mobs to go.<br />
<br />
Took too long to get set up in overtime and failed with 4 mobs left on 50 slaughter.<br />
<br />
Our biggest issue was getting singles fast enough and good DPS. I had to fortitude a couple times, I had Defensive Disc up a bunch to help healing. We even took out a 4 pull once when monk died because chanter was so good.<br />
<br />
Lack of CoD mob though kills you. You almost have to have one if you want to win. <br />
<br />
Yes, the Cleric started Cheals as soon as I took one hit...Until the mob was slowed.<br />
<br />
Biggest quad I got was 2800 hps in one round I believe. That was a little bit of a shocker.<br />
<br />
Fun Stuff, but you really do have to pick your group members well.<br />
<br />
I can actually tank ok, (a little bit of a sponge) I just need a cleric with strong mana regen. Beast buffs and Nines wouldnt hurt before you go in btw.<br />

It is very easy as soon as you grasp the idea that root is god like and stuff doesnt summon.   Enchanters are fun to take for thier charmed pets...makes them go pretty quick.   We usually have the ranger pull with snare and hardly every need to mes things.  Just remember they dont summon and rootable...most of them.   If you have a wiz or someone able to stun them I use my wiz to stun so my shaman can cast malo then slow for no aggro and we have no problems</div></div><hr />

At that point we weren't trying to win - we'd send in a ranger first to track and if there were no names, we'd restart.  I think I have more losses than anyone else on the server :P<br />
<br />
My guild is now elemental but I have no elemental armor yet.  Raid buffed I'm at about 9200 hps and 1680 AC.  LR 5, ID 5.  Typicaly for a hard LDoN I go War, Cleric, Shm, Bard, Ench, DPS<br />
<br />
I've done it without a bard (had a wiz instead), I've done it with a druid instead of a shaman, and I've done one once with no secondary healer.  At this point I rarely lose with that set up.</div></div><hr />

Obviously he is far from uber, no FT, 8 aa points, 4k mana pool.  Our tank was a paladin from a Time guild, but we had no shaman, and a CH that landed at about 50% healed 4200 hps, so I imagine he was under 9k hps.  Frankly it was a piece of cake.  I never went below 50 mana, and only had to use supernal light (instead of CH) a couple times.  There was another paladin in the group that was mostly taking care of group heals and such, but I'm pretty sure I could have handled that as well as the MT.  I was actually nuking once a fight or so and still staying mostly full mana.  <br />
<br />
Rest of the group was an enchanter and a necro with elemental+ gear and a 58 beastlord (really).  Whoever said AC is more important than hps is probably right on.  After doing that though, I wouldn't think twice about doing one on my warrior (would have before now but generally it seems like my LDoN groups are always half bots).</div></div><hr />

Given that change, is anyone aware if they changed the difficulty of the adventures?<br />
<br />
I've started doing the &quot;high risk&quot; missions with my regular group. We've been grouping together for about 1.5 years.  We are all 65, pre-elemental, with an average of 130 AA.  While its not a cake walk it has been easy with the bard pulling 1-3 and getting the adds on ice.  The group is War (me), shammy, druid, mag, wiz and bard.  While we do have the occasional death its not a big deal.  I have an ench/cleric posted enroute to do quick buffs and we just finish up the mission.<br />
<br />
I think bottom line it comes down to the type of mission (Collect are a bit easier), the zone and how well the group works together.</div></div><hr />

-pull reasonable numbers<br />
-handle crowd control when &quot;oops&quot; pulls happen<br />
-slow the mobs OR handle massive burst healing<br />
-provide high, sustained DPS<br />
<br />
Well geared pallys are very hard to beat as MAs, tho warriors with high AC and the new separate timer discs + incite can do pretty well.   &quot;Optimum&quot; group I've seen is pal, ench, shaman, cleric, monk, &lt;dps class&gt;, all ele geared.  With a DC pet, that combo can grind thru a typical hard collect in 30-40 min.<br />

You dont DC you just use CoD.  The wolf pets in EC do something like over 700dps after you give them haste.  Last hard I did mobs was just falling over dead soon as the pet hit them...was nonstop chain pulling...having snare &amp; malosinia highly recommended :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
setup was<br />
war 65, (me)<br />
wiz 65, (me)<br />
shmy 65, (me)<br />
cleric 65, (me)<br />
<br />
chanter 65(him)<br />
paladin65(him).<br />

i didnt really had ahuge problem with time or shit in hards, but whati  found out its defintly worth to wait for collects in hards as we usally finish them with 20 -30 mins left.<br />
<br />
we're pacify pulling 1-3 max, because at 9,4k hp i wouldnt wnat to tank more then 2, Root parking is a nice tool for hards as well.</div></div><hr />

i would suggest trying NROs or EC, because these are usally very open spread areas you wont have huge split problems with, or use straight a bard because a monk is kinda worthless in the short terms of time. be sure pacifyier got a HIGH cha, at 200 chanter dead about each 2nd pull at 305 it was way better.</div></div><hr />

I really don't see why you'd do a Hard on a Tak unless you're just so sure you can't possibly mess up, or if there's an item there you really want.</div></div><hr />

We also have:<br />

Chanter: CC &amp; Slows<br />

If you have a bard as puller, you can substitute a Shaman for the slows instead of the chanter.<br />
