Some of you at Fennin tonight may have seen this.<br />
<br />
Say for example on Fennin the main tanks disc is about to fade. Instead of letting it fade and hoping for the best, we can;<br />
<br />
1) ST runs in hits riposte disc (furious)<br />
<br />
2) St hit AEtaunt then hits Incite to ensure aggro<br />
<br />
3) Clerics have 12-15seconds to switch healing to ST. During this time Druids/Shaman can heal to cover ae dmg.<br />
<br />
4) As soon as Furious Fades which will generate alot of aggro blocking and returning every attack, ST will hit Defensive/Stonewall depending on situation. <br />
<br />
By this time the chain could be easily transferred without fear of clerics dying on MT death. <br />
<br />
BTW this worked great tonight. I gave it a test try before our server crashed</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurok</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you know there is a good chance that you will have to do a tank swap during a fight you can easily pick four tanks and put them at 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the agro list using the new taunt's.  <br />
<br />
Tank 1 <br />
Uses incite pops it right when they start and pretty much every 30 seconds after that.  Since this is the only tank who will be using procing weapons there is no chance they will lose agro with the extra instant agro and the hate modifer.<br />
<br />
Incite<br />
1:  	Increase Hate by 398 (L63) to 400 (L65)<br />
2: 	Increase Modify Hate by 68 (L63) to 70 (L65)<br />
<br />
Tank 2 <br />
Uses a non hate procing weapon and pushes the berate button every time it pops.  (Be carefull to save enough endurance for fortitude, defensive ect, however.  An extra 300 hate every 30 seconds and a hate modifier of 60 should be plenty to keep this tank ahead of anyone else on the raid but still behind the number one tank.  <br />
<br />
Berate<br />
1:  	Increase Hate by 291 (L56) to 300 (L65)<br />
2: 	Increase Modify Hate by 57 (L56) to 60 (L59)<br />
<br />
Tank 3 <br />
Exactly the same as above but uses bellow.  AGain 200 hate should be enough to keep this tank ahead of most of the raid and just behind the 2nd tank.<br />
<br />
Bellow <br />
1:  	Increase Hate by 200<br />
2: 	Increase Modify Hate by 50<br />
<br />
Tank 4.<br />
Same as above with provoke<br />
<br />
Provoke<br />
1:  	Increase Hate by 85 (L20) to 100 (L35)<br />
2: 	Increase Modify Hate by 25 (L20) to 45 (L40)<br />
<br />
When the first tank dies <br />
<br />
Tank 2 Uses incite<br />
Tank 3 uses berate<br />
Tank 4 uses bellow<br />
Tank 5 uses provoke if needed.<br />
<br />
To be quite honest.  As much as I love these changes.  I think they are going to make tank swaping extreamly trivial, where it did used to take some skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that way is nice but only prob by the time ou got to 3rd tank with just defensive timing out the 3rd tank will mostlikely have not endurance to use defensive and there would be no point.<br />
<br />
Using aetaunt and hitting fortitude/incite/defensive will do alot more and allow you to use the discs to full time<br />
<br />
example today im mt used incite/Fortitude/defensive/insicte then precision i had no endurance about same time (slightly before cause ran ooe which ended it early) precision ran out.  defensive lasts 3min or so so thats 6 times of pressing berate x 200 youll get some regen but your fighting so not much thats almost a full endurance bar, then you will have a shortened defensive.<br />
<br />
then the third tank hitting belittle or whatever for 3min then turning to berate for 3min hell be ooe before his turn up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's much easier to manipualte where you're on the aggro list using different weapons, provided you're at least at Elemental level.  Below that level, weapons do not generate enough aggro so that your say 3rd tank can use a weapon that does less aggro than the first 2 warriors consistently, yet still has enough aggro not to lose a bunch of casters when the switch happens.<br />
<br />
Of course, AE Taunt pretty much takes care of any need to arrange aggro list in a correct manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand, maybe now people will use tank rotations  more often, instead of single tanking and only switching for deaths. I think its good and will let all the non &quot;MT&quot; warriors have some fun as well as be better for the raid. Plus, they can go aggressive when not tanking!</div></div><hr />

Good point. We rarely used tank switches before because it wasnt worth the extra hassle. But now I imagine quite a few more tanks will be getting some tanking action.<br />
<br />
Btw, any way to hotkey incite with /doabi or /disc? Would like to have it as last line on my AE taunt hotkey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just make mobs that are untankable w/o defensive.<br />
<br />
Damn has anyone forgotten AoW ? ....<br />
<br />
At least in the old days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Augustus</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furious Disc will make you able to tank anything. Least till it runs out. Heh. then you can just pop Defensive. Think that's the point worked at here.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like Besri is going to make me work more now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Used AE Taunt, Furious, Stonewall a couple times last night and it worked great for me.  Just have to make sure that you use hotkeys for them and not the UI which is too slow and clunky.  Also you prolly want to hit Stonewall a few times as Furious is wearing off, it'll give you msgs like 'you are already using a discipline' until it drops.  Thus you can reduce the chance of getting hit for full a few times between the 2 discs.  I don't think there's any real point in using Incite if you are going to be doing furious and AE taunt, that will put you on top, and then ahead a good ways (specially if using a 2h).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuniargo</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a hotkey on one of my back hotkey pages specifically for tank switching.  This all can be manually done, but it's always nice to have something like this for me at least:<br />
<br />
/rs Tank switching in progress to ME!  Tank switching in progress to ME!<br />
/alt activate 110<br />
/pause 121, /disc furious<br />
/disc defensive<br />
/rs DEFENSIVE ON - DEFENSIVE ON - DEFENSIVE ON</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurok</div><div class="date">12-20-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for having the next tanks using the other taunts to stay 1.2.3 and 4 on the agro list is so that the mob turns immediatly on your instead of summoning a cleric, rogue or wizard who might be number two.  No matter how fast your reaction time is in hitting ae taunt there are times where a mob will summon and kill a caster before you can blink.  <br />
<br />
I guess I'm the only one who has ever had a tank die , and then the mob takes off running to kill a caster, and in doing so runs right out of range of my ae taunt.</div></div><hr />
