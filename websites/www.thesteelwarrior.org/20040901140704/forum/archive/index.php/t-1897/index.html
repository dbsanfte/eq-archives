<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">..we still all want to try to have a real life meeting of sorts  ?<br />
<br />
just curious if it's still being thought about; i knew azlana asked a while ago..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yep.. yep..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Make that a double...<br />
<br />
yep.. yep..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh I am willing to go with 3. :p. Perhaps once we set a date a few more will come out of the woodwork...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">weekends work best for me; weekdays are rough with work.<br />
<br />
let's get the ball rolling !! and someone has to have a digital camera i hope :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well this weekend is a family reunion...ugh.<br />
<br />
I was thinking something Friday nightish? 7/25? 8/1?<br />
<br />
We meet in Manhattan? I have no clue where you are Az or how you are for transport...<br />
<br />
If we do meet out here on the Island, I would toss out Jillian's as a possiblity? (The one on Rt 110 in Farmingdale.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think az is westchester county....i know i'm about 45 minutes east of Jillian's but i live in the boondocks. easy enough though if manhattan is the center point it's only a hop skip and a jump to the ronkonkoma train station.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am about 5 minutes from Huntington station. So training in is NP here either (well other than the $14.00 LIRR takes now)...<br />
<br />
LOL <br />
<br />
*has visions of shouting TRAIN! as the train pulls in :p*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oulurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*has visions of shouting TRAIN! as the train pulls in *<br />
<br />
LOL  I can picture the blank stairs on the commuter's faces as they are far to used to people shouting innane jibberish they don't understand.<br />
<br />
Funds are a little tight for me at the moment, but I'd like to make it if I can.  I'm all of 5 minutes from Ronk train station, but I have no vehicle or licence.  To bad my EQ friend moved to AZ, I'd hate to drag another along to listen to us talk EQ, vent about Sony and dev's, and make general fools of ourselves with EQ related comments.  (like shouting TRAIN! lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azlana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">NYC would be best fer me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Besides there is an advantage to having this in the city.<br />
<br />
BEER!<br />
<br />
If we were to do this a weekend, early would be better. I am in 2 face to face games. Yes I need a real life. (Champions and D20 modern (as a break from our 18 month old 3rd ed D&amp;D game).<br />
<br />
Well it sounds like the ball is in your court Az.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the 7/26 weekend is out for me; got a busy weekend with the school bus demolition derby...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">School bus demolition derby?<br />
<br />
LOL care to expand on that a bit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shik...you scare me sometimes lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">what?  :D  20 school buses; one track..last one running wins..woot 100 dollars? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LOL where is this happening/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Riverhead's little racetrack (http://www.riverheadraceway.com)<br />
<br />
My brother-in-law allegedly has a bus lined up for me to go smash up; but on the 26th there's going to be; along with the normal race fare; a school bus demolition derby and a &quot;train race&quot; ( Three cars chained together end to end, front car having the engine, middle car has the driveshaft removed and steering welded to stay straight, and the end car with no drivveshaft and only having steering )..<br />
<br />
I've been racing cars since I was around 15 years old ( around 19 years now )....kinda hard to not have grown up outside of when 5 of your relatives all race there and my younger cousin chris is 4th generation in his family to race there :D. <br />
<br />
tons of fun. it's basically my only vice outside of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Az! We are awaiting your pleasure.<br />
<br />
1) shikarii you're just a babY! Gah! Ok, thinking less bar, more bar/food place.....and ignore that beer comment! You're too young (offically). <br />
<br />
Ahhh the roach coach figure 8 race. LOL good luck!<br />
<br />
So you have that whole left foot breaking thing down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">methinks you did the math wrong :D <br />
( i started racing when i was 15, which was 19 years ago .. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nope, math was fine...<br />
<br />
READING was bad :p.<br />
<br />
You should know that, warriors strong on math...weak on reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i was going to say; unless you are collectin' social security and chase yer grandkids around i ain't no spring chicken....<br />
<br />
and, touch my beer and die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Youth is in the mind not the body.<br />
<br />
I will probably die anyway, but why would I mess with your beer? <br />
<br />
You are no less that 5 months older and no more than 17 months older than I am...assuming you aren't being too fuzzy about when you started racing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oulurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow, I may be the young one at this thing.  I'd never ask a lady her age, so I'll just assume Az is 21 like she looks. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">*boots thread in the behind to get it moving again*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">years before EQ came out. I basically quit hanging out in bars/pubs when I turned 21 :D ( life in a small town growing up sucks like that )</div></div><hr />
