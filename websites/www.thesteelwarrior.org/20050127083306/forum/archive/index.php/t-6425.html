<br />
<br />
I have been reading the boards for a month or so. I took a long break from EQ on my warrior so I have gotten out of touch with gear and weapons.<br />
<br />
While I &quot;think&quot; my gear is ok and I &quot;think&quot; my weapons are ok I am confused because I have read so many different setup's about gear, weapons and augments.<br />
<br />
I am not in an elemental guild anymore, but I do open raid as much as possable in BoT. I feel comfortable with the set up I have because I &quot;think&quot; its ok but wanted to ask some experts.<br />
<br />
I am having a few minor agro issues from time to time but not often.<br />
<br />
Based on the gear I have does anyone see any glaring weaknesses?<br />
<br />
Is my Great Blade of Storms/Obsidian Scimitar of War a decent weapon setup still? Are there any upgrades that I need to look at in the weapon area?<br />
<br />
I know I need augments in the weapons, regardless whichever ones I use but here’s the question there. I have read post where people advise to use yak and others that say anger 2 or anger 3. Also, some say Anger 3 in a GBoS is good other said Yak.<br />
<br />
So before I blow adventure points and learn that I screwed up could someone or several people clear up my confusion on yak/anger augments and which augment I need in which weapon for the best agro set up.<br />
<br />
I think I have a strong grip on the AA path as I am now at 134 but if you see a glaring weakness there please point it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you all  for reading my post and any advise/corrections you make.<br />
<br />

<br />
There are some things missing like Helm of Rallos Zek, Blade of Carnage, Crystallized Acid Bracer....You might buy some day.<br />
<br />
In Terms of your Agro, Either Ykesha and Anger III or 2x Anger III is fine. <br />
<br />
I don't think you are going to get a 100% firm answer. <br />
<br />
Anger III in general is expected to be better agro than Ykesha.<br />
<br />
So if you are the type of person that definitely wants the best stuff, then Get 2x Anger III. <br />
<br />
Just make your next 30 AA points Weapon Affinity 5 and you won't be worrying about agro again.<br />

Whoops just saw your AA's...Get ID and LR maxed out LOL. Some funky AA choices in there before your defensives were maxed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes made some /cough dumb aa choices in there  testing the waters and listening to a few well retards.  I have ID at 2/5 now and I am currently working on it.  Next plan is LR then WA.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
speaking from experience, your GBoS with anger3 will be more than enough to get the job done before any weapon affinity.  anger3 on your offhand + weapon affinity will make you an aggro demi-god ... only suffered by elemental wizards who are triggerhappy.  like they said .. unless you plan on significant tanking in past elementals/time .. that weapon setup should tide you over till forever.<br />
<br />
i'd reccomend anger3 for the primary.  for offhand either another anger3 or a yak augment would be good.  anger3 is still the best choice, though, and well worth the effort and timesink even for an offhand proc.</div></div><hr />
