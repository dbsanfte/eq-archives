<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kannul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">N00b warrior here.  What does it mean when your weapon has a DMG bonus?  Do you add the DMG and DMG bonus numbers for your total DMG on the weapon?<br />
<br />
Also, I currently weild a Wavecrasher in Primary.  What's a better weapon for secondary...  Sword of the Bloodsworn or Swiftblade of Zek?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">copper hammer of striking offhand :D packs quite a wallop + nice DD.<br />
SBoZ is nice and all but it's a bit dated these days; esp when for DPS you'll start leaning towards a two hander and not 2 non-proc 1Hers.<br />
<br />
Damage Bonus..err, i really need to copy and paste that chart into the library. it's kind of like what you said but there are some different variables involve dliek delay +/- a certain number for 1Hers and 2Hers and some over/unders that where it scales up  lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tillain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 65 the dmg bonus is 13, so lets say you have a 16 dmg weapon mainhand. Max hit is 95(108), Min hit is 1(14). The numbers in the brackets are the real numbers you get with a dmg bonus, non bracket numbers are what you'd get on a normal hit without the bonus (so like you would with your offhand)<br />
<br />
So basically its Normal hit + dmg bonus = total. If you are fighting a mob with really high ac or one with an ATK debuff(Creator in ssra comes to mind), you'll notice a lot of 14's and 1's spamming in your hits window. This is because you are getting the minimum hit in your mainhand as well as your offhand(offhand has no bonus). You can really notice the dmg bonus in fights like those.</div></div><hr />

Take 2Xdamage   then add the damage bouns  then divide that total by the delay and that will let you compare the &quot;modal&quot; point of two weapons. Higher means more DPS.<br />
<br />
I use WMBS (cheapo 4000pp weapon) for best DPS for the price:<br />
<br />
3.4 or something like that from above calculation at level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's the one. Thanks Sam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>HeartView</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With my Beastlord at 42nd level he still gets hits for 1 damge from time to time, even with a damage bonus of 5.  What gives?  My warrior isn't high enough yet to get a damage bonus (soon, methinks).</div></div><hr />
