I started it last night but I need some more info on spawn times or place holders. I tried Alakazams but there was very little info. I am basically looking for the BP for now.<br />
<br />
Any info would be great...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly, I can no longer find the Twilight Exchange EZboard, which would have solved a great deal of your problems. Here's some basics:<br />
<br />
 Twilight Sea - If your list of pieces says to kill mob XXX YYY, and he's not up, proceed to killing all mob XXX that aren't XXX Workers or XXX Warders - those will only spawn more Workers and Warders. Killing any of the others will bring a small chance of popping the named. Shadows should be fairly easy to get as long as someone is farming smithing stuff. Named minnows spawn only off of the NE corner of the water, and are a pain.<br />
<br />
 Tenebrous Mountains - Any aliens or animals you need, just hack aliens/animals at random. Coterie named you need have specific spawn points in/around the castle - I don't know these ones. Just keep killing PH's until a named spawns.<br />
<br />
 Scarlet Desert - All Vas Ren named spawn at one of two places: The static spawns around the lake, or in the tents. Tro Jeg named PH's are all Tro Jeg Sentinels. Do not bother with Shamans, Soldiers, Banes, or static spawns. Sun Revenants only spawn in the camps on the walls, don't bother with the plateau. Named flowers/cats/hoppers/bugs can spawn from any flower/cat/hopper/bug. (Yes, that's right: Kill a bug, you might spawn a named flower. Yes, it's fucked up.) Named Grol Baku are half spawn points in the caves and the tents, and half killing Sentries until a random named pops.<br />
<br />
 Mons Letalis - I know next to nothing about this zone, because it's a cast iron bitch to hunt in. Named Spirits are on static spawns in the big ugly thing in the middle, kill PH's. Named Horrors ditto in caves. Named Thought Leeches ditto in caves. Named Shik'Nar come off of killiing non-hatchlings. Named Stonegrabbers come off of any Stonegrabber. Same with named hoppers.<br />
<br />
 General Tips - Bazaar shopping is gonna help a lot. ALWAYS keep an eye cocked for odd pieces you need. Also ask the local Twilight piece dealer (if there is one on your server) if you have any troubles finding stuff - they are usually pretty good about that.<br />
<br />
 ALWAYS check the zones on patch day.<br />
<br />
 Remember that all this stuff has factions. Continued farming WILL make you KoS, and that's a pain, especially in the hidden area of Twilight.<br />
<br />
 All in all, using all of the above, plus the old board that's gone now, took me about 6 months to get a full set of Bravado's with my low 50's Bard. Also ended up with an extra 30-40 full pieces of armor for other classes and a mule full of random pieces. Plus a bunch of extra cash from selling drops. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">tracking is a huge benifite for finding the named mobs. while running through some of these zone on my ranger, i noticed that almost every 3rd or 4th creature was one of the named mobs that drops some of the pieces for these quests that i would otherwise of never noticed as a non-tracking class. <br />
<br />
usually the mobs with the special drops have slightly different names. for instance, stonegrabbers are very common, but a named might be a glowing stonegrabber, an enormace stonegrabber, a vicious stonegrabber, (these are just examples) and so on. allakhazam would have a full list.</div></div><hr />
