This helped for alot of things such as new guildies in general could catch up relatively fast on AA progression for being on pair with the guild they joined.<br />
<br />
However in OOW AA speed seem to have dramatically decreased. I do realise that you can reach a somewhat tolerateble rate if you go with the right group to the right zone. However it seem to me that for average xp groups it is realy slow. <br />
<br />
Seeing that the influx of new players to the game is realy low meanwhile AA requirements is skyrocketing with new available AA's i wonder how it at all will be possible to maintain a guild rooster. <br />
<br />
Eventually ppl will quit. If not tomorrow then in one year or when eq2/wow is released etc. How on earth is new players ever going to catch up to the current requirements for guilds.<br />
<br />
My guild isnt that far, we are curently learning inktuta. It takes arround 2-3 month for a new member to become on pair with the guild in gear. However i dont see how on earth it is going to become possible to catch up on AA's.</div></div><hr />

Take a guild group there and I think you'll be impressed :)<br />
<br />
I've also done a bit of multi boxing in RCoD as well to get some runes for my alts.  The aa/kill is pretty good there as well, and you get away from other people most of the time.  It's on par with KT I'd say, and easier in comparison.</div></div><hr />

I find this an odd statement(not meant in an insulting way).  Dranik Hollow expeditions, 2 % AA per kill, unreal fast kills.  I get an AA every hour and a half with no effort.  Ruined City expeditions, 3 % AA per kill, fast kills, AA every 1.25 hours, easy.  MPG 4 to 5 % AA per kill, kills reasonably fast, AA every 45 minutes.  RS 5 to 7 % per kill, moderate kill time, but overall AA time slowed down by our group being marginally lower geared than really should be ideally for RS(read that we need downtime for medding), still an AA per 45 minutes to an hour.  Ruined City and WoS I have not really spent enough time in yet, but from what I am told, AA's not that hard to get there either.  Anguish I have no idea about.<br />
<br />
Before OoW came out, the best place for EXP that I went to was KT, and they were no faster than what I am getting now.  I am very happy with the pace that AA's come in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now we are looking at a gear difference.  Compare my gear to yours, consider the people I exp with have similar gear, and extrapolate from there.  I actually cannot tell you what we could get in PoV pre-OoW, simply cuz it was not some place I exp'ed in for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tanked RS with less gear than Redhenna and only died twice over the course of the night due to an unexpected add and due to a goof up on the clerics part. I was only buffed to 10,600 and about 1850ac. As long as you have a solid cleric you can do it np. We were making an AA per hour because the puller kept F'ing around trying to find out where named spawned. It should have been faster.<br />
<br />
PoFire is still close to 2 aa per hour though with a high dps good group and is easier than mobs in omens. I have yet to do anything in Omens that has compared to the XP in fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RS is very doable at our gear level.  When I have been there, we try and keep constant pulls, and the cleric I was with had mana issues that slowed us down...when we had a nice routine going, 1/2 hour per AA was doable, even at our gear, just not sustainable.<br />
<br />
Edit:  BTW Bes, you need to break out Dariuse again and come hang out some night.  Dariuse needs EXP too!</div></div><hr />

Beats even Castle2 in xp, havent found anything as amazing as that.<br />
But you need some serious Qvic+ group for that.<br />
<br />
With a good group (bard / war / cleric / sham / rogue / mage) we were above 3AA / Hour.<br />
Probably something like 3.5 or 4 (didnt really check).<br />
By the time you were done moving, the cycle had repoped, and you have almost zero pull times.<br />
The only bad thing, is no horse, so that slows you down a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a pickup group (a mixture of the 2 best guilds on my server, both qvic, and me being guildless) in riftseekers at level 69. You don't need to be qvic only to go to riftseekers. I tanked every mob with a pickup group and only had a total of 4 deaths (3 was on 1 pull with an add then a spawn). So don't count out riftseekers if you aren't to qvic yet. My gear was even more gimp then it is now. If you are time able then you can do riftseekers.</div></div><hr />

I agree on the spacing, it does slow you down.<br />

And for someone that has yet to set foot in Time or past Ikky group trials, I think I do fairly well there.</div></div><hr />

Also i am ok on admitting that i get quite ok xp ratio when charging through to some MPG group trial. <br />
<br />
However, whenever i go outside my usual group xp ratio gets insanely slow. In pg its qiute simple, pulls are simply to slow for regular groups to get descent amount of xp on. This is probably due to a higher skill requirement for doing oow groupings, pulls needs to be very tight handled sudenly where in plane of earth as example you had to be as dumb  as your local village idiot to pull an add.<br />
<br />
However my post seem pretty misunderstood. I am not trying to figure out how i personally will get the best xp ratio in oow. What i wonder is more how the upcomming applicants are ever going to get on pair in AA in oow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boy-</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i think what jobned is trying to get at more is that there isnt very many places to do decent xp due to how crappy PG is set up.<br />
<br />
Obviously, basically the idea was that once you get above WOS/Dranik-level, your next zone for aa is pg.  Unfortunately in practice, PG-xp is hardly (if at all) better than WOS/Dranik xp.  The zone is just set up so stupidly spread out (i guess so a blind warrior with no range weapon could pull singles), that pulls simply take forever.  In anywhere other than the 6way camp, during the latter half of a repop cycle I'm doing nothing except exclusively pulling and praying i get back in xprange before the mob dies.  Crawling in PG really isn't bad xp, but with so many xpgroups camped at random xx ph spot, you can't really crawl anywhere without other groups bitching at you.  <br />
<br />
Soo, if you're above the level that that kill in WoS without wiping (which really isn't that hard), your next step of progression is into PG, which isn't an upgrade at all.  The aa is still horribly slow, which is a huge issue when most of a raiding guild's applicants are going to be at this stage (ie not fully aa'd and totally not geared for riftseekers).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understood what you where getting at, I gave numbers on how long for an AA per zone to highlite that I thought AA's where coming fast enough.  I, with no trouble at all can get 3 to 7 AA's per night(depending on where we go and how long we spend there...usually 3 to 5 hours) with no issues whatsoever.  Family guild friends(who lacked access to EP xp before OoW) are astounded at the AA xp they are getting at 70 in OoW.  One friend was all excited he had gotten 5 AA's in 4 hours in MPG(70 rogue, ornate/bazaar gear mostly).  How much faster do you need xp to come in?<br />

You missed RCoD instince zones.  Less xp per kill, but hella fast kills, and mobs are packed in there(it is the exact opposite of MPG...where in MPG you have to work to pull adds, in RCoD instinces you almost cannot help it, rooms have 5 to 8 mobs, plus lots of roamers).  To me these are actually the next logical step past WoS, and from there to MPG and into RS.<br />
<br />
For apps and AA'ing up, remember that before OoW, the rate of xp they where getting was reduced(gear and AA levels being lower), for people that I have had contact with, either in family guilds(ie, the people who would move up to a raid guild) or with low AA totals, and most seem rather happy with the pace AA's are coming in for them, compared to pre OoW.  While I, with EP access, KT flag, and raid gear(tho far far from uber, omg) find OoW xp to be a relatively small step up from pre- OoW, and you(much more uber, may find it too slow), those people who are getting major upgrades just from xp'ing in OoW zones(where FT drops like rain, and gimp DH instinces are dropping things like 52 AC plate legs) are finding that their AA totals are rising dramatically.</div></div><hr />

At 68 the aaxp is hellish fast in instanced zones (about 30% are even con to me). In fact I parked all my guys at 68 and cranked 75AAs in about 60 play hrs in these zones (not including setup time but I logged at instance entrance). My fav is the sewer entrance that can actually be placated (I lack a FD or bard puller in my box). Can pull like 15-18 mobs a cycle (20 mins) with only pull down time. They net 3-4% a piece so an AA every 45 mins or so is no real prob. Not bad and can be done by an underequipped grp depending on your puller (splitting 3 elites with a warrior and mezzing the 2 extras is always a fun use of defensive and Q/CH). Course the instances with that high mob density are hell for placate resists (what a crappy spell that one is) so I only pull the one where I have just one tough split. At 69 its still pretty good, 3% mostly, (wont know 70 for a while, am doing my key AAs as I go).<br />
<br />
Basically I dont buy the argument that a new raider will have a hard time getting AAs, I just think the expectation for AAs has escalated from 100-150 to like 300. That is the true source of a relative newb's issue with joining their first true raid guild.<br />

You can hang out in the little outlet at the bottom where a named spawns. There are more mobs close than you'll be able to kill. Just be careful crawling in as the respawn is so fast there and if you don't keep pushing forward they will respawn on top of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been hanging in Riftseekers lately and it is awesome exp. Once you learn where some safe camps are, there are plenty of pulls for the non-uber group. You won't kill as many mobs per cycle as in these other zones, but at 6% a kill it goes fast.  Also for the non-raid or upcoming raider ( and even most raiders), every camp will have some nice drops for you whether it is in the form of great augments or loot. If you stop paying attention to the exp bar and work on getting named and before you know it the aa will be piling up.</div></div><hr />

I'd imagine Riftseeker ought to have the best XP but it seems like more trouble than it's worth.  I guess it's good if you just plan to sit down in one place for a while and grind away.  I like RCoD (66-68) or RCOD instance zones because of fast pulls (especially instance zones).  Clearing to one trial in PG is pretty fun too, get reasonably good xp while doing something productive.<br />
<br />
Everything that's 66+ pretty much gives the same level of xp until you hit 70 (white) and 71+ (yellow).  A level 68 will give more xp than a 67 but it'll also have about that much more HP to compensate so it makes very little difference whether you're killing a 66 or a 69.</div></div><hr />

Are you sure Riftseeker can spawn in any of those spots? I've only seen him spawn in 3 spots. I don't think he can spawn in the center, Balancer, or Battlemaster spots. Would be nice to know because we usually leave battlemaster up since he doesn't assist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except it doesn't scale as you get higher dps.  MPG actaully works well for groups with low dps, or with casters, the pulllengths aren't that much of an issue, because you don't kill as many mobs per repop, you don't have to run as far to get each additional pull.  I consider decent xp about an aa every 30mins, which is about what we were getting in KT at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You missed RCoD instince zones.  Less xp per kill, but hella fast kills, and mobs are packed in there(it is the exact opposite of MPG...where in MPG you have to work to pull adds, in RCoD instinces you almost cannot help it, rooms have 5 to 8 mobs, plus lots of roamers).  <br />
<br />
Our tests put it at a bit less than 3%/kill, with each kill taking roughly a minute even with decent dps (these mobs, like hollows, have like 20% hp more than KT mobs for no apparent reason).  So while pull times isn't an issue, we're still looking at 40mins or so per aa, 35ish if everything is perfect.<br />
<br />
We'll probably get the crew together and try catacombs again, but I'm pretty sure we'll be disappointed by it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prefect does indeed spawn at Taromani's feet. I have personally spawned him 4 times there. Also, in your Queen -&gt; Riftseeker rotation, if you pull the 2 chimera PHs just SE of Riftseeker room (go straight instead of turn left into room), they are PH for Familiar Venomtail and both come single. It sounds like you already have more than enough mobs to kill, but adding named is always a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds about right.  The point I was going for here was that for those people who would be apping a big raid guild, who lack AA's(and probably gear), that this is the next step after ooW.  40 minute AA's for low AA, bazaar/LDoN geared, unflagged people is exceptional.  Most people outside raid guilds that I know consider an AA per hour exceptional, and this is a place where they can get it even faster.<br />
<br />
As best I have seen, outside RS( and maybe Anguish) xp caps at roughly 45ish minutes per AA(figuring in downtime for whatever reason).  That is not perfect, but it is certainly not bad exp.  I suspect that is kinda by design, as if AA's come in too fast, people will max AA's too early, and have no reason to continue to exp.  Course I could be wrong too.</div></div><hr />

Well once again. My concern is still not ppl who are not raiding devoting their play time to getting AA and doing single group content. My problematic is kind of reverse this scenario. <br />
<br />
Alot of ppl playing this game actually have real lifes yet still commits to raiding guilds. This means that they maintain a normal working schedule (or study schedule), meanwhile they are raiding 5-6 hours every night +assigning the nescesarry time required to AA the nescesarry amount.<br />
<br />
Again to repeat an allready said point the new ppl starting lvling up going toward the raiding route is not overwhelming. At least on my server &quot;tholuxe paells&quot; the recruitment grounds are not very big. <br />
<br />
Another point is that the amount of AA's required to catch up with your guildies and actually become a valuable asset to the guild is insane, my guild main warriors got somewhere between 400-500 AA's that basically needs to be catched up. We are not talking resist AA's or various crap AAs here but actually defensive, avoidance, HP etc AA's that new ppl simply do not have. <br />
<br />
Yet xp speed are only on pair with what it was in tier 2 plane of power as i pointed out earlyer. We got up to 1 AA per 45 minute in plane of power Grinding 2 years ago. The required amount of AA's those days were lesser than half of what it is today with faster progression speed.</div></div><hr />

Like someone said earlier, Castle2 in Fire is still the best AA exp.<br />

Here is where I think the problem comes in.  If people with say 100 to 200 AA's can get to that 400 to 500 AA mark in a hurry, then people with 400 to 500+ AA's are going to get AA's even faster.  SoE I think is trying to limit AA speed so that the people in the latter catagory do not max out AA's too fast.  Unfortunatly, this has the side effect of limiting how fast lower AA people can get AA's.  I do not see a good path out of this problem tho.<br />
<br />
You are right that there are certainly a ton of important AA's now, I am at 424 atthe moment, and still got some good stuff to get, tho I am gaining fast on that.</div></div><hr />

Also there's some number of casters that never seem to gate which will help with DPS (casters less defensive skills) you also have clerics to balance it out.  Maybe the mobs are packed closer than say, PG or RS, but certainly not compared to say RCoD or RCoD instance zones.</div></div><hr />

In catacombsc, (i think C, the one that actaully has a safe zi) crawling through with 0 downtime for pulls.  First aa took 30mins, second aa took 31mins.  We probably could get it to 22-25mins if we had real dps (we had war/sk/rog/dru/bard/cle).  Pulls are pretty brutal tho (lull is fairly ineffective due to huge aggro ranges) and not sure i'd want to do it outside of my crew.<br />
<br />
In contrast, in PG, crawling from riftseekers to arcana was a 27minute aa, but we had slightly higher dps than in catacombs (enc instead of dru, dru didnt have 67 dps buff).</div></div><hr />
