<br />
how much hp per ac point is a good trade off?<br />
is there a formula for str/hp/ac trade offs?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you can really assign a value to 1ac = x hps.  Although some peoples extensive parsing suggest that increasing AC by x% yields a decrease in damage taken by y%.  This could be interpreted as an increase of your hps by some percentage.<br />
<br />
With that being said, you will commonly see figures thrown out here that suggest 1AC is roughly equivalant to 10HP's when determining which piece of gear to use.  Although there are many assumptions that go into this figure.<br />
<br />
When you start grouping with clerics over lvl 39 that have complete heal, hps start becoming more important than they were before when heals did a set amount of HP's.  The same 400 mana the cleric uses heals up to 7500hps regardless of how many you have or are down atm.  Therefore, the more hps you have, the more efficient that 400 mana is from the cleric.<br />
<br />
Another scenario that HP's may be of more importance is when you are Main tank at a raid level.  Some mobs hit for insane amounts of damage and you have to survive long enough for the heal to land.  Obviously, the more HP's you have the longer you have to live until healed.  There is a correlation between the AC you have though and the damage a mob does to you though so AC isn't irrelevant.<br />
<br />
This probably sounds like rambling, but I don't believe there is a cut and dry answer to your question.  Oh, and a final note, strength is virtually meaningless to warriors.  It does up your damage and attack ratings slightly, but much of the warrior gear has strength on it so personally I would chose HP/AC/STA and just be happy when a piece of gear gives you strength as a bonus.  By the time you get your gear to where you want I would bet you have more than enough strength as a side effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are tanking PoP stuff, whats better...<br />
<br />
Having a shaman buff you with 7, for 544 HP.<br />
<br />
Or right clicking an ornate BP for 300 AC buff and +36 AC (magic resist boost aside).<br />
<br />
choosing between 36 AC and 244 HP has become a little harder lately I think. Not sure which way I would go, with the option, think it would depend on the MOB in question.<br />
