<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iroxorsju</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was trying to think of a good way to increase warrior taunt and thought it would be cool for an AA.  The AA would be 3 lvs and have the same effect on you at all times as hate buffs that Enchanters/SK can cast.  First lv everything you do is 3% more agro second lv is 6% and thrid lv is 12%.  Have the Buffs stack on top of that.<br />
<br />
I am not sure how this would work of course.  Maybe it would be to much agro if you could stack the spells on top of the AA's version, allowing casters and other class to go nutty and not have to watch agro which is a big part in making it through a raid fight.  Might also jack up warriors that are not MT on raids.  Its just an idea i thought of, probably already brought up a few times.  Just wondering if anyone else has thought of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QxT</div><div class="date">09-06-2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That 'aggro increase to whatever you do' shit is way too 'gimme'. The effect on the raex bp and stuff like that, I just can't get into that. They need to change that effect to a damage shield that does damage and X amount of aggro everytime you get hit, some small increment like .5 or 1 point of hate, I dunno. That way gaining initial aggro still requires some old skool taktix and tricks of the trade but once you have it you can maintain it alot better. And who doesn't love a hoss damage shield? Make it like 25 point worn ds, make us smile, give us some dps while we get our asses beat. It also helps tangle /shield into the equation, since you /shield the ds/aggro mod go to work. Put's a lil new twist on /shield. I don't know how severe the effect on raex bp is, I don't and won't be wearing one for some time, but if 15% aggro mod to your actions is as strong as it very well should be, then would wearing it be like wielding EB weapons when you aren't tanking? Hazardous to your 'damage dealing' session? That would suck. Basically, an effect and AA's like that, are an uncreative way and very unthoughtful, stale ass, boring tactic to 'fix' our class. If they want to get into AA business with us, reduce the reuse time on ae taunt and rampage *alot* (why not rampage, ya know?) Give us an AA with like a 2 minute reuse or whatever, garauntee proc on next swing, if you're going to keep saturating us with aggro proc weapons to fucking rely on. It's coming, because instead of ripping us apart and starting us over, they just keep adding aggro gimicks like EB and shit. I know some people scoff the 'next swing definate proc' AA but if I told you to give us a weapon that dumped 600 or some-odd points of hate to our target via procs a few expansions ago, you'd call me insane. So at some point you have to realize to 'fix' us is to give us a big bag of tricks in the style of AA, procs, mods etc...but then they'll scale up every other class around it, so everything stays relative and the cycle keeps on spinning.<br />

Holy mini rant, been holding it in~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelissa</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hate buff idea could work, if it was a skill that could be clicked on or off.  Maybe a battle chant that plopped an icon in the Song window when active (stepping on Bard toes a bit there, but a self-only ability could be workable).  <br />
<br />
However, it should be implemented as a skill not an AA.  Class Specific AAs don't start until 59 which is too late of a point to address the issue.  Also, Warriors shouldn't be forced to spend AA points on something that is required to balance their class.  I'd think a skill that all Warriors got at, say 44, and maybe progressed as the Warrior went up in level would be workable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rather then start it at 59 with aa, make it an innate ability at around level 30,35 and have it pop up in your ability page. Make it scale from 1% bonus hate to 10% bonus at level 65. Make it a skill like forage except rather then you getting an item on your curser, you get a buff. Could possibly go into songs window so it wouldn't take a buffslot.<br />
<br />
That way you can click it off if you don't want agro (not MT or something).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, how about an aggro idea that doesn't involve another @%#$ing AA?  Something innate so we can all benefit from it rather than the 65s.  Enough with the AA ideas for aggro.</div></div><hr />
