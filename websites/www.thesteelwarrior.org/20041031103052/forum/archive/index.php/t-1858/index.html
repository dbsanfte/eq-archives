<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>terk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there. I'm a level 50 Warrior currently using Wavecrasher in Main, Frosty in Offhand. I know there have been a bunch of threads like this, but I'm wondering what the next step up from this would be in terms of keeping taunt, and improving damage. I seem to read that the wavecrasher is getting to be kind of a tired weapon, and that I might do better with Frosty in main. I have a Reaver for 2hs, but that doesn't seem to do as much aggro. (Or damage, but I could be imagining it). <br />
<br />
Any advice for purchasable upgrades? I see Disembowler and Fleshgrinder, which look nice, but probably terrible aggro. <br />
<br />
Just looking to know how I can do my job better. If I sell the wavecrasher, I'll have maybe 40k to spend. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your lvl 50, you wont find a better aggro combo that works for you than what you have, unless you have money for a BoC/SoD.<br />
<br />
Everything else out there better than that combo has post 50 req levels on em, except the afore mentiond BoC/SoD</div></div><hr />
