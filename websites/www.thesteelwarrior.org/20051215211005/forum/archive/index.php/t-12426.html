<br />
&quot;When the next content patch releases (version 1.7) fear spells will now cause opponents to flee immediately, even if they were already moving. This should cut down on the number of situations where fear hasn't been taking affect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hey, I got an idea, lets require alliance to have server race/class combinations that people rarely play (Dwarf priests), as opposed to shamans which are surplus.<br />
<br />
This change really blows for the onyxia fight.  It figures it would have to come right as my group gets the fight basically down too.  :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't even stance switch to avoid fear on onyxia, since she can do it before beserker rage finishes its cooldown.<br />
<br />

Onyxia just going to be... not fun.</div></div><hr />

Pfft.<br />

I'd like to take this oppurtunity to say &quot;Fuck cleanse.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this gay &quot;You release during a fight, you obviously suck and no loot for you&quot; bullshit, it's total and complete crap.  So they're making it totally uncontrollable, and making it so if you die to something early beyond your control, you also get screwed out of loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">08-06-2005, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">have you put loot on FFA and rezzed all dead before looting? we've had zero looting issues with it whereas before some people were definitely screwed out of items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">08-06-2005, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issues come from if you release and don't tag the mob again before it dies.  Have you guys had people get wiped out like that and still be able to successfully loot?  We do run FFA, and are pretty paranoid at getting people up since that announcement.</div></div><hr />
