<br />
Not a huge number of mobs in this  parsing,  a few hours in BoT before I bought  the first level of the avoidance AA. I tried to cut down the LR5 portion to match what I collected tonight in BoT.<br />
<br />
LR5: I was getting hit 46.89% of the time (per YALP parse)<br />
LR6: I was getting hit 45.56% of the time (per YALP parse)<br />
<br />
There's about 1400 swings (12 mobs) on each of those parses. I'd say one pct per level is what it looks like to me.<br />
<br />
Any other data yet? This isn't a long enough parse to really be definitive - its just a start.</div></div><hr />

What does that make it?  30/40% over a non-AA'd character?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought PE was 10% of CA/CF/CS thus we have CA3(10%)/CF0(0%)/CS3(10%)/PE = Avoidance(11%) / Crit (0%) / Mitigation(11%)<br />
<br />
Secondly I thought CA and CS was just raising AC softcaps (respectively the Avoiding AC softcap and the Mitigation AC softcap) and thus don't give a direct impact on domage recieved (opposed to shielding bonus from gears and Def/Eva discs) but decrease the overall domage along fights by changing the hit distribution.<br />
<br />
<br />
note : since there is no known limit for avoidance bonus from gears it might be considered as a Avoidance AC Softcap bonus.  ie if the softcap is 1000AC for monk, then it becomes 1100AC with 100 in avoidance. but this is just a thought.</div></div><hr />

I tanked some named in the far north of proving grounds last night and the mob hit me almost ever swing.

<br />
I'm noticing in proving grounds that the mobs dont hit nearly as hard, but hit more often -- exp mobs are quadding for 800 instead of double/tripling for 1200 like in KT.  The dps is the same, but my 100pt dmg shield is much better now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed DI/RM in beta but got kind of odd results.  I was fighting a level 70 mob.  Going from DI0 to DI5 only reduced my dps (50-60 min parse each time) by 3%, but RM 5 reduced it by 9%  I don't know what to make of this and I couldn't parse again because I couldn't un-buy the AA.  The only explanation I could think of was that I was at 2500 AC (wearing Dev twink gear) while parsing and if the mob had low attack it might have minimized the mitigation effectiveness because my AC was already so high that most hits were for minimum.  <br />
<br />
Will have to take a closer look at those logs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think there is an avoidance cap, or softcap in the traditonal way, CA/LR would just flat out make you get hit less.<br />
<br />
CS/ID suppodely raise your softcap which makes AC more effective (so basically is added mitigation) but besides for a dev stating its like that I havnt seen real hard evidence that it is, which leaves me wondering</div></div><hr />

It's not.  Read the AA screen, it says nothing about CF.  Furthermore, it's only a 2% bonus.<br />
<br />

<br />
You're a little confused here by too many terms.  I highly suspect that CA and CS work the same regardless of the AC level you're at.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty convinced that people that don't believe theres a softcap are caught up in thinking it has to be around 2k AC when in all reality to make sense it has to be around 1k AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that, but for that statement to be true, we have to rethink our definitions of &quot;Soft Cap&quot; because it is clearly not what the accepted definition of the word is.<br />
<br />
He stated that pretty much every level 65 already passes the softcap, and I've seen some really shittily geared 65's, so clearly he doesn't define softcap the same way we do.  Until we figure out what that definition is, I'd rather not confuse people with the terms.</div></div><hr />

It's not a square corner though, and AC is still very useful above that point, just doesn't make as big a difference as it did before.  I'd guess where the old hard cap was (12-1400) is probably where the knee is, and CS shifts it up a ways. I have a hunch that there is a harder cap somewhere in the 2000s but I don't know if it's ever been parsed.  I didn't read that shield thread as carefully as I should have probably.<br />
<br />
It's very possible that referring to cs as 10% mitigation isn't exactly accurate and may vary considerably depending on what your AC is though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was about half way through 67 so had all of my skillups defensively, also had both levels of avoid and mitigation from aa.  Im not sure what level the mob was, i didnt have a way to &quot;find out&quot; but he was pretty ass rape.  Hit for 1622 max with shielding 16, died before i could even equip my shield.  He was a huge ass fat flying drake looking thing with 2 aes.  Tried him with 2 groups and got him to 97 before i died then all hell broke lose.  The aes were a spell slow and 1k dd + 100 a tic drain of everything.  He also ramapged like every round, although it wasnt ae and i was on rampage + tanking so possibly was flurrpage like half of the tier 1 time bosses.<br />
<br />
Also the rest of the mobs in the zone including named dont hit me for anything, clerics can just chain comp heal with no disc up without getting close to death so the attack on the mobs is pathetically low.  Of course they are all immune to bliss since 99% are 69+.  The mobs also missed me a ton and hit for min virtually every hit, but the boss hardly missed me at all and had a fairly attack rating.  My ac at the time was 2700 wo shield buffed no bard but i had wood on since i died fast as hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I'm inclined to believe it's even lower. I was seeing an (not parsed) improvement in mitigation from CS at 1100 AC or so, and given that you can buy them at even lower levels, the &quot;cap&quot; is probably staggeringly low.<br />
<br />
That being said, Haass you're right in that theres some confusion on soft caps. One the one hand you have the point of diminishing returns when you compare your mitigation vs. a mobs atk. <br />
<br />
The other &quot;softcap&quot; is the one that is supposedly modified by shields and mitigation aa that we're talking about here. I don't know how to resolve the confusion other than to say that the &quot;coded in&quot; softcap seems a more appropriate use of the word.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, see, for this to be true, people like me would see little to no benefit from CS/CA, and that's clearly not the case.<br />
<br />
I'm at like 1338 or so AC right now, and that's the highest I've ever been at, thru the HP &gt; all years, and there is still a very discernable difference between how I was tanking pre AA and how I tank now.  If the soft cap truly exists right around my AC level, then how would changing that soft cap improve my tanking ability?  Moving it up to 1500-1600 wouldn't change the fact that my AC hasn't started to reach diminishing returns yet, and yet I still can't deny the fact that I tank better.<br />
<br />
The only way this could be true, is if we had like a really low ac tank somewhere, who after CA/CS, tanked exactly the same before and after, and I just don't see that happening.  You would also need to prove that he's below the soft cap by comparing him to a 1400 ac warrior who doesn't take much less damage than him.  Dev supported information or not, it just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

So maybe it's 1000.  The numbers in my post were just a wild guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I know that, I'm not stating that the your numbers for the softcap are accurate, I'm just saying that it can't possibly be 1000..because we know that going from 1000-1400 will increase your tanking ability linearly, and not start diminishing in that time period.<br />
<br />
You would need to prove that between X and X + 200 or 400 or whatever is indeed where the softcap is at, because you tank virtually identical at both numbers, and then prove that CS and CA have no effect below X</div></div><hr />

Cily<br />
<br />
Well, that's what I'm trying to explain.<br />
<br />
See, our current definition of &quot;Soft cap&quot; Is somewhere that we don't see linear improvement...as Brutul put it &quot;A knee in the curve.&quot;<br />
<br />
In order for us, and the Dev who stated the softcap remarks about tanking AA&quot;s, to be talking about the same thing, we have to change our definition to whatever his defintion of &quot;Soft Cap&quot; is, because it's clearly not what we think it is.<br />
<br />
If it were, there would be an AC level, below somewhere around 1250, where you get absolutely zero return at all on mitigation AA's, and that doesn't seem logical at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda assumed the &quot;soft cap&quot; worked like other soft caps in EQ. Like mana gain from stats, or HP gain from stats. Diminishing returns after X, but still linear (from that point, so its still a knee in the curve I guess, heh).<br />
<br />
This also fairly well meshes with what I have seen.<br />
<br />
Wether or not the mitigation AA give any benefit below a set amount is logical or not is irrelevant, but I could see it implemented that way if this unknown soft cap is pretty low anyhow. This would be the same as adding an AA that raised the &quot;soft cap&quot; on stamina, and if they did, we would buy it, and prolly would not call it illogical really.<br />
<br />
This method also allows the developers to put noticeable gains on AC for new items without throwing balance too out of whack. They trick us into being excited when we get a new BP with 22 more AC, cause that is a bigger number than the 5 AC it is actually adding =p<br />

<br />
It's not really linear.  It's a curve and it's going to be relative to the ATK of the mob.  Higher ATK means more room for improvement in your AC, so more significant boosts from adding AC at a higher value.  There also may be a couple bumps in the curve as the dev talked about with the softcap that mitigation AA are said to effect.  So you're moving the bump in the curve.  None of it is linear though.<br />
<br />
Also I'm not sure the +22% total avoidance from all the AA really means that if a mob hit you 60% of the time with no AA, it will now hit you only 38% of the time.  That's great if that's the case, but I'd need to see some parses.  My hunch is it's not quite that big of a difference.  Do we have parses through GoD AAs showing the 17% improvement?  e.g. 50% hits  becomes 33%?</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you know this?  Have you plotted average hit over a wide range of ACs on a single mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be that the damage taken is a result of cumulative modifiers and has a small effect on changing parameters which for a small data set could be assumed to be linear.  Many mathematical packages can &quot;force&quot; slight curves into linear equations quite easily with few data points.<br />
<br />
If Damage taken is something like the following:<br />
<br />
Damagemax *[1 - (RNG)(modifierforDI/DB?) * (RNG)(ACmod) * (RNG)(AAmod)]<br />
<br />
As far as I know mobs have min and max hits and all that the AA's do is skew the results of the mobs damage to average lower, it is not a straight shift of the damage.  Having modifiers multiplied by a random number generator should still allow min and max hits, but could skew the data to one side.<br />
<br />
I am fairly confident max hits of mobs do not change based on AA's but has anyone confirmed that the min hits do not?  If they do not, the mobs modified damage would have to be checked against the min damage of the mob and then set to the min if it were below.  This could account for the apparent increase in min damage taken based on high AC levels and AA's.<br />
<br />
It is a rather crude theory and model and much detail would have to be worked out.  For example I am guessing the ACmod would be a function of mob ATK and the tank's current AC.<br />
<br />
Anyway, could be part of the explanation and the shield AC if you have one equiped might get a multiplier when comparing ATK vs AC.  The modifiers certainly could be a table lookup with non linear values based on the inputs.<br />
<br />
Oh well, bored at work.<br />

<br />
Remember, each expansion (potentially) has a DIFFERENT &quot;soft cap&quot; (definition: knee in the dps vs. ac curve, or alternately AC range when mode dmg/hit starts to approach min dmg/hit).  For the original EQ, it was in the 950-1k range; that went up slightly w/ kunark, was in the 1250ish range for velious, etc.  Remf's up to 2.5-2.6k (depending on buffs/bards/trib), and seems to have gone over the &quot;hump&quot; for PoP mobs, and at least some of the GoD ones.  Jury still out for OoW, spent some time in proving grounds last night but not enough to get a good feel for it (or sufficient logs).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this post is WAAAAAY longer than I expected it to be, so in summary:  I think what Haass is saying is logical, to find out why, read on.  If you do not wish to read the whole thing, then at least read everything before and after the dotted lines.<br />
<br />
Seems like people are talking about 2 different things.  One is a programmed soft-cap, the other is the soft-cap created by the fact that once your AC outclasses your opponents attack sufficiently enough you get little return for your $$.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
My question is:<br />
<br />
Is there a programmed soft-cap or was the developer speaking about the soft-cap that exists when you compare a mobs attack to a players AC?<br />
<br />
If there is a programmed soft-cap, it would have to be the same regardless of content.  I can't believe they would have it setup so that if you go to lower guk your AC does mean anything above 1000, but if you go to ToV your AC is effective up to 1200 or whatever.  <br />
<br />
In this case Haass is right, it doesn't make sense that CS would raise this soft-cap.  Because I know for a damn fact that 1000 AC vs 1300 AC is a huge difference in PoP and LDoN.  And because this is a programmed soft-cap the difference would be the same no matter where you are.  <br />
<br />
Basically, there is no soft-cap because there is a huge difference between 1000 AC and 1300 AC, so how could CS effect it.  And if nearly all level 65 Warriors are at the soft-cap, and we all know 65 warriors with less than 1300 AC (I had 1240 when I dinged 65), then either the Dev was incorrect when he said nearly all 65 warriors are at or above the soft cap, or there is no soft-cap.<br />
<br />
In this case you would have to do exactly as Haass said.  First, find the programmed soft-cap by comparing parses from warriors with AC's ranging from probably 900-1400 to see where the diminishing returns are.  Then you would have to compare a parse from someone who is under that soft-cap and has 0 AA to someone that is under that soft-cap and has some mitigation AA's.<br />
<br />
The second half of this post is completely irrelevant if there is a programmed soft-cap because clearly that is what the AA would effect. <br />
<br />
If there is no programmed soft-cap and the soft-cap only exists because of comparing a mobs attack to a players AC (or mitigation rating to be more inclusive), then it still doesn't make sense.  How can the mitigation AA's on my toon effect the comparison of the attack or DI of the mob I am tanking beyond that point where the soft-cap exists.  It exists because mathematically it is VERY difficult to get increased returns.  The AA would essentially have to change how the equation is written.<br />
<br />
It seems also that after a certain point there will be a hard cap.  No one sees random_mob_001 hits you for 0!  And everyone knows mitigation doesn't eliminate units on the DI scale of a mob.  So eventually, once you are at the bottom of it's DI scale, you CAN'T mitigate any more from that particular mob.<br />
<br />
In this case, you would have to get a 2600 AC tank with mitigation AA's up against maybe a Velious or Kunark target.  Then you'd have to get a  2600 AC tank with 0 mitigation AA's in the same situation.  The 2600 AC itself should be enough to nullify the attack or DI from one of these targets, and then we'd see if somehow CS can change the way the DB/DI equation works.  I don't think we're going to find many 2600 AC tanks with 0 AA's.<br />

The second half of this post is completely irrelevant if there is a programmed soft-cap because clearly that is what the AA would effect.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe this is all completely innane babbling by myself and I'm completely missing something in this post or in the knowledge we have about AC.<br />
<br />
All I know is that I saw large returns from between 1000 and 1300 AC and I also saw large returns from 0 AA to having CS3 and PE.  These were done in seperately (because I focused on levels first, gear second and AA's last), so the arguement that maybe I was raising my soft-cap as I was raising my AC is irrelevant.  <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, between 1300 AC and where I am now is where all my defensive AA's have come in.  Therefore, it is possible that the returns I have been feeling have been from the AC I have gained between 1300 abd 1450 and not from the AA's I have gained in the same time period.  If that is the case, then a.) the difference between 1300 AC and 1450 AC is way more than the difference between maybe 1150 and 1300 AC (I say this because I have noticed a huge difference in my tanking ability in this time period) and b.) the programmed soft-cap is higher than almost all level 65 warriors have reached (I would say ~ 1350 AC).  If this is true then again, the Dev was incorrect in saying almost all 65 warriors have reached the soft-cap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To change the distribution of hits with CS/ID, NO CHANGE to the AC cap is needed. All that is required is a several hundred cell look up table, and a term that says, 'Oh, yeah, look 15 cells to the lower of whatever the randomizer tells you.' This has ZERO relation to your AC. This has the effect of an additional subtractive term in the mitigation equation, and is both the lazy and the 'sane' way to implement something like CS/ID. From dev comments and in game observation, there are TWO different, really poorly named onset points in the AC effectiveness curves. The existance of one does not, in any way, preclude the existance of the other.<br />
<br />
The first of these caps is reached at the early luclin level, by dev comments. Let's call it 1300 AC. Beyond 1300 AC, the value of AC vs atk changes. 1000 AC and 1000 attack are directly comparable. And here's the really important part: However, past 1300 AC, each AC point is worth a hard coded, linear fraction of what it was before 1300. Assuming that for the plate tanks, the conversion factor is 2, 2100 AC is only comparable to 1700 Atk, not 2100 atk! Every point of AC is still valuable, and is, in fact, more valuable, as you now need more of it to keep up with ever inflating mob attack values.<br />
<br />
The second cap is the edges of the mitigation tables: At some point, you will sufficiently exceed mob attack, and see little to no return from addition AC against that mob and lower attack mobs only. This is because no data beyond this point exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">about the &quot;AC softcap&quot; I said that (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=127275&amp;postcount=11) some month ago, so I agree with brutul.<br />
<br />
1. about the influence of AC on domage received, <br />
I think that since there is two type of AC hiden in one number, why would be only one &quot;AC softcap&quot;. this is an extract of Magelo AC calculation<br />
AC formula: <br />
 -------------- Agi -- T -- Items - Avoidance - Mitigation  - Total  - +AC <br />
 Base --------- 82 -- 42 --- 0 ------- 490 ------- 84 ------ 677 --- 677 <br />
 Base + mod1 - 82 -- 42 -- 475 ------ 490 ------ 717 ----- 1425 --- 748 <br />
 Base + mod2 - 179 - 58 --- 0 ------- 506 ------- 84 ------- 696 --- 19 <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Total AC from formula: -------------------------------------------- 1444 <br />
so even if we have only one number showed in our stat, I think that the game may use more of them in the calcul of combat system.<br />
<br />
2. on the link between AC and ATK, <br />
there is a very old post of extensive test done on it. the drawback is that it has been made in PvP to be able to get the exact ATK and AC of the two fighters. but the results was surprising since the average domage (dps) recieved was ploted and showed a formula like D = ATK + 1/AC<br />
I mean, at fixed ATK the domage received was converging to a non zero value with a curve alike 1/x ; while increasing the ATK wasn't changing the curve nor the position on it, but was just translating the whole thing up lineary (at least with the three ATK value used).<br />
so yes PvP and PvE mechanics are totally different in EQ, but still it's quite surprising to see such formulas.<br />
PvE parses show unsurprising thing : the more AC you have the more frequent you get hit for min, without changing hit distribution type (same curve, just streech a bit by the AC), but I've never seen plots of the dps function of AC to compare with the PvP results.<br />
<br />
3. on def AA,<br />
we know that they don't influence the AC number showed in the stat. we know they don't influence the max nor the min domage (there aren't DB or DI mod). we know that there are usefull to receive less domage. a dev said that CS improves the AC breakpoint.<br />
so, because I think there is actually two AC values with they own AC breackpoints, I suppose that CA improves the second AC breakpoint. and I globally see the domage generated by a mob as :<br />
 * random to check miss / hit -&gt; use of the first kind of AC, lvl difference and other things like ATK and direct mod and position (front, back, ...).<br />
 * random to calculate n for the D = DB + n*DI formula -&gt; use of the second kind of AC, skills diference and other things like ATK and direct mod.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so all in all we don't really know where and how the def AA are counted but they both are usefull and should be maxed because they always showed benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if nearly all level 65 Warriors are at the soft-cap, and we all know 65 warriors with less than 1300 AC<br />
<br />
Just a nitpick but he didn't say &quot;nearly all&quot; level 65 warriors are at the soft cap, he said the &quot;median&quot; 65 warrior is at the soft cap.  Which means there is a very significant number of them that are below it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some thoughts, and a bit of clarification of what I was saying earlier-<br />
<br />
For each expansion, there is a mob (or possibly mobs) with the maximum level + attack combination in that expansion's zones.  Assuming no hardcoded exceptions due to special buffs/etc., that mob defines where the maximum &quot;knee&quot; in the mode hit vs. AC curve is for that expansion.  It also seems logical, and agrees with casual observation, that &quot;typical&quot; atk values for the highest level &quot;regular&quot;, pure-melee mobs in an expansion has a set value.  This combination of level + atk sets the average/typical &quot;knee&quot; in AC vs. mode hit- for *that* expansion.<br />
<br />
Note that this is a background phenomena, purely a result of game mechanics (max/typical atk) + designer decisions (max/average mob level).  On top of this baseline, you can add non-linear AC vs. ATK, various mitigation implementations, etc.  And there is nothing to say that several expansions couldn't share the same max/typical mob level/atk values either...<br />
