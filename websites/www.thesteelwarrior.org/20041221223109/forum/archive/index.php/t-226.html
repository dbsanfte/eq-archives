<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm no newbie to the warrior community, but it has occurred to me that there are a lot of different grades of warriors reading the board.<br />
I know I've been playing EQ for almost all of its existence, consistently, but I've only been perusing these forums for the past 6 months or so. As such, some of the terminology has me at a loss.<br />
<br />
I'm constantly seeing abbreviations for weapons/items. However, rarely does someone take the time to actually spell them out (I know I try to, whenever possible, since the written word doesn't require a time trial, when you're not playing).<br />
<br />
Soooooo...<br />
someone care to spew forth their resevoir of full item names (why not discs, AA, and other abbreviations that are taken for granted) for the new people to the forum? That may help them acclimate and participate that much quicker...<br />
<br />
I mean, not everyone was around when it was &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;in&quot; to call out you were proccing your PGT in LG-D on the Ass/Sup, in hopes of getting your TBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With so much drama in the LGD it's kind of hard proccing your PGT, nah mean yo? NAH MEAN?<br />
<br />
Uh, anyways ...<br />
<br />
BCA = Barnacle Covered Axe, a new drop from Legacy of Ykesha Zones, with a proc called Pique that adds 100 points of hate. A hot topic of late is how useful it really is, and how it stacks up to other weapons of its level and power ...<br />
<br />
Praetor's Blade of Debility which has a shammy debuff spell proc.<br />
<br />
Black Blade of Tormenting, which has a fast acting Damage over Time spell proc, Torment.<br />
<br />
Frostbringer, which has Frostbite, a 60 point DD spell and AC debuff proc.<br />
<br />
Any of the Ykeshas, which proc Ykesha.<br />
<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
What other Acronyms you need? BoC? Blade of Carnage. Thurg = Thurgadin. SS = Skyshrine. Kael = Kael Drakkel. Usually in reference to the quest armors specific to that zone. Or just Champ's, Myrmidon's and Warlord's.<br />
<br />
AA acronyms that are commonplace here are ND for Natural Durability. Run 3 for Increased Natural Run Speed, Level 3. Regen 3 for increased natural regeneration, level 3. AE Taunt for Area Taunt. CF 3 = Combat Fury 3. CA and CS are Combat Agility and Combat Stability. LR and ID are Lightning Reflexes and Innate Defense. TM is Tactical Mastery. Flurry and Rampage usually get spelled out. PE is Physical Enhancement, not the 1990s rap group. PD is Planar Durability, not a police department.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of for now.</div></div><hr />

It's a case of laziness, and that's not gonna be replaced any time soon.  It's the reason things like PST and plz and thx are so common....because some people are far too busy to be spelling out entire words.<br />
<br />
Just ignore em, they go away.</div></div><hr />

A list like Abbreviation = Name would be the right thing.<br />
<br />
This is just some of the abbreviations I have encountered on the forum and when possible also the names associated with them. :)<br />

<br />
Irony at it's finest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's really funny is the irony of you missing the humor in the title.<br />
<br />
Thanks - I had no idea what a TSBS was, though my guild had acquired a few &quot;Twisted Steels&quot; over the past few months.<br />
<br />
Also worth noting is how abbreviations, much like camp names, vary from server to server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ToD = Truncheon of Doom</div></div><hr />

Race: ALL<br />
<br />
The Effect &quot;Attack of the Gods&quot; is a 3.6k hp lifetap that only works on Gnomes and Halflings. Reason to believe that it only works on these retarded races is because the Gods are punishing them for making too many wizards and druids. But /shrug ... thats only what I read out of &quot;The REAL Plague of Norrath: Halflings and Gnomes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its the same in EQ, some references are made so often people<br />
do not want to type the name anymore :)<br />
<br />
Anyway if you ever have a question, just ask it.<br />
Many of us will be glad to help you</div></div><hr />
