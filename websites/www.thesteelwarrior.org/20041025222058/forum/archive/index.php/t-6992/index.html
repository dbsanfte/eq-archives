<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Imagine that...no second part to melee upgrade...but they found time to make pets more badass.    FUSOE :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who cares? we dont need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they can do whatever the fuck they wanna do to any other class out there, if it doesn't affect me, i don't really care. wanna buff pets to all bloody hell, go right ahead, but don't you dare give them children defensive or nerf me, then i'll start by bitch generator</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's far deeper problems that need to be fixed then a melee part 2 &quot;balancing&quot; in this game. I just hope they realize that instead of making more inane decisions like improved sitting regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/laugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh those poor pets cant compete in todays world!<br />
<br />
:eyeroll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">we got lied too, Huge melee upgrades coming.. make warriors better in groups, better taunt, make the game less mind numbing.<br />
<br />
I tested openings on test.. it was a good idea that needed some tweaking.. but instead of tweaking they remove it and we get disc's on 4 timers, a heal that does nothing, and a ranged hate thats on a timer that barly helps.<br />
<br />
leaving us with knights still being the tank for 99% of the content and us doing dps. <br />
<br />
After BL got an upgrade I realized that they were done with us. Got into the Wow beta, sold all my alts gear and quit 3 accounts. <br />
<br />
Maybe ill be back if they fix this game. <br />
<br />
Oh and my rl BL friends suggestion to fix warriors? roll up a pally and PL him to 65.<br />
<br />
yes I am bitter.. 3 years of playing a warrior to watch them get weaker and weaker with each expansion as hybreds got sronger and stronger.</div></div><hr />
