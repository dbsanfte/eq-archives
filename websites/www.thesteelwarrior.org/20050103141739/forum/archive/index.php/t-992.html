Man so far its been hard to figure out wtf is happening in those log files :)<br />
<br />
I keep hearing warriors with offensive AAs and BoW parse ~180dps. I just would like to clarify is that including dmg shields kick and whatever else  non weapon dmg? Can someone give me a rough idea how their weapons prefor lets say in Vex Thal or PoTactics. Those 2 zones are good since I got logs from them. I am looking for a juice 2h weapon only dmg to help me figure out my logs. Just trying to see how my Seru sword perfoms. I a parsing something like 70 dps in VT with it and 100 including ds and whatever. I just dont see how geting a boW would triple my dps with only slight ratio difference and AAs. Insight plz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with buffed up atk i get around ~140 dps in poearth from the front... attacking from the front as opposed to from behind makes a huge difference in dps especially with 2handers...<br />
<br />
AA's also make a big difference in 2hs dps as well as agro...<br />

PB3<br />
Ferocity 3<br />
CF3<br />
FotA3<br />
TM3<br />
Flurry3<br />

will increase ur dps significantly...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorek</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, getting all the appropriate Offensive AA's helps a ton ie. All of them ;p. And generally, anyone with a BoW/SEWS, in an Elemental Guild, probably has a good amount of attack (1600+ at least) when buffed etc.  This will allow you to hit for max more often. It's also good to pick mobs with well rounded AC to parce on. Parcing in VT is no good, all that shit has jacked AC. I alway parce on trash ele mobs. <br />
<br />
 I just would like to clarify is that including dmg shields,  kick and whatever else non weapon dmg?<br />
<br />
Kicks yes, DS's perhaps - a small one, self only maybe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had flurry since jan 2002 (first class skill I bought) and I've parsed every log since - never since a single flurry get riposted.<br />
<br />
As for DPS - I've maxxed offensive aas and with BoW in elemental planes tanking with max haste I generally see between 140-180 DPS on stuff - with peaks as high as 240ish and as low as 80 ish depending on situation (i.e. other attack buffs etc...) Tanking Fennin last run I averaged 120 DPS to him from melee and thats with me using evasive for first 3 minutes of a 7 minute fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clearing up to Avatar of Mist last night I got a lucky streak.  On one of the Phoenixes flurry procced twice, and I didn't miss a single hit the entire fight, 283 DPS w/BoW. I wasn't tanking so no DS damage and likewise all hits were from behind so no NPC avoidance skills.  No bard overhaste, no nothing, just standard raid buffs.  It was nice and made my gf (highest atk rogue on server) jealous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">k your advice is to parse more pop mobs then. k<br />
I am trying to compare average not some one time only DPS.<br />
Also would be nice to know dps in xp group situation ei not max buffed since thats what I am going to be parsing in pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Short parses really don't tell you much.  I've gotten 240 DPS with BoC/Blackout over a period of about 90 seconds before but I average less than half of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I said it before I said I say it again I want average performance of my weapon :) I know how to parse mine just the results are a bit off from what I expected. So looking for input on what AVERAGE not neceseraly max buffed DPS people do with their weapons as long as they got chanter haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in my experiance, when people give you &quot;money shot&quot; numbers like 180 dps, they are talking about max dps with all types of damage included.<br />
<br />
im not at that level yet.  my max dps is about 110.  my average is 76.  big difference, and it pisses me off no end when people quote max dps.  max dps is useless.<br />
<br />
I lied - my max dps is actually 245.  in a fight where I hit only once, for 245 points of damage.  thus, 245 dps :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vengeance 50<br />
Blade of War (or Sews)<br />
Full AA<br />
Behind the mob<br />
Full buffs (normal buffs no damage shield)<br />
<br />
180dps + is a very realistic number VS PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
I parsed 110-130 on a regular basis in HoH/Fire tanking.<br />
And i didnt even have half the offensive AA. <br />
Now i'd say 130-150 tanking. 180+ in the back.<br />
<br />
Cant do parses anymore. (Thx French server)<br />
But i'm willing to bet i do 200ish in melee VS Fenin Ro Tanking.<br />
Veng41 + BoW + Full AA + CoP + Vallon + Fero + Feral Avatar + Bard<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps: When you hear us saying 150-180 dps we are in almost all<br />
cases refering to PoP mobs, that have zero ac/mitigation.<br />
VT (and all of SoL) is a melee nightmare.<br />
<br />
When you slash AoW for 100avg, and Fenin Ro for 230 avg.<br />
You really see what mitigation means.</div></div><hr />

Parsed 3 days in a row, fighting same mobs.<br />
<br />
Pb3, TM3, Fer3 <br />
<br />
Avatar, but no other attack buffs.... /w SoV and ranjer lovin' add about 10-20DPS. 100% haste.<br />

Edit: Oh and max DPS would be 32000+ when I score a FB on one of those evil rabbits in EW :D</div></div><hr />
