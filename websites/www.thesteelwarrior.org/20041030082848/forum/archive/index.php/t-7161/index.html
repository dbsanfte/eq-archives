I wore a couple of pieces into my late 40s. Also, check out the Library section of these boards and this thread<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well not sure if any in your guild are in their 50's or not. If they are there is a pretty nice helmet that drops in Velks on the bottom floor of the named on the back wall. Like 20 AC plus some small stats. If not you can probably hang around the helmet drops farely often and is Lore/no drop so people will ooc that it is rotting. <br />
<br />
I also remember that some plate armor drops in the Warrens off the king. Not sure on stats though.</div></div><hr />

Don't know what you are wearing there, but do search in bazaar by slot/ac/war/your race + religion and you might be surprised to find that rings/earrings are the cheapest hp boost you can get.<br />
LDoN points build up pretty slowly at your level, but in some slots LDoN merchant stuff is goign to be the easiest &quot;earned&quot; armor you can get (depends on your guild, too, but that's a general rule).</div></div><hr />
