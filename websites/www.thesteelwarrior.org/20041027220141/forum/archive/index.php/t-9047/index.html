<br />
  I am getting annoyed especially on the Sony boards with lazy ass bastards whining that the elemental planes should be opened up either by level or some easy single group quest.  What the hell? So all the people in guilds who spent months upon months to get there can watch lazy ass 01  waltz right in.  Hell no. I see plently of casuals willing to work for progress and I respect them and understand that other priorities or their dislike of raiding keeps them from being harder core. But what the hell is with the lazy shits who think they are entitled to everything without working for it. Where the hell does this welfare mindset come from.  I am sick and tired of the UBER LEET RAIDERS ARE OPPRESSIN me bullshit.  I can't remeber a single time myself or my guild Oppressed anyone. Where the hell do they get the Idea I'm a casual I'm more noble than the raiders.  Frankly it makes me want to strangle people.<br />
<br />
  You want elemental access I am sure there are ways to get there without hard core raiding if you are willing to pull your thumb out your ass and work for it.  Pickup Raids are on a lot of servers, guild alliances etc.  You want Fire like exp get your lazy ass out of BoT and go check out omens of war.  In Ruined City of Dranik I found 2 camps where unlike fire 3 mob to a % it was 2 even at level 67 and 68. The mobs there are easier and actually drop some decent loot.  MPG has some good xp and drops to.  Stop acting like bleeding gashes and go out and work for something. I was in a family guild until I decided I wanted to see more of the the game and joined a raiding guild. I doubt I would be termed casual as I averaged 4-6 hours a night. I amassed 20k LDON points to equip myself. When I joined my guild I had over 200 aas and was a completely single group equipped tank with 9400 hp and 1650 ac buffed.  So don't tell me it aint possible to progress without the elemental planes. Been there done it already. It requires a lot of work and a lot of tedium but it is nowhere near impossible. <br />
<br />
  Now we have Omens of War with good xp, elemental quality loots and level 70. Meaning that for Joe Casual and his family guild they will be able to get to the elemental planes and even time with far less people and efforth than before. The power level is going up and with the new zones and Discord you can even skip a lot of content like Vex Thal and Veeshans peak. It requires nutting up and working for it though. Those who want to say raiders have it on a silver platter can get on their knees and blow me and make sure to swallow.  I mean the super leet xp at 1% per 2 hours is fat. The losing xp as you learn a new event, the wipes that come with learning how to beat mobs. Its part of the expierence that they just want to skip by. But in keeping with the thought I have found the new rallying cry in EQ<br />
<br />
1) The Uber Leets have elemental access...Its not fair GIMMIE<br />
2) People worked hard to get their gear ...Its not Fair GIMMIE<br />
3) I'm being oppresed<br />
4) EXP is too hard...GIMMIE DING<br />
5) People get more xp than me...GIMMIE<br />
6) My class is more useless than that class...ITS NOT FAIR GIMMIE<br />
7) My calss can't solo....GIMMIE<br />
8) Gimmie GIMMIE GIMMIE GIMMIE<br />
9) Im a casual Im better than those mean raiders....REWARD ME<br />
10) I'm a casual Im a noble oppresed player .......Set my people free<br />
11) MY PUSSY HURTS........<br />
12) I pay the same as the raiders do ....Gimmie what they have...<br />
13) OMG Origin ports me back to my home city which is x# of zones away from pok book...OMG OMG UNFAIR YOU SUXXORZ WOOD ELVES.<br />
14) LDON is too tedious and the price to high...GIMMIE POINTS<br />
15) MY PUSSY STILL HURTS...<br />
<br />
   Ya know its sad. There are a lot of good casuals out there who bust there ass to get what they have and this rant is not directed at them. It is directed at those whining and bitching for elemental zones being opened up, those who whine that BoT is suck ass xp and are unwilling to try to find better xp, those who somehow think they are holier than thou becuase they CHOOSE not to raid and then whine because they can't get the best stuff.<br />

<br />
It started strong, with a clever and snide subject line, but on average, his flame felt old hat and lackluster.  I give it one out of five stars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lazy ass wannabe ubers who are still worried about the EP's when they should be knee-deep in Gates of Discord or the new expansion are also a problem. I mean come on Drathos, if you were really uber, why would you care what happened to the elemental planes? You'd be well beyond them.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soulrazer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Drathos if not his tone and presentation. I worked hard to get to a lvl and ability to beat the executioners trial. Right as im ready to earn my way in they open it up to everyone and ruin it. Im not ready to be given anything else. I want to work my way into the EP. BoT is now the equivelent of Karnors just a few levels higher. Thats what happens when you give away things for nothing. If you acctually have to earn the right to step in a zone it helps promote skilled playing and team work.<br />
<br />
<br />
FYI Im not in a raiding guild. I have under 5k unbuffed hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think we have really covered the exicutioner--or even 1 group keying. Getting one group together for flogging is a much different proposition than needing to find 71 people for an extended serise of raids for access. <br />
<br />
Once more of the non-raider population is 70th we will see what the god keying process is like for non-raiders. I have a sneaking suspition that it will work fairly well. But again--that is finding one group and not 71.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a non raider, not even guilded, but not casual.  I play near every day for extended periods, have gotten all the way to Ikkinz2 with the same group that I started PoP with.<br />
<br />
Now I could care less about the PoP zones being locked up, if I was suddenly able to access every single PoP zone except Time, I probably wouldnt even bother zoning in.  As long as they dont put epic 1.5 stuff in those zones where I was denied access, I'll never care about  them.<br />
<br />
With that said, I do think it was a huge concept mistake to lock up zone after zone in PoP and GoD.  What they should have done is to not lock any of the zones themselves, but lock the raid encounters (like OOW).  The whole point of all those PoP flags is to get to candyland Time.  They just went overboard and locked zones instead of encounters.<br />
<br />
Whatever.  Isnt it a moot point?  I think Sony learned their lesson about locking up content as is evident with OOW, and Xp can be gotten by the truckloads in a ton of other places besides PoF or wherever.  <br />
<br />
Dont lock up zones, lock up encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yawn.<br />
<br />
GoD really pissed a lot of people off.  OoW looks to be a lot better, but people are still ticked about the situation GoD created plus the massive disparity in loot  between raid guild players and everyone else that really got out of hand with PoP.  Of course the high end raid loot should be better, but it's so far apart now as to be absurd.  <br />
<br />
Also some have this funny idea that they should be able to enjoy a significant portion of expansions without joining a particular style of guild and/or playing 30+ hrs a week.<br />
<br />
I don't know why I'm using even this small amount of logic though.  It's clear from your ranting that you're not going to listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">bouh !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whether you are a casual or a raider, why in the world would you let the quality and/or ease of acquisiton of somebody else's gear affect your enjoyment of the game? <br />
<br />
Okay, so the path that you followed to get your gear was a more difficult one than somebody else followed LATER. You got that gear EARLIER and have been enjoying its benefits when it was the highest quality available. Now you should be using that gear to move into the highest end areas of the NEW EXPANSIONS. The people following behind aren't competing with you, are they? Have they joined your guild and displaced you from your spot in the tanking order? Why in the world would you care about them?<br />
<br />
Good lord. Go outside every once in a while and meet some people of the opposite sex. They're much more interesting to pursue than a magelo.</div></div><hr />

I disagree.  After 28 years of marriage, I can say without hesitation that the pursuit of a magelo is, indeed, more interesting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drathos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I could care less if its easier for people to get there. My rant is about people wanting to get everything with no effort. I don't claim to be uber. Im just a middle of the road warrior. 8400 hp and 1933 ac unbuffed is afr from uber. I'm just sick of all the people whining about how everything isn't wide open for them SOE HAS DEINED NOONE ANY ZONES. You CHOOSE not to pursue some zones.  As for chasing a Magelo I could care less. Hell I haven't update mine in a month or more. My progression that I do check Is by what mobs I can tank today that I couldn't tank yesterday.  <br />
<br />
  I love the comments go out and meet a woman or get a life. Becuase I Raid I have no life..Yall are too damned funny.  Personally EQ will never take over my bar or going out time.  But it has replaced my TV watching time.  So all those people with the argument that all hard core raiders are 16 year old geeks glued to their computer with no lives can STFU or give head to a shotgun for all I really care.  It just annoys the hell out of me that when these self proclaimed Little noble guys have some problem or can't progress any further without work they start off and say SOE AND THE UBERS CAN GO F THEMSELVES and the like.   People seem to fail to realize that the vast majority of content in the game is not locked.  And partially because as happened last night when a group of fucktard pop the rings in Earth and chaos ensues. Nothing like seeing the Triumvirate of Soil trained to zone in. Or being in Fire when some moron  trains the birds to c2... Not that I XP in either one too much. I spend most of my xp time in Kod Taz, Ikkinz or A couple of the new OOW zones. But on raids it sucks hardcore when group of tards 01 comes and screws shit up..<br />
<br />
   My only real point is that the people whining they are somehow oppressed becuase they aren't willing to work towards anything. They seem to think that because they pay 12.95 a month they should just be able to loot any and everything they want. Thats my problem.  They just annoy the shit out of me.</div></div><hr />

Roll up a twink.  Instead of playing at US primetime (5-10pm), you play between 5 and 10 AM like some of us have to.<br />

that pisses me off. i've prob seen more of the game than these asshats have tenfold and unless i break 'x' AC or HP's i'm just a newb.<br />

<br />
Really though, for some people the time you have to put into eq has gotten better lately. Having instanced raids which you can plan for a specific time helps with schedules, and most raids are 4hrs or under anymore. The sad part is that to get to some of those raids you need to have gone through the more time-intensive stuff in the progression before it.</div></div><hr />

There should however, be a way into the elemental planes that do not involve 72 people.<br />
<br />
Make it tough, make it require skill, but make it doable by a small force. Of course, we may not have to worry about this if OoW has armor that can match Raex's.<br />
<br />
Still be fun to open up the planes just to see the look on Drathos's face though!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say about half the players in raid guilds log on for the 3-4 hours of a raid and then log off.  Maybe it's different on other servers, but generally speaking the folks who have been in on the raiding game for many years are pretty much tired out of &quot;playing&quot; the game: they just &quot;raid&quot; the game and call it a day.  Right now is an exception as everyone wants to get 70 and AA's complete.</div></div><hr />

I have a little warrior with about 100 aas and about 8.5k hps as buffed as the poor guy can get, and I enjoy the game.  It's exciting to have those places that I may reach some day, and grinding out for little gear increases knowing some day I may make it there.  My problem is that I work and have a family, and although I play most days, I never get a chance to be on for more than 2-3 hours at a time, and that just doesn't go well with raiding.  I mean what point would there be for the people that play 8+ hours a day to continue to play if I can play 2 hours a day and be in the same places they are.  And yes, everyone in EQ whines too much, especially the rangers, but that's a different topic.</div></div><hr />

When you can't type the two extra characters to spell &quot;you&quot; instead of using &quot;u&quot; in place of it, or can't be bothered to type out &quot;because&quot; rather than using &quot;cuz&quot;, people just assume what you have to say isn't all that relevant.

<br />
So many raiders get all hung up on this &quot;only those who work harder get more&quot; idea.  But it patently isn't true.  Some raiders obviously work very hard for what they get, perhaps you're one of them.  Some raiders obviously don't work all that hard for what they get, because many of us have seen them in action and if they're that clueless in guild chat or in a group, they sure aren't capable of &quot;working&quot; that much more effectively in a raid.<br />
<br />
What is certainly true is that with EQ the more time and effort you put into the game, the more rewards you should be receiving.  And if that time and effort is spent doing things that are in some ways more challenging than other things, and an additional reward is associated with that, well and good.  No beef with the concept.<br />
<br />
But where it begins to break down is when the reward for doing things that are anywhere from just a little more challenging to a lot more challenging becomes so overblown that they start considering that the norm and designing expansions around a hyperinflated concept of what the run of the mill player is sporting in the way of gear.  Just like not every person working for a living, and some people who make very little in monetary return work very hard indeed, is Bill Gates, it is also true that not every person playing EQ is Joe Uber Player.  So when everything is priced as though Bill Gates were the anticipated purchaser and that leaves Joe Working Class out in the cold, so is Joe Casual Non-Raider left out in the cold when expansions are designed as though everyone was Joe Uber Player.<br />
<br />
Now, OoW seems to not be a problem.  There appears to be lots of opportunities for both Joe Casual Non-Raider and Joe Uber Player to find things that are within their &quot;scope&quot; of enjoyment.  And there seems to be gear dropping that is pretty appropriate, if not a little too good, where people can get ahold of it.  Which is exactly what the Casual Non-Raider players have been bitching for the last 3 or 4 expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No thats just not so, they are not paying you to play with gear. What you accomplish and get is what you should get. Effort put in to worthless endvors and silly atempts to progress should not reward you. I dont want a second job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Effort put into worthless endeavors (I assume you're talking about killing greens and other very trivial mobs) isn't really &quot;effort&quot;, now is it?<br />
<br />
I'm going to state right now that the term &quot;effort&quot; in this use means actual work involved fighting difficult mobs for the level of the character/area (named/events) and/or completing difficult tasks (quests), not just sitting around killing random low level mobs.<br />
<br />
Maybe a clarification on terms will make discussions easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Um, a better way to put it might be maximizing the return on the effort you are willing to make (playing smart). One doesn't have to be killing greens to be making relatively worthless effort.<br />
<br />
Playing smart means you discover how the game works, what you are willing to put into it, and play accordingly.<br />
<br />
An unscientific TSW poll shows that ~75% of all players raid. If most of the best drops or their equivent were available by soloing alone, then few would group/if grouping alone sufficed, then very few players would raid.<br />
<br />
While this might be just fine with you, it wouldn't be fine with others. Be satisfied that there is plenty for casual players to do and plenty of room for progress. A small minority of players may have exhausted single-group and pick-up raid content, but they are a very very small minority.<br />

Actually it's the stating the intuitively obvious in a superior tone as though other people weren't already aware of it that I find irritating.  You have a tendency to drop pearls of wisdom such as &quot;the sky is blue&quot; as if you're the first person to notice or be aware of the fact.  And you're obnoxious about it.  It really isn't necessary to tell anyone that EQ is not primarily a solo game.  But it should be equally obvious that it was not originally intended as a raid game either.  Yet you seem to feel that because it's become more raid centric, that makes raiding somehow more worthy or better than soloing.  And anyone who doesn't play the game the way you do is somehow less worthy of being rewarded for their play time.</div></div><hr />

I would take it a step farther. Lots of &quot;normal&quot; people surf for spoilers but far fewer bother to get involved in voicing their opinions. Many (I did this for years on all the class sites I have followed) just soak up the information, ask the occasional question, post the occasional insight, and move on.

Players post things like there is no progression path to GoD for casual players and no method to upgrade beyond LDoN armor and their 5500HP's. After posting such things that create the impression they are misinformed, it's a little silly to abandon those positions and cuss out those who informed you otherwise.<br />
<br />
There's no superiority involved in calling the Loyalist Shield to someone's attention or players listing drops sub 10K Warriors can get in GoD in a group. Wanting to complain 'It can't be done!!' and then cussing out those who point out specifically how it can be done is not a good argument.<br />
<br />
Play smarter means what I said. Killing greens is not the only waste of time in EQ. Sooooo many players post and complain they are stuck at 5500HP's unbuffed at level 65 solely because they don't raid - it's not true. Wallow if you want, but player after player is NOT stuck at 5500HP's unbuffed at level 65. Sayng it in a negative way - play dumb (I'm stuck at 5500HP's unbuffed at level 65) long enough and hard enough and eventually you'll convince people that you do lack a LOT of basic game info - but they'll still try to help.<br />
<br />
EQ is not solely a raid game, but certainly raiding was introduced early and is very popular. I believe Absor once pointed out that better loot rewards always have and always would be obtainable by raiding than grouping alone.<br />
<br />
Yet, it's possible to progress without raiding 24/7.<br />
<br />
Haas knows how to do it. He started to do it. He may continue with the effort. It can be done. OoW makes it easier, not harder.<br />

Maybe it's the pot telling the kettle to shine up - but my goodness, OoW is the answer to the hardcore non-raiders's prayers. Enjoy it!<br />

Main problem for casual warrior is simple, non-visible slots.... sony is good enough to make armor suits such as ornate but they always forget non-visibles or make the only choice tradeskilled items which is kind of stupid, seeing that the next best ring is 60k-90k (depending on how many are up) is kind of harsh since it takes me 6 hours to make 5k... in a week thats just under 45kish and all that time I could have been leveling or AAing is lost.<br />

And you are correct - there are a lot of No Drop items. In many cases &quot;uber&quot; guild groups will pick up a random player just to have a 6th person.

<br />
Franky BB, I find most everything you have to say as disingenuous these days.  Was there gear in GoD?  Certainly, if you could get to it.  If you could get a group together to attempt to take on the mobs that dropped it.  If that group wanted to use a non-raid geared tank in the attempt.  That's a lot of &quot;ifs&quot;.  Maybe for you it was a walk in the park.  For others not as dedicated to the raid game and therefore not already geared up far beyond normal aspirations, it wasn't quite so easy.<br />
<br />
LDoN, as is well known and commonly accepted, required far more of a time investment than the returns warranted.  Telling people that if they didn't spend the year or more of dedicated play time in LDoN, in the specific theme necessary for their gear type, they therefore have no room to bitch is pure unmitigated hogwash.  Did you spend a year doing nothing but LDoN gaining the upgrades available for Warriors?  If not, STFU about how anyone else ought to be doing something you yourself haven't been willing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Battleblade assumes that everyone can get a group that wants a 5500 hp warrior as a tank.

<br />
For a 5500hp warrior, the situation is FAR different.  Even if you do what he'll suggest next, which is &quot;Build your own group&quot; the majority of people aren't going to stick around and waste their time with a sub EP geared tank when they can just wait until all the ubers are done raiding and pick one of them up to PL the group for them.<br />

You need to stop buying gear.  Only buy what you absolutely have to and farm the rest.  Playing smart does apply here.  Wasting money on things that you could group for or have made for you isn't a productive use of your time.  Spent the plat on the earth rings that you CAN'T get to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I and others have observed that LDoN is a resource used even by better equipped players, but it is a trap. You most certainly do not want to get your entire armor set in LDoN. Personally, I'd just do the BP as far as armor goes, if I'd even do that.<br />

I was once a 5500 HP tank. I was not wanted in every group. My solution (as it has been for a long time) was to raid. I don't think I could not raid and still play - I think that's just the way I'm made. However, I have played a Druid and Paladin twink without relying at all on my quild to equip them. They aren't even level 60, haven't raided in years, nor are they equipped to the max - ya see, I play those characters as a casual player. They are equipped good enough to have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">Without raiding I would very soon quit EQ. No point to play otherwise for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">I'm certain that even if raiding wasn't such a huge leap ahead in gear than grouping, people would still raid.  There are plenty of people that just find more fun in raiding than grouping, and I have zero problem with that.  My only problems with raiding are (besides not wanting to depend on 30-50+ people to have fun waiting around to do something):<br />
<br />
1. Making the game where the only way you can actually experience the lore and immersion and storyline progression is by raiding. (i.e., making it where if you didn't raid, it might as well not be in Norrath because you're only just doing minor quests and killing random mobs hoping for drops.  You could be playing a game called &quot;Punkin Dunklin and the Twinkle Twins&quot; for all it mattered at that point.  The lore makes this game really come alive, restricting it to the raiders hurts everything)<br />
<br />
2. Locking away a multitude of &quot;bonuses&quot; because you're a raider doing multiple mob raid progression (such as high exp locked zones, tons of equipment dropping from raid-only zones), but not having a similar bonus of progression for those who go through multiple, tiered single-group events/trials.  Note: This is to be interpreted as &quot;You gave this, but conveniently forgot this&quot;.  The presence of bonuses doesn't bother, it's the lack of any bonuses for other means of playing.<br />
<br />
3. Because of #1 and #2, raiders having a cocky, I'm-better-than-you-because-I-raid attitude.  The superiority complex over those who don't raid that I've seen a good amount of raiders have makes me nauseous.<br />
<br />
Therefor, it's the results of supporting and amplifying the raiding game while letting the non-raiding game rot that causes problems.  It's not the fact that raiding exists, just that it's been pushed well over anything else.<br />
<br />
GoD and OoW have done a lot to turn around these problems.  GoD allowed about the first half of the expansion available to non-raiders (after the change), because it was all single-group trials.  OoW has only one locked zone that requires raiding (although I admit I don't know of the requirements for entry).  So it seems they're realizing this preferential treatment is causing problems.<br />
<br />
Here's my suggestion, coming from an ex-player.  Take the Deus Ex approach:<br />
<br />
Let the raiding progression be the &quot;brute force&quot; method, where you go in guns blazing.  Let the non-raiding progression be the &quot;stealth&quot; method, where you're not trying to cause a ton of commotion by having an army, but taking back ways and underground routes.  Where you might have to do 1-2 difficult raids to enter a zone, a single group would go through 3-4 3-hour difficult trials through tunnels or sewers or forests or something.<br />
<br />
I do think both raiding and non-raiding can coexist...they just have to do something different than what they've been doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't surprise me.  This is what happens when you make an expansion that makes all others obsolete, you filter all the cows into one pen and expect them to enjoy it.<br />
<br />
You may not be pissed off with it now, but you will be.  And you will be LONG before the next expansion comes out to spread out the people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Haass has that one right.  OoW is an awesome expansion, with one downside:  not enough zones for the shear number of people there.  While the instance zones help, it simply is not enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Problem isnt one expansion making another obselete. Its making 1 zone &gt; all others for the lesser geared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, not really.<br />
<br />
Expansions are made because the world needs to be bigger.  There are more people playing and crowding is becoming an issue, or there are not enough things for the majority of the player base to do to keep them playing the game. Expansions which raise the level cap make the world smaller.  If you leveled to 61 during PoP, well, kiss the old world goodbye, because you're never going back there and doing anything remotely productive.  They should have learned from that, but yet here we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">The problem is that this is a progression game and people &quot;get left behind&quot;. It's one thing to be level 50 with hundreds of other level 50's doing level 50 progression content. It's quite another to be level 65-70 with less than 6000HP's unbuffed and hearing about what the &quot;ubers&quot; are doing.<br />
<br />
I have a 53 Paladin and I'm about to strip his gear yet again. Not because he's not powerful for his level/progression, but because absolutely no one is doing the huge amount of content at his level.<br />
<br />
That's the problen the casual/non-raiders have had. There p-lenty of content for sub 6000HP Warriors. BUT who wants to camp Droga weapons when the ubers have so much more.<br />
<br />
That's the only part that Kaesorn is fairly correct about.<br />
<br />
1. Most of the lore in the game is outside of the locked zones. Specificaly it's found in quests. The best example is to make a Halfling Druid and do all of the noobie quests in Rivervale - it's amazing just how immersive the experiance is. If you were experiancing EQ for the first time, you'd be quite surprised how different the initial experiances of playing different classes is.<br />
<br />
2. High ZEMs, better foragable items, better tradecraft drops, and better loot have been the major advantages of raiding for quite awhile. As Brenlo once commented (paraphrasing) - players will always get better loot from raid targets. The advantages of not raiding is to focus on the many many quests like the Loyalist Shield of Honor (or Levi cloak, Fleeting Quiver, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.) that do not require a raid. I still haven't done it for my Paladin alt - there just isn't enough time to do it.<br />
<br />
3. Kaesorn totally misses the boat in the end. There ARE two different games or more precisely a half-dozen at least. My son's girlfriend is a level 24 Shaman. She logs in and talks to her EQ frinds and sometimes goes with them to kill some mobs (and sometimes doesn't). An acquaintance ONLY sits in the bazaar and makes deals. Another only 2-boxes. Some only group.<br />
<br />
But, those that wish to use an alternative playstyle generally acknowledge it's an alternative - they don't expect to achieve the same results as those who play the game hard and to maximize their progression and gear.<br />
<br />
But Kaesorn and Haas don't acknowledge really that they are playing a different game. They want the same loot rewards by alternative methods. My son's girlfriend charms people into giving it to her (not that she cares about loot - if she did, she'd raid). The bazaar trader hopes to bargan himself into having it (not that he'll use it), and casual players hope SoE will make it easily available to them.<br />
<br />
Six-person fights just can not have the complexities nor the degree of challange as completing Uqua for example - not even Vxed/Tipt. While you can argue completing vxed or Tipt takes an individual the same amount of time as doing Uqua, there is not the same degree of challange, nor should there be the same reward - ever.<br />
<br />
The chat with friends game, bazaar trader game, only soloing, only grouping, light raiding and taking down Epic 1.0 mobs as a guild this late in the game, and hardcore raiding ARE different games.<br />
<br />
When my old time bud gives me a /tell and says I finally completed my Monk 1.0 Eppic, I don't get all stuck up and send him a link of my Painsipper. I /tell him &quot;Grats. Woo Woo. That's a huge accomplishment!!&quot; Amd I'm telling the truth - because in the version of EQ he plays, that epic IS a huge accomplishment.<br />

<br />
I believe a bunch of us stated you chose to play a different game - you wouldn't acknowledge it sir. You claimed:<br />
<br />
1. There should be no locked zones. Well OoW has the lag, trains, and begging spam and other benefits of &quot;open&quot; zones. The ubers are cherry picking the raid boss mobs, doing Epics, and getting spells. When they are done, it's back to Inkta'Tu, Txevu, and the other unpronouncables. <br />
<br />
2. The equipment &quot;gap&quot; existed because the very small minority of level 65 that don't raid (and soloers, and bazaar traders, and other &quot;alternative&quot; users) didn't get the lion's share of attention - there was no progression path. Ready to concede you were wrong?<br />
<br />
Glatius,<br />
<br />
Look, mudflate the game by putting in near time quality loot in open zones, player tradeskill improvable augments, etc. and of course people are going to &quot;enjoy&quot; it. LDoN was designed for casuals and to my mind it is a pita expansion. Yet it answers most of their concerns - instanced content that ubers can't bottomfeed, rewards for playing short time spans, etc. OoW is pretty much the opposite of what they have asked for in the past except for the &quot;locked&quot; zones issue - lower level players can zerg one group mobs - hooray!!<br />
<br />
SoE listened to all players and loostened up the game. But Haas and other casual posters are still sub-6000HP's unbuffed. Heck, the AC and HP gap is a LOT bigger now - I'm at 15K HP's full raid buffed and I'm far from exceptional.<br />
<br />
They still play a different game, Epic 1.5 isn't a DBoW and Magnetic armor isn't QVic. BUT those that make the effort can do better than Droga weapons or Fierce Heraldic armor. Anyone who makes the effort. They realize that SoE having gone to extremes to make the entire player base happy (&quot;Free loot for everybody!&quot;) they can't complain anymore and have any credibility.<br />
<br />
OK, Haas can complain the ubers are too uber - but he's done so consistantly, he's &quot;special&quot;. Fortunately there's level 70 now (and hopefully 75, 100, 150,....), AA, guild tags, and visual equipment checks (is that store bought or no drop armor I see?) to distinguish those you want to group with from those that can't take a hit, mez a mob, etc.<br />

You've acknowledged you've chosen to play a different game. You contend there shouldn't be a difference between hardcore raiding and grouping. I (and to some extent Brenlo and the long history of EQ) says there should be a difference.<br />
<br />
More challanging content/raid boss mobs will and should drop better loot. Better loot = added capability. More experiance grinding = levels, AA and LDoN Adventure Points. Figuring out a progression path and pursuing it = improvement. <br />
<br />
Frodlin and casual Warriors themselves post Magelos and show equipment upgrades beyond 6k HP's unbuffed. You start an experiment to explore wether a progression path exits - WELL? Does it??<br />
<br />
No one want to group with a level 53 Paladin or a sub-6k HP still in class/diety armor level 65 Warrior. Not when a little effort can and has transformed many players to something more effective. If I want to play my 53 Paladin, I have to get with the program. Fortunately, there's a progression path. There are items not yet obtained that are obtainable.<br />
<br />
The fact I didn't make the progress when more players were doing the content makes it more difficult - I'm willing to conceed I chose to be a tail-end Charlie. Fortunately I understand you have a regular group.<br />
<br />
I note for example that your Magelo does not have 10AC, 40HP, or 20HP/20Mana/20End augs in every slot possible. It doesn't take raiding to do this. I, who doesn't understand because I'm &quot;uber&quot;, obtained all those AC and HP LDoN augs. In fact since there wasn't the ability to move them, I did them 2 or 3 times. I still use several.<br />
<br />
Many players have offered help and advice. Thowing up your hands and saying it's impossible is not constructive.<br />

<br />
Should you come up with a coherrent arguement, be sure to share it.<br />
<br />
The original poster was a bit out of bounds for making a sweeping statement without much to back it up, but y'all have gone a bit beyond him.<br />
<br />
Look at Haas's augment slots Glat. - empty. That's easy 1 group content. I did it, Frodlin did it, heck, you probably even did it. If you want to suggest Haas has proven his case - hardcore groups have no progression path given this evidence of the effort he's made, why feel free. How old is LDoN? This is not a case of there wasn't enough time, AP's can be earned in half-hour play sessions. IMO, Haas doesn't like LDoN and if he doesn't like it, he's not going to do it.<br />
<br />
Haas is entitled not to raid, to feel LDoN consumes time without sufficient reward, X expansion isn't worthwhile, etc. But you can't swim against the current consistantly and expect to get the same results as those that swim with the current.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand the argument where someone is determined they aren't going to play SoE's game, but instead will only play the game of EQ they want to play and then expect, no demand!, good results.<br />

Well, the great thing about the ignore feature is that it still gives you a link you can click on if you want to read the post. You can usually tell from the context and the responses whether it's worth taking a look at. I recommend you try it out and see how it works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Partha,<br />
<br />
I asked Haass a clear and straight forward question. I didn't veer anywhere on the rhetorical map. I'm thinking he's able to answer it for himself  if he chooses.<br />
<br />
There's an argument that can be made that goes something like this:<br />
<br />
I play EQ to have fun. Raiding for me is not fun and I decided not to do it. Grinding out endless LDoN's to obtain augments is not fun and I won't do it. There's a time consumption aspect to EQ that's the antithisis of fun and it's this that must be fixed.<br />
<br />
Now I've no idea if that's Haass's position or not, but it isn't the one he has taken. Such a position would be a good retort to the original poster's comments. Instead, Haass has claimed there is no reasonably doable progression path for hardcore non-raiders - the content does not exist. The original poster contends the content exits but casuals are too lazy to do it. <br />
<br />
The argument I just provided says that content (LDoN for example) exists and is doable, but isn't reasonable because it's not fun. If this argument is correct, the challange for SoE is not more content for casuals, but making the sufficient existing content more fun. Quality, not quantity.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not terribly interested in scoring points on Haass. But there is something he's trying to say. His posts, what he's contended, the experiment, his augment slots, etc. all point at a set of attitudes about the game. IF he would abandon beligerancy in favor of discussion, then we all might find out what it was.<br />

Congratulations, you have been swinging your E-cock for quite some time now. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is that people want to be able to enjoy the game without haveing to put in 6+ hours per day. Why is this hard to understand? Certainly their are two different games, people that play 6+ hours a day should very well have great gear. But EQ is no longer about Quests its about Raiding.<br />
<br />
Battleblade says- &quot;OoW is pretty much the opposite of what they have asked for in the past except for the &quot;locked&quot; zones issue - lower level players can zerg one group mobs - hooray!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume that is another way to build up your ego? Why do you care how others play, this game is about fun or about playtime? If you and friends can take down a mob with one group that shouldn't meen others need to be locked out of the zone. <br />

<br />
this is yet another manifestation of soe's obsession with uberguilds that isnt talked about enough. i dont think anyone will deny anymore that its much easier to get a group at 65 and zero aa than at 64 with any number of aa. and this is only true because they dont see that you have no baron title till theyve already committed to joining you in a group and they are ashamed to say no after they see you up close. this issue is not a &quot;progression path&quot; issue so much as it is evidence that soe has picked up almost no new customers in the last few years. so now a level 65 with 80 aa is considered to be a newbie by a large proportion of the player base.<br />
<br />
the priorities for soe have been:<br />
<br />
1) powergaming computer required. they dont admit it on the box but if your computer is more than a couple years old you will lag so badly that progression is stifled almost no matter what. if your computer is brand new you will probably be ok but there are many with state of the art systems who also are crippled in performance. in this case the powergamer must also be computer savvy enough to follow tech support instructions like &quot;we suggest you update your motherboard BIOS&quot; and other trash.<br />
2) 30-60 hours/week required. if not you will not progress. progression is not determined by total hours played the way it used to be. it used to be that a person who plays 500 hours in a year would progress the same amount in a year as a person who plays 500 hours in ten weeks would progress in ten weeks. not true anymore because you simply cannot get to the important content without being guilded and flagged and you wont get either without signing off your free-time rights to a guild honcho.<br />
3) communal playstyle required. factions used to be between the player and the mobs. now its between the players and each other. you need a guild. period. once you are in a guild all other guilds become your enemies. freelancers are despised by soe. the cash economy has been all but eliminated at the high end. upgrade worthy drops are found on so few mobs that to have a decent job of attaining them without a guild (even with GoD and OOW) requires a huge time investment in the messageboards or other 3rd party eq tools like lucy or allakazam. this has not always been true. it used to be that one person hunted in one spot and one in another and one got cash and one got gear upgrades and they used trading to equal it all out. but almost everything worthwhile anymore is no drop. farming cash even at low level is horribly inefficient compared to sitting around in luclin zones waiting for someone to ooc &quot;item rotting at loc xxx,xxx&quot;.<br />
<br />
try to get a friend to start playing eq and tell him &quot;i know you cant get a group. i know you will be level 65 before you can loot items beter than what you can get for free by begging. i know the lag is intolerable. but trust me just invest 2000 hours in the game and 1000 dollars on computer equipment and suddenly things will begin to look up and you will see why we like this game.&quot;<br />
<br />
by the way if you are going to criticize haass for not having all his augments just remember that when playing becomes intermittent due to the game being no fun you are going to lack augments ok? it doesnt mean the person is wrong about the problems of progression for non raiders. i could put in another 1000 hours and get more augments and ldon no drop gear but the &quot;progression&quot; in that is small compared to what raiders get. and it wont impress 12k warriors that i have a full set of ldon augments and equipment that i got in 2000 hours of played time.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for &quot;getting&quot; it. In an open zone lower level guild raid targets are &quot;uber&quot; one-group targets. Lower level guild raid targets, yum!<br />
<br />
Haass and Rysingsun point out that when level 70 Vanquishers are in a zone, it's harder for a level 65 to get a group. A good argument for separate high-level content for &quot;ubers&quot;.<br />
<br />
But this is not what players wanted. Eventualy anytime a named mob pops in WoS, some &quot;ubers&quot; will bottom feed it, twink their twinks, or /auction the drops/loot rights.<br />
<br />
The only real way to combat these things is to make content/loot that is more apealing to &quot;ubers&quot; that only they can handle or get to - maybe flags would work. Maybe Txevu, etc. and other locked content are the only things that will get &quot;uber&quot; guilds out of the way of up and coming guilds. Ironic, isn't it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">No translation needed.<br />
<br />
If you start playing today or roll up a new character you better have a permanent group or powerleveling set up for them (or be able to solo). Most of the earlier content is completely empty of players.<br />
<br />
If you didn't get the LDoN augments, it's harder now. There are fewer people doing LDoN. Yes, you can get GoD augments or player tradeskill enhanced augments, but they are much less accessable, especially if you are short the AC and HP's LDoN augments would give you.<br />
<br />
The game moves on, you either move with it or you get left behind.<br />
<br />
Now maybe augments mean nothing to you Haass, but on my character they represent over 600 HP's. That's equivilent to a fair amount of major equipment upgrades. Using LDoN augments alone you can get an extra ~200HP's and 40 AC. Doing GoD amd OoW single group content can increase that pretty nicely.<br />
<br />
Augments are significant. Thanks for answering my question I guess. I had supposed you detested LDoN so much you wouldn't do it to fill your augments slots. I had no idea it was because you believe augments aren't that important.<br />

While I agree with a lot of what you said in your last post, I don't think this is quite fair. <br />
<br />
There are two paths you can take: Raiding and non-raiding. If you want to be a raider, then don't play the game like a non-raider. Don't work on wasting your time getting worthless equipment to join a guild when all that matters is flags. On the other hand, if you don't raid, don't waste your time on flags that will only open up raiding content. <br />
<br />
Basically, know the game you want to play and stick to it and you will be successful and not feel slighted by the guy the joined a big guild and got better gear than you in a month. I chose the non-raiding path. I work hard for my gear and think I am doing pretty well for not raiding and having pretty limited play time. I knew when I chose to drop any guild tags and embark on my own that I would never get the best gear, and I haven't looked back since. <br />
<br />
I didn't waste hours upon hours of my life getting equipment worse than someone who is quickly picking up the scraps from the resident uber guild because I am having fun.</div></div><hr />

They should have to EARN their phat lewtz by playing just like ME!  <br />
<br />
Don't worry, as you point out yourself later, the gap between the hardcore raider and those who aren't is still ridiculously huge.  Yes, the hardcore raider should have better gear, but in EQ it is so much better as to be absurd.  There's just no comparison at all.  If you're buffing to over 15k hit points now, then you have about 5k more hit points than an extremely WELL equipped non raiding warrior, who with a great deal of effort might be able to hit 10k.  You also have many hundreds more AC, which makes a huge difference.  <br />
<br />
Many people want a game where you don't have to play obscene amounts of time in a raid guild to be a &quot;good&quot; character.  They don't expect to be the best.  The hardcore person will get that, and deservedly so.  They just want to feel like they're pretty good after so much time spent in the game.  That's not the case in EQ though.  In EQ the non hardcore raider, especially for tanks, is a useless piece of shit compared to the raider.</div></div><hr />

if you had any clue what haass and i are talking about you would have understood from context that we were talking about level 70. so stop focusing on the typos as if those are the only arguments you have an answer to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">While I agree with a lot of what you said in your last post, I don't think this is quite fair. <br />
<br />
There are two paths you can take: Raiding and non-raiding. If you want to be a raider, then don't play the game like a non-raider. Don't work on wasting your time getting worthless equipment to join a guild when all that matters is flags. On the other hand, if you don't raid, don't waste your time on flags that will only open up raiding content. <br />
<br />
Basically, know the game you want to play and stick to it and you will be successful and not feel slighted by the guy the joined a big guild and got better gear than you in a month. <br />
<br />
in a month? is it THAT bad? but seriously your point is well taken. years ago when i knew the game was tilting in favor of guild centered playstyle i stayed out of a guild because it &quot;suited my playstyle&quot;. but i was quite offended when PoP was declared a &quot;guild only&quot; expansion. when zones like hoh were later opened to unflagged people it became clear it could be solod by my druid naked for exp. why the heck did they hide behind flags zones that were not even particularly hard. even a poorly equipped warrior could handle hoh. and it gave twice the rate of experience of luclin zones - even to the average non raiding type. the flags were put there to be a timesink. eventually even the guilded were enraged by the timesink of backflagging and declared as a result of their anger that the flags should never be removed because it would be unfair if others didnt suffer the same pain they already did.<br />
<br />
and this is supposed to be a good game?<br />
<br />
in time it got worse. no one new when PoP was opened up that the elemental zones would give such huge experience that people wouldnt even balk at spending 60aa on 100hp. suddenly this idea about each player playing in a way that suits his own playstyle came up hollow. it is no mystery that eq has few new players. no drops were one of several death sentences to the ability of new players to enjoy the game. they all by themselves destroyed the cash economy. they caused upper level players to have no use for their cash so they started selling it for real life cash or giving it away. every new player soon learns that the fastest way to progress in gear is to ask for looting rights on no drop gear in higher zones. meanwhile they buy a weighty polearm (if they are too lazy to farm free no drops) for 5pp. its quite bazaar that bottomfeeding greens yields more cash than hunting blues. ive long said that the answer to the tradable vs no drop debate should always have been &quot;you can only loot what you got experience for&quot;. but its too late to easily change it. the design staff spent way too much time implementing the game and much too little time thinking ahead of time about the ramifications of their design decisions.<br />
<br />
now we have a &quot;game&quot; where the fastest way to 65 involves a lot of begging and this kills the spirit of the new player. we have a game where (new) casuals dont get hooked on the game because their very first impression of the game is &quot;it sure has a slow framerate&quot;. /tangent .. when i started the game 5 years ago the graphics were absolutely beautiful! the spell effects were captivating! some of the armor and weapons that dropped actually got equipped! this part of the game has been destroyed. was it on purpose? of course not. sony management didnt get up one morning and say &quot;lets ruin the game for the newbie because the real money is in the ubers&quot;. but it is nevertheless what they did. a few years ago the game was ruined for anyone under 50. a year ago it was trashed for anyone under 65. what are you going to do when the game becomes unplayable for anyone who is not in a guild? sooooooo .... is it true that ldon groups have become very hard to get now? its what people are telling me. and no wonder! all you can do post 65 is adventures where they hit for 960! and there arent enough players left under 66 to quickly get groups. sad. very sad.<br />
<br />
they gave me an ldon where at 65 i went 40 minutes before my very first heal. and no its not because we rested between pulls. we had a chain pulling bard and i tanked it all. but should i even suggest that &quot;hey maybe we should do a hard&quot; and the messageboards fill up with people telling me its too hard. well now they wont let post 65s do the easy ones so if they cant handle the hards they get no ldon at all. way to kill an expansion! way to kill the best stepping stone to GoD for the non uber .. poor a method as it was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, know the game you want to play and stick to it and you will be successful and not feel slighted by the guy the joined a big guild and got better gear than you in a month. <br />
<br />
thats why i joined the game of life. well its one of the reasons. i probably would have quit eq no matter what because of personal reasons but .. still .. this made it easier for me.<br />
<br />
haass .. give up the game. i survived. you will survive. its heartbreaking leaving my warrior and druid in permanant limbo but its good for me. as for me i will not play any online rpg game again. i know how addicting they are. i broke free of everquest and only the messageboards are a lingering relic of my past .. one which is slowly fading as well. if i try another game i might get hooked. so i wont try one. im too undisciplined to play in moderation. eq is not made to be played in moderation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">So let me see if I have this right.  In BB's mind, if you have a level 70 Warrior with 9k HP buffed and a level 70 Warrior with 14k HP buffed, the fact that people prefer the 14k buffed Warrior indicates that there should be &quot;special&quot; zones for those 14k Warriors to go so that the 9k Warriors can get a group? <br />
<br />
So, once all the 14k Warriors are off in their &quot;special&quot; zones with their guild buds, raking in the exp and phat loots hand over fist, why exactly won't people be trying to get the 12k Warriors, who aren't quite uber enough for the 'special&quot; zones yet, because they're new to their uber raid guild?<br />
<br />
Besides BB, as you yourself often preach, if you're not at the appropriate &quot;level&quot; for the zone, then you should go where you are appropriate.  So the ubers should be going off to find zones that offer them an appropriate level of difficulty, rather than bottom feeding and competing with 9k Warriors.  But of course in the minds of the ubers, bottom feeding is perfectly okay.  But god forbid that a non-raider should actually expect to have access to uber &quot;special&quot; zones. <br />
<br />
Hypocrisy, thy name is BB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me dude, EQ has zero hold over me.<br />
<br />
I quit for 9 months..canceled, deleted, put the CD's in the closet and I walked away.  I didn't miss it, I didn't crave it, and I don't need it.<br />
<br />
But, what really happened, is that I was really fucking bored.  Gaming has been a part of my life with a few friends now for almost my entire adult life.  We tried to find games to replace EQ to no avail. Warcraft 3 is great...but there's only so many times you can fight the battles that you can create with 3 guys (my usual gaming preference).  We didn't get a single fucking invite to even drool over for WoW, most of the other MMO's suck donkey nuts, Doom 3 turned out to be WAY less than I had hoped for, and the only other thing we did is try to get old school games that kick ass running on Windows XP (By the way, if ANYONE can figure out how to get Total Annihilation running over the internet these days, PLEASE LET ME KNOW FOR THE LOVE OF GOD).  <br />
<br />
EQ has no hold on us.  When WOW comes out, we'll be dropping this game, and we won't be looking back.  We're at that point.  But we're not at the point of sitting around each and every nite going &quot;What you wanna do?&quot; &quot;I dunno, what you wanna do?&quot; just so we don't have to play EQ.<br />
<br />
And since I'm playing EQ, I'm gonna continue to do what I've always done..which is point out the glaring problems in gameplay so that hopefully someone at SOE gets a fucking clue and realizes why their game will never last once they have some competition in the genre.</div></div><hr />

But, I've played EQ forever, and I've been at all levels of play. I was a total idiot for over a year, I was the pickup tank for even longer, and I was the prime tank for several guilds after that. I've sat at from under 2000hp unbuffed to over 3200ac fully raidbuffed. I've also quit actively playing since some time back and only logging in occasionally nowadays.

A few days ago the discussion had actually evolved into a somewhat-interesting debate over the inherent faults in designing new game content. <br />
<br />
Until you came in, cock waving every which way but right, proclaiming that nonraiders &quot;want all the same loot rewards through alternative methods&quot; ... and aside from that just generally being a dense asshole.  You were the one that made this the topic of fucking conversation on this thread and you did it very specifically and very explicitly on purpose.   I find it particularly ironic that this retard train was re-railed in your post calling Kaesorn out for his comment that raiders have &quot;a cocky, I'm-better-than-you-because-I-raid attitude.&quot;  In response you noted &quot;Kaesorn totally misses the boat&quot; but your fucking attidude is the absolute crowning jewel in his proof. <br />

I'm tired of your stupidity, your rhetoric, and your insults.  You are really missing out on what it's like to play and enjoy a videogame; and you honestly don't know jack and shit about what marketing and sales if you truly believe a game company intended or intends to design a game that permits real progression through only one playstyle path.

I haven't been in the OoW zones yet, and I've been wondering a couple of things.<br />
In the open/outdoor zone(s), are the mobs so close together, either in static positions or in their pathing, that they are within each other's aggro ranges and therefore cannot be pulled without FD splitting or spells such as pac?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>arlakisd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">I could take a naked warrior and pull most of MPG w/o issue. Now mind you if the tank didn't get ranged aggro. I'd go splat but it'd be doable. Pullers Are NOT required at least in MPG. I haven't spent much time in WoS. (Train City) So I'm guessing it's easier to pull 2 plus there.<br />
Haven't gotten a Riftseekers group either so can't comment about that zone either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Ah, thank you.<br />
<br />
I asked because if this is true:<br />
&quot;Most warriors know their class at 65+ its all about the gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
and the aggro ranges of mobs do not physically overlap in an outdoor zone, then unless someone lets the lvl 64s in, there shouldn't ever be any trains in that zone. Assuming warriors do all the pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">I asked because if this is true:<br />

<br />
And what happens when the Cleric flubs up and the Warrior hits the ground and the group DPS then scatters?  Inept Warriors are certainly not the only nor even the primary cause of trains.  Trains happen even if the Warrior knows his class inside and out, if his group mates are the three stooges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">Well, I concur with that. In fact, it also depends on the other pullers out there.</div></div><hr />

Most of the trains happening due to couple things:<br />
<br />
1) invis drops at wrong time people dont take it for the team, they try to run out<br />
2) see invis catches people exploring or people who are trying to skate by certain places where a mistake gets you into aggro range of a see invis<br />
3) tanks are gear dependent and hence although someone may know their class, lesser geared tanks allow less room for error, especially true with overnuking casters in a weaker aggro warrior grp<br />
4) pull something inadvertantly<br />
<br />
in the end people wont take it for the team they would rather take the chance of training the whole zone and dont even bother to yell they are training the zone<br />

MPG has a couple wanderer's that can cause 2 pulls. But It is hard to get more than 2.. Even trying :)  And for pulling Bard speed movement matters more than skillset there.</div></div><hr />
