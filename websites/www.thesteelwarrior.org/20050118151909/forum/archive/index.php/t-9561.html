<br />
Is attack more valuable than AC point per point?  For example, if the choice were +10 attack vs. +10 AC, which would be the preferred upgrade?  Up to the 250 limit, of course.</div></div><hr />

It will slightly increase your DPS, but warrior DPS is NOT something to sacrifice tankability over.  If you have the choice between two equal items, one with ATK and one without, get the attack then, but if you have to give up stats that arent maxed yet, or especially if you have to give up AC or HP, its not worth it.<br />
<br />
AC &gt; HP &gt; STA &gt; DEX &gt; AGI &gt; CHA &gt; ATK<br />
<br />
Everything above increases your ability to tank...except ATK.  If you want to do DPS, make a rogue, ranger or monk alt, and worry about ATK then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I certainly agree that atk is not a key stat in taking, I'd rather have an item with an extra 25 atk than 10 agi or dex to be honest. AC, sta, hp, regen, and worn effects are all &gt; atk, as is charisma. But when someone starts getting items with significant increases to atk, they're likely capped str/sta/dex and probably agi with buffs. <br />
<br />
I would never make a statement comparing atk to ac or hp like the common 1ac = 6ish hp, but it is one stat to keep in mind when looking at items. DPS is a major contributor to aggro, and atk increases dps. But ac/hp/atk will differ from warrior to warrior, as will the zones and mobs they are expected to tank. If you're in a spot where raid bosses aren't too hard, then sure, go for some more atk. That being said, I wouldn't trade any hp or ac for atk unless I could get some stupid ratio, like 10hp for 50atk or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The relative value of certain stats depends on where you are in the game, and what sort of gear you have. AC and hitpoints--well, you just never get tired of having more. As for ATK, I've never picked a piece of gear based on ATK. I can't imagine a situation where I would, since one's ATK generally seems to take care of itself if you get better gear. <br />
For a long time, STA ranks right up there with AC/hitpoints, because until you cap out STA, STA *is* hitpoints. In my experience, though, STA for a long tiime is actually easier to get than DEX (if you get the best AC you can, you'll be getting STA but not necessarily DEX in some armor lines), so for some warriors at some points (55-65?) dex may be lagging behind STA, which can become an issue with proc rates and hence improving your chances of good aggro early. It's pretty easy to see what an extra 15 STA gets you; it's harder to see that +15 DEX does anything at all. However, you can easily see the difference between the aggro of a warrior with max dex and WA vs. a warrior with &lt;max dex and no weapon affinity. <br />
AGI, ATK, STR...well, they just aren't that big a deal. If you're not encumbered, you're strong enough. the only time I ever pay any attention to STR is if I'm smithing for a skill up. <br />
For advanced tanks doing tough mobs, DI is sometimes and issue, and its success rate is a function of CHA, and CHA is kinda hard to max, so you see some folks get a little interested in it at certain points in their careers. <br />
Various resists are the same: situational, depending on what mob you're fighting. Not at all uncommon to see Magelos of warriors with a bag full of weapons and another bag full of resist/clicky stuff. I don't recall ever seeing anyone packing something to improve ATK at the expense of AC/Hps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a cleric 'buff' called Divine Intervention, which lasts for about 10 minutes or so, and gives you a % chance to 'proc' so to say, a Complete Heal if your health gets below a certain point (think 20% of health not sure). I.e this is a lit. life saver when you tank mobs that can one round* you. It sort of gives the healers a bit more working space in healing you. <br />
Now the chance for the DI to proc is a combination of cleric AA's and your charisma, hence you see tanks that use DI regulary equip charisma gear, get charisma buffs and pref. also have a bard singing +cha grouped /w them.<br />
Smart use of DI and the AA's / Tank's charisma can be the difference between a tight healer rotation, or the more usual cleric-zerg fest....<br />
<br />
<br />
* Its also extremely useful when you low on clerics and such on less higher end raids. My old guild pretty successfully raided all of ssraa and VT with a bare minimum of clerics, DI keeping us tanks up on more then one occasion.</div></div><hr />

So is looking at the time those posts were made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the item I was thinking about:<br />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70232<br />
<br />
Ended up buying it, but also had been thinking about hardened serpent scale legs vs. ornate legs, which are similar cost, but based upon replies will definitely go with ornate legs in that case.</div></div><hr />

Yup.  ATK is nice, but I wouldn't give up any amount of AC for any amount of atk.</div></div><hr />
