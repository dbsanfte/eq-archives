<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any hints/strats on it?<br />
<br />
Also, could a skilled/well equipped group of 65 cleric, 65 mage, 63 rogue, 65 Pally, 65 enchanter do it?<br />
<br />
Everyone of us have over 50 AA, and rogue/mage/pally getting quite close too 100.<br />
<br />
Migth also have a 65 necro/65 enchanter to add if they are on<br />

BTW, my warrior is only 53 atm, so he is not tank yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ntdor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ehhh you COULD do it..with 2 ench's would make it easier..but it might take like 3-4 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spinetwist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive one grouped it, but its sloooooooow. <br />
<br />
Id suggest getting some levels before trying this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its doable with 2 chanters. The walk is not worth it quest is buggy as hell and there is a good chance gnome can poof middle of the walk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did this with 2x war, wiz, enc, clr, bstlord npnp. took me about an hour - hour 30. It's pretty easy, the triggered spawns are 6 green lizards, 2 green lizards, 2 brown lizards,  1 brown lizard. Random, iirc. Well worth the risk, 100hp earring = god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">has anyone ever seen the nexxus gate gloves drop from this quest? i dont believe to be any on torv and was wondering if they were removed from the loot table...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Me, a cleric and an enc do this almost every night. The earrings sell really well, and it takes about 50minutes.<br />
<br />
I've never seen the gate gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this event despawns after about an hour and a half, i tried to 2 box it and the gnome despawned about 3/4 of the way through.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gnome doesnt de-spawn.  you probably had one of your toons blocking his path and he warped to somewhere into the zone.  Happened to us a few times.  Thats the only time I've seen the gnome &quot;poof&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Its not too hard, but I would recommend a dedicated slower especially your first time doing so.  Root the gnome and memblur after the mobs are dead.<br />
<br />
And no... I have yet to see the gate gloves as well... anyone actually looted the gloves recently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loosscru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually I think the gnome is on a timer.  The times I have done it without any problem it was done fairly fast.  No med breaks, keep a few folks ahead of the gnome to pull mobs to the next spot so you don't have to wait for a mez or root to wear off.  In other words anyplace you can save time go for it.  I have done it with as few as 8 folks in under an hour but usually 2 to 3 groups of 60+ is a safe bet for actually finishing the quest.<br />
<br />
No I have yet to see the gloves drop.<br />
<br />
Here is a walk through I wrote a while back, may be helpful for you here.<br />
<br />
This is a map from EQatlas.com which I put some dots on for your reference.<br />
http://members.cox.net/nothinghere/gnomewalk.jpg <br />
<br />
About this map and the CT gnome walk in general, the gnomes path is the blue or light blue dots.  A random number (between 1 and 6) of mobs (made up of green and brown lizards) will spawn at the nearest red dot every time the gnome hits a pink spot near a number.  This will always happen and yes you can end up with 6 brown lizards.  <br />
<br />
The only exception here is that when the gnome hits the pink spot at 6 you will get a spawn at 5 followed a few minutes later by a spawn at 6.  The spawn at 6 pops right on the gnome so you have to watch for it but 6 is usually just a single spawn.<br />
<br />
The pink spots near A and B are a bit different then the ones near the numbers.  Mobs only pop at one of those trigger points, not both.  So if the gnome walks past A and you don't get a spawn then expect it at B.  If I remember correctly the spawn at B is far more common.  <br />
<br />
On the number spawns the gnome is pretty safe and you can just keep him where he is.  The A and B spawns are different because the Mobs pop almost on top of the gnome.  You have to act fast to save him at A or B.  Usually it is best to agro the gnome and pull him out of range of any AEs the mobs (or the raid party) may cast.<br />
<br />
The gnomes pathing: Usually the gnome moves around the dark blue path in a clockwise motion, going from 1 to 2 to 3... all the way to 6 and back to the start.  However, I have seen him occasionally break from this pattern.  Sometimes after the visiting point 3 the gnome moves to 4 via the light blue path above B.  This isn't much of an issue just be prepared for it.  <br />
<br />
Far worse is when the gnome breaks off the dark blue path after point 2 and takes the light blue path to 5/6.  This is quite annoying because he then goes back to 3 following the dark blue path on the west side.  After 3 he follows the path as normal to 4 and then skips by the turn to 5 and 6 and follows the dark blue path back to the start/finish area.  This is a problem because you end up clearing allot of mobs that will likely have respawned by the time you get back to them.<br />
<br />
As far as strategies go, have an enchanter and a shaman watch the Gnome and keep him slowed.  The shaman can take hits from a slowed Gnome without too much issue if the enchanter has to mez some mobs.  Otherwise have the main force stay ahead of the Gnome trying to clear danger out of its path.  On some turns you have to watch out incase he takes a light blue path.  You want to do this event as fast as you safely can.  The gnome has been known to despawn if you take too long (I have heard anywhere from one hour to three hours but have only seen it happen after about an hour and forty-five minutes give or take).  Also some people report that if you block the gnomes path then you can cause him to despawn but I have not seen this happen myself.<br />
<br />
At some point (usually off a brown lizard at 6) a quill will drop, this is the item the gnome wants when he gets back to the wizard port in.  He will despawn and respawn when he reaches the base of the port pyramid and ask if you found his quill.  Turn in the quill and get your reward.  The rewards are all tradable so it doesn't matter who loots the quill.</div></div><hr />
