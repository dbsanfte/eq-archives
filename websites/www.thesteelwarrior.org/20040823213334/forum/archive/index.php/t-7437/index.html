 Just wondering what everyones opnion is on Guild Raiding Progression<br />
<br />
i.e. 45 to 55 KAel Drakkel for faction and Arena for armor upgrades<br />
      55 to 60 Tov for armor upgrades<br />
      60 to 65 Kill Ak Anon guards because they taste good.....errrr nm<br />
                    Vex Thall, Ssra, etc........<br />
<br />
In essance there are many leaving and some that just dont play as often as they used to so what if you could would you orginize as a progression for gear and tactics exp to get a guild <br />
<br />
Anyways what are your thoughts on Guild Progression. :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I really think that it also depends on the size of your guild.  Once you are in the 65ish area if you can handle some of the lower tier non-zone boss mobs in PoP, there are some great upgrades to be had as well.  Vhazik the Shade and the Mujaki ring event in PoN give some nice upgrades.  The BoT tower bosses are wonderful raid targets for some extremely nice upgrades if that is where you are....ornate chest armor lines, other nice armor pieces and weapons, etc.  You could spend a lot of time raiding the towers to get everyone outfitted in that nice gear.  If your people can handle BoT, all of the min bosses can drop the other ornate pieces as well depending on which you kill, and you need to kill them for the tower key quest anyway.</div></div><hr />
