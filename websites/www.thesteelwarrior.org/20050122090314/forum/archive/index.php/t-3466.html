<br />
I have an enchanter main and warrior alt, and play in a raid-guild whose policy is one-member one-main, and in which it is hard to equip alts - a policy I agree with as it makes the guild stronger, and allows us to progress faster.<br />
<br />
Fortunately one of my EQ hobbies is trading the bazaar, and business has been booming :) enough so that over time I can afford to outfit my warrior in pretty much the best droppable gear going.<br />
<br />
I've linked my magelo below which is up to date. Things I have in mind to buy when I see them for sale are a Blackened metal collar, a second crystallised acid bracer, and a second steel ring of earthen resilience.<br />
<br />
But after that what else should I be looking for, I'm at a loss? Or is that the end of the road as far as droppable gear goes?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any hints.<br />
<br />
Burgar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: I think there is a new dropable earing that came out with loy that has more than 70hps and I belive cultrual armor neck has more ac if not more hps than what you have now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A SoD instead of ChoS would be better. Not worth the price, but better.<br />
<br />
Btw, the end result of all this is you have to ask yourself...<br />
<br />
What do you want to do with your twink anyway?<br />
<br />
Your gear is good enough to exp just about anywhere when you get your AA's.<br />
<br />
You should be around 8400k+ hps when you finish the droppables and your ND 3, PE, PD 3, PP, etc...<br />
<br />
So, what exactly do you want your Warrior to do?<br />
<br />
I say get him the last items you mentioned, then start PL duoing the hell out of the exp for him :)<br />

Start working on the 40 hp augs from LDoN to pop into your gear slots to add more hps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I thought I was the only nut ball crazy enough to twink a warrior with those items. Just missing a Black Plated Collar and a BoC and I am all set for bazaar items. There are a couple of earrings with more HP than the Bloodmetals, but I don't think the HP are worth the hit you take in other areas - AC and resist mostly - to make them worth spending the plats.<br />
<br />
Also, don't bother buying an SoD. You should be able to get your hands on a Greatblade of Storms from the plate tower in BoT. He is easily 2 groupable, less if you are in a Time guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm reminded of a druid on my server who said that I'd have 6k hp if I had full ornate. This was back when I had 3 pieces of ornate and was at around 5.3k So I was kinda like, &quot;Oh yeah? so the other 4 pieces of ornate have 700+ hp on them? Damn, I should have bought those first&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Hey Wandor I see that you also have no procs on yur weapons, are you holding agro well or did you add procs in slots?<br />
<br />
Humm I have a soulscream/great pernicity belt/cloak combo, yet I own a HRG (trying to sell), maybe I should go with that and CoF... <br />
<br />
<br />
Lets see<br />
Sta 10<br />
AC 9 <br />
Str 9<br />
HP 30<br />
<br />
AC 12<br />
Str 25<br />
HP 50<br />

<br />
AC 21<br />
Sta 20<br />
Str 36<br />
HP 80 on mine<br />
<br />
<br />
Use HP = 1, Sta = 3, AC = 5 to equalize HP<br />
<br />
Them: <br />
<br />
135 175 12<br />
<br />
Total 322<br />
<br />
Me: <br />
80 60 101<br />
<br />
Total 241<br />
<br />
<br />
str 32 on mine vs 8Agi and 8Dex on theirs hummm... thats probably like 30HP to me... <br />
<br />
Theirs is like 50HP better (I have SoV all the time so haste difference is nothing) ... CoF is like 40K...  Humm my belt and back would sell for 40K... <br />
<br />
tough call.</div></div><hr />

I'd be sold on HRG and CoF but then if you almost never have shammy buffs then maybe you need to take stats into consideration.  14more raw AC and 55 raw hps though... looks a pretty easy decision to me.</div></div><hr />

Why do people say this guy's twink would have 8400 hp after he finishes out the HP AA? He Might make 6400, but I doubt it. Seriously, some people have no concept of Hp. They mean buffed. He should have around 6000-6200 unbuffed, then add in 2403 in buffs and you get 8400hp. It takes a Time equiped tank to get 8400 unbuffed.<br />

Hey Wandor I see that you also have no procs on yur weapons, are you holding agro well or did you add procs in slots? Take a look at my magelo again, I have a seperate profile for my agro weapons. I don't usually MT since Moord is only 62 and there are always some 65 plate wearer with more AA with me so I use my DPS weapon the majority of the time. When I need agro, I use a copper hammer and a sword of the bloodsworn. I plan to get a BoC and a Greatblade of Storms if one will ever drop for me.<br />

Exactly. It's too easy to max STR/DEX/AGI with some buff to really consider those stats to even consider them. Toss in FA and even an assling druid can max thier melee stats pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

Belt of Raging Nature (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17444)  (75 hp/36%haste)<br />

I like it because it's a bit more versatile.  It's easy to switch around the cloak for different resists, eb.</div></div><hr />

IF they haven't been suggested before:<br />

Another Crystallized Acid Bracer<br />

Another Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience<br />
Iron Cog Earring<br />

<br />
To answer the earlier question what do I plan to do with my twink...well a few things. When I'm not raiding I generally play in the same tight group of friends I've played with for 2 years. This group has two monks, one cleric, one beastlord, one wizard and me (65/107 enchanter or 61/6 warrior) depending who is on. I levelled Burgar with the intention of making our grouping a bit more flexible, as contrary to what a lot of tanks seem to say (&quot;I LFG for 2 hours and never get one&quot;), there never seems to be a decent one LFG when we need one. I also created Burgar as a bit of a change from my enchanter, who has all the raid AA's he really needs, and grinding AA's for LR5 or to increase int cap another 5 points gets a little tedious after a while.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay 8.4k hp buffed sounds more reasonable. But if you'll note, the orginal post said 8400K + :D Soooooo... he was still wrong.<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to take a moment to put Sam in his place. Sam... your gear blows compared to the stuff these guys have. I don't understand your whack hp = 1 sta =3 nonsesnse, but if you take a look at the magelos, and you click that button that says modifiers, it does a wonderful thing, it lists all increases by hp, mana, ac, stat, resists.<br />
<br />
Sam = 971 hp, 474 mana, 338 ac<br />
<br />
Wandor's alt = 1661 hp, 396 mana, 472 ac<br />
<br />
Burgar = 1544 hp, 325 mana, 443 ac<br />
<br />
Omni = 1305 hp, 375 mana, 364 ac<br />
<br />
Well Sam, I must admit, I'm amused by your immense MANA, but it seems your title of &quot;Best of Bazaar&quot; is forfeit. You may now go directly to your room and cry, do not pass go, do not collect $200.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'd have done every stat, but I think maybe you understand you're not even in the same league as these people now.</div></div><hr />

From Wandor<br />
<br />
For the sake of the comparison, I valued set the base value of HP (x1), STA (x3), and AC (x5) then factored in effects to determin the final order. I used a x3 factor on the STA because morst warriors capable of getting these items should be able to easily max STA with buffs. I also gave AC a x5 factor because as many people will point out, AC doesn't stop AEs and all the AC in the world doesn't help when you are out of HPs.</div></div><hr />

With the following you can reach almost 8800 before augments and I still have a couple places I can make minor upgrades. Get the fuck out! That rocks, I though I would be stuck at 6khp when I finished. From the look of things it may be possible to break the 9k barrier on a twink with a mix of bazaar gear, LDoN armor, and small raid targets. The magic number will be 6597hp at max STA without any other buffs to get 9k with symbol+9 or 6720 to get 9k with Virtue. It will be interesting to see if someone can pull this off, I know I have a new goal now.<br />

That was a rough gauge I use to set a preliminary order on gear Sam. Just because one item has a higher comparison number doesn't mean that the item is better when looked at as a whole and it doesn't take in to account the individual situation.<br />
<br />
Using that comparison which would you wear -<br />
Yellow Fang Earring (150 comparison points)<br />
+30 AC <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Tear of the Rainmaker (125 comparison points)<br />
+7 AC<br />
+5 Str +5 Agi +5 Dex +6 +80 HP +30 Mana<br />
vsMg +6 vsFire +6 vsCold +6 vsPos +6 vsDis<br />
<br />
Strictly going by points, the Yellow fang earring is considerably better, but realistically the Tear is the much smarter choice.</div></div><hr />

6507 hp / 1454 ac / 261 sta with only droppable<br />

I don't think we'll be seeing anyone sporting that much Farwater unless they have a serious amount of free time available.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the race is on to a 9k twink. Getting flagged I think will be instrumental, that's a lot of free HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With LDoN it will be fairly easy to get over 9k with all the augments. Before they added the PoP charm, I ran some numbers and you could get just over 9k with all droppable or 2 group encounter gear. <br />
<br />
Some upgrades from my profile:<br />
<br />
SoD -&gt; GBoS = 35hp<br />
Rubicite Girdle -&gt; Belt of Dwarf Slaying = 15hp<br />
CoF -&gt; Cloak of the Firestorm = 50hp<br />
Chokdai Pauldrons -&gt; cords, strength of elements, pauldrons of the deep flame = 45hp<br />
Earrings -&gt; 2x Iron Cog = 50hp<br />
necklace -&gt; Dozekar neck = 35hp<br />
mask -&gt; thulian visor = 15hp<br />
<br />
Total = 245hp.<br />
<br />
Multiply this by 1.165 for aa skils = 285hp<br />
<br />
This would have put me at about 9075hp. If you can max out charm (60hp is max I can get) that would be 9120. <br />
<br />
With LDoN, depending on how the augments are going to work out after the patch, I wouldn't be surprised if we can put this number over 9500. Not bad for a no raid loot!<br />

That also includes though Kizrak's Battle Armor Bp and Legs pieces of which molds will run ya around 100k to 120k each depending on server but well worth it.<br />
<br />
So once raid buffed a warrior could reach 6700 + 2400 = 9100hp.<br />
<br />
I include the PoTranquility armor quests in this because you can buy most of the pieces in the bazaar and some of them add a nice chunk of HP.<br />
<br />
And btw..remember this is if you don't have to worry about level restrictions.<br />
<br />
That 9100 hp figure does not count augments and/or adventure stone stats maxed (ie on charm).<br />
<br />
If you indeed could max out those also hmm its hard to say.  Lets look at what you could buy if you were rich in plat and yes I included some crafted cultural armor or pieces made from tradeskills.  If you have that much plat you can have most anything made for you.<br />
<br />
Arms: Kizrak's Armbands of Battle.<br />
Back: Cloak of Destruction, Cloak of Greater Pernicity<br />
Chest: Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle<br />
Ear:Iron Cog Earring, Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement, Ear Symbol of the Veteran<br />
Face: Mask of the Dragon Slayer<br />
Feet: Boots of the Storm, Mithril Boots<br />
Fingers: Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience x 2<br />
Hands: Velium Encrusted Gauntlets, Kizrak's Gauntlets of Battle<br />
Head: Helmet of Rallos Zek<br />
Legs: Kizrak's Greaves of Battle<br />
Neck: Black Plated Collar<br />
Range: Stonewood Compound Bow, Featherwood Compound Bow, Obsidianwood Compound Bow, Primordial Driftwood Compound Bow<br />
Shoulders: Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates<br />
Waist: Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
Wrist: Crystallized Acid Bracer x 2<br />

Okay now that does not include any augment's or items you can buy through LDoN whether through raids/groups there and/or purchasing with your adventure points.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

You're not going to get 6700hp unbuffed with that gear. I have almost exactly that set up with just a couple of differences. At level 63 I am sitting at 5300ish HP with ND1. When I get level 65 and the typical HP AAs, I should top at a little over 6khp unbuffed (5300 x 15% HP from other AAs = 6095hp). I don't see where you are coming up with the other 700hp.</div></div><hr />

There are just too many HP lacking slots in that list (shoulders, gaunts, face). Click on my profile below and check out the bomb non-raid profile. There is a 9k+ non raid warrior. Dozekar stuff is a pain, but even if you swapped it out for some stuff with slightly less hp, you'll still be over 9k. You can even do better than this is you get real crazy with it...dain belt, another iron cog, thulian mask. <br />

<br />
Hmm guys that 6700 is unbuffed.  I never said that a warrior could do unbuffed 9100 hp.  That warrior would be raid buffed to get 9100hp.  I SAID THAT A WARRIOR can get to 6700hp on his own given the right equipment (tradable).<br />
<br />
And what weapons you have you counted in your calculations for hp wise?<br />
<br />
I have 2 sod's which add another approximately 129hp each x 2 = 258hp.<br />
Did you add in the effects of<br />
Kizrak's BP of battle: adds another 295hp for 1 hour 30 min<br />
Kizrak's Greaves of Battle adds another 146hp for 54 min<br />
So in doing the math would be about 700 hp just from those 3.<br />
<br />
Also ND 1 is just a small part.  Ya need ND 3 to really see a difference in your HP thats worth it at all. ND 1 is only 2%, ND 2 = 5% and ND 3 is 10% so you have only barely touched the surface at 2% in training in ND.<br />
<br />
ND3 + PE + PD3 = AN ADDITIONAL 17% to your existing hp.<br />
<br />
Also look at <br />
innate stamina adds 10 sta which translates into 80hp<br />
advanced innate stamina adds 20 sta which translates into 160hp<br />
<br />
So lets look at this in a hypothetical way for a moment.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have 6k unbuffed right now.  Lets add all of this in.<br />
<br />
6000 Current unbuffed hp.<br />
480 from your finishing off your other 2 trainings in ND.<br />
240 from finishing off trainings in stamina.<br />
<br />
Right there you are at 6720.<br />
<br />
But lets look at me for a sec to make things a bit simpler.<br />
<br />
Right now with effects from bp and greaves and wielding 2 sod's I am at 5900 hp.  Lets add all the things I have yet to train in and armor pieces I can get to increase my hp even more.<br />
<br />
5900 Current HP with this setup and effects from bp and greaves.<br />
<br />
Now thats with the following equipment in slots:<br />
Arms: Kizrak's Armbands of Battle<br />
Back: Cloak of Greater Pernicity<br />
Charm: Intricate Wooden Figurine<br />
Chest: Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle<br />
Ear: Earring of Endless Speed<br />
Ear: Earring of the Solstice<br />
Face: Eyepatch of Plunder<br />
Finger: Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
Finger: Valorium Ring of Gallantry<br />
Feet: Helanic Tundra Boots<br />
Hands: Kizrak's Gauntlets of Battle <br />
Head: Kizrak's Helmet of Battle<br />
Legs: Kizrak's Greaves of Battle <br />
Neck: Helanic Tundra Collar<br />
Shoulders: Forged Shoulderpads <br />
Waist: Helanic Tundra Girdle <br />
Wrist: Helanic Tundra Bracer <br />
Wrist: Helanic Tundra Bracer <br />
Primary: Sceptre of Destruction<br />
Range: Stonewood Compound Bow<br />
Secondary: Sceptre of Destruction<br />
<br />
Now lets see how we can improve on this with AA and better items.<br />
<br />
Change to the following items for the additional hp.<br />
<br />
Bracer: Crystallized Acid Bracer adds +69 hp + 8.5 from aa skills<br />
Bracer: Crystallized Acid Bracer adds +69 hp + 8.5 from aa skills<br />
Ear: Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement adds +39 hp + 3 from aa skills<br />
Feet: Mithril Boots adds 70hp<br />
Finger: Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience adds 41hp + 4.25 from aa<br />
Finger: Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience adds 41hp + 4.25 from aa<br />
Head: Helmet of Rallos Zek adds +96hp + 6.8hp from aa skills.<br />
Neck: Black Plated Collar adds +115hp + 6 from aa skills.<br />
Shoulders: Chokidai Hide Pauldrons adds 115hp<br />
<br />
Okay now we are up to 595 + 5900 = 6495hp<br />
<br />
Now we go improve AA skills:<br />
Planar Durability 4.5% (3 trainings still need to be done) = 292hp<br />
<br />
6495hp + 292hp = 6787hp<br />
<br />
Now lets lets look at weapons for hp improvement.<br />
Primary: Blade of Carnage adds another 91hp + 8.5hp from aa skills.<br />
<br />
6787hp + 100hp = 6887hp<br />
<br />
This is without adding aa stamina trainings which would be 8 points of hp per 1 point of sta but of course stamina maxes out also just like other stats.<br />
<br />
So a warrior on his own can get 6700hp on his own with his effects on battle armor.<br />
<br />
Hope that explains it,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stamina only adds HP if you aren't capped. The gear required to get up to 6700 unbuffed is going to cap or take you near it. <br />
<br />
Shield of the Arcace does not stack with Focus. If you want your 295 hp from shield, then you are going to need 6900hp to reach your numbers because you are going to be losing the 210hp from focus.<br />
<br />
Last, your number of HP added from those items are all skewed because you are counting in sta. Sta is non-linear so you can't even generalize it like that, and it caps at 305. <br />
<br />
<br />
Please actually check out the link I have provided and check out the bomb non-raid profile. It shows a war with all the aa's and a gear set up necessary to reach the numbers you speak of. Heck, you can just check out my real profile where I have all the items in your proposed upgrade, and it only puts me at 6350. This is with max hp aa's. I can already get over 6700 self buffed, but I am only at 8800 fully buffed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to go back and read the posts again and look at some real magelo's TheGiantOne. Several of us already have the gear you are talking about and not a single one is at 6700hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Kizrak's BP of battle: adds another 295hp for 1 hour 30 min<br />
Kizrak's Greaves of Battle adds another 146hp for 54 min First of all, these are buffs. If you count these in your HP total, then you are talking about self-buffed HP, which is not the same as unbuffed HP. Like Fynepisa pointed out, you can use these buffs if you like, but you lose more in the long run because these buffs don't stack with shammy buffs, which are vastly superior.<br />
<br />
Also, with the gear you have listed, you will easily be at max STA so you can remove any STA HP you are counting on. You can waste points on innate and advance innate stamina, the only thing those are good for is bringing up your naked HP. Once you put on your gear and go over the cap, all of these AAs are wasted.<br />
<br />
Also ND 1 is just a small part. Ya need ND 3 to really see a difference in your HP thats worth it at all. ND 1 is only 2%, ND 2 = 5% and ND 3 is 10% so you have only barely touched the surface at 2% in training in ND.<br />
<br />
ND3 + PE + PD3 = AN ADDITIONAL 17% to your existing hp. I am aware of that. You will notice that I specifically calculated what my HP will be with the additional 15% HP I will get when I get the AAs. You will also notice that that number is considerably less than 6700hp.<br />
<br />
A warrior CAN get 6700hp with less than raid level gear, but you can't do it on tradeable gear alone. You will have to fill in some spots with better NO DROP items or get some HP augments to get to 6700 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
In order to get to 6700hp unbuffed, you have to have somewhere in the neighborhood of +1900 in RAW HP from gear/augments AND maxed STA at 305 to go with all of the HP AAs. The gear you have listed will not accomplish that. Make a magelo with that gear and all the AAs you want. You should end up somewhere in the 6k-6300hp range depending on which items you use.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't belt of raging nature and even a heiro cloak eek out a bit more HPs than the rubi girdle/CoF combo?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mighty Twink! (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=655464&amp;alt=133653) <br />
<br />
I added all the sta aa's to my profile and it put my sta at 300 and hp w/o the charm at  6569.....add in 2400 and thats only 8969...granted you still have 5 sta to add but doubt you'll break 9k....if you throw in a charm then you might just do it....<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not an EQ equipment expert and i'm just playing around...but this was best i could get.<br />
<br />
edit: oh yeah 2 things....my profile does have a charm in it...the above number are me subtracting the 40hp from it....however i didn't factor in the 6sta from it so even my numbers are still off because of the extra 6 sta from the charm<br />
<br />
 i also think you could break 9k with droppable gear...however unbuffed hp would be lower...substituting higher hp gear and lower sta gear would prolly do it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that is better. There are a lot of places I could squeeze a little more hp, but I try to upgrade long term. In the end I'm thinking I'll have either the 90hp haste cloak from the hard LDoN adventures or stop being lazy and farm dozekar for his 100hp haste cloak. Either of those will make the girdle better than the belt of raging nature. I also took a couple months off, but kept buying stuff while Iwasn't play and ran out of plat. LDoN hasn't very good for making money since I've been back :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, how do you guys earn your plat? It seems people want to stick to purely droppable equipment. I kind of assumed certain easy to obtain No drop stuff would be ok since it can be done by 1-2 groups. How are you guys earning the plat to buy a full suit of farwater, a SoD, and a BoC? If you are actually farming some of this stuff yourself then there is no reason you can't kill the mobs like Eindride and Dozekar with that same group you are farming the elementals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I make my plats from all over the place. I am a tradeskill junky so all but Smithing are 218+ with most over 240. It's pretty easy to make plats every time new trade skill items come out if you don't have to spend a fortune skilling up.<br />
<br />
I also make a fair amount farming small raid targets. BoT towers are good for getting BPs and runes to make spells people pay a pretty plat for.<br />
<br />
I think the majority of my plats come from playing the bazaar trading game. I watch for deals all the time, they are out there if you pay attention and know the market. I usually pick up anywhere from 5 to 10 items a week that I buy strickly to turn a profit. I usually don't bother unless I can make 5k or more selling a little under the market so I don't end up with plats tied up in gear I am not using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay okay..<br />
<br />
I will subtract the hp about 30 sta worth which you would say goes over the maxed cap but still after that is still 6700 but I won't quibble.  And yes I meant self buffed (what hp a warrior could get to by himself)  After all,  the effects on greaves and bp are part of the hp setup once you have them.<br />
<br />
Also remember levels do play a factor in determining hp so those of you who are commenting on how you can only reach a certain amount of hp at 64 or lower this would be the reason why.  1 reason being a 64 or lower warrior will receive less hp per point of sta than a 65.<br />
<br />
Those of you who are posting who are 65 I don't know what to say except please remember that I am counting in charm and my 2 weapons for hp also and my 2 major self buffs from greaves and bp.  Just from those would be 787hp.<br />
<br />
So no more debating LOL.  If you count those things into the factors a warrior can reach 6700hp SELF BUFFED.<br />
<br />
In response to how we get these items outside of being in a uber guild its simple.  Start tradeskilling and get 4 GM's in 4 trades and make and sell uber type items using profit from first skill to finally get to 4th one and then all the profit you can buy what you want but expect to put in time over at least a 3 month period which I did those skills.  Started out with Fletching one of the hardest trades and made the uber bows, then used the plat from that to finance getting GM in smithing, etc etc.<br />
<br />
To keep it simple when I get those items in next month will post a magelo then if needed.<br />
<br />
Anyway as a previous poster put it the subject doesn't matter with all the hp augments you can add to various pieces of armor even with stats maxed out you can get a large amount of hp added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, that makes me feel better. I make my money farming small targets and buying and selling in the bazaar as well. It would seem to me this and tradeskills are really the only lefitimate ways to make massive amounts of plat without turning to ebay type stuff which imo makes it pretty reasonable to include stuff like BoT tower equip at &quot;twink&quot; level for someone who has amassed millions of plat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, 6700 self buffed is definately more than possible. I am currently at 6750 self buffed now without buying any LDoN armor/augs thanks to charm augment and some 12hp dropped augments. I guess it was just a miscommunication since the discussion had turned toward breaking 9k fully buffed which is around 6700 unbuffed as opposed to self buffed.<br />
<br />
As for the scalecracker. There are a lot of cool things from CT and possibly elsewhere that could be upgrades, but I think lack of availability is why they get overlooked. I've never seen a scalecracker for sale myself. There gets to a point where getting the items isn't about being able to afford them, but being able to find them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does no one ever mention Scalecracker? Like Fynepisa said, part of the fine art of twinking is the availability of the item. In order to get a Scalecracker, someone has to farm the Ring of Fear enough that everyone who wants one, gets one so they can filter down to the bazaar. It would be pretty hard to justify dragging the guild down to do the RoF for twink.<br />
<br />
Also remember levels do play a factor in determining hp so those of you who are commenting on how you can only reach a certain amount of hp at 64 or lower this would be the reason why. 1 reason being a 64 or lower warrior will receive less hp per point of sta than a 65. I think everyone here knows that. That's why people talk about HP in absolute terms - level 65 with all the AAs for comparison, which is why it was suggested that you look at Fynepisa's magelo since he already has 65+AA and the gear you mentioned.<br />
<br />
When discussing HP there are 2 points of comparison, unbuffed and fully buffed. There are too many variables to even bother considering anything else. Really, fully buffed should be the only measure since that is what really matters, but its easier to compare magelos so people often talk about unbuffed as well.</div></div><hr />
