VERY deep red/grey. It looks pretty nice if you ask me... all except my bracers, which are a bright red, makes me very easy to see... just a flash of red light smacking the mobs. Helps for targeting on raids too.... as if being pretty much the only Vah Shir there doesn't help....</div></div><hr />

I liked that enough that I died some of my other pieces to match, though I left the Myrmidon's armor at its medium tan color, and the boots have a leather look that mostly fits. So, Shaemus is basically light brown/brushed gold in color.</div></div><hr />

Been too lazy to dye Kiya's armor.  My cleric, however, looks like she walked into a paint factory explosion.  Purple legs/arms, blue bp, gold boots/bracers, and non graphic thurg helm.  She'd previously been all purple and before that, mostly sea blue.  Now I'm pondering making her armor all mist grey or black. =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is how I had my armor dyed sence day one of LoY I had it all planned out before release. <br />
<br />
I undyed it this week due to the fact that WAY to many people where copying off me and it didnt have the same effect. When people copy off you tell you they didnt copy off you and then later tell you they did, frustrates you. When your a lvl 65 and other 65's are coping off you and try to say I didnt even know yours was dyed like that frustrates you.<br />
<br />
So that was my dye job, Now im back to the non-dyed job due to a few people on drinal ... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I've seen a few people dyed like that on Terris, Kiros.

<br />
also, since dye removed the cool factor from having identifyable gear, we prefer (hubb sham and i) to leave it natural and show our gear for what it really is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our whole guild decide to do the same color scheme (or as close to it as everyone can get).  It turned into a much bigger pain in the arse then it should have been.  First off they wouldn't take my sugestion of here (http://www.members.cox.net/nothinghere/ugly2.JPG) and instead decided on something difrent.  is a pick of a cleric, as the dwarf still ain't tht good looking.Here (http://www.members.cox.net/nothinghere/woodelf.JPG)<br />
<br />
I have to say the silver and blue look nice even though the non plate and chain peices sometimes run into trouble.  Especially the caster robes, they realy have a hard time.  But then again, its better then the black and or red suits that 99% of the players have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First dye - all the crafted blue color - I shouldnt have changed that. It was truely great.<br />
<br />
Second - tried to get the gold like the cleric armor and black but failed to get the desired effect - I wound up looking like a bubblebee.<br />
<br />
Third - on the suggestion of about 100 people, I dyed everything but the pants green and dyed the pants purple. This creates a &quot;the hulk&quot; look for ogres - although some say its like Barney (Barney is purple with green pants).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I always claimed to be the First Bard of Halas (well except I'm too big and mean to really be a bard), so I went with a Lambent look on the legs, BP and vambrances. Went white/silver on the boots, helm, bracers and gauntlets.  I wanted a little contrast and I just hated that the day dyes came out 90% of the server dyed themselves monotone black...<br />
<br />
its pretty funny that most of the warriors in my guild went some shade of blue, from lambent to cobalt :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">is getting components to dye armor something that you can only do at high lvl?  could I die my armor slots at 33 solo?  and if so how do I know what I need for what color?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the components for dye are sold in the lighthouse in Gulf of Gunthak, so all you need is Legacy of Ykesha. But, you'll also need to have some pottery and brewing/alchemy to make the dye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No dye here yet, its fun to go to the dye page and see what you would look like in full bronze, indicolate or cobalt tho.<br />
<br />
Im kinda tempted to dye all my SS bits warlords colour cos I dont like the brown but dont think I could handle walking round looking like Im wearing something that I'm not.<br />
<br />
As for the clown dye jobs being a half elf warrior is about looking good not looking bad, so those are all out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went a little old school, and dyed my armor the color of Indioclite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All black.  On my server only one person went the all black route that I ran into (and it was after i dyed it).  <br />
<br />
I really like the fast that I cannot be judged on sight.  I also really like the Black Knight aspect of it since I always liked reading Ivanhoe.  <br />
<br />
If all of a sudden I start seeing a lot of level 30 Black newb warriors on my server I'm gonna puke tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutalliss</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hated dye like nothing else but last night I finally went soft and dyed my armor.<br />
<br />
Went for red glow gloves, yellowish/golden BP and rest is darkish grey. <br />
<br />
I fiddled around with the colors for a long time, I wanted to give my armor some sort of worn metal faded long, however that proved to be difficult.<br />
<br />
I might eventually dye my armor in some hystirical colors just so people can spot me better on a raid.<br />
<br />
F dyes!</div></div><hr />

Now I look like a red white and blue freak. Helm and arms blue (Warlord's), legs, bracers, boots are red (Brellium), and BP and gloves are silver (Thurg/Tmax gloves). I wasn't going to buy LoY, but after getting a look at my new armor I think I will invest the 10 or 20 bucks and at least look like a proper warrior.</div></div><hr />
