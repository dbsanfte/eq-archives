<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Savidlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to do the scale conversion quest. All I need is the jagged permafrost shard off the The chilling terror. I've had a friends ranger parked in perma for weeks now to check tracking. I've also gone down with a few friends and cleared the whole pit area sevral times.<br />
<br />
My question is does this mob have a PH? Do I just need to live down there one weekend killing everything that moves. Or can I just keep checking track. And  I do have the ranger deep enough that he can track the Ice Witch and bears. From what I've read terror spawns near the Ice Witch.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnawbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe we were just lucky, but he was generally up whenever we'd zone in to check (3 of 4 times or so, usually just checking before or after an EF LDON).<br />
<br />
Didn't bother heading down to him if he wasn't up, so I don't know about a PH. He only spawns in one spot though; he's always been just out of aggro range when dropping down in the middle of the pit, so clearing all of the pit is pointless IMO.<br />
<br />
Bring lots of group healing and burst dps, his AoE and melee damage make Kunark dragons look like pansies (though his hps and regen blow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Midnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, when you jump down that middle pit he'll be behind you just out of agro range. I've never got him to actually spawn, and I camped there for a few solid hours. I had to get him after a patch. <br />
<br />
It seems from what I heard, he'll pop at that spot after a patch. I logged in after a patch and headed down there. There wasn't anything spawned in his spot and I believe it took about 13 minutes after everything else down there spawn, then lo and behold, it appeared.<br />
<br />
Good luck on that battle. Was one of the strangest I have ever fought in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We cleared the bottom and the 2 at the top of the ladder until he spawned. Not really sure what ones were the PH's though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a quick update, finally got the jagged permafrost shard after the third attempt on him ... don't expect to get it off the first kill. He is easy enough for a group of 5 65's with no issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Savidlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Finaly found him up yesterday and got my shard on the first try. Just because it was early and lots of folks were bored I had 9 folks. Was definatly a fun little fight. some how in my prep research I missed that he has a nasty spin-stun. Almost lost a druid we had with us when I was spinning so bad I couldn't taunt. But then what's one less treehugger :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ZamokGrimblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, does it spawn only after a patch or is it timed or ph'ed or what? And you say one group of 65's can do him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tanok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure on PH, but I got him to 30% with myself (warrior), pre elemental gear, and a druid of the same gearing.  So, logged in a cleric, rezzed up, and engaged with 3, no kei or haste or anything, and destroyed him.  Definately 2someable with decent gear, just put a heal over time on yourself so you don't lose the healer if he stuns you early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We used a group of 65's but should be able to do with less as long as the healer doesn't get aggro while the tank is stunned. I'm not positive on the PH, we wiped out the zone I think 3 times before he finaly spawned, I think his PH's were on the lower level though or the 2 at the top of the ladder.</div></div><hr />
