<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering, did anyone figure out some kind of formula for taunt that would tell you the chance of failing? What does the chance of taunt working depend on anyway? If it's supposed to put you on top of the aggro list, it definetely has no chance to work when the other person has far more aggro than you, and it sometimes fails just because you didn't have that much aggro the spell landed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if &lt;warrior really needs taunt to work this time&gt; then <br />
     FAIL<br />
else<br />
     SUCCEED<br />
end if<br />

You forgot part of the logic statement...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what I can tell, it depends on your taunt skill &amp; the relative level of the mob to your level (I'd bet there is a zone modifier, also.  eg. taunt worked for shit in early CT &amp; PoV).  It would be pretty hard to figure your success ratio even with you taunt skill maxed &amp; vs only blue con mobs since you don't get a success/failure message, and therefore don't know for sure if it was your taunt or some other factor that got you agro.  Your best bet is to check it against talking mobs, &quot;You will not evade me, soandso!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's some pretty funny code, btw.  Sad but true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with CT was that it followed old world taunt rules, ie you could not taunt a mob that was higher than level 51, period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I ran some tests back in Luclin...  but since this was prior to the taunt skill increase, they're dated now.   *KNOWING THAT THEY ARE DATED* here's the results.<br />
<br />
(Disclaimer:  I was really angry when I posted this, so there's some fairly colorful language, but I took out the *most* colorful parts).<br />
<br />
How does one test the effectiveness of taunt? <br />
<br />
In order to do it, one must attempt taunt over a decent period of time, and have a mechanism which allows you to see if it's successful or not. In many areas, a successful taunt is verified by the following message:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll teach you to interfere with me Target&quot;<br />
<br />
If your taunt fails, no message, if successful, message.<br />
<br />
So, logging a couple of hours fighting against mobs who give this message can give you a reasonable gauge of how well the Taunt skill works. <br />
<br />
In light of VI's exp revamp, this is an important thing, because a warrior in a group needs to be performing their function against even con mobs if they're to contribute to justify their group spot.<br />
<br />
Today, I ran those tests, and was shocked at the results.<br />
<br />
I hunted in the Shik`Nar caves of Fungus Grove, in the royal area. This would allow me to test a variety of different level mobs to gauge the effectiveness of Taunt.<br />

Based on this data, I can confirm and definitively say without question, Warrior Taunt is fucked up beyond comprehension. I don't mind it working 30ish percent of the time vs. level 60+ mobs, but EIGHT GOD DAMN PERCENT is simply wrong.<br />
<br />
AGAIN!   THIS IS DATED AND NEW TESTS WOULD NEED TO BE RUN.... DO NOT CONSTRUE THIS INFORMATION AS BEING WORTH ANYTHING OTHER THAN HISTORICAL INFORMATION AT THIS TIME AND IF YOU DO REFERENCE THIS WITHOUT MAKING THE DISCLAIMER I WILL CALL YOU ON IT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1 in 6 sounds about right for pre-PoP.  Since PoP I'd say it's about 1 in 3 but I've never parsed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have always loved the successful taunt = smacktalk from mobs like in PoFear, Hate, and Sky. It is good code to see if someone is being a goob and taunting while they are not MT/SA. I wish it was implemented more in higher lvl areas just so we would be able to establish a pattern, but I am willing to bet that is why it is not coded.</div></div><hr />
