<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other day, when I was pulling with a (non-proccing) bow during an LDoN adventure, my primary-hand weapon proc (SotB) procced on a bow shot while the mob was a good 50 feet away from me, and I did not have auto-attack turned on.  <br />
<br />
I have also, in the past, proc'd my offhand weapon in a combat round in which no offhand swing occurred (Dual Wield check failed), this verified with all filters turned off so that I could see any misses that might have been failed offhand swings.<br />
<br />
Thus, it is at least possible to proc a primary-hand proc from a bow shot, and an offhand proc from a primary-hand melee swing.<br />
<br />
At the next opportunity, I intend to grab a large supply of arrows and head down to the archery target in Warslik's Woods to determine whether it's possible to proc an offhand proc from a bow shot, and whether the proc rate for melee procs appears to be the same with archery as with meleeing (i.e. approximately 2 per minute).<br />
<br />
This leaves me with a couple of questions, that I'm hoping you can all help me to answer.<br />
<br />
1) can anyone think of a way to determine whether it's possible to proc a primary-weapon proc from an offhand-weapon swing?  As far as I know, it's not possible to have a combat round with no primary-weapon swing but with an offhand-weapon swing, so I can't think of any way to test this hypothesis.  OTOH, the answer isn't that big of an issue, so...<br />
<br />
2) Is it possible to proc a bow proc from a melee-weapon swing?<br />
<br />
3) If so, does the bow proc proc at the same rate for melee-weapon swings as for archery shots?<br />
<br />
4) Finally, if all of the above are true, it seems to me that the Obsidianwood Compound Bow (Flame Shock, 110 DD) is preferable for a warrior to the Stonewood Compound Bow (Aura of Battle, i.e. Vengeance II and regen).  Specifically, 110 DD twice per minute is 220/60 or 3.6 additional DPS, while the 1% additional DPS from the Vengeance II is likely to be only about 1 to 1.2 additional DPS.  When you add in the aggro advantage of procs, the Obsidianwood Compound Bow starts looking really optimal.<br />
<br />
So.  Can someone help me answer the above questions?  If someone would be willing to email me (mickey_phoenix @ hotmail.com) the location of a blue-to-65 mob that I can safely pound on the back of without having it aggro on me, I'll run the tests on proccing bow procs with melee weapons myself.  But lacking such a mob, I can't easily experiment on this.<br />
<br />
And...assuming that the above speculations are correct (you can prod a bow proc from a melee swing, and the rate is the same as normal procs), do you agree with my analysis that the Obsidianwood Compound Bow is a better ranged-slot item for a warrior than the Stonewood Compound Bow? (assuming that STR and STA are already maxed, which at least for Ogres like myself is quite trivial).<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />

P.S. Note that if all of the above holds true, it's also quite advisable to augment one's bow with a nice high-DPS (Rujark 150 poison DD) or high-taunt (Mir Anger III) augment, thus giving one six total procs (dual-wielding) or four total procs (using 2hb).  Note also that while adding two more procs to a high-end dual wield MT setup is not all that powerful (at best, with Anger III, it's approximately a 25% increase in proc-based hate, and only a 50% increase in proc frequency), it's much more significant if you're dealing with a BoW with Anger III aug (52% increase in proc-based hate, and 100% increase in proc frequency).  Which seems to be the preferred high-end tank gear in any case.</div></div><hr />

Ceremonial wedding sword from ToFS, any geerlock item, etc will work for your experiment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, but only if you can find a no-combat primary-hand item that can accept a proc; and even then, I wouldn't be convinced that a no-combat item with a proc would be a reliable stand-in and function according to the same code as a combat item with a proc.<br />
<br />
So a failure of the primary-hand proc to proc from offhand swings would not conclusively prove that it could not happen.  On the other hand, observing a primary-hand proc from, for example, the Ceremonial Wedding Sword would be relatively conclusive evidence that an offhand swing could trigger a primary-hand proc.<br />
<br />
Great suggestion, by the way!<br />

P.S. The Ceremonial Wedding Sword has a Type 1 aug slot; various other non-weapon primary-handers I looked at have Type 7 aug slots.  In order to test this, I suspect we'll need a time-capable melee class with a non-weapon primary-hand item that drops in PoTime (and thus has a Type 8 aug slot), who's willing to spend points for a Type 8 proc augment.  Any volunteers to verify this utterly academic point for us?  :-)</div></div><hr />

killed a willowisp with a light stone one day when i was bored. well till it ran and i coudn't repost it anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a class in EQ called rangers, and they use bows and arrows alot.  They also often have primary and secondary weapons with procs.  Don't you think they have hundreds of thousands of collective hours logged testing this theory?  The only comment I ever heard from a ranger about archery procs is that they are quite rare (and that's for procs on the bow heh).<br />

It's not.  Something else happened, I've never heard and never seen anyone proc their offhand when they weren't swinging it.   I'm not doubting what you think you saw, I'm just saying there is probably another explanation for it.<br />
<br />
2) Is it possible to proc a bow proc from a melee-weapon swing? <br />
<br />
No, I've had a proccing bow since like level 30 (well, it wasn't proccing that early, but i've had it).  It doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
3) If so, does the bow proc proc at the same rate for melee-weapon swings as for archery shots? <br />
<br />
I don't have any parses, but Bows don't proc much at all.  I've blown thru a couple hundred arrows in a day before and failed to see my various bows proc.  This includes the Bow of the Huntsman when I was using it, Nightmarewood, and now the Featherwood that I currently use.  If I see one a nite, I'm shocked.<br />
<br />
Finally, if all of the above are true, it seems to me that the Obsidianwood Compound Bow (Flame Shock, 110 DD) is preferable for a warrior to the Stonewood Compound Bow (Aura of Battle, i.e. Vengeance II and regen).

When you add in the aggro advantage of procs, the Obsidianwood Compound Bow starts looking really optimal. <br />
<br />
All of the above isn't true, so naturally this makes this false.  An Obsidianwood will have zero effect on your MELEE dps.  A Stonewood will have an effect however, thru the increased ATK rating. <br />
<br />
Basically you didn't see what you think you did, or you're just not interpreting what you saw correctly.  Your weapons don't proc on bow shots, and vice versa</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, it is possible to proc and not swing with any weapon, either primary or secondary, as long as the proc is a dd.  The circumstances are wierd for this to happen, you have to kill the mob with just the damage from the proc.  If you want to test this yourself, get a DD proc weapon and run around in EC attacking decaying skeletons. Eventually you will kill one with a proc, but not actually swing your weapon, although you will still have to turn attack on. It's happened to me a number of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's because the proc comes before the swing.  You still swing the weapon, just that no damage registers because the mob is already dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actuall you don't swing, it never said &quot;You hit&quot; or &quot;You try to hit, but miss&quot;, and there is no animation either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Thus, it is at least possible to proc a primary-hand proc from a bow shot, and an offhand proc from a primary-hand melee swing.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the circumstances were, or what other things were going on, but you don't proc your melee weapons while using a bow.  If that did happen, rangers would have picked up on it a long, long time ago.<br />
<br />
But, just to double check, I just went through a 9 hour log I have using only archery, and for over 7,000 shots, there were no procs from my mainhand weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i remember one day i was standing around in Sro waiting for an adventure and i attacked some random mob that was walking by. i never actaully swong any of my weapons, and i'm not totally sure if i missed or not since i keep my misses off, but i killed the mob with only my offhand DD proc (GBoS).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good, now that we have a few more people saying it, it's easy to see what the deal is.  It's all in the order that text is displayed.  When you riposte a mob, you see your hit, and then you see that the mob tries to hit you, but you riposte.  When you flurry, you see your extra hits, and then you see &quot;You Unlease a flurry of attacks.&quot;  When you proc weapons, the spell damage comes before the melee hit.  If the spell kills the mob, then obviously the swing will never come since you don't do damage to a corpse. <br />
<br />
It's not that you don't swing, it's that the mob is dead by the time your swing message would have come up, it's all in the order that messages are displayed.</div></div><hr />
