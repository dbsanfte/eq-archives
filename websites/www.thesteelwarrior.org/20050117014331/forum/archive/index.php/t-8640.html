<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll try to explain my situation as best I can.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm using a BBotE and BoC combo and am looking for a slightly better set up. My guild recently broke into EP's and just started the rings in PoE(did our first 2 today). The way I see it I have 4 possible options to pick from: <br />
<br />
a) hold out for a BoW when we backflag RZ, <br />
b) try to snag a SEWS in the mud ring, <br />
c) or get a Bloodfrenzy when we farm cursed.<br />
d) don't bother and upgrade other equipment<br />
<br />
I'm currently sitting at 3rd in the dkp for warriors in my guild, and the 2 ahead of me already have Bloodfrenzy/BoC combo so I'm hoping they wouldn't bid on either a BoW or SEWS.<br />
<br />
I realise that pooling dkp in hopes of a BoW is probably a waste of time, but longivity of a BoW will probably be greater than any option I have atm.<br />
<br />
SEWS seems like the &quot;poorman's&quot; BoW. From what i hear they are fairly common and are a decent tanking 2hander.<br />
<br />
A Bloodfrenzy is probably the easiest for me to get, considering my guild raids cursed quite frequently. While BF/BoC is a very good tanking combo I'm worried about the dreaded EP ripostes. I'm currently running around 8.6k hp 1500ac raid buffed (about 8.2k hp 1475ac group buffed) and have concerns about tanking effectively with dual wield in EP's.<br />
<br />
I could try to make up for my lack of hp/ac by using my dkp to beef up my stats, but this might take awhile.<br />
<br />
Advice on which setup to use would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if you have any alternate setups or suggestions that would be great.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that im not flagged the way you or many posters on this board are, so you may get different opinions. As far as agro goes, that has been a very solid combo for me. I would definately like a BF or BoW, but would rather have some Raex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, as someone who owned SEWS and Bloodfrenzy, I would tell you that SEWS augmented with Anger III will easily carry you through the rest of PoP.  So will a Bloodfrenzy and any decent offhander.  Ripostes in PoP got tuned down ages ago, its not that big an issue.<br />
<br />
SEWS is not a common drop btw.  My guild spent 6 months in the elementals, we farmed Earth A rings relentlessly, we saw three SEWS during that run.  <br />
<br />
All things (such as availability) being equal, I would rate your options thus:<br />
<br />
1. BoW<br />
2. SEWS<br />
3. Bloodfrenzy</div></div><hr />
