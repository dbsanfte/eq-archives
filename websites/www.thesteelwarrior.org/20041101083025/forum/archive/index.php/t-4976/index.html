<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Magelo at left.  I am non-guilded, non-raiding, and have about 35K in the bank.  Lots of stuff could be upgraded - just wondering where I can get the most bang for my buck. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahael Gibran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well you could upgrade your range with a decent bow like darkwood bow of suffering and also get fierce heraldic for your face and shoulders and arms, that about it, maybe upgrade your hurricane plate bracer with fierce heralidc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One problem, Kahael, Xene's a dwarf and dwarves cannot worship Rallos.  That pretty much rules out RZ cultural armor. :p <br />
<br />
I'd suggest upgrading your arms, as they look like your weakest slot, currently.  Brellium, or the veksar vambraces. (name escapes me, at the moment)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your gear selection looks pretty good, except for the arms.  I'd be looking for something with stats, such as the arms from the Everfrost or North Ro adv merchants. <br />
<br />
Surprised you put 2 points into Regen, and not Run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks all for the replies. <br />
<br />
I've upgraded my arms to Feartouched Rubicite, though I can't seem to get Magelo to reflect the change.   I also now have a Nightmarewood bow but still looking for something better. <br />
<br />
I'm not only a Dwarf, but agnostic as well.  The pieces of Brellium that I have were very hard to come by. <br />
<br />
Surprised you put 2 points into Regen, and not Run. <br />
Yeah.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  I'm putting my points in run now - just need one more.</div></div><hr />
