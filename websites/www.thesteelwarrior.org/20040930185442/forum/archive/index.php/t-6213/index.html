<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The one highest-tier thing I've soloed is one of the black worms in Valor.  Lead with Truncheon of Doom and then swap to GSo4W for DPS.<br />
<br />
When I feel like soloing, I can solo my way all around the new Droga.  I lead with Truncheon of Doom and then follow with Anklesmasher (usually with Prismatic in off-hand) and then with GSo4W.<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity makes it a lot better since I get the important procs in quicker and can thus switch to DPS sooner.  The 10th Coldain ring is also very useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i soloed one of the freeport gate guards.  slow wouldnt land and i had to use all 3 of the discs with mighty strike saving the day.  i recommend that fight if you are kos to the freeport guards.  i ruined my faction 4 years ago and had to run through those guys every time i wanted to hit the freeport bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All of the freeport militia (in WFP) at the same time, including Sir Lucan and Brother Jentry, minus the 2 gate guards.<br />

furious, rampage with earthshaker!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think Lucan is the toughest I have ever solo'd.  I hate the corrupt freeport guards</div></div><hr />

<br />
dispell pots , 300+ Cr , and decent equipment <br />
<br />
the 300hp 10charge heal pots help too , and a crazy ds.. dont slow ,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Single Akheva mobs or 2 if they are patrollers. <br />
Ran into some Giant in EW just off of GD also that was probably the toughest without having slow. Without AA's there would of been no way I could of survived. Light blu and could only get him 5-10% less health than me for the duration of the fight even with defensive and I think using precision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">funniest one was that big fat bear in GD in the cave. took ~ an hour or so to burn his hit points down ( something-tooth? ).<br />
<br />
hardest was the named sarnak in Chardok that drops the mage dagger, i keep thinking Pizz'Tak but i'm sure that's not him. that was with 6 other sarnaks+dogs beating on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brolie Paragus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">your thinkin bloodmaw anyhow<br />
<br />
<br />
soloed that insnae regening kromriff recruiter before <br />
gonna try cazel some time too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gore and Talindor are rather easy to solo as a war with ep/time gear nowadays, disc chaining made it all possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hardest thing i have soloed would have to be... an Elite in SSRA.. Couldn't slow them with ToD,so i switched Tormax Axe, Hit Furious, after that hit agressive, then mightystrike.. Was only level 64 at the time though. I think i got down to 5ish% before he died. And All i got was a gay Dagger =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Not terribly tough, but Yeldema was fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">When I can't find a group, I run into PoI and solo for a while.  Mobs hit weak, you normally only get one or two at a time.  I can usually kill about 6 mobs before needing to use Healing Will and bandaging for about 2 minutes and then go again until I need to do it again.  The best thing is the level 50ish clerics at zone in who will normally throw me a CH when they see me bandaging.<br />
<br />
Good use of disciplines goes a long way here.<br />
<br />
As far as an individual mob:  I soloed a trash mob in Plane of Fire by myself and had 32 hps left when the mob died.  It wasn't soloing, it was stupidity!</div></div><hr />

230ish hp left, all disciplines down, self buffed. I like my new bag.</div></div><hr />

Edit: I don't think the wraith was up that day either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">general in kith, going to try and solo the dude in high pass for the rogue high elf, but he may be a little shady.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I can see soloing some of the dragons in WW, I should try that, would be fun. PoI is fun to solo, I can only go 1-2 mobs at a time before I need to bw and heal up. But how the hell did you solo the general???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Priest of Discord in Neriak, or Efreeti in SolB.<br />
Kinda a toss up.<br />
<br />
Dont have much specialized soloing gear, I just throw AA's at the mobs</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would be amazed at the damage you can do with furious + plankton to an old world quad mob.  Plus if you wait until you hit zerk you add about 20% onto that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Cazel in oasis.   It was very close--I had like 20 hp left and I had all raid buffs including haste when I started.</div></div><hr />

Cazel in oasis. It was very close--I had like 20 hp left and I had all raid buffs including haste when I started.<br />
<br />
Err Cazel's like, umm, a PUSSYCAT! Found him up on the way to an LDoN the other day and smacked him about. Took 2 mins tops to solo him and I was still around 75% health. His regen is nothing special these days.<br />
<br />
I was going to try to solo Gorenaire - and felt confident I would win - until I realised they had nerfed the 300pt heal potions I was planning on using. <br />
<br />
An amusing solo... a Qua in VT. Was a massive pull of 12 or 15 mobs and I quietly pulled it off to one side and beat it down without any assistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>holodmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Priest of Discord! toe on toe, not that hard since he casts alot ... tries to comp heal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Solo'd a VT mob interesting how long it take you like 45 minutes because that stuff has entirely to many HP to solo without help I would think.</div></div><hr />
