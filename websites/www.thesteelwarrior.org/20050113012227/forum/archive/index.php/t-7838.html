<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I donno, but it seems to me that given the fact that many of the events in the game these days require several hours to work though, it's not unreasonable for people to expect a little more than a few minutes warning that the system is coming down, even if it's to fix stuff.<br />
<br />
Barring a server crash I can't but believe that SoE could give a least a hours notice so that people could make informed decisions as to whether or not they want to continue a particular event or even start it.  It must be frustrating as hell to have a 3 hour trial, work your way through 2 hours of it to find that the server is unexpectedly coming down in ten minutes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was posted on their web page that it was going down quite awhile before it went down.  We knew it was going down mid yesterday at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, the web page doesn't cut it.  Most players don't even know SoE has a web page, let alone browse it regularly.  The information needs to be provided at log in or in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, Glatius. If they know in advance, it should be a one time pop up when you log in before the patch. There's no excuse for it, just replace one of the stupid &quot;buy expansion X now!&quot; ads.</div></div><hr />
