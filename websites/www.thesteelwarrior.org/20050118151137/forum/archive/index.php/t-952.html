<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steelhawk</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello fellow warriors, I was wondering if I could get some suggestions on items that I could get that would cheap upgrades for me, only have about 5k to spend atm (too many dang alts lol).  Well anyways I just need the gold tipped boar horn and the no drop item from PoI to get the greater cloak of Pernicity.  My equipment is in my profile if I got it working right lol, but I haven't added my base ac and atk, which I will do when I get a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things jump out from your profile.<br />
<br />
First of all, you have far better gear than I did at 53.  Grats on that.<br />
<br />
With only 5K to spend, there won't be a lot that you can do.<br />
<br />
I suspect that everyone will have their own idea of what is the &quot;first&quot; thing that you should get.  A lot of it depends on what your usual role is, what kinds of mobs you are fighting, that sort of thing.  <br />
<br />
In your place, the first thing I might upgrade is the head piece.  I snagged a helm of Raldukan for 4K, that would be a major upgrade for you, but it seems to go for a little more than that, usually.  <br />
<br />
I think the sectoid scale bracer has to go.  I'd get a silver chitin wristband there.  That should run you around 4K.<br />
<br />
Or you could get imbued granite spaulders for the shoulders.  20AC, 10 to all saves.  The downside to these is the weight (and no HPs or other stats), but the resists can't be beat on the shoulders.  Whether you need resists depends on the kinds of mobs you are facing.<br />
<br />
I'd go for a better ratio weapon in the offhand, too.  Something like a longsword of freedom.  If you are MT a lot, then something like a snowchipper or a spiked velium mallet.  Each of those weaps would be in your price range, depending on your server's economy.<br />
<br />
Another nice upgrade would be earrings.  The earring of the solstice kit is around 5K on my server, as is the electrified earring of tempests.  <br />
<br />
There's probably some deity stuff that can be smithed for you that would be a major upgrade, but I'm not an expert on the deity armors.  <br />
<br />
I notice you don't seem to have any no drop stuff.  Are you not in a raiding guild?  In not too long, your droppable upgrades will become very expensive, and the best way to upgrade will be through raiding and winning the rights to no drop items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steelhawk</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a family guild that is just starting to raid (done Kael a couple times but only have seen caster gloves), and usually I hunt in PoI or PoN and recently velks.  I am usually MT in velks and MT only half the times in the planes.  <br />
<br />
As for the diety stuff no one makes Rodcet armor on Terris, that I know of anyways, and the people now selling the rigid steelweave stuff aren't selling any piece for under 6 or 7k.  Fine Heraldic is also rare to find.  <br />
<br />
I'll start looking into the earring of the solstice kit, and the helm of Raldukan usually is more then 5k also, dang TT prices lol.  As for the SCWB we have been going to velks a lot with guild groups so hopefully I can get a chance at one of those without buying.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions and I'll start keeping my eye out on the prices, see if I can get a good deal lol.<br />
<br />
And I updated my profile so ac/hps/atk are all updated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought a Cloak of the Maelstrom today on TT for 3300 pp.<br />
<br />
I also had 6k to spend and have looked long and hard and there is not many things to upgrade.. I did loose some AC on the Chetari shield but at this pt, 80 ish HP total on one slot plus dex sounds like a good upgrade to me.<br />
<br />
You could also roll for it if your guild goes near the Throne area.. you don't need to go in the Throne room, you need 2-3 grps ideally for 55ish average levels. The guy that drops the cloak is level 61.. and you get adds every now and then. All in all it's fairly easy to get it';s just a matter of when your guild goes there.. personally I saved raid pts and bought it as it was an immediate boost to my hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cant see your magelo at work, but I'd say dont worry about raldukan helm.  Keep raiding kael until you get a champs helm.  It's one of the best you can reasonably get mid 50's and all it costs is some time and cheap gems.  Get what upgrades you can from kael, and just focus on the pieces that won't cover.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In all the time I've been in the Kael Arena .. at least a couple dozen raids, probably more .. I've never been present when a plate BP, plate legs, or plate helm have dropped.  I'm starting to think it's urban legend.  The drop rate is much better in HoT, particularly for plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get some friends and camp the plate cycle in Kael. Should get some thurg armor, and that would be some nice upgrades for you.</div></div><hr />
