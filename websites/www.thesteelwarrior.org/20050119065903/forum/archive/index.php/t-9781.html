With my current gear, buffing to around 9.2k/1600 am i MPG worthy or would i get schooled?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">with a good clr in the group, you will survive.  will still get schooled hard once in a while, but you can at least work on getting some rot loot from BH/DEK etc.  you really want to work on your AC some.  I find that AC is worth more in MPG+ type zones since another 500 hp isnt going to help you anywhere as much as another 100AC there.  I would aim more towards 10k hp and around 2kAC   once you got 10k AC, you have enough for clr to work with so your main job would be to mitigate those 900+ hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with oomwarrior. You can definately survive there and could hold down say Blind/Task ( I use this for example because its the camp im most familiar with.) and do very well.  A couple things that will make it either doable or not worth anyones time:<br />
<br />
1. You will want a back-up healer of some sort, no question. Some of the mobs there can get away from ya with a single healer. The lightning guys and the elites for example.  Some flurry. Some ramp. Nice to have a druid, shammy, pally, beast, soemthing to toss a heal in there to bridge the gap between cleric heals. <br />
<br />
2. Unless your cleric is really well geared i.e. good FT, focus effects, aa's it can keep down time to a minimum to have a mage for rods or a necro for twitch, etc..Really easy to run a cleric oom there.<br />
<br />
*3. No &quot;specialty&quot; puller necessary for a lot of the camps and nameds there. Again, Blind/Task best example...all single pulls. <br />
<br />
4. Don't be afraid to make your group move.  People are pretty used to sitting between Blind/Task and having every mob brought to them. This is cool, but it can also cause unnecessary puller deaths. Have em move up to one mob before named to make pulls shorter if you feel you need it.  Some of these guys are really quick and can catch ya, stun ya, kill ya real easy if you not careful.<br />
<br />
*although not needed to get single pulls, having a bard bring in pre-slowed mobs is a win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the tips guys, im really wanting to get the ring/mask/earring ive seen coming out of mpg, but i didnt know if i could hang there too well. at 70 with sturdi5 i'll be at 7409hps, (ie 10k+ proper buffed) reckon that would be enough for just one main healer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if im not mistaken the mask and ring are random drops off trash. so if you exp long enough at task/bh, youll see some drop.  cant remember about the earring.<br />
<br />
1 cleric should be no problem, its not a hard camp to hold down if you get the spawns timed properly, and theres a good spot with no wanderers.  but cleric should have decent FT/aas etc imo, cos sometimes e.g bunch of resisted slows,  theyll have to expend a fari amount of fast healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrtiz</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a bit over 10k raid buffed I get my butt seriously kicked in there now and then. With a good cleric I survive but usually I ask the shaman to spot heal...<br />
<br />
The most important thing is aggro tho, as long as the cleric only has to heal you it's ok, if you loose aggro over a dps class the cleric will run oom in no time...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the most part, nameds are easier than lightning warrior trash. Odi can be rough if you don't dispell her 50% mitigation buff (like all ikaavs) but other than that, taskfiend and blind hunter are roughly the same as normal mobs. BHR camp has the 20ac aug drop off him, look into getting that. Odi drops a 55hp aug as well, so if you camp between them (near RS zoneline) you have a shot at both.<br />
<br />
10k hp is plenty for this zone, your ac is a bit low though. I usually am at 10.5k hp in this zone, but I also buff to ~2100ac, which makes a nice difference in this zone. On any mobs but lightning warriors, a shammy is enough to keep me up. Work on your ac first and foremost, and you'll usually gain a few hp with each new higher ac piece anyways.<br />
<br />
As for other loot in mpg, the ear drops off blind hunter, priest shoulders drop off odi, taskfiend drops a dd or lifetap aug, not sure what else. Ring and mask are random off any trash.</div></div><hr />

I found that getting a Panoply of Vie from cleric (10% melee mitigation) and Verse of Vesegran (5% melee and 5% spell mitigation) really helps my survival until the slow lands.  Every little bit counts.<br />
I noticed an Elite Kyv ripped me for 5khp in one lucky round yesterday.  Luckily i was at full health at the time.  I try to never get below 50% because every now and then an elite will rip and tear a huge round off.  The lightning models flurry too, so they can land max 7 hits per round - that could be &gt;5 khp too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing it will be a bit tough for you bro.  I am sitting at around 10k buffed and 1700AC and I still am hesitant about going there.  I will go if it's a cleric I know well and not just someone's hand slapping the keyboard on a second computer to CH me.... but if it's someone I don't know I say forget it.  Also, you may find an overwhelming number of bitch-ass casters and/or hybrid melee types there that expect us to &quot;carry them&quot; per say.  I have been invited to groups with 65-67 chanters that basically can't mez, slow, tash, nuke worth a damn, or charm.... but still come and want to get free exp and loot.  Not to say all are like that, but quite a few groups I have gotten in are like that.  Good luck with it, MPG can give awesome loot, but takes a lot of patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've taken a few peeks into MPG.  While fun, I'd say only go with people you know.  I was getting smacked around but good, would've died a few times if not for an on the ball shaman.  And yes, having Vie and a Bard in your group is sooo nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say that MPG is going to be pretty tough for you, not just for the lack of AC but for lack of defensive AAs too (looks like you have CA1 and CS1 from your magelo.)  Like a previous poster said, if you have a group of friends, go try it, but I'd think that pickup groups would be really rough for the most part.  The good news of course is that you can possibly get at least 6 good upgrades (hp aug, AC aug, earring, mask, ring, and also Kuuan Infantry Greaves off Odi, dont think anyone mentioned those.)  Even with a bard you're not going to resist chaos claws procs teriibly often unless you have other resist buffs too, but circle alendar does a very nice job on cutting down proc damage if you can actually find someone with it (20% spell damage mitigation/2080 damage/70 enchanter.)  In general, I'd say you're better off working up AAs/levels somewhere else before trying MPG, but then again, the hard way might be more fun.  Let us know how it turns out how it goes when you try, I'm interested in hearing how it works out!</div></div><hr />

The ones near the zone in are no cakewalk either.  Ones that can proc that 660 dd are really mean and I would even go so far as to advise tanking with /Def on every once in a while to save on mana if you only have one healer.<br />

I think the xp is faster in WoS ( if I'm tanking) when you take into account the speed of kills.  But I have hung around and gotten some nice upgrades while LFG.  That warclasp earring is forever rotting on luclin.<br />

<br />
Seriously though, 10.5/2k can tank everything in the zone. I did mind camp in the northern area of zone for 5 or 6 respawn cycles. Granted i had a 1.5'ed cleric and shammy, but it really wasn't too bad except in the two places where you can occasionally get a two-pull (we had no chanter/bard). <br />
<br />
If you are looking at a new zone and are unsure of your ability to tank it, get a group there and see for yourself. I got a RS invite a week or so ago and figured &quot;why not?&quot; So, I get there and handle mobs decently, but I can't tank all that great there. So, when I get 70 and maybe pick up the next few oow defensive AAs, I plan on giving it another shot. If you start tanking a new area and it's obvious you can't handle it, send a tell to another LFG tank that you think would be able to tank there, and have them replace you. Each person has different experience in different zones, so asking for info on this board gives you a general consensus that may or may not be the case had you gone and checked for yourself.</div></div><hr />

MPG is hard in the sense you don't have 6 mobs unslowed you can tank using a Paladin healing, but until Riftseekers you don't even get the same difficulty as GoD.</div></div><hr />

Everybody I group with in MPG has that ring/ear for all of their alts now, and we have had 2 earrings on the ground rotting at the same time more than once.  Out of the many many BH kills I have done I have only seen one AC augment, and lost the roll to a ranger :p.  Rune drops in MPG are pretty bad now.

<br />
I can't say that I agree. MPG puts a royal smackdown on me, to the point where I can't really tank it without a backup healer. Tipt/vxed otoh I can tank with a single cleric very easily. My gut is that MPG mobs have a much higher hit% than tipt/vxed does, and perhaps mitigate slow more. I haven't bothered to compare parses though.<br />
<br />
I see 700+ quads with a bunch of procs pretty regularly in MPG, vs in tipt/vxed a full quad of hits let alone high-di hits is pretty rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well several of the times I've been in MPG the cleric hasn't had crack for some reason and it's been non-stop medbreaks and deaths. CH isn't always enough to keep me up without patches or hots, and the fights are long enough to require a LOT of heals. <br />
<br />
The last time I did tipt I wasn't tanking except for adds and stuff, so that makes it seem easier. However the cleric never ran oom and we pretty much rolled right through the event even with relatively low dps of war/war/enc/shm/clr/wiz and no pet.<br />
<br />
I wonder if AC helps more in MPG or something.... everybody thats saying it's much easier than tipt has lots more AC than I do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went  back to vxed last night. It was a joke. We flattened the zone without a pet. Then we got a pet and flattened it some more. We got multiple repops at a time, mezzed em, and kept killing stuff. I died once because the cleric and I were typing too much and he healed late. I was around 1750 AC and all pre-oow defensive aa. The last trip to MPG was last weekend and my gear is more or less the same except for a 15 ac aug.<br />
<br />
Vxed mobs only rarely quad. Most hits are singles or doubles, and they miss a lot. So I went back and looked at my logs...<br />
<br />
In vxed, my dps taken goes from below 100 to over 300. If EQC is calculating correctly,  my average dps taken across all fights was 171.<br />
<br />
In MPG, mobs quad a lot. Their max hit is lower, and many don't have procs, but I don't have a single logged fight under 200 dps, most of them are between 240 and 300 dps taken. A couple elite fights were over 400 dps taken. The average dps taken for my last trip to MPG at the ODI camp was 263 calculated using the same tool as I used for the vxed fights.<br />
<br />
Have any of you guys actually been to vxed/tipt since dinging level 70?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that a cleric's perception of easyness may have more to do with how often he has an 'o shit' reaction than how much healing he actually does. In vxed/tipt, 1 bad round means some healing needs to happen FAST, even on a bigass tank. In MPG, the dps comes in much smoother and so if you're a bit beefier than I am simply casting ch @80% or whatever will keep you up with almost no gaps.<br />
<br />
For me, however, in MPG the cleric is trying to get away with only using CH and it just doesn't always get the job done.</div></div><hr />

I would be seriously interested to see some parses from one of you guys that says MPG is a pushover in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I always found Vxed much easier than Tipt /shrug.Unfortunately(or not hehe :) ) I've only been back to Tipt with pets the last while to help flag new folks fast.However,I know that Tipt tends to challenge some of our tanks and healers during clearing unlike their casual PG groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could also be the different styles that make the GoD trials versus MPG seem different.  The camps I've done in MPG are basically static, single pull, group stays in a safe spot, easy to afk for a break, easy to get buffs from people outside your group, sort o deal.  The goal oriented nature of Vxed/Tipt means you have to move more and med less with less flexibility on when/where you choose to fight. Also more difficult to get buffs from classes outside your group.  That could change peoples perception of the difficulty of the actual mobs in these 2 areas.<br />
<br />
Another thing that could be clouding the issue a bit is that there is quite a variety in mob difficulty in MPG. Some of em are damn easy, and some are seriously tough (at least to me).<br />
<br />
Im interested to go back to GoD trials now at 70 and see for myself if i think they got noticably easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, well, I did another run through tipt today. All the way through to jhiru with no pet but carrying an enchanter who averaged 2.75 dps. We ended up wiping on jhiru because he busted out with a 'balance of the nameless' ae that stripped all our buffs, dispelled our newly acquired pet, and decided to munch our cleric almost immediately afterwards. Anybody seen that before?<br />

BUT, I will say that tipt hits harder than vxed. The cleric wasn't stunning this time, and I was running around 1870AC with bard resists (but not amped as much as I had in MPG last week). My average DPS taken on all fights including an extremely lucky noc who nailed me for 800 dps with 4 claws procs and a quad was 239.17.  The single cleric was able to keep me up without med breaks or patches from the shaman. DPS taken ranged from 74 for some gimpy ikaavs to 810.89 for the lucky noc. The jhiru fight fell apart too badly too quickly to get a worthwhile dps number.</div></div><hr />
