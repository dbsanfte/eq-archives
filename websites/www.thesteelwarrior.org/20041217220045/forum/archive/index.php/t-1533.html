<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are currently all spread out. Everyone having their ideas, everyone agreeing and disagreeing...<br />
How could we ever assemble all these diverse ideas into one realistic fix for warriors?<br />
<br />
Trying to get a fix here and there for warriors is asking too much imo.<br />
If we want to see something happen, it has to be focused.<br />
<br />
When casters ask a fix, it's simpler for them, because they know it's Spell related.<br />
<br />
It's a bit more complicated for us, because we need a fix, but don't know where exactly. (everyone has their own opinion)<br />
<br />
<br />
So I'd like to start a poll, and see in which domain  the majority of the community would wish to see a fix happen.<br />
We could then concentrate on this domain, create an armory of ideas all within this domain.<br />
<br />
We would then have a Solid, Realistic Upgrade to warriors.<br />
Rather then scattered ideas that give the impression that we want a complete Overhaul.<br />
<br />
So here are the &quot;Domains&quot; in which warriors could seek a change, that i've thought of. <br />
Please say so if I missed any possible domains.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Disciplines and &quot;Stances&quot; (New/Upgrade disciplines, as well as a new sort of permanent discipline called &quot;Stances&quot;)<br />
<br />
  Statistics (the base of the warrior. Hp, AC, Skill caps etc..)<br />
<br />
  Skills and &quot;Combat Moves&quot; (More tools to the warrior. Be it simple skills, or more elaborate Special Moves.)<br />
<br />
  Itemization and Focus Items  (weapons, effects and armor. New ones, upgrade some, make more warriors only ones etc.. As well as bringing in a plethora of new Focus items for warriors)<br />
<br />
  Knights (would the problem be knights only? would nerfing them fix everything?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've put in all possible domains, even those I don't agree at all with :p... it's up to the community to decide.<br />
<br />
Yes, this isn't  a poll yet, I want to be sure I got all domains possible, before starting a poll.<br />
<br />
And please don't make any posts about how this Domain is useless or that Domain is completely moronic... the poll will show that :p<br />
<br />
edit: changed a few things :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Combat Moves*<br />
<br />
I anticipate those flames about how we dont want spells etc... :p<br />
<br />
<br />
These could be a nice fix to all melees at once.<br />
<br />
We could have like a 4 gem slot bar, instead ot he 8 casters get.<br />
Then have a Book of Tactics to store all ancestory moves our guildmasters taught us throughout our training.<br />
<br />
Since it uses stamina to make moves, a few changes to how stamina works could be usefull too...<br />
like make it more punishable to have 0 stamina, but also harder to lose stamina while fighting.<br />
<br />
Just clarifying what I mean by Combat Moves ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 comments pop to mind.<br />
<br />
1:  There are a number(tho definatly a minority from appearences) who feel the problem is not with warriors, but that knight agro generation is too large.  Admittedly hard to address in the formot you are suggesting, but it should probably be at least looked at.<br />
<br />
2:  Why not actually address each area?  Seperate topics on each area would work fine.  Locking oursleves into a single suggestion for improvment I think hurts us in the end.  If SoE sees our suggestion, and for whatever reason deems it unacceptable, we have gained nothing.  If we offer suggested class improvements in each area, with a caveat that we are not after all of them, only offering them as possible solutions, I think we would be better off.<br />
<br />
Those comments aside, I would vote for skills(taunt), AA's and itemization.  Sorry, could not keep it to just one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bunnie, I am so pissed off at you for suggesting that right now I cannot even type a cohesive and constructive reply to this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I see is very deep in EQ.<br />
<br />
All other classes have gotten a serries of progressions and upgrades, they have been tweaked and updated. new spells, focus items, gear...<br />
<br />
All except melee... <br />
<br />
pure melee are lagging very far behind. Monks and Rogues are a little better off in that they each have a fairly large skill set, and they have abilities that give them some utility. the only thing melee have gotten is new gear to compensate.<br />
<br />
Disciplines/AA's dont count because every other class gets them.<br />
<br />
Gear I think is horribly itemized AGAINST melee. <br />
In the beginning there were hp/ac and there were mana items, now they get both, no choices.  <br />
<br />
Maybe Asking for a revamp of the class is too much, but we need something done that isnt another bandaid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I mean is melee classes barely do enough to cover the basics of their jobs with an unlimited supply of &quot;combat energy&quot; . Putting a limit on their combat power via the stamina bar will destroy the melee classes. We don't do enough to have it limited like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skills, AA skills and &quot;combat moves&quot; should be one bullet.<br />
<br />
Disciplines and stances should be one bullet. <br />
<br />
( Actually you could combine the skills group with the disciplines group )<br />
<br />
Itemization and focus items should be one bullet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skills : upgrade Kick and disarm. Kick today hit for 1, interupt rarely... Disarm... Well I used it at level 30 on GD giants, and sometimes in duel... but it should do damage or add more hate.<br />
<br />
Itemization : more class only items please. Not just weapons. ALL slots<br />
<br />
&quot;Combat Moves&quot; or &quot;Stances&quot; : definitively not. this is EQ, not DAOC, it would be just like adding heals to wizards. At thsi state of the game its may be a  move too radical<br />
<br />
AA Abilities : well, Rampage and Warcry could be revamped... And I like some new flashy AND useful ability like casters have (exemple : pet swarm, Lifeburn, WTD...) something like a forced berserker, while you lose control of yourself but continue attacking your target, scorring Flurry and Rampage red messages and beeing hasted at 30% overcap for the duration of the ability :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Varaho, the whole thing with stamina can be changed or whatever.<br />
The base of that &quot;domain&quot; was having a series of abilities to choose from, all limited not by time, but something else.<br />
Can discuss wether its good or not to use stamina, or whatever, i didn't give the &quot;Combat Moves&quot; thing much thought.<br />
Just threw everything i could think of.<br />
<br />
And yes, I was planning on putting &quot;Nerfing Knights&quot; as well :p,<br />
but forgot about it :x<br />
<br />
As for it being bad to focus on one domain...<br />
well currently we're doing all domains, and look where its taking us.<br />
<br />
People are giving ideas for Disciplines, which are rendered useless by other people's ideas for Skills.<br />
But then if we have those skills, the other's idea of that focus would be overpowered.<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
But sure, can group a few things together. Like itemization and Focus.<br />
or skills and combat moves.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
and for combat moves... again... these arent spells?... just skill that demand stamina.<br />
<br />
Like for example: Gut Slash - you cut open a sensible part of your enemy, making him bleed. (furor's Aggro Dot idea)<br />
<br />
instead of making it a skill that pop up every X seconds, and that you just keep mashing.<br />
Make it something that demands stamina or whatever...<br />
forcing you to choose your skill wisely.<br />
<br />
There's a reason we don't have many skills....<br />
that's simply because having 10 skills that dont demand anything, can easily be overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People are giving ideas for Disciplines, which are rendered useless by other people's ideas for Skills.<br />

etc... <br />
<br />
Understood, but just because two ideas are mutually exclusive does not meen either is bad, and giving a whole shopping list of ideas(which I think is what raaj is doing) gives more to choose from.  Not saying your way is wrong, just suggesting another way to maybe do it.  Ultimatly, if you are the one doing it, go with what you think best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not saying the two ideas are bad :), i'm saying exactly the opposite.<br />
Two very good ideas cancelling each other out is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
There is a problem however, on how ideas are made on the board.<br />
Everyone has their ideas, everyone wants to express them.<br />
<br />
Say you want to make a good soup.<br />
Wouldn't you first figure out what sort of soup you want? will it be fish soup? vegetable soup?....<br />
<br />
as it is now, everyone is tossing in their carrots, their mushrooms and their meatballs.<br />
What we end up with isnt a soup, but rather a compost :/<br />
<br />
<br />
I have many ideas i'd like to express myself :p, and all in different categories.<br />
But i know that if I express them now, on these boards, the way it is now....<br />
even if it were the best idea in the world (which it probably isnt :p ) it would recieve a few &quot;Yays&quot; and &quot;Boos&quot; and then get forgotten under the heaps of incoming ideas and complaints.<br />
<br />
almost everyone wants something to be done, almost everyone doesnt know what exactly.<br />
I was merely trying to proceed by elimination. <br />
Clarify what warriors really want... cause right now, it's a blur.</div></div><hr />
