<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes. Just read the emotes during the event, then it should dawn on you what it is that is healing him and how many times it will happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rashere did a hell of a nice job on this one, I really hope it stays in it's current form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eh, two hours of unavoidable and incredibly tedious trash clearing just to get to an event is the kind of horse shit that makes people retire from playing this game.  Hell of a nice job? No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">dude, his loot is sweet, 2 shields and a crappy bow, hell yeah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Clearing to him sucks ass i was refering to hp fight itself.</div></div><hr />

Oh shit, let's go farm shields then! =p<br />
<br />
Seriously though, forget the lame clearing... I appreciate the creativity, but I still think this fight is less fun/interesting than all of Inktu`ta, and Barxt too.</div></div><hr />

This event is teh absolute sucketh.  You gotta have strong dps, and we're getting to the point where we can barely get 45 on-line to try it.  We've never beaten it, and only ever gotten him to CH twice in one fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sandaormo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This event does suck. We beat it on our second attempt after learning a couple things our first try. but it is very long and boring and tedious to say the least. <br />
<br />
the thing about this event is that it put us into the Tacvi rotation but we haven't had a shot at Zun Muram *sp* *name?*. Tacvi is a whole nother story hehe we tried the first named a couple times last night fo rthe first time and lemme say it's hard hehe..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">going into tacvi on someone elses work is gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This event sucks indeed took us 58mins to kill HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm going to disagree with Brutall, the fight itself is pretty cool in concept but I dislike the entire encounter, everything about it the clearing, the miniboss clearing, the final boss... all of it.  Some people find it fun but I just found the entire encounter extremly tedious and had I not been leading the raid at the time I doubt I could have put up with completing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think if HP drops 4 or 5 loot it'd make the event worthwhile.<br />
<br />
While they're at it make everything that drop 2 loot in Txevu drop 3 (Arena, Cragbeast, etc), and the Ixts BP mobs drop 2 loot instead of 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Rumor has it clearing will be lessened.<br />
<br />
Grain of salt and all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hehe, the monks should appreciate that. Must suck a bit having one of their highend weapons on a mob no sane guild does more than 2-3 times max(with the current amount of clearing required).<br />
<br />
And now that a better shield drops from Tacvi, thats one less &quot;worthwhile&quot; item on his loot table.</div></div><hr />
