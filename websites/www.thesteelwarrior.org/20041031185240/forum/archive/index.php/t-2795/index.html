<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my server, CoF is going for around 45k, and soulscream belt is hovering around 20k. I was wondering if for a 61 warrior in a guild starting to do vindi, tov, etc, it would really be worth it to get the CoF, or would the extra money be better spent on upgrades? Also, what upgrades would you recommend if I went that route. Keep in mind, I would like for this haste to last for a while, as I may not be getting a better haste item for a while, and it seems like belt slot is easier to upgrade than back slot.<br />

With your cultural, the logical upgrade in belt for you  (non-haste) is Heavy Rubicite Girdle, I think it has 25 AC and +85 HP. I'm not sure of cloaks with more raw HP than the 80 on yours now, but I'd suggest getting some + stamina items quickly, you're missing out on a lot of HP there. Calculating from the pre-pop stat cap of 255, you'll max Stamina with buffs from a level 57 Shaman once you get your unbuffed stamina to 200. You'll want to be there because you'll run out of buff slots using Infusion of Spirit and Talisman of Kragg and the single stat Shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
31% is enough to get you through till you're able to loot no-drop haste with buff haste, so I'd go with the belt haste, and with leftover plat, grab a pair of Valorium Rings of Galantry (6ac +8 all stats, 65Hp and mana)and a <br />
Mosquito Leg Earring (8AC +8 stamina +65HP)or an Iron Scream Earring (2 or 3 AC +7ish sta and +65 HP). If you have a bit more plat, Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement is better than either one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh could also pick up an Earring of the Solstice package for the ear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, mask of the forgotten is around 20k, maybe a tiny bit more... how would you factor it in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm ok Mask of forgotten is 10 AC, 5 agi and 15HP, so putting haste on face will cost you 2AC and 45 HP<br />
<br />
Belt haste with soulscream will lose you 10 AC and 50 raw HP, gain you 10 stamina (which will give you 60 additional HP @ level 61) 9 strength and 5 save vs cold<br />
<br />
CoF instead of FH cloak will lose you 6 AC and 30 HP, and gain you 4 dex and agi and 15 save vs fire<br />
<br />
Tough call. I think I'd go with soulscream belt. It results in a net HP gain, and boosts your low strength as well, though it's also the biggest AC hit</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">anything over 30% haste is ok, u will be max haste or really close with just SoV. its pointless to consider haste after you are better than 30% other than to solo and chanterless xp groups. should look at the other stats and maximize hp/ac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Noramally I would recommend the CoF because you lose less AC/HP over upgrading other slots, but you can really put the 20k difference to good use by upgrading other slots instead. Depending on your server economy, you could end up with a Soulscream Belt and a couple of other upgrades to really give yourself a huge boost in STA.<br />
<br />
waist: Soulscream Belt (+10 sta)<br />
rings: 2x Valorium Ring of Gallantry (2x +8 sta)<br />
ear: Earring of the Solstice (+5 sta)<br />
range: Darkwood Bow of Suffering (+5 sta)<br />
mask: Grimling Contraption (+5 sta)<br />
<br />
For the 45k you would spend on a CoF, you should be able to get all of the above items and end up with an additional 41 sta.<br />
<br />
Once you get those, I would look for:<br />
<br />
ear: Mosquito Leg Earring (+7 sta)<br />
arms: Kizrak's Armband of Battle (+6 sta)<br />
boots: Kizrak's Boots of Battle (+3 sta)<br />
hands: Kizrak's Gauntlets of Battle (+8 sta)<br />
<br />
In any case, you need to get some haste ASAP, no haste is hurting you more than you can imagine.</div></div><hr />
