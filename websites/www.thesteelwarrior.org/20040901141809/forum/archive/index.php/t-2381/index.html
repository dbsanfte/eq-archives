<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eradani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I’ve read a lot of people saying that defensive is why we aren’t getting fixed, and people want it gone.  That warriors need to be put on their own mitigation tables, like defensive, but without the loss in DPS.  That we need more sustained aggro, but not really the snap aggro of the knight classes.  That we need to have a knowticable advantage in the HP and AC attained from similar gear.<br />
<br />
And then, I see Knights who feel like we need to give up something in order to get anything.   That, in most casses being defensive (that, as said some of ‘us’ want to get rid of anyways) so, let’s look at a possible comprimise, let’s say that we as warriors got the following fixes…<br />
<br />
Defensive – removed, warriors are now put on their own mitigation tables, almost ‘prema defensive, but no loss in DPS.<br />
<br />
AggroDoT – implimented, warriors can now generate sustained aggro separate from the weapons they use.<br />
<br />
HP/AC – warriors inately gain 15% more HP/AC from items then any other class.<br />
<br />
So now we warriors are happy, for the most part.  We got some changes made to the class that will help us have a more level playing field over the snap aggro, and utillity of the knight classes.<br />
<br />
Now, the Knights are upset that we got a huge upgrade, and are now more in a place of compitition with them for exp groups, they demand to be able to have the ability to tank boss mobs to make up for that.  (wether or not they need to, is beside the point, let’s just continue. [ blah blah, new spells and focus items with every expansion, and almost every patch. Blah blah] )<br />
<br />
Would we as a warrior community have a problem if Knights did get ‘defensive’?<br />
(well, not really defensive)<br />
<br />
[put fun little knightish name here]<br />
by focusing on their melee side, Knights… etc etc etc. [make up a good knightish discription]<br />
<br />
the up side?<br />
<br />
Knights, for 2.5 minutes can go ‘defensive’ and mitigate like a warrior<br />
(ie: tank boss mobs)<br />
<br />
the down side?<br />
(because defensive does have a down side) isnt a loss in DPS for Knights<br />
when using the ‘knightdefensive’ the knight’s spells all grey out, for the durration.<br />
(LH/HT not included, as we don’t loose kick/disarm/etc)<br />
There is no way to end this skill, untill the timer runs out.<br />
There is a 10 minute reuse time.<br />
<br />
What would we have at this point?<br />
Warriors now have a slightly larger HP/AC advantage over a Knight in identical gear.<br />
Warriors have something other then the RNG for aggro generation.<br />
Warriors now take less damage for mobs then any other class.<br />
<br />
Knights would still be wanted in groups because of snap aggro, and higher starting aggro.<br />
Knights now are given more melee utility, at the cost of their caster side.<br />
Smaller guilds can now do larger targets if their warriors arnt on.<br />
The question Knights would have to ask in using this is ‘am I willing to give up all my spells for 2.5 minutes?’  as warriors have to suffer with lower DPS and theirby lower aggro generation because of it currently.<br />
<br />
Because of this, I doubt that Knights would us it often in exp groups (perhaps as much as we us defensive now) but, this does open up new doors on raids.  Don’t want to WS tank to start? Fine, have a Knight pull with a spell, and use this ability. After 2 minutes, have your main warrior take over.  Not enough warriors to be rampage tanks?  Fine, have a Knight use this ability.<br />
<br />
At this point, I could see this as being win/win Knights still wanted in groups, Warriors still wanted at raids, but each is a little better at being 2nd in the other area.<br />
<br />
As to wether or not this would be unbalancing, yeah it probably would be.<br />
But it’d never be implimented, I just wonder if something like this were to happen, could we live with it? And be ‘happy’?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To make it work like the warrior disciplines do, when a knight is in 'defensive' : <br />
<br />
1) Knight DPS is lowered by 40%<br />
<br />
2) Knight cant use any other disciplines(in their case, SPELLS) during the duration of defensive PLUS the 7 minutes 30 seconds of the refresh timer.  Yes knights will have to use their 'Taunt' key just like we do and procing weapons!<br />
<br />
3)Knights cannot use HT/LoH during the 3 minuite duration of Defensive. Just like Warriors cannot use their /Shield ability while defensive is on.<br />
<br />
4)Knights cannot cancel the discipline while its in use.  So no spells from start to finish once defensive is applied. So thats 10 minutes 30 seconds of no spells. Just like warriors cannot use any other discipline or cancel it once its applied.<br />
<br />
Oh yes and refresh time stays the same from lvl 60-65. Yup it never lowered with the PoP expansion. Our disciplines remained the same. They dont have seperate refresh timers. You use one, you cant use any other. The refresh timer did not lower like it used to do from 55-60.<br />
<br />
Thats the downside warriors pay for using defensive(and any other discipline).  And thats how its should be apllied if given to knights in a mimic to warriors. <br />
<br />
Knights still want  it? They sure as hell didnt think Defensive was 40% mitigation with no downside. Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well it is an interesting idea. I think it will be a fair tradeoff. <br />
<br />
Only 2 things i dont agree.<br />
<br />
Lets only take out our spells for the time we have defensiv activ. This mean for 2 1/2 minutes. It is less because our powers and more because the pain with it. Most fights take less then 7 minutes and 10 1/2 Minutes reuse time will only make that we sit arround after the fight and wait that our spells come back and have no us in this time. Warriors are back to full power after 2 1/2 minutes i think knights should be able to us all there tools other then disciplines to. But this will only be a emergency action and you will rarly see knights us this from start. But it will give us a nice new role in raids. Emergency tanks when all warriors are death. Take aggro with stuns, hit defensiv and tank the mob for the last few hps. <br />
<br />
But more important we need to be able to us rightclick items in this time. If we cant us this it is usless against all debuff mobs. A defensiv knight without buffs is way weaker then a buffed knight without defensiv.<br />
<br />
Arbosch Bloodforge</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Guess what Arbosch? That is exactly what every warrior has to do once they use defensive. Once the 3 minutes of defensive end, they have to wait 7 minutes 30 seconds to be useful again. They cant use any other discipline. <br />
<br />
We even have Offensive disciplines with refresh timers of 20+ minutes. Thats right. If we pop one of those offensive disciplines, we wont be able to use defensive if an emergency occurs during the refresh time of the other disciplines<br />
<br />
Ugly isn't it? Thats the price we pay. Thats the price Knights would have to pay. <br />
<br />
I invite you to share our pain.  Let the other pallies know the truth of Defensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
But here is the thing. Paladins dont want downsides. They despise them. They cant handle having downsides. They want all the PROS and very limited or non existant CONS.<br />
<br />
Remember before PoP was released the Slay Undead changes?<br />
<br />
SoE intended to add 3 additional levels of Slay Unded. Which meant GREATER damage at a GREATER frequency.  Of course since PoP had a damn good share of undead mobs among the exping and raiding areas, they had to give them a &quot;downside&quot; to this massive power. <br />
<br />
They were gonna give Slay Undead an ON/OFF button. <br />
<br />
ON- Hellish Damage to Undead. Imagine Slay Undead 6! But with the downside  of recieving 50% more damage FROM undead. <br />
<br />
OFF- Normal damage to both to undead and  living mobs. Paladins would mitigate as normal.<br />
<br />
Pallies would have been even more vicious undead slayers than they currently are.  Of course they would have been forced to simply being Damage dealers to undead when SU was turned ON.  They would have required another tank to keep aggro while they were in this Undead Damage Dealer mode. <br />
<br />
But No. They didnt want to be just Undead Damage Dealers. They wanted to be Undead Damage Dealers AND Tank.  So SoE, due to all the collective whinning, decided to leave SU untouched. No downsides. BUT paladins would NOT get 3 extra levels of SU(Greater Damage and greater frequency). <br />
<br />
I WISH, for all that is holy, that I could use a discipline like Fellstrike  on at least Humanoid mobs with an ON/OFF button, with a downside of recieving 50% more damage from Humanoids while it was ON.  Mob turns on me, I turn my Damage mode OFF. How simple. <br />
<br />
I would have NO problem with that because I have been used all my Warrior carreer of the burded and downsides from disciplines. <br />
<br />
Paladins should be friggin thankful their Slay Undead is not a 3 minute ability with a refresh timer of 20+ minutes. (Like Aggressive discipline).<br />
Or hell Like Fellstrike 12 seconds of Damage with 45 minute refresh? I forgot. I dont use it because it would make me USELESS in case I had to use Defensive during a raid. <br />
<br />
Defensive is useful in exp groups when the healers die. You pop defensive and PRAY for your suriving groupmates to finish off the mob before it kills you. <br />
<br />
We cannot use defensive to solo  mobs because we do 40% less melee dmg while Defensive is on and our DPS is crap already. We have no heals, no root, no snare, no dots, no FD.<br />
<br />
Open your eyes pallyboy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Paladins and Shadowknights are not only fine where they are atm,<br />
but they're a tiny bit overpowered.<br />
<br />
There is ZERO reason to give them anything in exchange of a warrior FIX.<br />
<br />
Hybrids are classes that can Melee AND Cast.<br />
Where's the penalty for such a thing?... nono.. no more exp penalty....<br />
<br />
You want Defensive now?<br />
<br />
Then you'll probably want 2k nukes...<br />
and what about FD Paladins don't get FD! wtf!!<br />
<br />
You reminds me of those bards that want to be able to offtank.<br />
Nothing but Spoiled kids.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to WANT knights to be nerfed now... <br />
gonna try sending a couple feedbacks with proofs of how Knights really ARE overpowered...<br />
<br />
if you dont realise how overpowered you are, it's probably because you suck at your class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can't just give us some permanent semi-defensive mitigation. A mob must still be able to hit for full or the entire game's balance goes to hell.<br />
<br />
A significantly improved mitigation table would do fine. Something equivalent to what would happen if you boosted your AC 20% would change the damage curve on warriors sufficiently to make them such better tanks, innately, that we would be much more desireable for exping. <br />
<br />
I would go for an HP Boost too. 10% or so.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather have those two than some innate aggro-ing increase tbh. I feel I hold aggro well enough that having those would work best for us as a class and having both would seriously unbalance the game. I would however want to see aggro on low level spells significantly reduced so that Paladins and SK's have to seriously hurt their mana to hold aggro in the ridiculously easy way that they can right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sarelin, what use will those hps and ac be?<br />
It will make high end encounters easier... but we don't want that. We are fine when tanking those high end bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as a paladin or sk can be kept alive with no punishement dealt to healer mana, they will be favored to us no matter HOW much hp/ac we have.<br />
<br />
What use is going to be your 10k hp and 2kac, when your Blade of Carnage won't proc for 2mins, and your Taunt won't work 5 times in a row?...<br />
The shaman, wizard, necro, monk, rogue are all going to wish they had a Knight instead.<br />
<br />
Aggro is the core of the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for mitigation and hp.<br />
IMO, this is how it should be:<br />
<br />
A Warrior should be able to tank an unslowed mob, as good as a Knight tanks a slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Sounds fair doesnt it?<br />
And slow classes dont become an absolute need anymore, but rather a very welcomed addition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;A Warrior should be able to tank an unslowed mob, as good as a Knight tanks a slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Sounds fair doesnt it?<br />
And slow classes dont become an absolute need anymore, but rather a very welcomed addition.&quot;<br />
<br />
How would that affect the tanking of Raid level mobs? That discrepancy in damage taken as you suggest would be posible with our own defensive table(superior mitigation). That or we parry/avoid  more often than we currently do with a hefty increase in some defensive skill caps.<br />
<br />
The problem would remain though. A group will kill faster with a knight tanking than a warrior. Knights are more than sufficient to tank any exp mob and can lock aggro so group can unleash their full DPS potential. <br />
<br />
If they upped or mitigation or defenses, we would still have the problem of a group holding back their DPS so they could allow us to get hit by the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree the aggro is still a problem Vikos. Reason I said Aggro was the Core of the problem (scroll up ;) ).<br />
<br />
When I said warriors should be able to tank unslowed mobs like knights tank them slowed. It was mostly to illustrate how I visioned our mitigation difference SHOULD be.<br />
<br />
The good thing about it however, is it would make a REAL difference in mitigation, not like the current one.<br />
<br />
And groups could be formed this way:<br />
<br />
Warrior + Cleric + 4 DPS classes (whome all have to watch aggro)<br />
or<br />
Knight + Cleric + Slower + 3 DPS classes (whome dont watch aggro).<br />
<br />
<br />
You'll notice that a warrior will be preferred when no Slowers are around. And the first setup may be preferred if the warrior has high end aggro tools (BoW), because it will allow more DPS.<br />
<br />
The only problem, is if we make the mitigation table higher, it will unbalance raid encounters.<br />
Thus a nerf on knights would be needed instead, to spare raid encounters....<br />
<br />
but there's a possible solution that doesnt nerf knights, and doesnt unbalance raid encounters,<br />
read the &quot;Odd Idea&quot; I posted in The War Room. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Perhaps you missed when I said:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Now if those classes have to med up after every fight or two they won't be preferred, they will be balanced, because you will no longer be killing faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If a warrior could tank unslowed mobs as well as a knight tanks slowed mobs, this would help our aggro issue too. The worst problems I have with aggro are from a failed taunt immediately after a slow, or, worse, resisted slow. An enchanter tanking an unslowed mob is not a pretty sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If a warrior could tank unslowed mobs as well as a knight tanks slowed mobs, this would help our aggro issue too. <br />
<br />
While superficially this sounds attractive, I see some issues with it.  If a Warrior tanked an unslowed mob as well as a Knight tanked a slowed mob, then there would be no reason for the group with a Warrior to use a slower, there go spots for Enchanters and Shamans, they'll be replaced with DPS peeps.  And if Warriors tanked unslowed mobs that well, mobs hitting for the kind of numbers that PoP mobs hit for, how might Warriors do against pretty much all the boss mobs prior to PoP?  Wouldn't they have to retune all those encounters in order to not allow them to be completely trivialized by the new improved Warrior tanking?<br />
<br />
And of course if Warriors were tanking unslowed mobs that well, wouldn't SoE probably want to modify the mobs so they were more of a challenge to a group with a Warrior, thereby in all likelihood giving the Knights the big shaft in the process?<br />
<br />
The only thing that might work, and I'm just thinking of this as I'm typing it so don't jump down my throat if it doesn't appear to consider everything, would be a mini-defensive ability.  Something that you could fire off say once every couple of minutes but would only give you perhaps 30 seconds of improved mitigation, but wouldn't reduce your damage output at all.  This might be something that wouldn't cause things to be too out of whack.  30 seconds isn't a long time, but it might be long enough for the Warrior to establish enough aggro for the slower to slow and not having the Warrior be a mana sponge in the meantime, compared to a Knight tanking a aggro locked and slowed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you boosted the Warrior's hp and ac to be able to tank mobs that good unslowed... then there may be issues.<br />
But HP and AC isn't the solution to all...<br />
example: the idea I suggested in another post.<br />
Have the mob slowed down for hitting a warrior.<br />
<br />
The slow would be less then shaman/enchanter slows, and it would only affect the warrior.<br />
Thus enchanters/slowers wouldnt lose their priviledged spot, and all raid encounters wouldnt be affected by much since you'll have a Slower with you anyhow.<br />
<br />
But the effect will remain present: Warriors will be able to tank unslowed mobs, while knights will have trouble. Ta Daa!<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are lots of other solutions.<br />
I'm pretty sick and tired of the HP/Mitigation solutions. They will never work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It would be near impossible to code every monster in the game to be insta-slowed only to the warrior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I never really get how having a Knight improves caster DPS... I can see melee, but most melee can loose aggro w/o too much loss in DPS....<br />
<br />
Yes, higher aggro allows casters to &quot;burn&quot; mobs, which certainly has it use's in XP Groups, however its not really that beneficial for longterm.... In a group a caster is going to want Mana Regen = Mana spent, unless a caster is actively wasting mana by being FM and still regaining mana, the overall DPS of having a knight tanking will *not* go up by any signicent amount, because with the caster casting above his mana regen, they will go oom, and then have to regen mana, making the DPS more or less the same. I guess with clickies it might be useful... but Rend robes dont drop, and are rare and far between, and not really something to exspect an average casters to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Madronedorf, go ask a pure caster how much mana they regenerate per tick, then ask them what focus effects they have, then ask them what spells they have that can improve spell power or the amount of mana they have.<br />
<br />
There is huge amount of mana that just recently appeared in the game for casters, this happened at all levels of play. Compare the amount average wizard in velious to an average wizard could now, most likely you will notice a few new mana regen spells in their arsenal some focus effects that further lessen the strain on the mana pool, a few numerals of flowing thought and perhaps a cheep horse that makes it so they med most of the time. They could get all of that for about the same amount of effort I have invested in my gear now. Hell come to think of it, even I have flowing thought...</div></div><hr />

The primary reason to let a knight tank something is when the engagement is special.  For instance if the monster is blinking all over its faster to respond with spells than it is to chase to close the range to melee.<br />
<br />
No real surprise here.  Knights tank in situations where Warriors are weak.  I'm sure you'll have a good excuse why this is wrong Apothes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and basically... all fights in which a Knight can survive SHOULD be Exclusively Knight.<br />
There's no reason whatsover to pick a Warrior over a knight if the knight can live through it.<br />
<br />
And with a knight surviving through 50% of Reparm... that makes a LOT of mobs to which he would survive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Bunnie, I didn't say it was impossible for a SK or Paladin to tank things.  Especially with a monster like Reparm its all HP.  Apothes makes it sound no matter where some magical guild they deny Warriors the chance to tank at all.  By your own admition, you went through 3 Warriors before using a Paladin.<br />
<br />
As said before, you want a Knight to tank in places where Warriors are weak (ie. /disc defensive is useless).  TZ is a perfect example.  If a monster is dealing large amounts of &quot;off damage&quot; then stick a Knight in there because /disc defensive does squat.<br />
<br />
Once again I point out that this one big reason why /disc defensive really hampered Warriors.  Even with that said defensive offers huge savings used against the right monsters.  A raid leader would be remise if they didn't consider this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Give me the name/address of a guild whose warriors can keep a group healed during an AoE mob, or spot heal an MA in a way druids and shamans don't dream of. While you're at it, show me a guild whose warriros can FD pull, buff their group's atk, or sustain their HP with lifetaps (yes, I'm well aware taps can be resisted). <br />
<br />
Stop trying to pass off the &quot;waah waah, well warriors get to MT exactly 2% of the mobs in the game and we can't.&quot; That bullshit doesn't fly here. Don't try to pass it off, hybrids have alternate roles on a raid besides tanking that can't be filled in any respect by a warrior. Not to mention the fact that certain mobs are tanked more efficiently by a hybrid than a warrior. Still crying foul off that mountain now?</div></div><hr />

I've been visiting this board for a long time now, and overall the thing that is worst about this board (and admitaly most of the other boards, including paladin) is people come up with things that simply arnt true to try to build their case, and then they are questioned on it, they dont respond to it and instead either dont reply at all, or put words in other peoples mouth and try to debate that  <br />

Hi, WHere did I say that? I didnt, <br />
<br />
You know what bullshit shouldnt fly here? Bullshit like saying things w/o having anything to back it up, Bullshit like putting words in other peoples mouth, Bullshit like trying to change the subject when challenged on the legitmacy of your comments.<br />
<br />
Apothes said something to the degree of why do some guilds use Knights to tank boss's exclusivly... I think thats a bunch of bullshit, no guild use's any one class to tank boss's Exclusivly overall, sure some guilds may use class X to tank Mob Y, but not Class X to tank ALL boss's. Hell I may be wrong, I don't think I am, but until you come up with proof to the contrary.<br />
<br />
I could very well be wrong, There could be Guilds that tank Mobs 100% with knights, I doubt it, and I calling apothes out on his statement, if he proves me wrong I'll shutup, and I'll loke like a dumbass... But until you prove that, then your just spewing undocument bullshit...<br />
<br />
Put up, or shut up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">unless its an NToV/PreNToV guild <br />
Apothes only said some guilds, and didn't precise at what level of the game they were.<br />
So by saying &quot;unless its NToV&quot;, you're pretty much agreeing with him ;)<br />
<br />
Lots of guild that are in the lower end should be using Knights exclusively, gearing them up like they would any MT... making them thus have more hp and ac then any warrior and the unbeatable aggro added to that.<br />
And that's plain wrong....<br />
<br />
you play a Warrior in a guild that only does ToV... well... you're useless.<br />
<br />
To be of any use as a Warrior, you need to be in a guild that does AoW+...<br />
and that's simply Bullshit.<br />
Especially considering that new expansion won't be Uber Boss driven... but dungeon driven...<br />
where Paladins will be KINGS and Warriors will be big piles of ... Guano.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If indeed its ntov/pre ntov then he should say that.<br />
<br />
Velious is two exspantions old, Hell a guild could gear up a ranger and do NToV...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Sorry I lost track of this thread too many to keep up with lol and as far as exclusive knight tanks what i have heard is of course hearsay. but on RN supposedly DA uses knights pretty much exclusively they are currently on rathe encounter IIRC. it could be BS though since it's hard to tell forum our server board as a bunch of crap slinging goes on. but as the posters here have shown quite a bit of pop boss mobs are tanked with knights maybe not exclusively but it can be done.<br />
<br />
So there is my back up to my claim but I should reiterate it is hearsay as I have no firsthand knowledge of it just what i have heard. But even if guilds do not use knights exclusively I think by seeing the posts here after I made that comment it is safe to assume knights tank a big % of PoP mobs with no more issues then a warrior.<br />
<br />
as far as why Pon banned me you could be right Aeka but please point me to the thread where i did not back up a claim an where it states I was banned for it?<br />
<br />
I can still read the PoN board hell I could post under a new name if i wanted but I don't have the desire to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'm ending my participation in this now to avoid the risk of venturing even farther off topic.  Having a thread go into an ugly tail spell of personal vendettas is just plain bad.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry everyone has to see the ugly side of class balancing forums.  I should have known better to mention any of your past history since it would just gode you into fanning flames.   Do you want to start a flame war?  That is the exact thing that got you kicked off that board.  I'm not about do that here.<br />
<br />
Class boards are always a good read.  I plainly don't have the desire to learn every aspect of every class so browsing class forums is a way to get a little info.  I'm also very happy when other browse PON since it keeps Paladins there who don't have the time to roam boards in check and in the know.<br />
<br />
As for Apothes, I won't go into it with you here.  I stand by my posting history here and any other board.  I don't always agree with all posters but I try to keep things level and cool.  Does your posting history show this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Does your posting history show this?<br />
Not trying to fan a new flame here, but how is that trying to keep things level or cool?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">More like a rethorical question. ^_^ I really want him to think about it instead of posting a response since I won't respond to him in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">K, just trying to point out that the end of that post was thoroughly inflammatory. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think most reasonable people would have to admit that it does seem like Apothes from time to time goes out of his way to stir things up.  I'm not really sure why, but it does seem like he carries a bit of a chip on his shoulder regarding other Paladins in general and Aeka in particular.  Is there some specific reason for this Apothes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I dont get why everyone has that image of Apothes o_O....<br />
<br />
I have yet to see a post from Apothes where he just tries to stir things up.<br />
<br />
And theres definately nothing on this thread about any vendettas or anything....<br />
he just said some guilds used Knights Exclusively... which isnt false...<br />
and now you all jump at his throat.. <br />
did I miss something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I started off sane but the post kind of ended up insane, if you have issues with language pelase do not read this post.<br />
<br />
I would not say I itentionally try to stir any so called pot. but it does aggrivate me that 99.9999999 fucking percent of paladins downplay thier skill sets. I am a very outspoken individuall and usually do not resort to personall attakcs although what i consider personal and others do seem to differ a bit. and Aeks you stand by your posts? check out the thread I started askin for a stun nerf and Aeka's posts :p (that is intentionally stirring so called pot ther ewas even a post in that thread i made to anotehr thread where people could bitch about me and keep it out of the thread but people pmd the mods saying i was a troll lookin for attention because of that so I deleted the damn thread. I could give a fuck about attention). But I see a shit load of posts here from pallies that are just not true and it has really pissed me off to no end I play the god dfamn class no where near the level of a lot of people here but I know what I can and cannot do as far as what mobs I can tank as a pally that is hersay because I draw that conclusion from posts I have read on PoN and here.<br />
<br />
I work in a enviroment where if you cant take the stress you best get the fuck out cause no one is going to let up. I have betted head with VP's more then once and will in the future I don't fucking back down because you tell me something and I know it to be not the whole truth.<br />
<br />
I want one thing for EQ ot be challenging and if fucking holyer then though god mode shit lickin fucked up tistty suckin pallys get there way then there will be no point in playing eq cause any fucking schoolgirl pally can tank a fucking boxx mob which in my book is total fucking BS. a pally is a holy warrior destined ot defens the underprivlaged not a brute force warrior pallys are more subtle and use spells to aid in thier defence please tell my why the fuck a subtle warrior can fucking tank general reparm from 50 to 0?????? IT IS TOTAL AND COMPLETE FUCKING BULL SHIT!!<br />
<br />
<br />
GOD DAMNIT SOE FUCKING PUT WARRIORS BACK WHERE THEY BELONG AS THE NUMBER 1 NUMERO UNO TOP DOG GADMANED TANK! AND NERF THOES FUCKING PANSY ASSED PALLYS LIKE MYSELF WE HAVE GROWN OUTSIDE OF OUR CLASS!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">And to clarify yes I have been wrong in some of my posts like the exclusive knight tanks I do not know for a fact if the guild uses only knights so I was technically wrong in that post. But I do know for a lot of PoP mobs guilds use Knights to tank exclusivly. How you ask? from reading posts of people saying who they used to tank a mob.<br />
<br />
I aint 100% right all the time hell sometimes I am lucky to bat 500 I will be the first to admit that. But I do know what my class can do I would say cannot do but there really is not much a pally cannot do.<br />
<br />
I am far from politically correct and if my posts upset you or you think I am just trying to stir the pot or if you are living in your own reality and don't want to hear the truth (the times I am right) then do not read my post's.<br />
<br />
If you all want start a petition I am sure you can get get me banned from this board also if you try hard enough if I bother you all that much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Yes, okay.  We understand that there are cases where a defensive Warrior is a better choice.  And there are cases where a Paladin is a better choice.  So, it appears that PoP requires that boss mob tanking duties be shared across the tank classes to be most effective.  Fair enough.  Now that Warriors have their raid role somewhat diminished and the Paladins have their raid role somewhat increased are we going to see Paladins finally stfu about how they have no raid role?  Will we finally see Warriors get a little utility to make up for the fact that they don't have a lock on boss mob tanking any more?  Will many Paladins stop trying to use our role as boss mob tank as a rock to beat us over the head with regarding the fact they should be a better choice for group tanking?  Will Saddam Hussain surrender to U.S. troops and claim that it was all a big misunderstanding and that his weapons of mass distruction were destroyed as a gesture of good will long ago?  I think the answer to all of the questions above is no.</div></div><hr />
