<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes you heard me. I want nice and ripe, dark blue mobs to solo while being LFG.<br />
<br />
I tried the alien mobs in Akheva, since i knew on beforehand that they were level 50, but since they lowered the exp cap, they can't be single pulled anymore.<br />
<br />
Velk spiders are light blue/green, no use.<br />
<br />
Kobolds in VL are light blue, only the prophets and champions are dark blue. I can solo them all NP, even the nameds, but killing endless streams of LB's isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
Went back to Sebilis, only some bok's are dark blue, and krups. I can solo krups too, but they tend to come in pairs, and their aggro range has increased significantly. Felt like being level 54 again pulling there...</div></div><hr />
