<br />
i'm currently playing on the german kael drakkal server and my guild entered the elemental planes last week after killing RZTW.was not easy but we did it :)<br />
<br />
now i heard a rumour about script changes on the US servers in preperation for the OOW -Addon.<br />
for example: you kill both trigger mobs,VZ will aggro immediately (because he's aggro to the raid if your're in the corner near VZ spawn).<br />
TZ will spawn beside your right after killing the VZ's,same with fake RZ when you killed TZ.<br />
<br />
is this true or just a rumour ?<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TZ WILL agro the raid when he spawns, VZ needs to be pulled, same for RZ (fake) and RZtW. If you are getting instant agro then you are on auto-pull(tm) some how.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did notice something weird, but we our first attempt was... monday? I'm not sure if it's &quot;different&quot; not much to compare with.<br />
<br />
The first 3 attempts we did on the script, VZ did not spawn with hsi 4 gindan flayer guards.  The 4th attempt he did (was after they brought servers down).  We noticed using HoTT that even though no one had been near VZ, he had someone on target.  It was someone random it seemed, not someone who got a killshot or first hit or anything of that nature.<br />
<br />
The monks pulled a little early to try and split him and well, once he past his &quot;give up&quot; range and decided to follow his target he was agro on, VZ + 4 Gindans came.  We tried again and had the one person camp off, and then a bard who got agro off that player from song assist agro.  VZ's target list was clear then and we could split him.  But of the 3 times we did it that night when the 4 guards came up, each time VZ had pre-agro on some random player in the raid that we had to camp off.<br />

<br />
Everyone seems to take the southern hallway to start the script, where TZ spawns.  Is there anything wrong with taking the northern hallway?  I assume VZ spawns there and you'd fight him first, while TZ roams into the map room unaggrod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendak</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea but the usual reason for doing TZ first is he's generally accepted as the &quot;harder&quot; encounter I guess, and the main reason I would assume is that if you were to try and &quot;pull&quot; TZ, it uh.. would be fun.<br />
<br />
Trying to run a mob that range attacks 3k DD arrows and snares you would be interesting.<br />
<br />
Whereas VZ has no ranged attacks.<br />
<br />
So I think that's the MAIN reason TZ is done first, pulling TZ would be a nightmare.<br />
