<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give &quot;report&quot; to &quot;an angry goblin&quot; (5 day spawn, p150, p1950) in Droga. He will wander down the hall into a small room (p250, p1600) and Warlord Skargus will spawn (56-57 SK, with 800-850pt HT, 10-15k HP, hits for 165). Kill him and loot his head. This guy is rumored to be a 200-300 point faction hit in the direction you need it. If you can spawn him while KoS, it would be advantagous to simply farm him with a group of people, until all 6 have the head. You would then have 1200-1800 more factin with Chardok. (Much simpler than AE goblin slaughtering.)</div></div><hr />

Classy dude, fuckin classy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The angry goblin spawns in Frontier Mountains now.  Instead of pathing, after you hand him the note, Skargus will appear on top of him.  They have all the loc information.</div></div><hr />

Classy dude, fuckin classy.  <br />
<br />
yeah, except that he does not mention that as well as the goblin traitor spawn has totally changed as well, why should the angry spawn be the very same?<br />
I dont see how this is classy, but I now know that this here is the wrong board to ask for information now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goblin traitor is still in droga, same as he's always been, right on the fringes of the old Warder area.   I still fail to see what that has to do with the angry goblin or how to make him spawn.  You make him spawn exactly the same way you did when he was in droga...you sit around and wait for him to be up and then you finish your quest.<br />
<br />
I dunno what the hell information you're looking for, but we answered your question multiple times now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the necros say its 3 days, not 5 though. And the first few responses were quite snotty like &quot;go and sit there&quot; <br />
Yeah, I can do that myself, I just want to know how pointless it would be to do so. I am not going to burn myself out for a week over this quest, if you are simple minded enough not to bore to death by sitting there for a few days, yay you.<br />
<br />
and I bet about the traitor you are referring to something on allakhazam, not your personal experience as well ? :P<br />
I still think that if you need detailed quest information, dont ask on steelwarrior, think what other class might do the quest too and ask there :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh for fucks sake dude<br />
<br />
Make a goddamned ranger, park him outside the cave.  Every time you log on, log on the ranger and check track.  If he's up, you run your warrior out with your friends, you get your ring, and you can do other things. <br />
<br />
Why the hell is that so hard to figure out?  Did I hold your hand enough for you to figure out how to find your spawn, or do I need to make a character on your server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't know it was changed.  When the droga upgrade first came out the angry goblin was in his old spot.  Most of the droga quests were moved to FM though, so I'm not suprised this one was as well.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, Bite Me.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Yeah, instead of just giving me the exact spawntime YOU decided to be snotty &quot;go sit there till he spawns&quot; about it, dont forget that. Why do you browse this subforum at all ?<br />
<br />
Erm perhaps it isn't good to mess with someone as angry as Haass? I learned my lesson there =) <br />
You dont level up by fighting green cons, do you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay dumbass, you wanna keep this going, we can do that.<br />
<br />
What good would the exact spawn time do for you that &quot;Go sit there until he spawns&quot; wouldn't?<br />
<br />
You're in a cave that is supposed to have a goblin in it.  He's not up.  You know he's a 5 day spawn.  WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT?<br />
<br />
a) Sit there until he spawns.<br />
b) Come back 5 days later and go &quot;WTF? Why isn't he up?&quot;  Proceed to whine on messageboard about being given false information.<br />
c) Check occasionally until you find him like everyone else with half a brain, and ignore making retarded posts entirely, thereby saving some face.<br />
<br />
You have 1 hour to complete your exam, I hope you brought your number 2 pencils.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy shit I think that's what we called pwnt.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mellow out fellas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pwnt by massive use of dirty language Ninjaburger, eh ?<br />
<br />
You know he's a 5 day spawn. WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT?<br />
I did not know he is a 5 day spawn, thats why I started this one here, you know? Why do you even post in a thread like this if you cant even add something semi-productive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I told you to wait for him to spawn.  Gimmel told you to wait 3 days.  An intelligent person could have gathered by that fact that he is not a triggered spawn, but you didn't.  <br />
<br />
At that point, it matters not whether his spawn is 20 minutes, 5 days or 400 years, it all becomes exactly the same thing.  YOU EITHER SIT THERE AND WAIT FOR HIM OR YOU KEEP CHECKING HIM UNTIL YOU FIND HIM UP.<br />
<br />
You then required Brutul to tell you that he was a 5 day spawn, and then you managed to insult him as well, and even I won't go that far.  Yes, they moved everything into Frontier Mountains and kept everything exactly the same EXCEPT FOR THE ANGRY GOBLIN!  He is now level 4 and is spawned by handing in 4 giant rat whiskers to your guild leader in freeport.  Seriously dude, grow some common sense.<br />
<br />
Please explain to me how your inability to comprehend the answer is being unproductive.   And also please explain why you feel the need to insult everyone who tries to help you.  You think anyone who saw this massive heap of disrespect is going to try to offer you information again?  I think not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If &quot;wait till he spawns&quot; is productive I dont want to know what you are like when in a disruptive mood.<br />
Ya I admit it maybe was a bit overreacting regarding brutul, however quoting from a 1,5 month outdated guide with that attitude and quote tags (when I still dont know where that one is, Search did NOT cough it up) together with your arrogant responses asked for it. I dont mind you now tho, I guess every board needs 1-2 assholes (http://www.winternet.com/~mikelr/flame48.html) (never saw one as fitting as in your case) to keep them from being boring.<br />
<br />
Oh and my other question still aint answered.. will the presence of the goblin traitor interfere in any way with the spawn? Cause that guy is up every time I have checked over the last days, which actually bothers me more than checking for the angry one every 6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I can savely say now that the angry goblin and the traitor do not share spawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Enough of this thread.  Trondir, it's usually more productive to not insult people that give you information, even if you feel they had too much &quot;attitude&quot;  while posting information.  Just a little advice if you want to actually get information and not just get flamed.</div></div><hr />
