   I like to solo... want to do the most damage possible in the quickest amount of time... but I also want a class with good roleplaying opportunities.<br />
   So, Warrior or Paladin- its boggles me. <br />
   Thanks<br />

**and if you could reply with a good site for the chosen class I would like to do some research, thanks again.</div></div><hr />

Why would you consider EITHER a Warrior or a Paladin?!  <br />

If melee then Beast is best choice really.</div></div><hr />

I love the warrior class, but I realized that once I built a shaman there are better solo classes.<br />
<br />
SK's are great for &quot;spike&quot; dps and tanking (FD doesn't hurt either).  I have seen some berzerkers do great dps and still tank ok too, but neither class solo's very well.<br />
<br />
I guess a real question would be do you want to solo and do great dps, or do you want to solo and live?  If you don't like dying then I would go Necro, shaman or druid for casters.  For melee I think the beastlords would be the only soloing class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Play neither a knight, nor a warrior.  You will NOT be able to do what you seem to want with either of them.<br />
<br />
You want a &quot;Tanking&quot; type character, since you are asking about a paladin or warrior, which are both tanks, so that throws out all pure casters.<br />
<br />
You want to do &quot;want to do the most damage possible in the quickest amount of time&quot; , so that throws out bards, and knights.<br />
<br />
You want to solo, so that throws out warrior, rogue, monk and berserker.<br />
<br />
You want to role-play, so that thows out....well, nothing really.<br />
<br />
So, you are left with:<br />
<br />
Beastlord<br />
Ranger<br />
<br />
And if you want to solo effectively from 1-70 +AAs, you really cant be a ranger, well, you can, but it will be VERY rough from 55ish til 59 and AM3/EQ, and even then, root/shoot is NOT great exp.<br />
<br />
I play a Beastlord, and I can solo, even at level 70, I can solo mobs that hit for 600 easily.  I can do &quot;decent&quot; damage, and with my weapons, and a few AA skills, a /disc, a few dots, and a few nukes, I can do a good deal of damage in a short time.  I have a pet, she is named Snarl, and is a level 61 Scaled Wolf, and she has 18AA all of her own, which makes her higher level than many players in everquest, heh.  So, yea, I can role-play too, if I want.<br />
<br />
I can be Tank, Slower, or DPS in a group, or all 3, which makes getting a group easier, grab a healer, 4 others, and go.  One of the 4 a tank, great, now I dont get hit, one of them a shammy, great, now I can use more mana for DPS, etc.<br />
<br />
But, if you are dead set on paladin or warrior, the pally is by far the better soloer.</div></div><hr />

Hybrid Melee and Melee's from the old world aren't solo_friendly. And why thrw away a year of levelling if you can make a class that only gets better with age like a beastlord or wiz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd definately vote for Beastlord if you like to melee and solo.  My main is a 70 Beast with 237 AA's that buffs to 7.8K with just Conviciton and self Beast-Buffed.  I can easily solo an AA in about an hour and 20 minutes in GE or similar places killing darkblues with great efficiency.  Beastlords will never come close to the shear tankability and ability of a warrior to withstand the harsh beatings of content made for groups of that level.  Beastlords also don't come close to comparing to necro's or even druids really in the solo department, but out of the melee classes, they are easily the best at soloing.  I also have a Warrior alt that I enjoy playing a great deal.  While he doesn't solo like the beastlord can, he is great in groups and will one day reach the level of being able to tank the big stuff.  I love the thrill of close combat with both the beastlord and the warrior.  My warrior stands toe to toe much better, but doesn't even come close to the soloability of the beastlord.  Paladins can heal rather well, and tank rather well, but they loose out alot on the damage department.  If I were going to have a tank.. I'd want a warrior to play if for no other reason than the thought that you can gleefully bathe in the blood of your evicerated opponent as he gurgles his last muted cries through his blood choked esophagus.  Paladin's are just too good and noble to do that... They'd feel guilt for days at having to slay the poor creature.  Warriors were built to kill and fight, get bloody in battle and stand up to the meanest of mean with the steely eyed resolution of an enraged war boar.  My young warrior is only 41 now, but growing swiftly in his thirst for blood and power.<br />
<br />
One final edit I forgot... There are 2 class sites that I find invaluable.  One is TSW, this site that I have linked, and the other is for my Beastlord information.  That site is http://www.beastlords.org  .   There used to be a beastlords.com, but that site was taken over by a commercial site and now is mostly an advertising platform with very little good information on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you can afford to spend a million plat twinking your character, I guess a warrior or paladin would work out well. Of course, with the amount of plat it takes to make a warrior a decent solo class past 20, you could do the same for any other class for better results.</div></div><hr />

Wizard infos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but if you want DPS...go play a wizard man.<br />
<br />
Shik, he was asking between a war and pal, which are both tanks.  Beastlord is really the only DPS-ish option for him, unless he wants to completely be unable to tank at all, but seeing as his first two choices are tank #1 and tank #2, I think he wants to play &quot;in da face&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is a shadowknight.  They can solo decently, much better than a warrior, faster than a paladin though.<br />
<br />
Sk's are the dps tank, but they cannot directly heal like a pally.  But FD can save your arse and be very useful for splitting camps solo.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine played a SK to 70 and I always had better gear than him but he could solo stuff I couldn't dream of.<br />

OK Captain Obvious; I call your bluff and raise you 20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uncharacteristically restrained reply, Shik...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My vote is...well, neither of your choices.  As has been mentioned neither is noted for their soloability.  Soloing seems to be the crux of your request.<br />
<br />
If you want to solo:<br />
<br />
1.  In your face, beat down style?  Beastlord, hands-down.  They have no real competitor in this arena.<br />
<br />
2.  Finger-waggler?  Wizard, Druid, Necro...in that order.<br />
<br />
<br />
My $.02, but with inflation probably worth much less.</div></div><hr />
