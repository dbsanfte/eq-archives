I cant find them anywhere.  If you could post what books you have found, what lvl the skill is, where you found it and what the skill does that would be great.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any more info?  Can other classes turn the same item to the same or other NPCs for spells or their abilities?  To whom do you turn it in to?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's someone with a name that's like Reyfin Malakawa, a Nihil in the Abysmal Sea.  You must do the turn in yourself.  Both the rune and the tome are no drop.  For spellcasting classes he gives a fixed spell back, i.e. Cleric will always get Order and nothing else.  Of course we can only get Bellow of the Mastruq since we only have one 'spell'.</div></div><hr />

If that tome is the only one we get I feel they are shafting us still on the melee revamp part 2.  They said it was going live with the expansion, I guess not.</div></div><hr />

I remember, vaguely, that there was *more to come, we scrapped openings* ... but not that any of it was going live with GoD.  Not from a dev post, tho I do remember some speculation that it might (from players).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, ok.  I guess I was hearing the gossip from players and not from the dev team.  Thanks for taking the time.  I looked at Lucy again and the sorce is Test, but they scraped them from Test too.  Thanks again guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those Warrior abilities were all tied to openings.  The feedback said stuff tied to opening aren't very useful (and probably correct) so they scrapped the opening idea and going to go with more abiltiies on a timer with endurance cost ala incite.  They have not said when these new abilties will go live.  I think we will see the +endurance on existing items first, and then who knows when the other abilities will go in.</div></div><hr />

Melee Revamp Part 2 happened. It's done and over with. For those that missed it, it was simply putting in the MONK skill that didn't go live with part 1.<br />
<br />
(And of course, breaking it. Then claiming to fix it, but screwing it up, then claiming to fix it again, but it's still screwed up).<br />
<br />
Melee Rebalancing Part 3 will most likely include fine tuning some bersker stuff (they're woefully incomplete right now) ... and hopefully putting SNEAK ATTACK, the Rogue ability LIVE.<br />
<br />
Warriors don't look to gain much from these parts of the movie. But then again, like in LotR, Boromir's role was pretty paltry in the last two parts.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Sarcasm aside ... they're going pretty slowly and are going to be doing the other melees next. They'll be back around to warriors eventually I guess. BUT ... you warriors need to ask yourselves ... What NEXT?<br />
<br />
You wanted to mitigate better than Hybrid tanks. You do.<br />
You wanted better aggro generation. You got it.<br />
<br />
What else is on the list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, personally i cant really say the we &quot;need&quot; anything but did casters and hybrids really &quot;need&quot; new spells? to be fair i think if we add spells as part of an expantion everyone should get to have a part of that pie, be it thru clicky items, endurance abilitys or what have you.<br />
<br />
we wanted to cripple mobs, make them bleed, etc, guess what class gets em? fucking berserkers, just like the took what the shamans where asking for and made it into a new class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the ideas i had thought of (yet doubt would/could get implemented), was having a warrior 'grab' the mob.<br />
<br />
Whether making a 'snare' or 'root' effect, i humor the idea that it'd make things refreshingly interesting.<br />
<br />
After all, seeing 4 shrunken warriors try to jam pile on a_large_mob_01 to slow it down (at the least), makes for some hilarious midget jokes. lol<br />
<br />
And yeah, sue me... i like the idea of adding some wrestler-esqe type skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabon Ssteel</div><div class="date">03-06-2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Next would be to give warriors comparable benefits like a mana class has with spells . We got 4 situational spells alias discs with a high reuse time and cost ..vs Spell casters with a broader range of usefull effects for both self and group uses.Give wars some Endurace regen gear to like casters/hybrids benfit from ft 15 / all spell increase items .add disc increase items .Then add some more discs to use at will.Stuns Defense enhanchments Group buff discs ?<br />
And thats it Classes are Balanced.</div></div><hr />

Considering that Sony said they wanted to make combat more interactive and give melees more options, to give skilled players a greater chance to distinguish themselves, I think we are still likely to see many of the old &quot;opening&quot; skills in a slightly different form in the near future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was from the Dev Chat just before the launch of GoD.<br />

Read this transcript (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5313) to see where the confusion comes from.  I think a lot of people (myself included) expected a lot more to be going live because of the comment.</div></div><hr />
