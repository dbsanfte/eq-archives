I am a little overwhelmed by the new combat abilities and I would like some basic info.  I am lvl 63 and have no real AA's to speak of...<br />
<br />
Are there lvl resrictions on the new abilities?<br />
Are there some that I should not bother getting?<br />
Are there some I can't live without?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you asking about  AA abilities or the new discs that we just got?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new disc that where just patched in live.  I had been following the info posted here from test but I am finding it a little confussing.<br />
<br />
Are there &quot;windows&quot; of oppertunity for using these new abilities?<br />
<br />
or has that not been made live yet?<br />
<br />
Also are there lvl restrictions?<br />
<br />
I would just buy um all and experiment but I am low on coins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other new ability we got is the Provoke line. There is a good post here from another EQ developer.<br />

<br />
The &quot;windows of oppurtunity&quot; that you speak of is not live yet. That is the 2nd part of the melee boost that Sony is giving us. All your questions should be answered in the first post of both those threads. Feel free to ask any other questions that you do not get answered.</div></div><hr />
