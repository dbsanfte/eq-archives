Mine instead of procing says &quot;Item out of Charges&quot; (mind you this is on Tunare) the server GM replaced it and it still gave the message so I'm assuming its a bug? Just curious if its been happening to anyone else out there.<br />
<br />
This item is from phase 3 time off of the last 2 Avatar guys btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the effect, I havent even been able to rate it yet since it doesnt work but I think its decent since lifetaps can be resisted even though such a small chance of it happening, I like the fact of having a heal but maybe one like greater healing or something would have been very cool instead of invigorate, I do know that it has a decent proc rate however from the amount of messages saying &quot;Out of Charges&quot; but who knows what they will change when they fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would invigorate generate any aggro.It is similar to a rune in that if the mob is attacking you you are ineffect healing yourself.<br />
<br />
If taht was the case and you wanted this weapon for DPs having it proc Greater Heal or whatver prolly would not be to shit hot for avoiding aggro..<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a hunch that Invig is probably zero aggro for some reason,I suppose you could test it by tanking a mob then having someone take aggro then standing next to the mob healing yourself with a Velious BP.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it is Zero Aggro,a LdoN Life Tap proc on it owuld make a really nice DPS weapon with a couple heal procs for AE's and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya I really cant tell if invigorate generates aggro, velious bps take like 15 seconds to cast so its very ineffective in testing aggro methods, but I have a good amount of experience in its aggro without a working proc right now its only relying on DPS which its aggro isnt very good except for sheer DPS aggro, its fine for exp groups and soloing or whatever, but mainly its great for ae fights and that life tap idea doesnt seem to bad, I was thinking that until a +5dmg aug comes around.  When its fixed i'll be able to answer that more easily, I wouldnt be suprised that a heal would generate aggro like self runes do though.  This definetly isnt a weapon that you can steal much aggro with unless you mod it up with anger 3 or something, but thats not what I got it for :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">generally when they fix a weapon, its usually on a patch day, so I wouldn't hold your breath about getting this fixed until next patch, then you can trade it in to a gm.</div></div><hr />

several times in xp groups ive noticed mobs turn to me as soon as this procs (Knights Blessing).  So yes, even *tiny* heals generate agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I know that actual heals on a proc will get you some decent aggro,Hopebringers are even better as it does the whole group..<br />
<br />
Invigorate just seems like it owuld be a non Heal type spell in a mobs eyes,more like you jsut regened 100hp or seen as a lifetap even.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it would have been jsut as easy to throw and actual heal on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iustus</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopebringers are even better as it does the whole group<br />
<br />
Look up the hopebringer proc, it is coded as a 1 hp DD, with the heal being a recourse. What this means is the proc is almost zero agro, you get no agro for the heal, only agro for the 1 point DD. (The only reason to go through these machinations is to remove the agro, which is why it was orginally a heal over time - but using a buff slot was bad, so it was changed to this recourse).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shitty shitty proc... make it a lifetap for god's sake!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah a lifetap or at least a 200 hp heal would be nice.  Why have the same heal as Kunark BPs?  The VP sword heals more, and the Vulak sword almost heals as much.  But this is supposed to be Time loot?<br />
<br />
And yes, we've got one or 2, and they are bugged, big surprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If weapons are supposed to have better ratio and better procs just because there are some previously good weapons with good procs, you'd probably see stuff that proc 1K DD or 750 lifetap or 2K self heals now.  <br />
<br />
Just because an earlier weapon had a better proc doesn't mean the later weapons have to be better.  That said, changing the proc to a 100 lifetap wouldn't be a bad idea I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to diss you or anything, but have you been paying attention to the changes of the selection of weapons as they become available? I don't expect the proc effectiveness to increase exponentially or anything, but technically, our weapon procs have been going up in quality from expansion to expansion. In the begining, there was the red epic proc, then Enraging/taunting blow, and now anger (on DBotW). Also in velious, the &quot;best&quot; weapons had an 80 hp life tap (2hs, 1hs, and h2h weapons off vulak), and in luclin they were upped to 100 (sword and staff off ssra, and an even bigger lifetap on Goldenrod). And lets not forget  that 750 DD proc on the Ethereal Destroyer... so yes actually I do expect improvements in procs, and NOT a step BACK :p. So actually now that I think about it it shouldn't just be a lifetap, it should be a 150-200 hp lifetap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its ratio is already very close to vanazir, so there is a limit to how much better they can make this sword unless they want to boost vanazir as well.<br />
<br />
IMO its just right. A nice common low-agro DPS weapon for the classes that can use, nothing more nothing less.</div></div><hr />
