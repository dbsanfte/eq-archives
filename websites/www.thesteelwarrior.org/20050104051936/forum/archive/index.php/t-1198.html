I don't post much but wondering about an upgrade that i've been trying to get for a while. Does any ones of a better hp/ ac back slot than Hierophant cloak that's droppable. Might have a chance at Cursed cloak but I can always save my points for other slots if I can get something thats droppable. Thanks for input.</div></div><hr />

You loose probably 130 or more hp (depending how much the stamina still helps) as lodi has no sta and no hp as well.<br />
Only thing that lodi shield is good for in the end is resist gear.<br />
I dont think there is an upgrade to hiero cloak or cloak of maelstrolm that is droppable.<br />
Cloak of thorns, cursed cloak are probably your best bet.<br />
I havent done much research lately, maybe some stuff from VT (if you are close to doing it).</div></div><hr />

Lodi shield is no way an upgrade over hiero cloak<br />
 <br />
<br />
Lets look at the important stats.<br />
<br />
Hiero cloak - AC 10, HP 75<br />
<br />
Lodi shield - AC 23<br />
<br />
Now, they say that as a general rule of thumb 1 AC is worth 10 HP.  So the HP value of the Lodi Shield over the Hiero is 13 * 10 = 130 HP.<br />
<br />
Based on that stat alone the lodi shield is a better bet.<br />
<br />
Take into account the excellent cold, fire and magic resists on it, as well as the EB effect, and I'd rather have a Lodi anyday.<br />
<br />
In fact, I have.  :D <br />
<br />
Oh, and if Draxion is after a droppable item, chances are he's nowhere near level 60, so your comment about the AA's isn't really relevant.</div></div><hr />

AC about the same.<br />
<br />
Gonaden, his guild is doing Cursed in Ssra.<br />
I doubt he is &lt; level 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxion</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for cursed the asians tend to keep it on their time so it's rather hard and Lady N rarely drops Cloak of thorns. In fact i've killed her in my previous guild roughly 8 weeks in a row and she didn't cough one up. <br />
<br />
Cloak of greator pernicity seems like a downgrade because of 25 raw hps less as well as 2 ac. I'm not too worried about Stamina atm though. Thanks for input again all.<br />
<br />
Edit : Gnomb replies fast :)</div></div><hr />

Its no big upgrade but at least some nice resists and 85 hp(i upgraded from a cloak of maelstrom).<br />
And if he doesnt drop cloak he drops a ft2 mask.<br />
Should be doable with 3 to 4 groups.</div></div><hr />

Would much rather try to get stuff on my own ;)  Not that I see many other choices to a better back slot since i think hiero is the best droppable but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, actually it has 2 more ac than hiero, and the only time you shouldn't be worried about STA is if its maxxed or if the hp loss exceeds the STA hp gain...depends on your lvl and AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the lodi.... thats not a warrior cloak.  No hps.  Simply put, the ac on lodi does not matter, hps are the most important stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I've really been interested in upgrading my cloak for was a Silver Steel Cloak (40ish ac 41 haste 110 hp lots of saves) from VT, but don't think we'll ever see one because we don't get many chances to do VT. Really what you're looking at in terms of a &quot;reasonable&quot; upgrade (IE actually WORTH spending the time/effort/points in upgrading) from a hiero cloak are...<br />
<br />
Velious era<br />
Cloak of Thorns<br />
Cloak of the Fearsome<br />
<br />
Luclin era<br />
Cloak of Dark Shadows<br />
Cloak of Maneuvering<br />
Cloak of the Black Wind<br />
Cloak of Icy Shadows<br />
Crystal Shadow Cloak<br />
<br />
PoP<br />
Fearsome Midnight<br />
and<br />
a whole bunch of other cloaks :p.<br />
<br />
The stupidist thing I've ever seen is that Terris Thule (required for Torment/Saryrn) drops a better cloak than Saryrn herself. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't progression supposed to go forwards and not backwards lootwise?</div></div><hr />

Pernicity has more overall hitpoints (STA and raw), plus 2 more AC...I don't understand how anybody can say the Pernicity doesn't win, hands down - its the better cloak for a tank.</div></div><hr />

Str?  Useless.  Stamina?  If you're level 60, you're getting close to it being useless if you've planned your gear out correctly.  Charisma?  Useless (Yeah, I suppose DI has a use, but if you need DI, you've got a better cloak).   Mana?  Useless.<br />
<br />
So now we're down to 12ac, 50hp vs 10ac 4 agi/dex 75hp.  75hp &gt; 50hp, Therefore Heiro &gt; Noob cloak of pernacity.  I'll even go a step farther and say that if you don't need the 4 sta off the Heiro cloak, run to Chardok quick and grab an Iksar Hide Cape.  Heiro clone without the stats, but with 15 PR/DR, and that's a win over the Heiro in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can max sta with buffs, Hiero isn't the best.<br />
<br />
Iksar Hide Cape<br />
AC10<br />
Hp+75 Mana+75<br />
SVPoison+15 SVDisease+15<br />
<br />
And it's lots cheaper than hiero anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever thought of the Loyalist Shield of Honor?<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics19/Loyalist_Shield.jpeg <br />
<br />
It's a rather simple quest out of Katta Kastellum that's called Vampyre Troubles if you search it under Allakhazam.  I've managed to easily trio everything up until the last spawn (60 warrior, 61 rogue, 65 shaman), so it's by no means difficult at all.  Finishing up everything but the last kill will take you anywhere from 6 to 8 hours depending on if you have port ability between Katta Kastellum and Shadowhaven.  However, the last kill will probably require a solid group since Valdanov Zefveer is not only a rare spawn, but has lots of hp and a 1k lifetap proc.<br />
<br />
Very worthwhile investment.  Too bad it doesn't have resists on it though.<br />
<br />
***And yes, I know this isn't droppable, but the quest is easy and the reward is, in my opinion, better than anything you can buy.</div></div><hr />
