<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerapheus</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, lately, some of my guildmates and I have been discussing a possible AA idea and I wanted to get your opinions of it.<br />
<br />
The AA would basically be a 9-pt AA that would allow the warrior (or knight, after speaking with some guildmates and getting their opinons) the ability to equip a shield with the 2H weapon that they choose.<br />
<br />
Now, I've gotten into an discussion with one of my fellow tanks in the guild, and he says this AA would be grossly overpowering.  What do you all think?   Personally, to me, the ability to use a BoW and the Aegis of Earth would be a great thing for tanks... perhaps considered to be a &quot;bandaid&quot; on the agro problem, but it would seriously improve on our tanking &amp; midigation ability, making us more efficient tanks.<br />
<br />
Thoughts/opinions/disagreements?<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get a weapon that does more damage then dual wielding and has as much stats as both your 1hand weapons combined,<br />
and add to this a shield with insane stats,<br />
and add to this the ability to Furious Bash.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield dies, period. <br />
Not only soe wouldnt want to see that,<br />
but I wouldnt either.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield atm needs a huge upgrade, not a total nerf to oblivion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Bunnie except I think dual wield need more of a fine tune than major upgrade. To balance the (usually) decreased DPS they might want to tweak that or give a little bonus on parry/riposte checks due to having a second weapon. An AA like this one being proposed, especially in light if the SOE/VI expressed desire to possibly institue a block with shields, would kill DW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never really gotten the whole 2hand weapon and shield thing. <br />
<br />
It just doesn't make sense to have to use both hands to wield a weapon, yet still have a (third?) hand to hold the shield.<br />
<br />
I mean logistically it makes no sense. Would it be nice? I guess so, but it would be very unrealistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be strapped to your arm I guess =p<br />
<br />
But like others said, it would kill duel wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaziganthi</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, the aa we need next is summon! Never worry about a gater again ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why add skills, just add class specific items, or do both. Cool item could be used in slam. I get slam :). or kick........ Some gloves and or boots that have spikes, or have a quest to add spikes to users foot. Say it could add dam bonous of 20 or something, might be dumb, but I like it :) <br />
<br />
God, you think with all the stupid ideas out here they could at least try one anyone, I mean I for one am tired of thinking and not acting, but I cant act on it, only they can, putzes....ok sorry done now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights already have the AA that permits them to use a 2hser and also bash.  SKs automatically get the ability when they equip their epic.<br />
<br />
With that AA, Sony has already given 2hers the upgrade important to bash.  IMO Sony ought to simply add that AA to warriors.  <br />
<br />
All your AA would do is permit players to get essentially a second equip slot.  Not cool imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love 2handed bash, but the added stats of both the 2hander and shield, and the dps of the 2hander would be over powered.  2handed bash on the other hand would not be a bad thing at all, and I would definately spend the aa for it.</div></div><hr />
