<br />
1. Keep the Mallet?<br />
2. Get a Barnacle Covered Axe?<br />
3. Get a Black Blade of Tormenting?  (I think I like this less though due to the dot component.)<br />
4. Other<br />
<br />
ALso was wondering, if I get the BCA, should the BCA or Frosty go in primary/secondary.<br />
<br />
Also, any cheap upgrades to my armor (I maybe have 3k or so banked) would be appreciated.  Here's my Magelo:<br />

<br />
but i can tell u that both are nice<br />
<br />
i would say pass the mallet and go for a BCA over the BBoT, you already got the frosty for ur main aggro source, and the BCA has stamina on it, and is a hair faster, and that 100 hate still comes in handy<br />
<br />
also that mallet in primary and a bloodpoint in offhand makes a nice non-MT combo that can dish out some nice dmg,</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Frosty puts out the best DPS of the two, so might as well use it for that too.<br />
<br />
That would be a nice solid combo. Do ya well till you get to big bad meanie monsters.</div></div><hr />
