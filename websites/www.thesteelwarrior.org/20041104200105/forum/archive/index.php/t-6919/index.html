Almoust same as rz 1h just worse aggro proc, but else nice, wonder where its from. Too bad its primary only as rz  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gurunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a complete waste.. it's a big aggro downgrade from DB, plus the stun only works up to 55th level, so it won't even interrupt casting on anything worthwhile... it's *barely* a stat upgrade, and you are excluded from weilding both... wtf?<br />
<br />
So the warrior class weapon is an overall downgrade from time, AND can't even be used with the time weapon...good news for twinks and the rot patrol</div></div><hr />

But well, all in all it's not so bad, it's the top DPS weapon for warrior, also the top one stat wise. It's a step forward on the way out of PoP. I'm just concerned about the farmability of Uqua. Would not be to surprising that Barxt drop a plate BP.</div></div><hr />

JoS is higher dps than that, stats are nice though, people shouldnt expect a mid tier zone (this expansion) to have a weapon thats blows DBoTW away, thats unrealistic. They should change the proc though that one sucks.</div></div><hr />

thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most of the GoD weapons are situational upgrades not 100% upgrades, usually the straight out DPS is better, but the proc itself is worse, this sorta screws warriors, and to a lesser degree Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">dps increase from darkblade isnt much for us.  rangers and rogues can weild their time weapons with their ikkinz weapons which DOES give them a staggering increase in dps.<br />
<br />
yea knights got fucked too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Neg 100 resist check against magic, also a weak point in the proc.  Add to the spiffy elf shoe graphic and you have a winner!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not like were hurting for dps, JoS is as much an increase for us as a darklint is for a ranger if not more, and this weapon will parse out to be atleast 10% more mainhand dps than DBoTW which was already nice dps to begin with, whether thats worth it or not is up to you. Rogues, shrug, I dunno what they parse out to with spineslicer / timeforged.<br />
<br />
What should they do? make the weapon 40/30 or 34/25? That would throw us way outta line. Changing the proc and making it offhandable would be nice, and maybe adding a combat effects mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Who would consider bagging a DBOTWL for this thing, sure it's a slight dps upgrade but not worth it? <br />
<br />
I do agree it seems to be more of a toy, and mostly situational.<br />

So true...and the drop rate is rediculas for the ikkins weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">About the stun of this weapon : <br />
I would not be surprised if developpers 'forgot' again that the basic stun was limited to lvl 55. <br />
They did same for a ranger GoD AA ( frost arrow, 1 sec stun) and we had to talk about it during FanFaire for them to realize they did a mistake about that. Now the stun goes up to lvl 65 with last lvl of AA (well, even after that change, the AA is still crappy, but that's not the subject... ).<br />
<br />
So you warriors may want to let devs know about it ... and btw, it seems they don't read class boards a lot (besides the sony bloards) as issue was stated over and over on ranger's boards before fanfaire</div></div><hr />

I was gonna say that too.  If this weapon looks like a goddamn fucking elf shoe, I, for one, will NEVER touch this stupid thing when, or if, I ever reach this level of content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Time has been very stingy with the DBotW for us. 6 months of weekly forays and we have gotten a whopping 4 to drop. While my BoW and the nifty agro proc from Symbol of the Planemasters holds up reasonably well I find myself looking for dual-wielding alternatives beyond waiting, perhaps eternally, for RZ to give up the goods. With a Barxt kill imminent, this is now a peripheral options. Obviously a JoS is very easy to pickup since they drop like rain. EoE's are common compared to the DB. So i was considering getting and EoE and JoS and finally get over the hump. Yet I am reluctant to do so since I feel the increase in agro would be marginal. Now fleshbiter is another weak alternative. I am inclined to wait it out but a part of me still nagging me to just get it out of the way and go DW.<br />
<br />
This thread indicates that I would be wasting my DKP on anything other than a DB. Has anyone actually gotten their hands on the fleshbiter and can comment firsthand?</div></div><hr />
