<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brigade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else thinking about pre ordering just to get into beta heh?<br />
<br />
I heard already also the game is huge, even in beta, and I am sure they will be adding more city zones, and I even read eventually they will have it so people can be villains also, which means pvp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">arf arf<br />
<br />
PvP - or villainous missions against the AI (the inverse of the heroic missions).<br />
<br />
CoH looks pretty nifty, tho I'm still not seeing how it'll hold my attention for longer than a few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Will let you know. My wife and I pre-ordered and should get Beta Invite on/before April 7th. I will try to do a little wirteup before release date so you guys can decide for yourself. If nothing else it will be cool to spend 3 hours making the costume.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Preordered already. I won't do a writeup tho, as I'm afraid of my own biases (Was surfing their boards in 2002)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I ordered for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1. I have several RL friends doing this game.  Some are quitting their time-enabled EQ characters and selling their accounts now (while they can actually get decent ching).  Some, like me, are going to raid in EQ and play in CoH to see how it is.<br />
<br />
2. CoH has a system that allows a level 40 to group with a level 20 character.  The level 20 is called a &quot;sidekick&quot; which fits perfectly with the superhero genre.  If there was one frustration for me and EQ - the inability to group with a friend that plays 10 hours a week and I play 30 hours a week - this was it.  The level 20 hero will have their abilities scale up to (for example) level 35 when in a certain distance of the level 40 hero.<br />
<br />
3. I can tell you that the play is extremely smooth and well done.  The UI is very clean, IMO.  The character generation is absolutely fucking awesome - and that aint my thing - my thing is the play mechanics.<br />
<br />
4. Instanced and scaled encounters.  Not only are the encounters scaled by level they are scaled to your &quot;archtype&quot; (similar to class).  Most quest stuff seems to be instanced - no kill stealing.<br />
<br />
5. Some will say there is no loot.  But, well, there is...they have things that are called inspirations and enhancements.  Each superhero has abilities - a kick, a mind control, whatever.  These abilities scale with level and have slots for enchancements(similar to slots from ldon stuff but abilities not items).  You get enhancements from completing &quot;story arcs&quot; (quests).  Enhancements &quot;attach&quot; to the abilities thus making your hero stronger - so, no boots of ass kickin - just a +50 damage enchancement that attaches to your kick ability. <br />
<br />
Then there are inspirations.  Think potions.  One shot modifiers that last a short time.<br />
<br />
6. My 12 yo son is into comic book stuff.  I intend to play with him and have fun.<br />
<br />
7. Starting on the ground floor.  I came in way late into the EQ game - I don't like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
The one big innovation I point to is the ability for the power gamer and the casual gamer to group.  Its pretty cool.<br />
<br />
I would say this game will only mildly hurt EQ if at all.  Now WoW -that's a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brigade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think world of warcraft will attract mostly younger people, so EQ could lose most of those.  <br />
I think CoH will definately be a sleeper hit though, at least longer than SWG thought it was a hit.<br />
I havent heard anything about the sidekick, but that does sound very nice, as I work 50+ hours a week and go to school full time, and it would be nice to actually play with my cousins or whoever else I know who always is hardcore in games.<br />
I agree with the person above though, it is worth 50$ just to create a character's costume, and give them a unique name.<br />
Forgot to mention also that I believe WoW is way over hyped like SWG was, and well my prediction is it will fall flat on its face, and with blizzards reputation it will be hacked by leeto script kiddies within a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Blizzard has done an odd thing.  It is an open early phase beta now.  So you will get reviews way in advance of production release.  Somewhere here there is a link to the Graffe writeup - which is very nicely done.  Is WoW over-hyped?  Probably.<br />
<br />
The WoW game is a ground up new game engine design.  Other Blizzard stuff was rehashed.  I doubt the hacking of it will be any more prevalent than any other MMoRPG.<br />
<br />
Oh, forgot to add.  City of Heroes is made by the same company that has the largest world-wide MMoRPG (lineage).  So they are not clueless about MMoRPG's.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
Once I get the actual beta and go hog wild I'll post more.  I am looking for that fun factor again.  (like a next hit of crack....hmmm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I played the pen and paper game &quot;champions&quot; for a long time.  If this has half the value of that it could be a very very good game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a friend who got into the beta about a month ago and he also preordered, well he got his preorder beta account about a week ago and has since given me his original beta account. The game is a lot of fun, plenty of things to do right now, but as been said before, i'm not sure how long it will hold my interest, EQ has held it due to loot and equipment upgrades with raids, since there really isnt equipment upgrades in CoH it may not hold water for me for to long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A couple of clarifications should be made about CoH:<br />
  Yes, having a character be a sidekick will allow a lower-level character to join with a higher-level character for some fighting fun, but regular (non-sidekick) grouping is within a very limited range of levels (just three, near as I can see).<br />
  City of Heroes is distributed by NCSoft (the Lineage people), but it was developed by Cryptic Studios, not NC.<br />
  The pre-redesign CoH game (the redesign took place well over a year ago, before anyone was ever in a Beta) was an almost complete copy of Champions (the pen-and-paper superhero RPG). It has since gone more &quot;mainstream&quot;, with generic classes and logical power sets being grouped together. It's still fun, though.<br />
Personally, I expect that CoH will hold my interest marginally for a while, at least. From the point of genre and personal character involvement, it does not compete with EQ and should not be compared as such. WoW, on the other hand, is a direct competitor, though I'm waffling on whether I'll try that one at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This game is hella fun.<br />
<br />
BTW, so far, tankers are debatebly considered the best solo class....thought you all might get a kick outta that. :D <br />
<br />
For giggles, I'll post more details when the NDA is lifted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Forgot to mention also that I believe WoW is way over hyped like SWG was, and well my prediction is it will fall flat on its face, and with blizzards reputation it will be hacked by leeto script kiddies within a week. <br />
<br />
SWG was overhyped by the people who made it.  WoW is being &quot;overhyped&quot; by the people who are playing it.  There's a huge difference.  <br />
<br />
Plus anyone who thinks an MMORPG is anything like battlenet clearly has no idea what they're talking about to begin with.  MMO -- Server Side, Battle Net - Client side.  Capice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ill go ahead and throw in my thoughts on CoH as Ive been in beta a while now. <br />
<br />
Yes, Sidekicking is pretty neat, it does address that age old issue of you outleveling your friends, you are unable to use this ability until you reach level 10.<br />
<br />
Gonna just straight down to the bottom on the &quot;best solo&quot; class thing. I dont see tankers being the best solo even in the slightest. <br />
1. Right now there is issues with Blasters that have taken Flight at level 6, there is a few mobs in the game that spawn in packs of 10 or 12 that have no ranged ability. A blaster with AE nukes can effectivly hover over these mobs and nuke them and gain 1/2 a level per spawn. I myself got 8 levels off these in 2 hours. This is in Perez Park if your wondering, but wont give away the location cause it doesnt need to be anymore congested then it already is.<br />
<br />
2. Scrappers are better solo then a tanker because of their DPS. If you tack on Regeneration as one of your main skill sets until about level 12 you can take on 3 mobs at once effectively, especially if you use Spines and boost up the AE attack in damage and reuse time.<br />
<br />
3. My defender is a GREAT soloer, I think maybe the best I have made. I took Kinetics and Psychic Blast, now Repulse is the reason I took Kinetics, they cant get anywhere near me, and when they do I just life tap them and heal up, in the mean time I'm using an array of different blasts to take them down. On average I can fight 5 to 6 mobs without an issue.<br />
<br />
4. Controllers... I have not played one cause they are so low on HP, but my friend does play one, and they have a power that is so totally overpowered he is determined its broken. They can walk in to a mission and see say 10 mobs there, they have an ability that will make the NPCs go like crazy and start killing each other, when their target dies the effect wears off. you can keep doing this until you have a nice number of mobs you want to kill. The crazy thing is this generates absolutely NO agro. The down side of this is you get no exp from the mobs that are killed by the other crazed NPC's but there is also no risk when you are fighting.<br />
<br />
Ok, enough on that topic.<br />
<br />
This game is fun, I have played it extensivly, but it doesnt give me the same excitement as EQ, but that is because it is a totally different type of game. I would say if you are looking for something new and fresh, try CoH.<br />
<br />
Another thing with CoH that many people dont know is how the leveling system works. Basically you fight until you have enough exp to get to the next level, when you do your exp indicator gets an up arrow on it, which means you need to go train up. You have to go meet with NPC's such as the Back Alley Brawler to get your level up. The cool thing with CoH is you get something every level. On all the even levels you get to pick a new power, at level 6 is when you can choose your first additional powerset such as Flight, Jumping, Leadership ect. But you get a new power every 2 levels. Each power has one slot on it so you can place enhancements such as a Damage modifier, Reuse Timer, Endurance Reduction, Extended Range ect. Now on every odd level instead of getting a new power you get to add an additional slot to one of your powers. So for example you have Energy Blast as a power and you put a Damage enhancement in the upgrade slot, your Energy Blast now does more damage, you can keep upgrading that Damage enhancement as long as you have a high level enhancement to put in there. But now your Energy blast doesnt refresh as fast as youd like, so at level 3 you add another slot on it so you can add a Reuse enhancement, now you tack a few of those in there and you can almost chain cast it for good damage. <br />
<br />
This is basically your trade off for spells equipment that you have in EQ, its not quite exciting as getting uber item001 but it can make you very powerful.<br />
<br />
Yes, at release there is only 40 levels, but patience will bring more, its already been stated.<br />
<br />
The mission system is nice, it gets you all over the place so you can see the city and I do like the instancing in this game, but to often during beta the instances have broken.<br />
<br />
One thing I would like to say about its look. I am a first person player, in EQ and any other game I play first person, in CoH I cant make myself play in first person, my character just looks so neat using his powers I wave to watch. This game is far far from an eye sore that some other games come out in, its a very nice looking game and the power effect can be breathtaking in some cases.<br />
<br />
Well, this is all for now, ill keep watch here just in case I see something else that I would like to post on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It, IMO, is a cross between a console game and a MMoRPG.  The combat is very fast paced.  Personally, I love it combat wise compared to EQ. <br />
<br />
And that is a good thing since the proportion of fighting is much higher in coh than EQ.  I hate crafting.  I hate camping for rare drops.  I hated inability to kill off greens without a healer of some sort.  CoH has addressed all that for me.<br />
<br />
There is no camping in the game as the baddies will never spawn where you are standing.  So an XP group needs to keep moving.  You cannot just sit in a spot and pull to it.<br />
<br />
Graphics are decent.  Interaction with the citizins is pretty cool.  As you are walking by NPC's they will tell you the time, tell you about YOUR latest killing of a street gang and how it helped them.  In addition, as you pass by the &quot;bad guys&quot; you catch snippits of conversations (clues) as to what is really going on in the bad guy world.<br />
<br />
At release level cap is 40 and the first planned update 1 month later will have the level cap to 50.<br />
<br />
Every class is somewhat soloable - not easily, but it is doable.  Many alpha &amp; beta testers felt tanker is one of the more soloable classes with controller being second (controller=chanter (&amp; to some extent cleric/shaman) like).<br />
<br />
Annoying aspects right now: only 2 chat windows where everything goes - annoys me - then again, I was a freek in EQ with 8 chat windows and 3-4 tell boxes going all the time.<br />
<br />
As previously stated, the only real innovation is the Side kick system.  Strip it down and its another MMoRPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">boy was i wrong :D **see next page**.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">FYI Peeps the NDA is lifted lets get more dirt on this thing.<br />
<br />
http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/item211.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Level 7 Science Scrapper, Level 6 Science Blaster, Level 5 Magic Controller, Level 4 Technology Defender here. What I've seen so far is low end solo play. Damn work!<br />
<br />
 Anyways, let no one fool you - with decent skill, ANY class is solo capable, and ANY class is capable of soloing missions. In a system where 3 same level mobs are the equivalent of one PC for power, soloability is huge, at least up to where I'm at.<br />
<br />
 Missions can have a cookie cutter feel to them - my two Science guys both got undead missions early on, and the levels were VERY similar. Then the game throws you a curveball, like the mission my Technology Defender just did, where the map had three floors, and actually stuck the hard mobs in the front of the map - the end boss was green, but the lieutenants by the door were yellow. Whether this is beta bugginess or deliberate, still a bit jarring.<br />
<br />
 Mobs are plentiful to hunt in the city zones, and the system of experience sharing helps to avoid the dread KSing. The fact that random mobs drop the Enhancements and Inspirations, and that there is no such thing as 'rare loot' also helps.<br />
<br />
 Making a character is just a complete blast, and if EQ is where you came from, you'll be doubly impressed by both the equipment variety and the color options open to you. The choosing of powers seems a bit restrictive, but when you hit level 6, it gets REAL strategic. Do you opt to open up the third power set where flight and miscellaneous other good powers reside, or do you stick with your base power sets? Do you open enhancement slots on your bread and butter powers or do you extend the exotic ones? The choices, while simple, are vast enough that even if you find someone who picked the exact same origin and archetype as you AND the same powersets, chances are you two won't have similar abilities, and even if you did, both would be different based on your level and enhancements.<br />
<br />
 There is a definite progression feel to leveling as a new toon - both in the quick acquisition of powers and the constant desire to keep upgrading your enhancements. The fact that you can 'outgrow' your enhancements gives you a good reason to keep building influence - if you're unlucky in drops, you can always buy the enhancements that give you the edge.<br />
<br />
 Graphics are good and solid, Max Payneish to my eyes. Very little lag, except for the time they stress tested by putting 5200 on a server at once, heh  :eek:  The fact that even city zones are instanced is a great help. Can't find any Hellions up? Go to the monorail and switch zones! Too much lag in Atlas Park? Go to Atlas Park 3!<br />
<br />
 It's not perfect by any means, but it is definitely worth a look if you <br />
<br />
 - are tired of the gear grind<br />
 - play in shorter spans than the average EQ player<br />
 - dislike camping<br />
 - like comics<br />
<br />
 EDIT - anyone from the boards playing, my toons are<br />
<br />
 Night Fighter<br />
 Son of Tesla<br />
 Spectrometer<br />
 The Venetian<br />
<br />
 Give me a holler!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i bought the pre-order..someone shoot me :D <br />
too many people i know from varoius communities are giving too many good reviews of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My wife is happy I am doing CoH now.<br />
<br />
You can get &quot;something&quot; done in 30-60 min chunks.<br />
<br />
So my life is better - the wife is happy and I can do my on-line gaming thing.<br />
<br />
WARNING: the XP starts to be a grind at 10th level esp if you solo.  However, if you group (duo at least) it flys fast still.<br />
<br />
PARTHA's review is accurate of all classes being &quot;easily&quot; soloable up to 10.<br />
<br />
(L16 blaster, L10 tanker, L12 scrapper, L10 controller - and have played a friends bumped alpha tested toon L37 at present)<br />
<br />
L38 Raid:<br />
tested a mob that requires people to be L38 - will require &quot;most of a supergroup&quot; to get it done at release (supergroup(guild) max size is 72)<br />
<br />
With my toons at the levels they are at I have seen the beginning story lines of several themes and I can say they are good reading/fiction/comic book like - which they should be.<br />
<br />
If you like combat, dislike crafting, dislike camping it just might be a game you would enjoy.  Soloing is doable but doesn't tap the really fun part of the game.<br />
<br />
Cut all the bullshit what is the bottom line:<br />
This game is fun.<br />
<br />
/shoot Shikarii<br />
<br />
OMG TAUNT WORKS in this game!<br />
Thought I'd add that lil snippit. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have been in CoH Beta and the NDA has been lifted. If you are unfamiliar with CoH, relax, we all are.<br />
<br />
REQUIREMENTS:<br />
800mhz P2 or better. Geforce2/ATI 8500 or better. 128 ram. I know many of you are saying an ATI 7200/7500 will spank most Geforce2's, but it has to do with 'OpenGL' support in the gfx card and drivers. Even at minimum computer specs, this game is very playable, and with more memory/cpu/card power, it only gets better. You can choose Video settings, and right now I have everything maxed. It looks like a neon wet-dream ( ok, maybe not that good, but still ).<br />
<br />
Character Creation:<br />
First you choose your Origin ( Mutant, Magic, Science, Natural, and Technology). Origin is important in what kind of missions you get and what sort of Enhancements you will use ( more on Enhancements later). Next you select your Archetype, which is basically Class in EQ. Archetype determines your choices of powers: Blaster, Tanker, Defender, Controller and Scrapper. This may sound like a limited system, but each Archetype chooses their primary and secondary power sets in the beginning. There are tons of combinations just among these.<br />
<br />
Costume Creation:<br />
First you choose your sex/size. Females from 4' to 8' tall, males the same, and HUGE size males ( Hulk, Juggernaut etc). muscle size from Lean/Athletic to Musclebound bodybuilder. The choices are pretty great. You have literally millions of combinations for costumes. I have yet to see two people who look the same unless they are trying to clone a trademarked comic hero.<br />
<br />
Starting Out: Instanced Zones-<br />
You start out in Atlas Park, an area of the city with huge monuments to the heroes of the past and present. Each zone has multiple instances of itself. Atlas Park has AP1-5. If AP1 is too laggy, choose AP2 or higher, chances are you will easily find an instance that has an acceptable amount of Hero to Villain ratio for killing. <br />
<br />
Changing Instances: <br />
To change from one Public instanced zone to another you can goto a zoneline to another area of the city, or hit the subway/train station. When you cross the line or click the door you will have a quick pop-up menu asking what zone/instance. It is all very simple. Plus, you zone way quicker than in EQ. <br />
<br />
Contacts and Missions:<br />
A contact is a friend or acquaintance you have been introduced to. You will recieve missions from them ( quests ) as well as be able to buy Enhancements/Inspirations ( more on those in a bit ). Some missions are to 'arrest/defeat' 10 specific kinds of criminals, such as Hellions and Skulls ( petty thugs addicted to 'Supradine', a drug that gives them temporary powers etc ). After completing a mission you return to the contact. You get XP and Influence ( cash ) after every mob you defeat, as well as mission completion xp. You can also XP by saving random ppl in distress on the street.<br />
<br />
Enhancements and Inspirations:<br />
An Inspiration is like an EQ potion, but it is instant casting and lasts 1 minute. Never fear, combat lasts from 3 to 20 seconds. This game is fast paced and fun. You can have up to 10 Inspirations at a time. Don't be afraid to use them, as you can purchase a new one with your influence.<br />
Enhancements are gem icons you can link to a specific power. You can get 'Endurance reduction, 'Dmg Increase' etc etc. It is a very simple and complex system. These enhancements can be traded to friends for free, in exchange for other enhancements or influence or inspirations. You can also sell them back to a store and get influence to purchase a different one.<br />
<br />
Death:<br />
In CoH they use Rikti Technology left over from the war ( aliens ) to summon a hero to a hospital a moment before they die. Basically if you fall over you can choose to spend a Revive Inspiration, get Rezzed by a friend, or click the hospital. You can also trade while you are down, so a friend can loan you a Revive Inspiration. Near-death creates an XP Debt. Basically you can not loose a level because that is silly, but instead you will spend half your xp earned to pay off the current debt. It isn't as bad as it sounds.<br />
<br />
Travel:<br />
To travel in CoH, everyone starts with SPRINT, a minor endurance cost to run faster than the average human. At level 6 you can choose a minor travel power, such as Hover, Combat Leaping, or Teleport Foe ( reverse CotH). At level 14 you get a major transportation power: Super Leap ( Hulk style Leaping on buildings ), Flight, Teleport Self, Super speed, Invisibility etc etc.<br />
<br />
Getting New Powers:<br />
Every other level you get to choose a new power from either Primary or Secondary ( those you started with ) or from a Power Pool ( those you get later in life ). Between these levels you get an Enhancement Slot, where you can put 1 more enhancement on a current power. It is a very cool system, and you always feel like your character is growing, because he/she is.<br />
<br />
Old Powers:<br />
Older powers never become useless. They are a part of your character, and remain a valid power through their development. They will get more powerful with age. this is a relief, as you will not feel as though you have to save choices for later in life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thats it from me. I am long winded, but I hope this gives you a good preview of City of Heroes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dizastor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">So is the only way to get into beta to buy the pre-release? <br />
Lineage 2 was simply sign-up and get a code(or 4) in your email box.<br />

BTW has the wipe been set yet on all-servers? I heard rumors it's on the 22nd? i should check their boards.<br />
<br />
For those people who are into old-style comic books; and superheroes and villians and stuff..this game is for you. It's definately not a comparison to EQ; it's more along the lines of a cleaner, easier interfaced and better running Anarchy Online. It's a blast. Figuratively and Literally.</div></div><hr />

Just curious, when did you play AO?  I ask cause I just picked it up a week or two ago and I've been having a great time with it so far.  I've heard it was pretty bad there for a while but it looks like they have put a lot of work into fixing it.</div></div><hr />

Beta up until 2 months after release; I had a level 115 MA on RK1 which I levelled by exploiting and whatnot and ( get this ) reporting each and every single incident. The game was so laggy; buggy; and overall a wholesome piece of flaming poo :D.<br />
I've heard it was improved as well; but; Funcom can kiss my ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hehe I dunno when it was released, but looks like it has come a LOOOONG way from when you played.  Perhaps to far.  Quite a few folks beefing about how easy it is to level and how many noobs are being found in the upper end game (damn i swear i seen that before now if i could just remember where.... ;p)  <br />
<br />
For now, beating stuff with my lvl 16 Enf fills in for my EQ playing time (SoE can kiss my tail)...</div></div><hr />

If that's what you want, hold out for a while. Myself, I just might pick it up for some fun time. I don't play EQ much anymore, now that I don't have the time to raid/be in a raid guild (/wave Koko, Binn, Doz). Something light and fun like this just might be the way to go... and lord knows I like bonkin' heads!

I am writing this right now and boy am I tired.  I am lacking in sleep.<br />
<br />
Sunday starting at 11:45am I started attempting to log in to the servers.  At 12:00 on the dot they were up.  I couldn't get in until 12:50 (50 minutes  - the bastards!)  I played a significant amount through 3:30pm yesterday.<br />
<br />
On Sunday I had zero lag and no link-deads (mapserver disconnects in this game).<br />
<br />
There were some issues in the instanced missions when I was in full groups (8 players).  Went LD 3-4 times in the last 3 days in that manner.<br />
<br />
Right now I am pissed I pre-ordered from Best Buy as in they wont be shipping until later today (maybe) and i will be without CoH for 2 maybe 3 days.  Although, I can use the break.<br />
<br />
Then again, this is an effective way to spread out the login server load over the course of the week.<br />

Judging solely by that trinket, they've done a hella good job putting a system together that allows you to be the cartoon you wanna be without there being a *perfect path* to the uber-toon, and without anyone getting significantly more powerful than anyone else at their level.  Impressive - and an impressively simple approach.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Well, you guys have done it now.  After hearing the glowing reviews I figured, what the heck I'll give it a try.  Two days later I now have a level 9 tanker on Champion server.  The game is very slick and lots of fun.  And, something I like, even a tanker can solo.  In fact I gather a tanker is the second best solo archetype in the game.<br />
<br />
Anyway, they've done a great job with the graphics and the ability to design your character to have almost any look you can imagine.  I went with an old school almost &quot;X-man&quot; look, but I've seen lots of other very creative looking characters.  The folks who make a super hero look like an albino in a sport coat baffle me though. :D<br />
<br />
I find the enhancement and inspiration system to be very cool.  Of course no one knows exactly what the enhancements do except in a very general sense, so you never know which kind of enhancement is best.  Should you go with reduce endurance, increased damage, greater range, or what?  Seems like every thing is going to be &quot;best&quot; guess for a while.  Which isn't necesarrily bad, but I'd hate to find out down the road that the enhancement I favored the most turned out to have all the value of charisma in EQ. :P<br />
<br />
What I'm really hoping for is that as you progress the game doesn't become more and more insanely difficult where you reach a point where light greens tear you a new one if you solo and don't even try an even con white.  I really hope they leave solo players the ability to take on even cons and even yellow cons.<br />
<br />
At least with the tanker, it makes a big difference which mob type I take on.  Some types I can take on 3 or 4 even cons and still come out on top.  Even a yellow and a couple of whites and be the winner.  Others, I get two evens and they woop on me.  But, over all very slick indeed.<br />
<br />
On the down side, I find that the server gets laggy frequently and I seem to lose connection a lot when trying to fiddle with enhancements, which of course I'm doing all the time.  And it seems like the missions are a little whacked.  Some are just right for my tanker.  Others have me going after mobs clearly over his head.  There was one where I walked through and beat down all the minions with little problem, but then the boss mob had a flurry attack that he fired off pretty regularly that killed me twice.  I would have called it quits if I had failed a third time.   And I also had one mission assigned to me at level 7 that is clearly a mission for a level 10 or higher with a group (it's in perez park if anyone knows that area).  So I would say that the missions, while seeming to be good overall, can be a little uneven.<br />
<br />
But if you find the missions aren't your cup of tea, there are tons and I mean tons of mobs around to kill.  I have to admit that I didn't always feel very hero like as I stood there out of range and conned the mobs.  Hmm, 3 whites, 2 yellows, and a red.  Sorry Ma'am, I'm going to have to pass on saving you.  My medical bills are just a little too high this month.  But then there were times where I waded into a group of 4 or 5 whites and opened up a can of woop ass on them, even if I finished with just a sliver of health left.  Definitely caught the hero feeling then.<br />
<br />
One of the things they have really captured and something I think is greatly missing from EQ these days, is a feeling of power.  You really feel like you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.  Well, okay, maybe two or three, but you get the idea.  Although, speaking of leaping, I found it a tad bit annoying when first starting out to be told in the hand book that I could jump higher than an average person, to then find that all the villians could jump over fences and walls I couldn't.  But once I got super leap, all better.  Still, if we can out run them from the beginning, why shouldn't we be out jumping them as well?  One of the mysteries of the CoH universe I suppose.<br />
<br />
But back to the feeling of power.  I have to say that they've made it feel good to play a game again, and not like you're an eight year old with a sharpened stick going up against the incredible Hulk and just hoping that someone can keep you on life support long enough for him to die.  I really hope they keep that feeling, it's what makes it fun and worth playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well glatius glad you are having a great time like the rest of us.    With that Prez Mission I am stuck on that one too.  That zone is crazy  mobs packed 10 deep it even warns you that you need a group in the mission details.  I heard in Prez Park EXP is insane since all the killing you have to do.   I also heard that soloing becomes a little difficuly after level 10 but after 15 or 16 it becomes easier.     I love playing my tanker great class I went with the warmace with invulnerability as my primary power pretty sweet combo IMO.  I have no problem so far soloing but I am only level 8 so I will see how that goes in later levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I love this game,  probably the best game I ever played.   I am having so much fun, the grinding of levels should not be considered grinding since it is actually fun.  The missions are well done IMO.</div></div><hr />

One thing tho, when you fight the druid guys in perez, if you have hover USE IT, the life mages commit suicide when they get low and it takes a fair amount of HP, but its a ground level AoE, so if you hover it doesnt hit ya.<br />

<br />
Just picked up a copy of COH today, have been just messing around but it seems pretty cool. <br />
<br />
I have a quick question regarding the camera settings. I am sure there is probably an extremely easy answer but I have failed to find it. (Thinking maybe I  have the salt shaker right in front of you but you can't see it deal going on.) <br />
<br />
Anyway, I was wondering if anyone could please explain what the command/setting or whatever you need to press(hold) to get the camera to pan around your character. <br />
<br />
Meaning, the general camera view is from behind the character, you can scroll in and out, angle up and down. I know how to do all that. <br />
<br />
Unless I lost my mind I did do it once in game (panned the camera around my character so I could get a good look at the front(face) of my character and what was behind) but tried it a second, third, etc with no luck.<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />

A-fucking-men!<br />
<br />
Of course no one knows exactly what the enhancements do except in a very general sense, so you never know which kind of enhancement is best. Should you go with reduce endurance, increased damage, greater range, or what?<br />
<br />
The min/maxers (read: 10+ hr day people) are at it.  I will say make sure you have at least one accuracy in your offensive powers.  Hitting or missing burns endurance - the same amount either way.  There are certain percentages to the enhancers &amp; inspirations.<br />
<br />
At level 12 head to Steel Canyon and purchase your dual origon enhancers - OMG the diff they make.  You will need to find the stores that sell the items for your origin though.  At ALL stores in SC you are able to sell enhancements.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I'm really hoping for is that as you progress the game doesn't become more and more insanely difficult where you reach a point where light greens tear you a new one if you solo and don't even try an even con white. I really hope they leave solo players the ability to take on even cons and even yellow cons.<br />
<br />
Last night my L18 Blaster took on the boss in a mission 2 levels higher - solo.  I managed to clear everything out so I had lots of room to kite around and do the blaster thing (run like baby).<br />
<br />
4 luck, 2 acc, 1 dmg inspiration prior to the fight<br />
<br />
The boss was a Blaster also.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I managed to stay away so as not to get melee damage (melee dmg=insta death for blaster) he has like 10% left I was about to die I used my last health insp to stay alive.  My big gun was ready to fire.  Fuck - it missed.  I ran around a corner and let powers regen back.  I got two shots off when he rounded the corner he got one off as he died.  I died thereafter...but the mission was complete.<br />
<br />
For me, it was one of the better game experiences I have ever had.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: Yes the missions stay soloable - some are very very difficult though.  (I also duoed (sidekicked) at level 39.  I was frequently fighting by myself as the defender had his hands full - I can say it seems to scale well at higher levels - ot it did in beta)<br />
<br />
The head dude of Cryptic has stated their goal is to have bosses be soloable with a 50-50 chance of winning using a full tray of inspirations.  EVEN con bosses.<br />
<br />
 the life mages commit suicide when they get low and it takes a fair amount of HP<br />
<br />
***SPOILER***<br />
Life mages have a very specific AI.  And low hp isn't when they explode.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The explode when:<br />
the group they are with are defeated and they are the last one standing<br />
OR<br />
2 people are in melee range of the life mage<br />
(pretty cool huh)<br />
<br />
Strat on them:<br />
1. Kill them first<br />
2. 1 tanker on life mage - everyone else stay back - blast away<br />
<br />
but then the boss mob had a flurry attack that he fired off pretty regularly that killed me twice.<br />
<br />
I HATE scrapper bosses when I play a melee.  Their dps is sick.<br />
<br />
One of the things they have really captured and something I think is greatly missing from EQ these days, is a feeling of power.  <br />
<br />
Amen.  Very well put.  Wait until you take your travel power at 14 (you did open one up in the general pool power - right, RIGHT!?)<br />
<br />
I felt extremely powerful flying to my missions - no more random shootings on me - a wondeful thing indeed.<br />
<br />
Steel canyon is HARD as hell, even the purse snatchers can fly<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Couple of general pointers:<br />
<br />
1. on bosses luck (&amp; discipline) insp are your friend - if they aren't hitting you life is good.<br />
<br />
2. if you are melee you will want to plan on taking stamina at 20th level.  Unfortunately this means taking 2 of the prior powers to open up virtually unlimited stamina.  It is overpowered by itself - but 3 power slots to get a huge benefit balances it out supposedly.  Every tanker NEEDS stamina for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i already have a clawn scrapper, but i want to start another, should i go with katana, broadsword or something else? kinda looking for a set that will = quick kills on even cons, even if it does cost a bit of endurance, and what is a good secondary power set for a scrapper that likes to solo? my current scrapper is very group reliant cause even with all my invincability powers i get stomped</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it is, then I really goofed up putting 5 enhancements slots on my defensive primary power. *grin*  I figured if my primary ability is to take damage, then I want to take lots and lots of damage.  But hell, I have no idea if reinforcing it that much really makes a difference or if I'd have been fine with only one or two levels of it.  Still, I can tell when I have temporary invulnerability up (not the highly reinforced power) because it will take a machine gun shot that would normally do 3 rounds of 4 damage and reduces it to 3 rounds of 2 damage.  If just flicking that switch makes that much difference I assume that reinforcing my primary defensive ability must give benefits.<br />
<br />
And besides it makes me feel good to see 5 slots all enhanced to 10++ at level 11. *grin*  But I do find that my limiting factor is endurance more than anything.  I've actually stood there, toe to toe with a third white con after defeating two, only firing off an attack every second or third opportunity because I simply didn't have enough endurance to do it more often.  It really must look like two exhausted boxers standing in a ring taking occassional pokes at each other when they can manage to lift their arms. *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">There is no &quot;wrong&quot; way to enhance yourself.<br />
<br />
However, are you a grouper or a soloer?<br />
<br />
What is your character in a role-play sense?<br />
<br />
Scrapper by definition is high damage output.  If you are going to solo a good amount defensive improvements make sense.  If you are grouping and can rely on a tank or 2 to hold aggro all damage, accuracy, and recharge may be the way.<br />
<br />
I believe (my opinion only) they intended scrappers to NOT be in the middle of the fray.  One of the best scrapper tactics in full groups is to hang back near the blasters.  Inevitably, the blaster will draw aggro (in fact I get aggro from a pack if we use no powers and we walk into a group of mobs - I learned this in a mission with a full group - we went up the elevators and got ambushed - I was dead in .04 second  :D  ) -- of course since I am a blaster I want all scrappers to save my ass - so I am biased here  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
If you want to be in the fray expect more deaths.  Enhancing your defensive may work.<br />
<br />
My opinion on enhancements is to think how you will play the character.  Then enhance your strengths.  My blaster is damage, accuracy, and recharge.  I am a Huge gun made of weak glass.  Give me even cons and a place to hide/run and I can kill 10-14 mobs easily in a short period of time.  However, it's risky stuff so the hospital is where I forward my mail....then again, i am out of xp debt very quickly.<br />
<br />
My fav scrapper is dark/dark.  The endurance drain is really bad (worse than others) until you get stamina.  So you would have to tough it out to 20th at least to get that.<br />
<br />
What I love is you can enhance yourself to tune your toon ( :D  ) to your play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">well currently on my claw scrapper i have a total of 3 augment spaces on basic melee defense(1 innate, 2 from level ups) with 11++ in each, its always active, as for melee i have 1 innate and 3 level ups on my power strike, does about 60 damage at level 10 if i use it will follow up(lowers defense and i gain acurracy) 2 of them are damage, 1 refresh time and 1 acurracy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">However, are you a grouper or a soloer?<br />
<br />
I think I'm more a soloer by nature and by the requirements of my system.  I find that if you have 10 mobs and 6 players all within a confined space, my system gets very laggy/slow to respond.  Much like big raids in EQ would sometimes do, you don't know the mob is dead until 30 seconds after it hits the floor, kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Also right now groups in CoH are, from what I've seen, really bad.  I've done a grand total of three groups.  One had the leader take a group of level 8s or so into a zone for level 10+.  Needless to say we got shredded pretty bad.  The other two were in Perez Park.  Mostly it consisted of running around from group to group of mobs with little or no organization.  In one group we rushed a group of the undead, well lets say I rushed it at the direction of the leader, since I was the first in contact.  Apparently there was one or two of those exploding undead in the group because I was on the ground and dead faster than I could respond, literally.  I hung around long enough to see that the group survived that encounter then teleported to the hospital and on my way back I'm pretty sure the entire group ate it, although no one would actually say.   The leader did unexpectedly show up in the same zone I was in though and soon there after logged without a word.<br />
<br />
At least if I solo I either know that I stand a pretty good chance of winning against what I'm going up against or I've made sure that I have an opportunity to run if it starts going against me.  I rarely end up dying if I'm on my own, although I do beat feet from time to time when I misjudge a situation.  But my succcesses far out number my failures.  That's not the case with the few groups I've experienced.  And it really sucks having to work off an experience debt you wouldn't have gotten if you were on your own.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure you're right.  It's kind of the same problem as in EQ though, you don't have any idea if a group is any good when you hit the follow button.  For myself, most of the time I'd rather solo than have to be the leader and put up with the crap leaders put up with.  And I'd rather solo than put up with a bad leader or a crappy group.  And a good leader can make a big difference if the team will listen.  But I've run into far too many people in online games that are rotten leaders and rotten followers.  When I join a group, I'm perfectly willing to do my best to be a good follower, but then that means the leader kind of has to lead....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Okay, some random thoughts.<br />
<br />
First off, the ladies that are always getting their purses snatched, they seem to be able to hold onto those purses just fine as the thug is trying to tear them from their hands, why do they need a hero?  Seems like they should be able to just open up a can of whoop-ass on him.<br />
<br />
Been playing my tanker and a blaster.  The blaster is level 8 and has hoover.  Talk about making things easy.  Most of the thugs have pretty weak ranged attaks so once you take out the one or two in the group with decent ranged attack you can hoover, have the thugs just gather under you and pick them off one by one.  Of course this doesn't work so well against clockworks and the reapers....<br />
<br />
With my tanker I've been stuck on two missions which both have final boss thugs that are identical.  They dot, life leach me when their health gets low for a good chunk, and have flurry attacks.  I just can't seem to beat them and it's frustrating.  Their damage output is so much greater than mine that even though I can take a lot of damage, I can't beat them down as quickly as they do me.  And the life leach is just evil.  I've tried inspirations, I've tried quasi-kiting them, I've tried go full bore beat down, I've tried everything I can think of, but since I have to get in melee range to hurt them and they do so much more melee output, I just can't seem to find anything that works.  Suggestions would be welcome.<br />
<br />
Comparing the blaster to the tanker, I think they were wrong in the handbook, I think if played well the blaster is a far better soloer than the tanker, although the tanker does well.  But the blaster's DPS is just sick.  At level 4 my blaster had attacks doing the same damage as my level 15 tanker.  Combine that with judicious running and hoovering, and you have one heck of a soloing machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I know there is an inspiration that ups your &quot;resists&quot;. Might want to give it a try against the life leech if you haven't already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The boost to resists only increases your resistance to immobilization, sleep, disorient, and hold as per the handbook.  I don't think this life leech attack is any of those, since it seems to act much as life tap for an EQ SK.  Although I did try it before I read up on it, and it didn't seem to help.</div></div><hr />

Murk Eidolons from Vahzilok missions? Their shadow melee can be pretty fierce.<br />
<br />
Suggestions: <br />
1- Outlevel the mission. Come back when the boss is now an even con. Their melee goes down a tick, so it's less overall damage, and they miss more. You might be able to withstand the onslaught better.<br />
<br />
2- Dull Pain, if you're an invulnerable tanker. :-)<br />
<br />
3- Bring a friend. Like a controller or a blaster. You can clear out the entire mission but the boss, then get a friend in there and boom, easy kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I ended up doing.  Went back last night, after gaining two levels, and the light red boss mob at 14 was now a white con at 16.  I beat him down with little effort.  I'd also added haymaker to my punch and jab in the meantime, which increased my DPS significantly and he missed on his flurries a lot more often.  Cleared out both missions.  It's a shame though, I would have preferred to have done it when it was more &quot;level appropriate&quot; but just couldn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">It happens sometimes, where you hit a boss that may, say, be easy for a controller or a blaster that is level appropriate to solo, but hard for a tanker. Or easy for an invulnerable/energy tanker, but hard for a fire/battle axe tanker.<br />
<br />
The quickest way to overcome that is to simply ask for a friend to come help. Like a blaster friend who can lay the smack down pretty quick on a single target. Think of it as Superman using his JLA signalwatch to bring Aquaman in, since Superman can't talk to whales.<br />

And I think I figured out what I need to be doing that I wasn't.  It seems that the inspiration buffs stack, which I don't recall being stated in the handbook.  By that I mean you can fire off more than one accuracy inspiration, more than one luck inspiration, and so on, and they seem to stack increasing the overall percentage, or at least they give you additional buff icons which seems to imply you get the additional percentages.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I took down the Eidolon with only a little bit of trouble after stacking a tray of inspirations on my toon and using one heal inspiration.</div></div><hr />

On really tough bosses i use 3-4 luck insp.  It is funny as hell when you stand there and they wail away and can't touch you at all.  For the 30 seconds anyway.

<br />
Yeah, it does.  But it sucks enderance like a crack hoe sucks a pipe.  I've got some tough choices in the next few levels.  I still need resist elements on my defense side and it would be sweet to get provoke so I have effectively AE taunt for when I group.  But I also need to enhance my stamina, which requires a pretty serious slot commitment.  Can I hold out on the stamina until my mid or late 20s or should I be getting it as quickly as I can?  I've not yet decided.<br />
<br />
And I've been adding dual enhancements as quickly as I can scrape together the influence for them, but they're expensive as hell and since they don't drop or at least haven't anywhere I've been playing, it's hard to upgrade them without having to buy more of them.  I hear people swear they make a difference, but I can't really tell myself, how do we know they're really all that much better then the generic versions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">One trick on selling enhancements.<br />
<br />
Look at the origin on the dropped DO.  Go to the corresponding shop.  You will receive significantly more influence selling a magic-natural DO that you can't use to a magic-natural shop.  The difference is huge over time and really only takes an extra 15 minutes once you learn where the shops are.<br />
<br />
I turned 21 and at 22 I get the opportunity to start slotting in SO (single origin) enhancements.  The cost between 25,000-30,000 EACH!<br />
<br />
So, I will be upgrading my DO's to higher DO's except in a few KEY spots which I will put an SO in here and there.<br />
<br />
 but I can't really tell myself, how do we know they're really all that much better then the generic versions?<br />
<br />
Their effectiveness is double a generic.<br />
<br />
SO's are 30% I believe.<br />
<br />
BTW, provoke in a group with a clue is fantastic.  I play 1 night a week in a &quot;guys&quot; group of RL friends.  I play tank.  I'll sit in the middle of 15-20 mobs and provoke.  They all beat on me while the gang aoe's or singles out and kills.  Its a beautiful thing.  i am getting all misty eyed - time to go /sniff<br />

I'm also a mutation tanker and I have slotted both mutation/science and mutation/magic.  As long as one of the aspects is from your origin, there doesn't seem to be a problem.

Dealt with some of those last night.  And here is what I found to work.  If you beat on one of the ninja Tsoos, poof the Socerer shows up to heal, you beat on the Socerer, he ports away, you beat on the ninja some more, he shows back up and you switch back to him.  It can take a bit, but you don't end up chasing all over god an creation and running the risk of aggroing other ninjas.  But the Socerers really need to be the first priority.

It isn't perfect yet guys.  We can help make it that way over time.</div></div><hr />

I'd bug it if I was certain it was a bug and not intended for some reason.</div></div><hr />

I've seen a lot of missions that were much tuffer at the entry than the back - even several where the final *boss* encounter was a snore compared to the front room.  And joined in one that the group could not get through until we had levelled a couple of times each - missions which had been given 4 or 5 levels before they were done.  I've bug'd a few, tho more in the mindset that it was feedback and not a bug.<br />
<br />
The past day, missions seemed more appropriate for the toon's level, and for the first time noticed that I was being told to go level before a contact would give me the next mission.  It's possible of course that I hadn't been told to wait before as latter toons rush thru missions faster than my first experiments, but by the same token they would have been more under-levelled for those missions in that case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frequently, although not always, when a contact says I have nothing for you, come back at X level, what he really means to say is, you've outleveled the missions I give, so you need to go to another contact.  If you come back to them when you've made the level they mentioned, they'll say that.<br />
<br />
I was in a mission today solo where at the very back end of the dungeon, where you really didn't even need to go to succeed at the mission, there was a level 20 NPC, this was a 5th columner.  Well at level 17 I wasn't sure I was going to be able to take him.  Tried him with just the inspirations I had at the time and he just wasn't going to be doable, although I did get him down some, maybe a third of the way.  Off I go to my closest contact, buy double inspirations for accuracy, defense, damage, two heals and a couple of catch your breaths, back I go, and down he goes.  So the right inspirations make a hell of  a difference.<br />
<br />
Also fought two light reds in a different mission and ended up making two trips to get inspirations, but once the first light red went down, Mr. Ting, the second, Govald, wasn't too much of a problem.  Been fighting the Tsoo a lot recently.<br />
<br />
And I agree that sometimes, even frequently, the entrance NPCs are the toughest in the mission, but it's also easy to duck outside and come right back in.  And going outside completely reloads your health so you come back in fresh while the NPCs are typically still most of the way down.<br />
<br />
I suspect that some of the missions probably need a little &quot;tuning&quot;.  I also suspect that some of the missions will be easier once we figure out the ins and outs.  For example, at level 16 I found out that the level 20 family mobs that use machine guns and shotguns, don't do enough damage to really take me down, so I stand a very good chance of being able to beat them down if I get them one on one.  Long fights, but winnable.  But the melee versions of the same mob do enough damage to outright kick my butt, so I avoid those.  Should a level 16 really be able to take down a level 20 solo without even requiring inspirations?  Probably not.  So they're going to have to work out some kinks here and there.</div></div><hr />

I'm suprised that they didn't re-tune that a bit from beta; i remember a lot of people replying after a mission that the entrance mobs were the toughest and once you got past the first 2 sets the rest of the mission was cake untily ou got to the boss.</div></div><hr />

Couple of questions for you all:<br />
<br />
1. Are you still having fun or is it waning?<br />
<br />
2. Have you had stability issues?<br />
<br />
3. Do you find yourself rolling a lot of different alts or are you doing one main toon?  I have never been much of an alt person, however, in this game i am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">1. still having fun..but i'm not powergaming like I did with EQ so YMMV methinks with this game. sure; i got a silly alt plus a hottie chick i re-roll just to mess with my wife..but for the most part it's one toon and i'm getting about a level in 3-5 days. but the world is so nice to immerse yourself in ( hell, i spent one day just jumping from rooftop to rooftop because it was fun to do )<br />
<br />
2. no stability issues here; but i've got a rather beefed up DSL line and lag is near unrecognizable.<br />
<br />
3. see reply 1. i just make an alt when i goof off; but they don't even last past 'Outbreak! Tuitorial'</div></div><hr />

I've rolled a stack of alts, one scrapper is becoming my *main*, but I intend to follow a few of them up.  Mostly, I like to play with the power sets and get a feel for how they work, so I'll take some time to play a toon up till 8th or 10th level, just to get a sense of it.  I even enjoy how two tanks can have a different feel if you goof with the power sets.  And I still get a kick out of dreaming up an origin, costume, and name for a character.<br />
<br />
Last night, I caught the house dr00d just sitting and watching me play as her EQ screen chattered merrily with ignored chat *hehe*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">1. Are you still having fun or is it waning?<br />
<br />
I'm still enjoying it, but I can see that it will eventually grow old barring new expansions.  I don't see 4+ years worth of interest in it right now, but I see longer than the 6 months I spent in SWG.   And I've played around with leaping from building to building as well, it's very slick.  I've also found that jumping from the tallest building you can find will take your health all the way down to 1 point.....<br />
<br />
002. Have you had stability issues?<br />
<br />
I've had a little bit of a problem with my system losing connection to the mapserver, particularly when I try and play with enhancements for some reason.  So far it's only occassionally annoying because CoH seems to not completely clear itself out of memory when it disconnects, either intentionally or unintentionally, so as a result I usually have to reboot to reconnect.<br />
<br />
3. Do you find yourself rolling a lot of different alts or are you doing one main toon? I have never been much of an alt person, however, in this game i am<br />
<br />
My tanker is level 17, almost level 18.  But I also have a bunch of alts, two on another server for those times when my primary server crashes, and 4 others on my primary server.  All of them are between level 4 and level 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Fought a Tsoo mission tonight that just frustrated the hell out of me.  Had four pairs of NPCs on the first floor of a mission where it was one of the enforcers paired with a socerer.  The socerer in each case was light red at level 18 and the enforcer was yellow, so both were level 19.  And with each pair, the Socerer just refused to cooperate.  Port here, port there.  I'd make a little progress on his health bar but then he'd port far enough out of range that I couldn't catch him, he'd port upstairs, downstairs, far down corridors, next to another pair of NPCs, all over the place.  So I'd beat on the enforcer enough to try and entice the socerer over and when he'd come, I couldn't hit him reliably enough to really defeat his health regen, so by the time I'd go through it all again when he ported away, he'd be back to almost full health.  And of course I couldn't keep an inspiration on me long enough to last an entire fight.  Just really really frustrating.<br />
<br />
I took out the first pair, lost connection, came back to full respawn.  I took out the first pair again and was working on the second pair, and it took me at least an hour by this time, when I zoned out really fast and lost connection again.  Finally, when I came back the second time the mission had changed the NPC spawn enough that I didn't have that particular configurartion any more, thank god.</div></div><hr />

Controllers are a wonderful friend to have.  Lock those porting healing bastards down.<br />
<br />
Do you have the very latest drivers for your video card? Supposedly that has been an issue.</div></div><hr />

It's so annoying to be a good 30 minutes into a mission get booted and bam gotta start ALL over has happened to me a lot hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Brigade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">holy cow, this thread got bigger than I ever thought it would be, which obviously is why I havent checked back in a while heh.<br />
<br />
Well I played coh beta for a month and a week before release.  the first month was awesome, then the game just started to lose it's appeal after my character list was full of lvl 10-13's leveling at the time, at that stage, was very very very boring.  Anyways though I have movedback to battlefield 1942 and found an awesome server with teamspeak etc.<br />
<br />
Anyways though currently I would not suggest coh, just wait for eq2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given that I jumped through a couple of dozen hoops within the last month to make sure I had the latest drivers for my video card for the DX9 upgrades SoE did, I can't imagine that my drivers aren't up to date.</div></div><hr />
