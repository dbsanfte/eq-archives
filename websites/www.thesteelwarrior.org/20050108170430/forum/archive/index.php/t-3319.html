<br />
The Warder problem in Vex Thal has been fixed on Test, and is moving to the Live servers during the patch on October 8th. <br />
<br />
YAY for no more problems with warders remaining up and blocking half the zone! =)</div></div><hr />

Maybe they hadn't actually patched it yet, but it was certainly not fixed as of this weekend.  In fact, this is the first time we have had a problem with a bugged warder.  Hope it gets fixed though, it sucks.</div></div><hr />

Would they even care if they were read the transcript of the dev forums where the devs admitted it was bugged and proudly declared they had fixed it?<br />
<br />
On another Warder forum someone mentioned that test was patched Monday - and they theorized that maybe that patch included the Warder fix...true or nay?<br />
