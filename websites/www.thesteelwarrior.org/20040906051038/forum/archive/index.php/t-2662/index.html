I woke up monday to severe back pain.  So severe when I tried to get out of bed I fell stright to my knees cause the pain was so intense I had to pull myself up to stand and basically learn to walk all over again also on tuesday morning the same thing.  I went to the emergency room on monday and a back specialists on wensday I got to do physical therapy and get a MRI done.  Sorry that is my little &quot;Life Stinks&quot; rant but I tell myself it could be worse.
