As soon as she joins, I go to buff with hero/symbol...it won't take hold, meaning she either has Aego or Virtue. Cool, I think to myself, she's got a good buff and I save a dot. <br />
<br />
So, we start pulling. Her health starts dropping like a stone...I have to start a Cheal basically as soon as she engages the mob. I manage to get a heal off when she's exactly at 50% health. <br />
<br />
It heals for 1550. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dear lord, I did not believe that was physically possible...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-25-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The crux of the whole (warrior vs knight) issue is that a pally with 7k hp buffed, and a war with 8.5k hp buffed can both tank just fine for an exp group... and the pally can hold aggro better/easier allowing the cleric to save mana by not healing people who steal aggro, and allowing the dps classes to go nuts.<br />
<br />
This cleric's rant is that because of this, people are assuming that a pally is ALWAYS a better choice than a war - and unless the pally is geared well enough to take the hits, that just isn't true.<br />
<br />
Of course, people (other than the cleric that has to keep them alive) don't see that end of it... they see the solid aggro and think that it means that person is a better tank.<br />
<br />
It is nice to see that some people still like a warrior as tank in their group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But its all out the window anyway.  Would a Cleric like healing a 4.5K Warrior in Innovation any more or less than a 4.5K SK/Paladin?  Anyone who does not use common sense deserves to get a little hurt. ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
iirc Aego is 1100 HP.  If the SK had Aego, then her base HP would have been 2k unbuffed.  Yikes, that's low.  My level 53 Paladin has higher base HP than that.  I find that a little hard to believe, her gear would have to really suck big time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You recall correctly, Glatius.  BoA is 1150 tho, but it's little difference.  Also, that SK might have had Temperance (only 800), as I mentioned later in that thread.  The cleric tried Hero/Symbol, both of which will still bounce off of Temperance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corillis</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a cleric as a main, a war as a first alt and a pally as a second alt. (both alts majorly twinked)<br />
<br />
My cleric has ok gear, the necessary aa's and i don't think i suck.<br />
<br />
I'll take a warrior ANY time over ANY pally. Why? because it's a challenge.<br />
<br />
Often in exp groups i dare the nukers to out aggro me. So then i have to heal the tank, the nuker and myself. No problem at all.<br />
<br />
I don't think clerics that have the appropriate gear to fight in a zone meant for them (by this i mean that a 55 cleric goes to PoI, a 60 one to PoV and a 65 to Bot -EP's) should have any mana problems.<br />
<br />
A warrior brings quite a bit more dps than a pally, but most of all, it brings back the thrill to exping.<br />
<br />
I know many casters that prefer aggro lock, but i most certainly don't. 'Just' healing is boring, keeping everyone alive is fun.<br />
<br />
Now, like i mentioned, i have a 250+ days /played warrior. I love him. Tanking is fun, beating the shitz out of something is great. So i know what being a warrior is, and i know the problems.<br />
<br />
I'm drifting off here, but the point i'm trying to get across is...<br />
<br />
Warriors rule.<br />
<br />
Yeah, pallies got some fancy shit, aye, they even have heals that i'd want. But i'm more inclined to leave a group if there's a pally tanking than when I see a warrior really trying his best to keep aggro, doing more than clicking 'cast stun' and doing their job.<br />
<br />
Also, as a cleric you immediately notice what kind of tank you have. Very often, and i mean VERY often i join a group with a level 62 paper pally tank. I hate em. I don't have a clue what they're doing in BoT. Also, like mentioned, people think warriors suck, so knights are better, so any knight must be better. Not true.<br />
<br />
Even if i have to heal the slower on every inc, i don't care. I'd rather do that, than start CHing at 70% cuz the pally has better aggro management. <br />
<br />
I love starting to CH a warrior when they go berzerk. There's no point in healing pallies at 1%, but there is when you heal a warrior at that level.<br />
<br />
Ugh, sometimes I think i'd best shut up. But there are more clerics than you think that prefer warriors to knights.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine exping at C2 in PoF, or even PoEB with a pally tanking. Even if they both push close to 10K hp.</div></div><hr />

Was in a PoV group, was only level 57 at the time, but fully buffed up I was sitting at around 6.3k hp. We had an SK join the group, and the cleric wanted the SK to tank. I only had about 1200+ ac at the time, and he had 1300, so I said np. And by no means before this was I having trouble keeping aggro. First pull and the SK died, I tanked the mob and we killed it and rezzed the SK. No clue how, but fully buffed this level 60 SK had 3500hp. Is that possible? I know druids and clerics with more hp then that. Seen Pallies with about the same hp's too.</div></div><hr />

I understand they may be lower level than me, but i am a ranger without HP-giving AAs, with Fear armor, I am not that uber...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well at level 65 without any gear on, I have around 2800 HP.  This is with my base stamina for a Barbarian Warrior untouched (when I created my Warrior strength was the way to go, bah!).  Now, it would seem to me that a 65 SK or Paladin should probably have around 2k or so (possibly a little more than 2k, but not a lot more).  So if a 62 SK has around 2k HP unbuffed, they basically have no HP gear on at all, they've got close to exactly the HP the would have naked.  Or at least that would be my conclusion.</div></div><hr />

My level 61 Gnomenecro has selfbuffed 2200 hp. :D <br />

I think the problem is to KNOW what equippment is the &quot;best&quot; for the class and the Zones.<br />

I'm pretty sure I had 1900 naked at 60 as a dark elf SK.<br />

<br />
Thing is, clerics like to use their mana as efficiently as possible. I've played one to 65, I've known many others: mana efficiency is to clerics (especially old school, pre-KEI clerics) what burst dps is to wizards and hp is to warriors, it's kind of their &quot;thing&quot;. This is why most clerics will prefer healing a real tank: why land a CH for under 2k when you can be landing them for over 4k?<br />
<br />
Not to mention with the new droga weapons (CHoS/SotB) warriors can hold agro quite well, well enough to be the only ones taking damage as long as the slower doesn't insist on slowing on incoming.<br />

That full set of Blood Ember used to be uber!  No piece of SK kunark armor except legs (25 hitpoints!) has a single hitpoint on it :p.  I wouldn't be too shocked to see a mid-50s SK wearing it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JAFFO</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a 65 Cleric, I would have to say that I prefer a warrior over a Knight.  It is more mana efficient to heal a 8K+ tank vs a 6K tank also ontop of HP's i have noticed that a warrior will in general take less damage per mob attack vs the knight whom will alot of times take full damage rather than partial. Taking these to things into consideration even if the warrior dosnt maintain agro as well it is still easier on my mana to simply do 1-Supereal Elixir on inc, 1-Superealy Remedy if the slower is an enchanter if it is a shaman most of the time another elixir will be fine, then with mob at 10-15% health remaining i will cheal warrior and the cheal will in general land at same time as mob's death. This equals out to 1200 mana per fight (800 if slower dosent manage to draw agro)<br />
 Now same situation with a knight will usually require 1-Supernal elixir if slower tries to slow.debuff.tash. on inc then its the same remedy or elixir, during the fight will usually require 2 cheals and then a 3rd at mobs death. 2000 mana per fight ( 1600 if slower dosent draw agro).<br />
  Also in the event of an over pull or add i can hold on healing the warrior minus the Supereal Elixir that i always us on inc. this will alow me to A). Maintain slower or CC as my current tgt to quicken the reaction time of remedy. B) It will also alow me to prevent healing agro until tank has mob's full attention.<br />
  If i am forced to cheal on intial over pull or add then i will almost always draw agro, and in  this happenes the chances of me casting threw 2+ mobs beating on me is almost zero, which means i will either die or have to cast DA/DB either  way i will not be able to heal which usualy results in the group wiping.</div></div><hr />

I have to say, I dont understand what the friggin deal is with these peeps and wanting a knight to tank.  My RL wife plays, and yes, she plays a SK....why?? So we have snare when we duo (not proc based).  I played a bard to 63 with 125+ days played, and a monk to 54 with 110+ days played, and now I have an Iksar Shaman, level 56 with 15 days played.<br />
<br />
Now, there are a few different groups I get in:<br />
<br />
1) Good SK/Pally = slow asap, maybe even dot here and there (RARE)<br />
<br />
2)Shitty SK/Pally = slow ASAP (and tank if I can, cause I tank BETTER than they do) and spend my mana healing them, and me (common)<br />
<br />
3) Decent Warrior = slow ASAP from melee range of the mob, rarely pull aggro, and waste mana hasting the cleric who is fom all the time and decides to melee cause the warrior dont need no heals.<br />
<br />
4) Great Warrior = slow asap from melee range, haste cleric, haste me, and cast regen on the warrior so the cleric can go from healing once every other fight to once every third or fourth.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would far prefer to slow with a warrior than with a pally or sk anyday.  Why??  Because I made a badass tank shammy, with 2khp before buffs, and over 1kac, so he can take the hits, and likes it.  I have NEVER slowed a mob, and had it turn to me, with the warrior unable to taunt it back off me before I died, NEVER.  However, I HAVE died because I was grouped with a shitty newb pally that held aggro like a champ.....till he died cause starting CH at 85% of his health just wasnt soon enough.<br />
<br />
How often do I wish that my wife played a warrior simply because getting her sk to the level of tankabilty to go to PoV/HoH and NOT be a detriment to the group is still a long way away.  The extra tanking and dps and mitagation of the warrior would help a lot in that, but we would have no way to deal with runners, other than root, which is very unreliable compared to snare.<br />
<br />
.....<br />
I have grouped my Bard in HoH/BoT and he has been with a warrior with aggro weapons, and various DPS classes.  Only rarely did the rogue ever, I mean ever evade, and the rogue was a good rogue, never did the ranger pull aggro...but the wizard did when he went nuke happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  I would rather be the slower in a warrior tank group than a knight tank group anyday.  Its NOT the warriors fault they dont keep aggro. Its NOT broken.  Its NOT that pallies do too good a job of keeping aggro....its:<br />
a) Shitty level 65 chanters that have less than 1600hp and 450AC that slow in tier2+.....leave the KEI whores in PoK where they belong, and get a shammy to slow, its what they were designed to do.<br />
b)leave the &quot;started playing EQ post-luclin&quot; or even worse &quot;started playing EQ after PoP&quot; noobs in PoK...you know, the ones that think EQ is fun = exp/hours....when eq is really fun = fun / exp...that is the more fun you have getting exp, the more fun you have overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
My Ideal group is: Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Bard, Ranger/druid/sk/necro, Monk/Rogue/Mage/BL.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taunt is NOT your enemy, enchanters and other exp hogs are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins who can play the class (and fortunately for us thats not the majority) will always be the superior agro/tank class of the 3 plate tank classes.<br />
When i leveled my cleric I have seen some of those specimen at work and it was rather frustrating to see how easy they have it using their tools compared to a warrior.<br />
Stun on incoming, up to 12 seconds to debuff, get more agro on mob without taking damage, sit outside melee but in agro range closest to mob and i havent seen the slower getting hit once ever.<br />
I was laughing hard when i saw the new stun paladins got for level 51.<br />
60 mana is a joke, a paladin friend of mine has currently a 4600 mana pool, so i guess it will be a while before running out of mana.<br />
But even with a much smaller mana pool i have yet to see a paladin run oom unless he was healing the group via group heals when cleric went afk or ld.</div></div><hr />
