<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonehead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ANybody with Cord Hilt Spike Driver have you had it proc lately?  I just got one the other day and with 300 dex and using it my main hand it didnt proc one time in 100 kills.  Could it be broken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">naw. the RNG just decided to bend you over and laugh. i've had days in a row my JBoW wouldn't proc and some times the thing just don't stop ( highest record procs is 9x in 9 rounds )<br />
<br />
*RNG=random number generator</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Still proccin for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mrith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">mine works fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wyndrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">mine works too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mine procs a ton, even in offhand and even when my dex isn't fully buffed to 305. You may have a filter off or something keeping you from seeing the message, I find it hard to believe it hasn't procced in 100 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i use CHSD in offhand and it still procs quite a bit (Ambidexterity).  It does seem streaky sometimes though...sometimes multiple times in a round or two, and sometimes seems like it wont proc at all (or until the mob is at 15%)<br />
Overall, still working the same as ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sometimes procs are just like that.  In droga yesterday I was on caster disrupting detail, and slam only refreshes once every 6 minutes or so, :)  so I broke out my spiked velium mallet and scimitar of ykesha hoping the stun component of ykesha would help me disrupt casts.  Damned thing didnt proc in 3 or 4 consecutive fights, with dex at 205.  Then we moved to an area where there were no casters and it procced so much I had to bag it because I kept pulling aggro off the main tank.  Typical.  :)</div></div><hr />
