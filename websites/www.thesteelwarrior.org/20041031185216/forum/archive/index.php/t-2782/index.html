<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solarmute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not thinking, I stupidly chose Mith Marr when I rolled a new warrior on Stromm instead of Rallos Zek... <br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) armor is pretty amazing. Stats for the BP:<br />
<br />
AC: +51 Str: +10 Dex: +5 Sta: +5 HP: +80<br />
<br />
Compare this to Luminant Heraldic (Mith Marr):<br />
<br />
AC: +51 Sta: +5 Wis: +10 HP: +40 Mana: +40<br />
<br />
My question is, should I dump my character and start over, or will this armor have little use for me after a certain level? I am currently lvl 27.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Atilette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fierce Heraldic armor is &quot;Recommended level of 45&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not sure it would be much use for you at your level anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If deity is THAT important to you, reroll.  Otherwise, it seems a giantic waste of time to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solarmute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Deity doesn't matter at all. I could not possibly care less. I just don't want to gimp myself at levels 45 - 55 (or however long Fierce Heraldic is top dog).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm agnostic and am doing okay..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have the plat to burn, go for it.  But I would not want to waste my time releveling just for armor.  You can find other gear to get ya by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fierce Heraldric:<br />
<br />
AC: +51 Str: +10 Dex: +5 Sta: +5 HP: +80<br />
<br />
Luminant Heraldic:<br />
<br />
AC: +51 Sta: +5 Wis: +10 HP: +40 Mana: +40<br />
<br />
Throw out the basically meaningless stats and you get:<br />
<br />
Ac 51 sta 5 hp 80 VS. ac 51 sta 5 hp 40<br />
<br />
Not that huge a difference, and the Luminant heraldric will last a very long time.  If Fierce heraldric better?  Yes.  Can you still succeed without it?  Yes, and quite well.  I got by being agnostic, and am doing quite well thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solarmute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">40hp is 40hp, but you're right. No point in re-rolling a character that I truly enjoy playing =D<br />
<br />
At 50/55, I'd like to try for Breastplate of the Myrmidon (SS armor):<br />
<br />
AC: +54 Str: +15 Dex: +7 Sta: +10 Agi: +7 Fire Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +5 Magic Resist: +10 HP: +90<br />
<br />
Anyone know how hard this is to get?<br />
<br />
Or, Warlord's Breastplate (Kael):<br />
<br />
AC: +59 Str: +16 Dex: +7 Sta: +10 Agi: +7 Cold Resist: +10 Magic Resist: +6 HP: +90</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warlord's is harder to get than Myrmidon's.<br />
<br />
Myrmidon's drop in WToV aka HoT (Halls of Testing). The mobs here are kos to everyone and that faction cannot change (nor does killing these mobs affect any other factions)<br />
<br />
The mobs aren't that hard, 1 good (SS geared) group can do it, 2-3 groups can own. Silk, Leather, Chain, and Plate drops here, and BPs are the rarest drops, it's a matter of luck to get one, but once your guild gets 2-3 groups outfitted in some Thurg armor, you can move into HoT and begin upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sigh. As an up and coming warrior I'm not looking forward to this step. My gear ATM is fine for me but my saves are horrible.<br />
<br />
Here's two quick questions:<br />
1. What level does Kael become good experience for a twink with 60ish gear?<br />
<br />
2. Would I be better off time-wise xp'ing through the 40s at giant forts now or somewhere else where the xp flows more steadily and then coming back at 55 to farm faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A possible better solution(one that does not involve farming a rare drop in a raid zone) is to go for Chestplate of Vindication.  Drops off Derakan the Vindicator.<br />
<br />
AC 45 STA 15 HP 100 15 to all saves, effect Aura of Battle(2 hp per tick regen and + 10 attack)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Incidentally, Warlord's is easier to get than Myrmidons, or was back when I was constantly raiding in those zones.  Drop rate in HoT pales in comparison to WToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">HoT is the Eastern Wing. WToV is well, WToV, and Kael quest armour drops there.<br />
<br />
Then you got NToV, but I wouldn't worry about that yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A possible better solution(one that does not involve farming a rare drop in a raid zone) is to go for Chestplate of Vindication. Drops off Derakan the Vindicator.<br />
<br />
Didn't know that had saves on it.. Not bad. I have a Cobalt BP atm which has comparable AC, stats. I'm actually debating getting a Crown of the Froglok kings (bye bye Raldukan :cry), a Bracelet of Quickness and a Bracelet of Fortitude as a way around the saves..<br />
<br />
I'm trying to come back to my guild with a warrior that is geared and doesn't have to make them fall back to HoT level. Ideally, I wouldn't need them to help me get the Vindi BP, Kael armor or HoT. i.e. I'm hoping to provide an alternate MA/SA when one isn't available (we are warrior and tank light) without much expenditure of guild resources/time on my behalf.<br />
<br />
I can duo or solo Kael arena with my main np so I can get the drops there without too much hassle. They are so low on DEX and the saves are only marginally better than nothing though too. :(<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there's no way I could do HoT alone though.<br />
<br />
Gah.. Part of me wants to give up on this little quest because my guild is really ready for NToV now and I know that I will not be ready gear-wise or level-wise to step up as even SA in time to keep us at that tier, so what's the point.<br />
<br />
Then again.. I really enjoy playing my warrior so the grind is fun in and of itself.. I guess I always knew that there is a science to playing a warrior but it's increadibly fun and educational to learn about things like positioning, aggro, etc.</div></div><hr />
