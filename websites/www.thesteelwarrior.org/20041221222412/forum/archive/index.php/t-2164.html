I mean for instance max damage for my warrior may be 100 but sometimes he hits for around 6. why such a broad range. A friend of mine says he ranger with 255 dex hits pretty consistent. Just wondering if anyone knew.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So true! There is even a handy link making tool above where they spew their garbage yet they can't seem to figure it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is ofcourse the possibility that this guy is here asking a legit question and happens to also play everwars and has it in his sig.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps the fact that he hasn't hidden the link in a post with words cunningly chosen to deceive you into clicking it means that he isn't a spammer.</div></div><hr />

I hate those spammers, and the fact that they can't spell worth shit half the time</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dmg Mitigation is affected by the targets AC and Offensive skill (and AA's if it's a PC). The higher the AC and Offense, the less often you will get hit for max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He has his entire post in his sig for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
And besides that he stat he is asking for is  ATK :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is a lot of threads on this forum explaining how damage is calculated. I won't comment here<br />
why a ranger damage is more constant : rangers usually uses 2 fast hitting, low damage weapons, so the max hit is low too, and the result is the damage seems more consistent, when it is not.<br />
I as a ranger can hit everywhere between 1 and 80. Not really consistant.<br />
U will always hit for anything between 1 ( or DB+weapon damage/10 if u are using 2h weapon) and your max hit.<br />
What will change is the chance to hit for those values ... a non skilled war will often hit for min, and nearby never for max. a max-skilled war will hit a bit for every value between min and max (i won't explain damage, repartition, there is nice graphics for that on other threads). what is important is the average damage, and more specifically teh damage per second (DPS). What will influence your chances to hit for max instead of min is the mob AC, and your ATK. this number is calculated based on skills ( offence + weapon related skill : slashing for example), on stat ( str for melee ) and on +atk items, more some miscelanious things ( rangers get +5 atk per level in teh end game).</div></div><hr />
