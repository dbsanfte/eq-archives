I have a 52 cleric and 62 druid at my disposal and noticed a level 65 giant that drops a nice cleric only hammer I want to get my hands on :D. From what I've read he hits 400 max and can be slowed, but can't find any info on how many hp any mob in here has. My dps isn't the greatest, but with a shammy ds potion (33) + druid ds (32) it helps quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Just as some background info I have taken the 62 druid and myself and killed everything except wing bosses in BoT w/o difficulty. So I guess what I'm looking for is how does solc compare?</div></div><hr />

The zone in is Lava with I belive unreistable 100 hp per tick.  I have watched many a freind die here, and take hours getting bodies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lava damage is based on your max HP and your Fire Resist.<br />
<br />
Lava will not kill a level 1 in one tick, even though he has less than 100hp.<br />
Lava will deal more damage to a level 65warrior than a 52cleric, unless the 52cleric has more hp than the 65warrior</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK well I went there last night with the 62 druid and the lava was interesting. My warrior took 78 dmg/tick while the druid took about 60 dmg/tick and that was with druid fr/cr buff. In solb I could sit in lava all day and regen faster than it damaged me :P<br />
<br />
I zoned in on the kobold side from solb (kos to both sides atm) and succored over to the goblin side (sola). Each side has shaman mobs it seems so I'm glad I took the druid because snare was a must. I was able to pull most goblins solo (everything was dark blue to me, some giants conned even to the druid), except at one point a roamer came through and agroed the druid which set off a chain agro reaction and i had to evac. Well of all time it could have hapened the evac left my behind (the druid was right on top of me) so I hit fortitude and ran for the sola zone. That lava is dark!!! Made it to sola and zoned with ~500 hp left. Luckily in sola i only take 10dmg/tick while in lava. Alt-tabbed back to druid who had just finished zoning, invised self and watched gobbos walk by from where I zoned earlier. One saw invis, rooted it, others came, rooted them. Memmed gate and left.<br />
<br />
So overall the xp was pretty good for just a group of 2, was getting 1% aa per kill and nothing hit more than 200, didn't even bother slowing with my ToD. However if I go back I will triple box with the cleric for pacify (need level 62 to pac higher than level 55 mobs :() to make pulls much smoother.<br />
<br />
I will get that cleric hammer some day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well with 2 boxing its a definate no go.<br />
with 3 boxing it would be very close. You would not be able to do spider queen. Giant nameds are pretty easy but some pulls to get to the you get 2-3 mobs and I highly doubt you will be able to handle that.<br />
<br />
Me pally friend that was EP equiped and my druid owned the zone and giant nameds. Fighting 2-3 giants was not a prob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SolC is a lot like ChardokB (a zone that more people seem to know) except that you need snare in SolC.<br />
<br />
There are tougher parts of SolC.  The giants hit in the 300's, and there is a mini-event of elementals who hit in the 400's which can be started every few hours.  I'm not sure how hard the spiders are.<br />
<br />
The overall boss of the zone is a pretty tough customer, and not really even 1-groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried finding out some stuff about solC over at allakhazam's but couldnt seem to. Am I stupid or is there nothing there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a page for SolC: The Caverns of Exile in the beastiary here (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=186), but for some reason, Allakhazam never added a normal zone page for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've zoned in a number of times without any problem.  The same goes for the  house dr00d (R.I.P.)  Escaping from there, when I was scouting and took a mis-step was a bit more of an issue (*d'oh*) ... but I made it once I'd figgered out where forward was at.  Crossing the zone line back over was a little wonky, and I seemed to have to cross it twice, but mebbe it's been amended.  Or I was goin' the wrong way.<br />
<br />
I led a small raidlet into SolC once, and most of the peeps made it across the zone without a problem.  The ducktards who weren't paying attention died in lava, or more *entertainingly* when they zoned back out and wandered off.  (*Where do I go?* *Stay where you are.*  *I can't find you!* *That's cuz I'm where you wuz you &lt;@%#&amp;*!!&gt;* - That was the day I quit the raid council. :P)  If yer paying a little attention, zoning in is a snap.<br />
<br />
I loved the zone, I think it's well worth time spent there.  One of the under-used areas, decent look to it, fun to hunt in and explore.<br />
<br />
The folx at alla also have  this page that should have been linked (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Antonica/Caverns_Exile.html) from the front page.  It links to the usual set of info pages (incl. the bestiary).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Payne I was just looking at your magelo again and there is something that irks me. You say you and druid can do BoT giants. Does that me only your warrior + druid or 3 box+ druid? Is your magelo outdated? Cause I remember when I was 2 boxing in BoT with myself and druid and I have a bit better equipment and  twice the AAs. It was not easy. If indeed you can handle bot giants without slower with just yourself and druid. I'd say you have nothing to worry about then from multipull in solC when you have a cleric as well. Giants in SolC are no where near as deadly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just me and the druid. I use my ToD for slowing and fights usually last about 5 min so I have to reslow once. I'm able to load all of my dots onto the giant in-between heals too and nuke occasionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh ,sol c giants seemed a lot easier.If your druid can heal you in Bot you should be fine as long as you keep the pulls small.I imagine Bot must be challenging with that combo hehe.Although, my wife (ep shammy)and I were being silly the other week and I pulled 3  out of the water wing and we won pretty easily though I blew discs while debuffing.So yeh, I think you could do a lot of the place with care to adds.If not evac would be the win! :)<br />
<br />
PS. we didn't wake the queen,she was untargetable when we entered.That time we had a shammy,cleric,necro,druid and me and barely lost to the zillion spiders that jumped me when i charged in.We could have beaten the babies easily had we been expecting it and not been way past ready for bed.I didn't expect we'd beat the queen tho we knew nothing about her,but, wth we were owning the joint and bein silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't say it's challenging, but it's definitely different. The ToD makes all the difference. Also I usually get buffs in PoK before I go so I'm usually sitting around 7600hp unless I can find a brells.</div></div><hr />
