<br />
Here is my question<br />
1. The +10 Ac agument should i Put this in the tak armor, <br />
2. Wich should I fill first that type 1 augment slot or the type 2 where I was planning on putting +40 Hp in all of my tak type 2 slots.<br />
3. Is it a good idea to put a buch of HP augments or should I spread it out between stats and such.<br />
<br />
I wont be getting to Elemental gear anytime soon, and as for GoD type gear its a possibility but not in the forseen future.  Here is my Magelo if anyone is currios<br />

However, to avoid future hassles you might want to put your best augs in your best items. My advice is to load up on hp/ac augs, then maybe fill in your stats so you can get them to max out with buffs and to also give your resists a bump up.<br />
<br />
Also, as i looked at your magelo i noticed some quick fixes that you might be able to do.<br />
<br />
You might want to consider taking a look at replacing your rings with 2x valorium rings of gallentry, they should give you a good hp and stat boost.<br />
<br />
Replacing that dex aug on your sword with an anger3 aug would help.<br />
<br />
Replacing your belt with a heavy rubicite girdle (or something with similiar ac/hp)<br />
<br />
finally, invest in an amy chain mask (the one from CT with 85hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. you cant put the AC aug (vendor sold) on the visible slots, only Face, Neck, Shoulder, Back, Waist.<br />
2. fill first the HP thus type 1 STA (cheaper) and then type 2 40HP (heavy cost).<br />
3. don't bother with a stat, except if you can't do anything else. you improovement path should be : <br />
 * remove the DEX aug from the red epic.<br />
 * aug the red epic with A3.<br />
 * put the red epic MH.<br />
 * buy the cheapest type 1 STA aug.<br />
 * buy the the arsh 1150AP type 2 40HP from tak for all your type 2 slots.<br />
 * buy all the HP/AC aug for the other items (back, face, ...) with a adventage for AC.<br />
 * if you aren't fed up with the LDoN mission, buy some more aug like stats, resist, atk, regen, DS, ultravision, inv seeing, ... (all that is not important but that makes things nice).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for putting my epic in my MH, I was always told to put your quickest weapon in your MH and slower in the Off hand.  <br />
<br />
Not that I dont appreciate the great advise, trust me I do alot and thank you for giving it.  I am just confused, I thought putting my anger 3 augment in a quicker weapon would result in better agro managment, delay on my epic is in the hight  20 where as my splitblade is below 20 in delay.<br />
<br />
I totally forget about the limited slots for the +10 ac augment shot myself in the foot on that one, so I will probably do as suggested get the +40 augments and sta adds where ever I can. <br />
<br />
My plan for mask and belt though was to get the highest ac/hp of both and put the +10 ac augment in them to give a better ac and HP along with anything else that will give me better defense and HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korgo</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't burn points on STA items.  collect em and put a 40hp aug on each piece then save for the next piece to put a 40hp aug in, and just toss in junk augs that you pick up while XPing in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Other than the pieces and HP augs (maybe AC augs once other pieces are done) there is nothing worth spending AP on outside of weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Delay doesn't matter for procs. If you have epic proc + A3 in mainhand and max dex you get 4ppm which is 2200 hate per minute.<br />
<br />
If you have A3 in main hand and epic in offhand you get 3ppm which is 1700hate.<br />
<br />
Put the red epic mainhand with A3 and dump the splitblade for a CHoS or SotBS.</div></div><hr />

Splitblades suck  :( Get something with an innate proc. Sorry to go off topic.</div></div><hr />

It is always beneficial to add another hate proc.  In fact, ideally your weapons would have their own hate procs PLUS anger3.  The splitblade essentially has no aggro of its own.  Ideally you would start with a much higher aggro weapon than a splitblade, and THEN add anger3, putting you much farther ahead.  That's why other people in this thread suggested that you move the anger3 augment to your epic, and dump the splitblade.<br />
Not that I dont appreciate the great advise, trust me I do alot and thank you for giving it. I am just confused, I thought putting my anger 3 augment in a quicker weapon would result in better agro managment, delay on my epic is in the hight 20 where as my splitblade is below 20 in delay.<br />
The weapon delay has no effect on how often you proc, so don't let that concern you.  You will average 3 procs/minute, no matter how fast or slow you swing.  (with 305 dex and weapon affinity 5)<br />
<br />
Your offhand procs half as often as your mainhand.  Use this rule of thumb to decide which weapon to put in our offhand.</div></div><hr />

You'd prob get same/better agro with a SSoY + your old A3 than with blade + A3</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LorikTremere</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have 30k to spend on weapon, I already took my anger 3 out of my split blade and going to sell it.  Thanks for the info it made a huge difference.  My question now is what can I do for 30k to get me where I need to be.  I saw suggestions of Copper Hammer or Bloodswarm, If yah dont mind giving a misinformed warrior a few pointers on what I should do to get the best agro I can do with what I got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, get the copper hammer of striking and the sword of the bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
And, you weren't *entirely* misinformed about low delay for a mainhand weapon, it's just that delay influences non-proc hate of the weapon, particularly the mainhand. But once you get to the level where you can use good proc weapons and your DEX increases, the delay issue becomes a progressively trivial component of your hate generation. The posters here are simply pointing out that you are well past that point now, and the CHoS and SotB have fairly low delays *and* good procs.<br />
If you have 30K then on most servers you'll have a fair bit of coin left over after getting these two recommended weapons.</div></div><hr />

I'd focus on getting all the 10ac augs first...best bang for the buck.  Then 40 hp augs.  Get a full set of both and they will serve you well (i'm still getting 40s mysself)<br />
<br />
And ditch the &quot;spit blade&quot; (heh i like that)...its a cool lookin wqeap but you'll get alot more agro with the droga weaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grumush</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly with red epic +A3 I would only focus on 1 of the weapons.  I would go with the sword of the bloodsworn for main hand with A3 aug on it.  You should also be able to sell that splitblade for around the 100k mark or pretty high up there.   Not sure why .. but there you go.  You can use that money to get some bad ass mini upgrades for other various areas.  Also I would stick to puting the 10ac augs on the 5 pieces it can go on (face, neck, shoulders, back, waist) the 40hp augs on head, arms, chest, legs, feet. I would also look into going to Natimbi and farming a few of the VERY easy to get augs there.  As for leftover spots that you have?  Stick vengance/aura of battle in what you can, what you want in others.  And for the type 1's left over I'd stick sta and dex into em or whatever stat your slackin in.  My 2 cents.<br />

Grum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LorikTremere</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went ahead and got the bloodsworm and use it with my epic, agro didnt pan out that well so I went ahead with the copper hammer of striking. I accidently put the anger 3 in the hammer and the anger 2 in bloodsworm.  So atm I am working copper hammer in MH and bloodsworm in off hand should I swich them around and exchange the augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope, it's better like this (CHoS is better than SotB, the only adventage of the SotB is that you can stun higher lvl mob but since it's 0s you can only stop caster and proc aren't reliable for this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LorikTremere</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thanks to this forum I was able to keep agro not only from other mele but alos necro's who I had problems keeping agro from the past.  I have to say the best advice I have gotten was to come here and get some help.  I like to thank you all for putting up wiht my inexperience and giving top knotch advice.  I have a feeling you will be seeing me again though hehe, I have come to realize I know less about this game then I thought.</div></div><hr />
