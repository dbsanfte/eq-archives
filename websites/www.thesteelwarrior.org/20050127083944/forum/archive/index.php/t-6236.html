<br />
lots of high end warriors like the sews + anger3 because for aggro and tankability it is just under that of an anger3 BoW ... and about = to a yak auged BoW (from what they tell me).  my question is, how far behind an anger3 sews is an anger3 BBB?  is it good for MTing and group tanking?  if so this may be one of the better non-ssra uber proccers pre-elemental?</div></div><hr />

I usually will go 1hs to start and then switch to BBB for the rune and less riptose once i have aggro while MTing. The rune procc is not all that much aggro however and while xping i will usually stick with 1hs unless it is a named or something like that.</div></div><hr />

I use it 99% of the time in GoD trails, hard LDoN everywhere.  I do switch it out for augged BoC and hategiver though on most boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

Served me well tanking mobs like Reparm aswell as in hard LDoN runs.  Was better agro than un-aug'd BoC + SEM combo.</div></div><hr />

I found that it pretty much ran neck in neck with my bf (aug'd) and boc, both sets has their perks and drawbacks.<br />
<br />
As for how it rates to an aug'd sews, well I can't help you there. I can tell you tho that an un-aug'd sews pulls noticibly more agro then an un-aug'd bbb.</div></div><hr />
