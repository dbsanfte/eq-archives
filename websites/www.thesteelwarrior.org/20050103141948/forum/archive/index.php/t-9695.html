<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard this went live on test recently.<br />
<br />
Word is, they are refunding all GoD AA's (hence the change to allow over 30 banked AA for refunded AA) and changing the prices on msot GoD AAs, and letting people repurchase. I was told WA for example was 5/5/5/5/5 now on test.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, 5/5/5/5/5 for WA would make it more expensive for WA 1-3, tied at WA4, and cheaper at WA5.   That would be a fairly lame-arse reduction to that ability, and would take it away from people that have it at lower levels.  Hope that's incorrect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was gonna guess it would be taken down to 4/6/8/10/12.<br />
<br />
40 isnt too bad for 500hp, as 25 would seem a bit cheap.</div></div><hr />

Heh, that's quite the rebalance they've got going on there.  I'm gonna buy that immediately!<br />
<br />
Err, wait..probably not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sebrna</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More stuff from the ranger board ..<br />
<br />
<br />
Swift Journey : Now costs 5/5 (was 5/10) <br />
Convalescence: Now costs 3/3 (was 3/6) <br />
Lasting Breath: No idea, didnt buy it. First step is 2 now <br />
Packrat: No idea again. First step is 3 now. <br />
Weapon Affinity: Is now 5/5/5/5/5 (was 2/4/6/8/10) <br />
Persistent Casting: I dont think this changed. <br />
Mastery of the Past: Now costs 3/3/3 (it may have been 3/6/9, dont remember) <br />
Sinister Strikes: Now costs 12. (was 15) <br />
Precision of the Pathfinder: Still 3/6/9 <br />
Coat of Thistles: Now costs 5/5/5/5/5 (was 3/6/9/12/15) <br />
Flaming/Frost Arrows: First Step is now 3 (was 4) not sure how it scales. <br />
Strengthened Strike: First step is now 3. No idea what it was before, never bought it. <br />
<br />
I got 5AA refuunded from WA and 3AA from Convalescence. Whee. <br />
<br />
I also got 2 sort-of-free AA. I had Step 1 of Coat of Thistles. It used to cost 3, now it costs 5, but they didnt charge me 2aa to make up for it. *coughhintcough* <br />
 <br />
Seems that you are gonna get to keep your AA if it costs more than you paid for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, 5/5/5/5/5 for WA would make it more expensive for WA 1-3, tied at WA4, and cheaper at WA5.

<br />
Are you serious? Who would want to spend 5 more AA on WA5? Wouldnt you rather have more AA to spend on other abilities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's fine for me (at WA4 atm), but think it's stupid that people that already have, say, level 2 will now be 4aa away from level 2.  There are other ways to remove 5 points from the cost than to make it harder on people that don't have tons of AA.   But if the post above is correct and it stays that way when it goes live, then maybe the people that already have wa2 will still have wa2, and get the difference of 4aa for free.  Hmm...  if so, that annoys me for other reasons. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solanthus</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remain aware that thosechanges applied to test only... thats why its test. I wouldnt get your hopes up about it staying that way.<br />
<br />
And go ahead and ask pretty much everyone whether they would want a steeper learning curve and less overall AA or a shallower one and more overall AA cost and the ones that weren't lazy would say go for the overall less cost... instant gratification is just that, you will feel better spending the 5 AA on something else afterward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to one of the above posts, they will not take away your AAs that are now more expensive than what you paid. <br />
<br />
Also, WA1-5 is currently 2/4/6/8/10 (30 total) and is going to be 5/5/5/5/5 (25 total) so having WA5 will give you 5 aa to spend now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see what the point of changing GoD AA costs now is.  IMO there should be inflated costs for the highest ranks of an AA skill.  That actual keeps the gap between a really hardcore and a more casual player a little closer.  Say you pay 15 AA for the first 2 ranks of an AA, but if you want that 3rd rank, it will cost you 15 more just for that.  Expensive yes, but if you're one of the people who really plays a ton, you'll have it.  Hardcore players also typically are able to earn AAs considerably faster than other players.  <br />
<br />
So yeah, increasing costs on GoD AAs made perfect sense to me.  No need to change it now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever consider that this is a bug? They would be giving away quite a few free AA to people this way.<br />
<br />
My bet is they will refund all AA and allow to to rebuy them.</div></div><hr />

they can't because you can have only 100 unspent AA on you, and you can only keep 30 unspent AA while zonning. This is a major issues for those with 800+AA; and even without that much remember that WA5+Sturdi5 is 90 AA, and there aren't alone on GoD's AA list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's enough discrepancy between the super ubers (99% of which are raiders) and the casuals in terms of HP, AC, and most importantly, AGRO (!) that AA's don't need to be on that checklist.  Especially when you consider the fact that Warriors are now sorta, ya know, BALANCED based on having WA5, Sturdiness5, and all of their Offensive/Defensive/HP AAs, making them ridiculously priced is a real iron boot up the anal cavity as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realize that it'll work out better for everyone in the long run, but at my current (really slow) AA rate, it'd take me 2 weeks to get WA2 back if I had it before the change and they took it away.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I guess if they learn and make the future stuff priced more appropriately, at least it'll be a one time cluster. ;)  Life will be better for our children and our children's children!</div></div><hr />

 Yoda, where did you get these numbers? Supposedly the code is live that while you can't earnmore than 30, you can get substantially more from refunds and still zone. Wondering where you got the cap being 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">During beta you could have 700aa banked w/o zoning, probably more. They could, in all reality refund all the GoD aa and just have people rebuy them. I think its a good idea(maybe because I havn't finished WA yet, but /shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can store a lot more than 30 AAs if it's from GM-like powers (and refunding obviously would be simliar) but it goes to 30 when you zone.  I've heard they're going to lift the 30 AA stored cap though, maybe just for a few week, so you don't have people accidentally zoning with 200 AAs and lose 170.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said on one thread the cap would become nonexistant (you cannot earn more aa's while having 30 or more banked, so the loss to 30 on zone is pointless anyway), I cant find it, but its been linked around<br />
<br />
<br />
I would honestly prefer to see all GoD aa's refunded and only allow people to spend the refunded AA's on GoD or previous, but I doubt that will happen (just means some of us will end up with 20-50 free OoW aa's).  Reasoning behind this is the pre-expansion caps, I was only allowed to carry 30 aa's into OoW from GoD era, why should a refund of points earned in that era be allowed to work in OoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope they don't refund the points and make us buy them again. I'd hate to spend 3 more AA's to get the same Sturdiness 1 I have today. That would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They put the 30aa limit in before the release of PoP because they wanted to avoid having people save up a ton of AAs to be spend when PoP went live. If I remember correctly there were people that had 50+ AA that were pretty pissed about it. <br />
<br />
Anyway, stuff like this is nothing new really. They have always made the older content more obtainable with the release of newer expansions. I also think OoW AAs are on the money as far as time spent goes. PoP AAs were pretty easy to get and OoW may have been a little too many AAs for higher levels of a line.<br />
<br />
If this actually happens I dont see the big deal really, everyone wins out. For the more casual folks they will have available better AAs for a reduced cost, while the hardcore folks wiill have some AAs banked when they log in. Not a bad deal IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not possible since some of us had max AA before OoW was released, so we have nothing to spend the refunded AA on except OoW skills, and if those 70-80 AA are sitting in our bank, we can no longer even earn new AA to spend on the OOW skills we have left.<br />
<br />
They would need to wipe our AA bank after the refund, meaning all those players just lost what they earned.<br />
<br />
I have no opinion about whether they completely refund AA and make you rebuy it or not, but I had better be able to apply all that previous time earning AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...do the people who already have these maxed all the way just get the difference in AA (i.e. WA5's new cost of 5 and it costing 10 previously) and keep the skill?

<br />
You get the difference back. When logging in to test I got several messages of the following nature &quot;You have recieved 5 AA from Weapon Affinity&quot;. Several people have stated that you do not lose any AA if the price had been raised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viriatus-nameless</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In that case its a win-win situation.<br />
People with low number of AAs will get aas in the form of the same skill at a higher price and not having to spend aas. (In this case i guess people will end up with more total aas then they had the day before).<br />
People with high number of AAs will get aas to spend somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Personaly ill be happy if I get some unexpected aas to spend.</div></div><hr />

I was refunded 20 points for Sturdiness 4 (people with sturdy 5 got 35) and 5 points for WA5.  I didn't have to rebuy anything, just got my 'extra' points back.  Reflexive Mastery and Defensive Instincts are now maxed and I have Sturdy 5, which I swore I would never pay 20 points for :).<br />
<br />
Supposedly they changed the amount of banked AAs you can have to something like 100, but I don't see any reason not to spend the refunded AAs immediately unless you are already maxed or something, in which case the next expansion is months away and you don't need those AAs anyhow :).</div></div><hr />

What I meant was that I spent 60 aa on something that just got changed to 25 total. I'm not really upset about it though, since I will now have 35 aa to go on a binge shopping spree with (not to mention the 5 from WA) But its slightly annoying having ground out 60 aa (which was akin to beating my head against a stone wall constantly, without stopping) and then having it changed to to 25 total to max.</div></div><hr />

Not that I'm complaining - it's just 40+ more AA for me to spend on OOW abilities - but at the same time - what's the point?</div></div><hr />

The point is, players asked for a look at GoD aa's and a possible rebalance of them, and the Devs decided to lower the prices. In case you haven't noticed, EQ isn't exactly at its prime right now. People aren't willing to invest as much grind time into it, because it isn't the monopoly it once was over the MMORPG genre. Stuff like, say, 1AA for 5 hitpoints, yeah, its not exactly a compelling reason to keep playing the game, especially if they were to continue scaling it that way. We want players to keep playing, and the obvious way to do that is to give them stuff that keeps them in the game (hello all of OOW with its extremely easy, shiny loot).</div></div><hr />

It was to slow down progression and it did.  Now however SoE is like a deer in the headlights with WoW coming out. <br />
<br />
I think they are doing the patch right *AFTER* WoW comes out to pull people back into EQ.  Dunno if it will work but it might.<br />
<br />
Good for the WARs who skipped all the defensive aa's to get hps!  Maybe you won't die now ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At SoE they secretly have a chart outlining every major event that has ever happened in this world.  Any possible action done by SoE is done to mitigate the effect of the thousands of events that can possibly affect the subscription base of EQ.<br />
<br />
GoD AAs were a bit on the pricy side but no one ever said EQ was fair.  Planar Durability costs more than Natural Durability (ignoring increase in XP gains between expansions) but people didn't complain.  Chaotic Potential is comparable to Sturdiness 5 in terms of AA/HP gained still and some people still swear by that.<br />
<br />
It was fine GoD costs were slightly too expensive and it's fine they decide to bring them down.  Unless you want them to go back and change run 1-3 to 5/5/5 instead of 1/1/1 (and a whole mess of undercosted earlier AAs) you shouldn't be complaining about whether anything's too expensive.</div></div><hr />

Some people save AA and get skills later, instead of spending them every time they get 1 or 2.....<br />

Any new info on this? One of the few things I'm looking forword to over the next year, haha, besides SW:E3 and WoT:KoD.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, guess I'll just play WoW until EQ temporarily boosts my interest on the 15th.<br />

Damn your addictiveness WoW!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexus</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally don't much mind this change. It was aimed pretty much specifically at the players in the same situation as me (about 550 AA per character right now, a LOT spent in GoD AA's, and all essential raid-oriented AA's defensive and offensive done on cleric and warrior). <br />
<br />
People with less AA than me are bitching because they'll possibly lose AA's they gained in GoD. Most of those people don't spend much time grinding anymore and it's an interestingly sidelong way of forcing you to be more active to regain what you once had again.<br />
<br />
People with more AA than me are bitching because they've been running out of things to buy aside from resists and junk AA's to play around with while naked in an arena waiting for a CR, this leaves them feeling like they busted their ass for nothing, and both bitter and frustrated from the fact that people who play extremely less than them can possibly get a leg-up on them.<br />
<br />
For me I'll just shrug and take it as it is. If I login after patch and have 100 AA banked on both characters (which by the looks of it I might!), I'll buy a few toys I never got before GoD that I probably should have, and then continue to grind to finish off my OOW toy AA's (Resist cap increase, extra buff slots, overwhelming attack *snicker*).<br />
<br />
It's just another phase in SoE's plan to attempt to appease the casual gamers who are leaving en masse for WoW and EQ2. They know they've got the hardcore players hooked either way, and for quite a while now they've been smart enough to go back to the roots and make the ignorant happy. It's business.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how many AA I'm looking at getting, but it won't be enough for me to start working on resists again. But it'll be close, I hope. Hell.. I still haven't gotten Warcry!</div></div><hr />
