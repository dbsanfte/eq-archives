<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GlowanMcLean</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some great ideas here.  Here's one I think might address the issue. I got the idea from seeing how the bard epic adds to the effectiveness of their songs.  I was talking with my bard officer and thought &quot;wish warriors had a reason like that not to bank our epics about the time we got them&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hey Verant, change our useless epic sword(s) into something that actually adds to our abilities:<br />
<br />
Gauntlets of the Warlord (hands slot)<br />
AC: +25 Str: +20 Sta: +15 Dex: +15 Magic Resist: +10 Fire Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +10 Poison Resist: +10 Disease Resist: +10 HP: +100<br />
Effect: Rage of Zek (combat) (1. decrease HPs by 175; 2. Increase Hate by 500)<br />
<br />
Other than the AC, the stats are from the Jagged Blade of War.<br />
I thought about putting 41 haste on it too, like the rogue or ranger epics, but that would probably be too powerful.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point is this: with this in your hands slot and procing as if it were in your primary slot, it adds aggro procs ON TOP OF the procs from whatever weapon or weapons you are using.  <br />
<br />
While we would still be slaves to the RNG to a point, this would increase our aggro generation ability without giving us the snap or assured aggro that Verant doesn't want us to have because it would make raid aggro too easy for us.<br />
<br />
This would increase warrior aggro ability for levels 50-65 without making things so easy that it would change the risk versus reward dynamic Verant obviously wants to keep.  As a warrior goes from a Frostbringer/Defiance combo through the BoW, his aggro generation will be increased across the board from the point where he earns his epic.<br />
<br />
Those of us who already have our epics could throw them in a forge for the new item.<br />
<br />
Interested in hearing your thoughts.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggested the same thing several months ago but I don't think SoE has any interest in making the warrior epic useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rade</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Khumak.  Where as this is a good idea you can bank on the fact that SoE has no intrest in changing a 2+ year old item.<br />
<br />
It would be better if we requested this as part of balancing the itemization of warriors.  Either this item specifically, or suggesting the hate proc on gloves instead of swords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">in terms of the warrior epic, I'd just as soon rather seem the upgrade the 2h proc to match RZTW's version of Rage of Zek. But, I like the idea of them being gaunts to enhance the weapons you're wielding as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would personally rather have them make the ratio better and add a proc for the blue blade.  That would so rock!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I certainly wouldn't see myself bagging these gauntlets any time soon.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheGiantOne</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm....<br />
<br />
Okay I like some of you have been in these lands since they were born over 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
From one expansion to the next we have seen POWER (best class if you want to call it) change hands as time went on.<br />
<br />
As a previous poster has put it look at our AA and then ask yourself &quot;where is our individuality&quot;? Sorry but it got lost in the last round of AA's that were created for most melee and hybrids.<br />
<br />
Its quite a simple fix if ya ask me Please Verant take that weapon of ours you call an epic that most of us have stored in bank and make it into something that won't embarrass us to use.<br />
<br />
Jagged Blade of War <br />
<br />
Type: Slots Weapon: Primary <br />
Weapon Skill 2HS <br />
Damage DMG: 36 DLY: 41 DPS: 17.8 (has damage bonus) <br />

Skill Mod None <br />
Boosts STR: +20 DEX: +15 STA: +15 HP: +100 SV FIRE: +10 SV DISEASE: +10 SV COLD: +10 SV MAGIC: +10 SV POISON: +10 <br />
Effect Rage of Zek <br />
Weight &amp; Size WT: 6.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />

<br />
and change it to the following:<br />
<br />

Weapon Skill 2HS <br />
Damage DMG: 55 DLY: 35 DPS: 28 (has damage bonus) <br />

Effect Rage of Zek (Change from 500 hate to 1500 hate) <br />
Weight &amp; Size WT: 6.0 Size: MEDIUM <br />
Class WAR <br />
<br />
After all the word epic means over a long period of time and should be one of the best weapons in the game if you have been lucky enough to complete that pain in the butt quest in the past.<br />
<br />
or take the following 2 epic weapons:<br />
<br />
Blade of Tactics <br />
Type: Slots Weapon: Primary, Secondary <br />
Weapon Skill 1HS <br />
Damage DMG: 14 DLY: 24 DPS: 12.08 <br />

Effect Rage of Tallon <br />
Weight &amp; Size WT: 2.5 Size: SMALL <br />
Class WAR <br />
Race ALL <br />
<br />
change this one to:<br />
<br />
Blade of Tactics <br />
Type: Slots Weapon: Primary, Secondary <br />
Weapon Skill 1HS <br />
Damage DMG: 16 DLY: 21 DPS: 15 <br />
Magic DMG None <br />
Bane DMG None <br />
Skill Mod None <br />
Boosts STR: +20 DEX: +15 HP: +75 SV FIRE: +10 SV DISEASE: +10 SV COLD: +10 SV MAGIC: +10 SV POISON: +10 <br />
Effect Rage of Tallon (change to dex +80, attack +60, ac +40) <br />
Weight &amp; Size WT: 2.5 Size: SMALL <br />
Class WAR <br />
Race ALL <br />
<br />
and this other 1/2 of the epic<br />
<br />
Blade of Strategy <br />
Type: Slots Weapon: Primary, Secondary <br />
Weapon Skill 1HS <br />
Damage DMG: 14 DLY: 24 DPS: 12.08 <br />
Magic DMG None <br />
Bane DMG None <br />
Skill Mod None <br />
Boosts STR: +10 STA: +15 HP: +50 SV FIRE: +5 SV DISEASE: +5 SV COLD: +5 SV MAGIC: +5 SV POISON: +5 <br />
Effect Rage of Vallon <br />
Weight &amp; Size WT: 2.5 Size: SMALL <br />
Class WAR <br />
Race ALL <br />
<br />
and turn it into:<br />
<br />
Blade of Strategy <br />
Type: Slots Weapon: Primary, Secondary <br />
Weapon Skill 1HS <br />
Damage DMG: 16 DLY: 21 DPS: 15 <br />
Magic DMG None <br />
Bane DMG None <br />
Skill Mod None <br />
Boosts STR: +20 STA: +15 HP: +75 SV FIRE: +10 SV DISEASE: +10 SV COLD: +10 SV MAGIC: +10 SV POISON: +10 <br />
Effect Rage of Vallon (change to: decrease hit points on target by 300 and raise you on targets hate list by 1000)<br />
Weight &amp; Size WT: 2.5 Size: SMALL <br />
Class WAR <br />
Race ALL <br />
<br />
Then after that add an additional damage of 20% more to each of the offensive AA skills and 20% more to defensive AA skills.<br />
<br />
Now we are rocking.<br />
<br />
LOL..now I know some of you are saying &quot;he went overboard on the changes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nope I don't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is the risk vs reward to obtain em. I wouldn't mind seeing them getting a little overhaul but making them 'the best' again isn't really on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackulle</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Epic's never really were the best... I got mine pretty early on and they were outdated when I got em (pre velious) not that there were really that many better weapons, but even then they just didnt quite make par on dps and agro.  What I thought then and still think is that the blue sword should have haste on it, like ranger and rogue epic.  Specially when you consider that really ranger and rogue epic are a pretty good deal easier to obtain than warrior's and a pretty good deal superior in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The warrior Epic has been changed. I don't see the information on Lucy's, but the Red and 2h proc used to be a Debuff, similiar to Cripple. This was changed (correct me if I'm wrong) about the time that the Blade of Carnage was changed to what it is now- Maybe earlier? Point is, our epic is, as far as I know, the only epic that was ever changed.<br />
<br />
I would maintain that the answer here is NOT request that the Epic be changed. All classes bank their epic sooner or later- I mean, it's from Kunark.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anything off the top of my head that's from Kunark that blows away the Epic- But I never had the epic when it was a Debuff proc, and I've never really checked the weapons from VP. I can't imagine that a Jade Mace or Lammy would take over.<br />
<br />
Is stuff from Velious Better? Of course. But think about it- If it wasn't... wouldn't the people who already had the Epic when Velious came out be kinda bored with it?<br />
<br />
IMO, the biggest problem with our Epic is that name... the Epic... If it was just the jagged blade of war quest, no one would be pointing at it and saying &quot;It's the JBoW Quest! It SHOULD be the best!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, the gloves idea is kinda cool... I know of the gloves in VT with call of fire? I just don't see making the Epic into that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panazule</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the major problem here is what about Beastlord epics?<br />
<br />
This is an insanely easy quest as well and yet the quality of the items coincide with the weapons available when the BL class was introduced.<br />
<br />
The war epic from day 1 has been lacking.  Why is the primary blade 14/24 and a ranger epic 13/21 ?  It just doesnt make sense to me.<br />
<br />
I would agree I don't think making them the &quot;BEST&quot; again would be a good idea however they never were more than &quot;decent&quot; and that's a shame because all in all the war epic, for the period it was aimed at, was not one of the easier epics.<br />
<br />
I think SoE's policy of never forcing people to have other expansions is ridiculous.  That rule in itself needs to be changed but even so, if they want to make a secondary quest to upgrade your epics just put the quest giver in kunark...<br />
<br />
I know it was depressing for me the day I put my red sword in the bank and I never even wielded my blue one heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm SO for this gauntlet idea.  Add a proc on top of your weapon with gauntlets that add very good stats.  I'm game for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas-<br />
<br />
There WAS a warrior add-proc-to-weapon guantlet, the Gauntlets of the Blood Fiend.  Was a self-buff necro lifetap, 75pts.  Got nerfed due to SK whinefest.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that proc-buffs require a spell icon (i.e. can't be permanent, must be a buff/icon), which is kinda ouchie.  Would also be a inconvienience to GoDS wearing folks... nothing's perfect tho.  I'd rather just see them put in Epic v2.0 quests into the upcoming expansion than muck w/ the existing one, but that's just me.  Oh, and make the damned scabbord a 10 slot 100pct weight reducer. :)<br />
