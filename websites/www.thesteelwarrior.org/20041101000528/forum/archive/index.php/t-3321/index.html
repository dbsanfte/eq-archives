<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ardbeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have mostly been playing my Barbarian warrior as an alt, but I am getting to like him more and more. He is now lev 38 and is probably in need of upgrades.<br />
<br />
I dont have a Magelo up, but he is mostly in Fine plate armor, with an Acrylia breastplate and FBSS. Cloak is Spider Fur, Orc Fang earrings and ac/hp rings.<br />
<br />
Weapons are Jagged blade of mourning/Centi shortsword/Centi warhammer/Sharpened mandible spear/Ornate runeblade and Frost giant femur. Got a darkwood  bow for pulling.<br />
<br />
Looking for a plan for upgrades that will last him into maybe his mid 50s. I suppose I should be concentrating on ac/hp gear, but I don't know exactly what values to aim for. I dont have any insane amounts of cash to spend at once so not looking for pices that cost 5-10k each or more.<br />
<br />
How is the cultural armor for Barbarians? Is the components hard to collect? I got a load of blue diamonds in bank, so that is np.<br />
<br />
Also he is Tribunal Diety.<br />
<br />
Greatful for any and all advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cultural armor for Barbarians that are RZ is around 5-10kpp per piece on Nameless server. Should look into that because it lasts a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tribunal Diety is better, and on my server cheeper, than RZ diety armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Helanic Tundra ( that's trib cultural right? ) is DAMN good stuff; hell it'll get ya into your 60's.<br />
<br />
see if you can strike some deals on it; it'll be money well spent for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SamirDaStinky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">try to score a frostbringer.  it has decent stats and a decent aggro proc. not sure if you're high enough to set off the proc, but the stats alone and the ratio on it will make it worth it. they're not too expensive either.</div></div><hr />
