Killed the elites for the weapons, found Smith Rondo inside a wall... highsun'd him back to his spawn, but he was agro to all who went near him, indiff from a distance. So we figured this is the 2nd version who you have to kill, since another guild had failed on this event the day before. We killed him and his spirit spawned, but all it responded with from hailing was &quot;...stares at you blankly&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I guess the old raid that spawned him the day before are the only ones who can get the flags...<br />
<br />
Strange he didn't depop and return to his 1st state after the other guild wiped, would have been bugged until next patch unless we didn't highsun him out of the wall...<br />
<br />
What is his respawn time?</div></div><hr />
