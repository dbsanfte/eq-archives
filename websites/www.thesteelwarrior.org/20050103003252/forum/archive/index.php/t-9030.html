<br />
Savage Onslaught - all Crits become Cripples and<br />
Mighty Strike - all normal melee hits become Crits<br />
<br />
can't co-exist. To output a string of Cripples Warriors still need to be 60% dead, likely to expire soon due to low HP aggro, and use Mighty Strike.<br />
<br />
It appears that the AA abilities affecting crit rate and Cleave are the only way to make Savage Onslaught do more than a bare minimum number of Cripples when used.<br />
<br />
Can anyone point me to a parse of crit rate with the AA's and say Cleave II or III? Has anyone done a parse showing Cripple rate or DPS increase as a result of using Savage Onslaught?<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to make this a useful discipline?<br />

It would allow us some nice burst DPS on occasion without having to hold off heals and try to stay berzerk for the duration. <br />
I can't really see it being too unbalancing as we can do it now as it is, just at greater risk.</div></div><hr />

It would have been just way too much for SOE to have ever given anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">since when do you use two disc at the same time ?<br />
even if they were on two separate timers you wouldn't use them both at the same time. but you would be able to chain them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course you are right Yoda. Like I said, I was optimistic enough to think it was going to be........<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
Discipline Holyforge - helps supply the crits<br />
Ability Slay Undead - converts crits to massisve (2k-10kHP) damage vs. undead<br />
Duration 5 minutes<br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
Discipline Mighty Strike - supplies the crits (or, if user is mostly dead, produces Cripples)<br />
Discipline Savage Onslaught - all Crits become Cripples /w modest (100-1kHP) damage vs. all mobs<br />
Duration 5 Ticks (in contrast to 5 minutes as in Slay Undead)<br />
<br />
I agree, SoE wasn't likely to combine two Warrior half-disciplines into a useful whole discipline even if it's for 1/10th the damage per hit and 1/10th the duration of what other classes get. My bad. I got overly excited/optimistic  when I first heard about my &quot;high level&quot; disciplines.<br />
<br />
With Aspit's parse showing a half-dozen modest Cripples under Savage Yawnslaught, the question remains - Any idea how to get this discipline to be worth using? Should my Raid Leader say, &quot;Offensive Discs Now&quot;, it looks like Fellstrike is still my best bet unless it becomes common practice to Furious/AE Taunt chain in raids.<br />
<br />
Having &quot;bought&quot; Savage Onslaught, I'd like to find a use for it.<br />

To be useful they have to make this a cripple on every swing.  Useless in it's current form.  I don't know why they would think  that we would want a damage disc that is far worse than our current ones with a higher end cost.  This is like giving clerics an &quot;improved complete heal&quot; that costs 600 mana and heals 6500 hps with an 11 second casting time.<br />
<br />
Wishing I hadn't turned in the rune for this now, :(  I could have given it to a caster to get something they might actually use.</div></div><hr />
