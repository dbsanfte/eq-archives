<br />
I have been looking thru Allakhazam, but cant really find an explanation of it<br />
<br />
Think the Mobs for the Cycle are Exiled and Cursed<br />
<br />
What I am looking to find out is, how do you trigger / start the Cycle and what Mobs have to be killed in what time to get thru them all. What order do they come in.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any information you can give me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Kill all the named in the basement, within a given amount of time (they all have to be dead at the same time, 1-2 hours?) or before rival guild comes in to start cycle, as always seems to happen.<br />
<br />
When all the named (lvl 60s) are dead the Glyphed Covered Serpent will pop. Or if someone killed Glyphed but failed on Exiled/Cursed you get a Rune covered serprent. <br />
<br />
When the Rune/Glyphed is dead you get Vy'zhdra the Exiled or some no loot crap mob, depends if someone failed on Cursed or not. <br />
<br />
<br />
When Exiled is dead then you get the cursed. Over all its a easy cycle, great loot, just remember Exiled = DT, Cursed = Charm, Glyphed = FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned above the cursed cycle begins in the basement.  To ensure the cycle is ready to be triggered you need to make sure that both Rhozth Ssrakizh and Ssrakezh are up.  Ssrakizh is on a normal 30 (?) min repop and Ssrakezh is on a 5 day spawn.  Once you have made sure that Ssrakezh is up you know the cycle is ready.<br />
<br />
To begin the cycle you need to kill 10 mobs in under 1 hour.  The 7 named taskmasters that I'm sure your familiar with anyway.  The 1 roaming warden that can be found near the mines.  And finally the 2 Rhozth mobs that you were tracking earlier.  Once all 10 of these are dead approximately 1 minute later you will recieve a zone wide emote and the Glyph covered serpent (or a rune covered as explained in a previous post) will spawn.  <br />
<br />
The Glyph covered has an AE FD that checks off Cold resist (if I recall) and will also knockback the MT.  Once Glyphed is dead Exiled will spawn.<br />
<br />
Exiled has a fire based AE that is supposed to be a fear + small dot but it's extremely easy to resist.  Exiled also DT's occasionally but I don't believe that it is actually timed it seems to be random.  You will need a DT sacrifice to pull Exiled down so plan accordingly.<br />
<br />
Finally is Cursed which has 2 AE's an AE charm that is based on disease resist and an AE dot that is based on poison.  Will leave it up to you and your guild to decide how you want to engage cursed as many guilds do it different ways, find a way that works for your own mix of people.  I will add that the poison AE dot is pretty diffulcult to resist and unless you have a huge healing crew it will be diffulcult to straight up melee him down while healing people from the AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donbe Mesinwitm</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Curse can be done with 30 peeps or less. We took him out on our very first try using 30. Our guild is not that Uber at all but we have great leadership and some very talanted players. We had 2  two boxed clerics and 4 druids healing and at lest 1 of them was boxed. I was the ST with the boxed druid. This ended up to be about a 20 miniute fight and I don't think we lost anyone one in death at all. Vladimoir has the right strats on the cycle. GM OOC the server on the kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cursed Cycle and what triggers him ... the simple Explaination.<br />
<br />
there are 3 mobs in the cycle, once its spawned.<br />
<br />
Glyphed Covered Serpent.<br />
Vyzh'Dra the Exiled<br />
Vyzh'Dra the Cursed.<br />
<br />
To spawn the cycle, Rhozth Ssrakezh, and Rhozth Ssravizh both need to be up, one of them is a 2 hour spawn, and one is a 7 day spawn (once the cycle is complete).  If only one of them is up, the cycle cannot, CANNOT, be spawned.  Both Rhozths will spawn 2 hours after being killed if the cycle is not complete.<br />
<br />
If both Rhozths are up, you need to make sure 8 other mobs are also up.<br />
<br />
all 7 taskmasters, and Warden Mekuzh.<br />
<br />
Kill all the taskmasters (2 hour spawn) and the Warden (2 hour spawn), then kill the Rhozths... Glyphed Covered Serpent will then spawn, starting the Cursed Cycle.<br />
<br />
You have 30 minutes to pull Glyphed before he despawns, or you must wait for 2 more hours to start it again.<br />
<br />
Glyphed has an AE feign death, which means your healers must assist heal, THIS IS NOT a MT fight.<br />
<br />
Once Glyphed is killed, then Vyzh'Dra the Exiled spawns.  Again, you have 30 minutes to pull him, or he depops, and you will need to start the cycle over again.<br />
<br />
Exiled is the toughest of the 3 mobs in the cycle.  He procs a DT every 2 minutes, so have a MT rotation set up.  THIS IS a MT fight.  Though you will need to swap through 2 or 3 in order to beat him.  He procs a stun/spin, and a blind.<br />
<br />
When Exiled is killed Vyzh'Dra the Cursed spawns.  You again have 30 minutes to pull Cursed, before he despawns, and you guessed it, you must wait to start over.<br />
<br />
Cursed is a difficult mob to get a strategy down for.  Welcome to your first Ranged Damage mob.  You will want to use Knights to tank him.  HE IS A MT Fight, though use knights, with a bard in the group.  Cursed Charms, stay at MAX ranged damage range. 170 is the range on his charm. <br />
<br />
Cursed is the easiest of the 3, though takes the longest to kill.  Hes a pure attrition fight, if you can keep your knight tanks up, hes as good as dead.  <br />
<br />
If bychance you need to start the cycle over again, Clones of the mobs you have killed will spawn in place.  the clones are EXACT copies of their sister mobs, with different names, and drop no loot.  Rune Covered Serpent is the Cycle place holder for Glyphed.  And something Banished is the place holder for Exiled.  Obviously there is no holder for Cursed, as kill him, and the cycle ends.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like different strats work for this cycle.<br />
Glyphed AE can be resisted, and we use MT for him.<br />
Exiled DT seems to either skip sometimes or can be resisted as well as we had fights without deaths that went longer than 2 minutes.<br />
We do Cursed always with a warrior MA.<br />
The AE is timed, so once you know when AE procs you are golden for avoiding it and running back.<br />
If you have an abundance of healers with MGB heals - SotW, paragon... you can even skip the run and get back part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the change in gravity Flux AE's ( they no longer send you flying all over the place ) I think the Glyphed is the easiest fight.<br />
Exiled DT is a pain at best, he is rather easy as long as you have raid setup to quickly change MA once MT DT dies. I have resisted Exiled DT a few times, however expect Main Assist to eventually drop on the Exiled.<br />
Cursed strats vary we use 2 MT grouped with a bard for resists and they NEVER get charmed. One MT to keep agro, the other to ensure Cursed is positioned properly as a Single MT cant really position cursed well due to auto summoning. Everyone else stays out of range and Range Kill him down. Takes less than 20 minutes to do Cursed in this manner.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

Just get your resists way up via bard song, and beat his ass down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gravdiger</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the information that is very helpful.</div></div><hr />

The beat down method requires your raid to have more than one bard in attendance...something we have yet to see.<br />

<br />
It is also funny to watch ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, keep a bard in the MT's group, so he doesn't get charmed.</div></div><hr />

[B]Since the change in gravity Flux AE's ( they no longer send you flying all over the place ) I think the Glyphed is the easiest fight.<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is not the case, We did him last night and becuase someone decided to be within aggro range after monk FD...I had to Run out from my corner and WHAM, I got launched to the other side of the basement.  This in turn had a chain reaction, I think about 30 of us or so took several trips in the air.<br />
<br />
Glyphed was the hardest fight.  Other 2 were cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naralli, why more than one bard?<br />
Have your bard stand close to MA and twist AE resist, AE mana and maybe rizlona or warsong (if your bard is lower than level 64) and you dont need more than one.<br />
It can be done as i have played that one bard (my back then 57 bard-didnt even have ae mana then) at cursed because no main bard was on yet and a US guild tried to blow the timer.</div></div><hr />

It takes no more than 15-20 minutes and we have very few deaths ( deaths usually people who have got to close ).<br />
If it aint broke dont fix it.<br />

<br />
Glyphed - Cakewalk.  Can heal the MT with spot heals.  Just have your raid pay attention to when they're FD so they get up quick enough.  Otherwise, Glyphed runs over to your clerics cause your MT doesn't realize he's down.<br />
<br />
Exiled - Starts getting a little harder.  A rot would be best for this guy if you're just trying him out.  He's not particularly hard, but he does Death Touch.  I'd wager around 170-200dps or so, give or take a bit depending on how well your MT is AA'd.  Just kill quickly.<br />
<br />
Cursed - Quads and Flurries for 600s or so and parses out to ~250dps.  You also have to include the dot damage (500 per tick?) that your MT is most likely taking as well.  Unslowed, however, Cursed hits extremely fast and can burn through your tank in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
The LORE behind Vyzh`dra is that he was once a rival to Ssraeshza.  If you put together the fragments you collect from the taskmasters/wardens, they piece together a phrase in which I cannot remember.  Basically, Vyzh`dra, like Ssraeshza, had the strength and power to slay gods.  Because of his strength, and the fact that he was also supposedly insane, Ssraeshza had him exiled/cursed.  I'd imagine the Exiled version was his true version of himself while the Cursed version is what he became while in torment.  Anyways, it's probably the only cool thing you'll ever hear about Ssra, so good luck!  :P<br />
<br />
Btw, best of luck on a Bloodfrenzy!!!  :D</div></div><hr />

Exiled has the highest melee DPS out of the cycle just because he's not slowable at all (but I think his PH, Banished, is slowable).</div></div><hr />
