<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">* Enrage - Increased the number of charges to 12. Decreased the duration to 12 seconds. The new duration is the limiting factor for slower weapons (e.g. Arcanite Reaper will typically get one less swing), while dual wielding and faster weapons will make better use of all of the charges over the duration of the ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not see this as a total nurf to slow 2H weapons but even a buff in certain situations.  Yes, if you base it off auto attack then it is a buff.  However, if enrage fires, it means you are being attacked.  Being attacked = rage.  Rage = being able to use your instant attacks.  In PvP you take damage so much faster rage can build quickly.  That means you could at least get off 1 if not 2 instant strikes in 12 seconds.  In certain situations, maybe 3.  Having the extra charges means that even with a 2H weapon, you could possibly get off 5 attacks, 6 if your really lucky.  You should at the very least get 3 off, 2 auto attacks and 1 Mortal Strike.  If overpower lights up, that is another, and if you got the rage you can do WW too.  If the stars align right, you can get 3 auto attacks and an overpoower, 2 MS's, or 1 MS and a WW for 6 enraged attacks.  Not likely, but possible.  When fighting mobs, you could save your rage for enrage as it almost always does to unload your MS, WW, and then MS again.  It does hurt some, but it can work in your advantage some times.  Anyone see a problem with this reasoning?</div></div><hr />

Anyone know by how much they increased the chance to block on this talent.  I would assume to 2% per level, but that is a guess.</div></div><hr />

I think you are reading that wrong... they are not increasing the block %.  They are adding the new rage thing in addition to the current block %.</div></div><hr />

1% chance to block per talent point for max of 5%.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you are right.  Man I am brain dead for some reason today.</div></div><hr />

MS / arc reaper is still superior to dw fury in every way and costs less points overall compared to the power gains made.<br />
<br />
I realize that certain people will now come in and say this comment is completely wrong and prot warriors are very viable in pvp, but any class can beat any other class if they get lucky and / or the opponent is a total retard. It doesn't mean the tree is worth jack shit.</div></div><hr />

Rage cost reduced (no next swing penalty), and made instant.  Damage portion removed but.. who the hell cares?  You don't stun for damage.<br />
<br />
The shield block is pretty handy for a lower tier ability, it will also prevent lower level wars from getting the shaft on rage gen.  It's a minor cost reducer, but it's really meant for the not 60's in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Fury tweaks certainly look pretty nice, but I can't really comment on them without trying a fury build. :/  In order to be worth it, fury has to put out a lot more raw power damagewise to make up for the consise, devastating blows the arms tree can deliver.</div></div><hr />

The protection changes made us a tad better in pvp, but really did very little to nothing to our tanking ability. We already have excess rage tanking bosses (sometimes you just cant push buttons to spend it fast enough) and the concussive change is a nice change for pvp, but in PvE did very little for us. Go-Go Stun-immune!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-13-2005, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, but I would argue prot tree &quot;in general&quot; dosen't need much help in terms of tanking.  It needs more flexability and some tactical usefulness for pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can tank damned near everything in the game with Mortal strike.  There's no reason you can't get the skills you want and still be a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Why Would They Do That!!! I Change weapons so much during battle, True Silver Champion, Thras Blade, Shield, Fist Weapon With Thrash For DW...So not Cool....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-13-2005, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good thing I'm not ^^<br />
<br />
I think the tree is about on par with where it needs to be for damage reduction, but needs some actual useable counters and skills for late game.  Riposte should be in place of improved disarm, some sort of auto-counter like the pallies crit skill, etc.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Rather than adding another post here to reply..<br />
<br />
The duels thing was a bug, you could change equipment where you could for any other fight.   You'll still be able to change weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">05-13-2005, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I agree right now there's very little point to going full protection spec, but that's the part I don't like. I -like- to be a defensive whore, and optimum tank over everything else. <br />
<br />
I like the riposte talent idea, maybe a talent that adds your block amount to shieldbash, and some other cool ideas ^^</div></div><hr />
