<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm pretty sure the idea of an ingame message/mail system has come up before, but I was wondering what the community thinks about it. We already have the lore for bards carrying mail in-game between cities. How about giving players the ability to send messages to other players in an in-game mailbox.<br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to leave a message for my friends when they are offline, or have a complete message that I can send someone explaining something to them without having to do it over multiple tells. This could be great for raid planning, or for letting people about the quest they are helping you with.<br />
<br />
It seems to be a fairly easy thing to impliment and can go a long way toward helping with planning/communication ingame. I always loved SWGs ingame system. It won't be a walk in the park to add to the game, but for the reward, I'm hard pressed to think of an better possible enhancment.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think? Raaj, you think you could bounce this off the Devs with the batphone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WoW just implemented this system with their last patch..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This type of messaging (persistent) was mentioned a few times, but there was nothing final. I wouldn't be surprised to see it soon though, because GM's already have the ability to leave you messages while you're offline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the update, Raaj. This kinda of enhancement would go a long way in helping ingame communication</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CoH has this as well; it's quite cool ( i think AO was the first to have an in-game message forwarding system even if you're offline. )</div></div><hr />
