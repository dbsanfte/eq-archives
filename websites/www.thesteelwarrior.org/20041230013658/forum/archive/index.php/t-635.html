I've never had to turn one in but I think you lose a significant amount of money from what you originally paid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheers guys I'll try that tonight.  In a rash moment with plat burning a hole in my bank account I bought a horse.  Now I have jboots I never use the damn thing, so might as well redeem what I can from it and put the plat to better use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just go into the stables and hail a few of the NPC's in there, some of them will tell you that they buy back certain color horses, find the guy that says he buys back the type of horse you have, and give him your bridle.  He'll take it, and give you a Bag of Platnum, which can be sold to an NPC vendor for pp.  Make sure you have some charisma buffs up when you give back the bridle AND when you sell the bag to a vendor, because I'm pretty sure the amount of pp you get will be affected both times.  Also, you won't get all of your pp back either, I bought a lizard for 12k, and got about 5k back, but it's still better than nothing.</div></div><hr />
