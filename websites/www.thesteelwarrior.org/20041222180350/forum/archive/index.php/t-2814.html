<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I managed to get my hands on a level 65 Shadow Knight and a level 65 Paladin to do some testing on hate generation (Thanks beta server!!) and came up with some interesting results.<br />
<br />
<br />
Test parameters:<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight using 1 spell:<br />
Terror of Thule (600 points of pure hate, along the same lines as our EB procs.)<br />
<br />
Paladin using 3 spells: <br />
Stun (lvl 30 0.0 sec stun with no dd.. 1.5sec cast with 12 sec refresh)<br />
Force of Akilae (lvl 62 4.0 sec stun with no dd.. 1 sec cast with 12 sec refresh)<br />
Quellious' Word of Serenity (level 64 10.0 sec stun with 108dd.. 2 sec cast with 24 sec refresh)<br />
<br />
<br />
The Shadow Knight, with no weapon equipped, would the bring the mob to the test area with proximity agro, then cast Terror of Thule (600 pure agro).  The SK would then duck to avoid riposte and stand there with attack off.<br />
<br />
We ran 5 tests:<br />
<br />
1.) Paladin cast Stun(level 30 0.0sec stun) until the mob turned on the paladin. <br />
<br />
After repeating this with 4 mobs, it consistantly took five(5) 0.0 sec stuns to turn the mob off the Shadow Knight. Total time: ~67 seconds.<br />
<br />
2.) Paladin cast Force of Akilae (lvl 62 4.0 sec stun) until the mob turned on the paladin.<br />
<br />
After repeating this with 5 mobs, again it consistantly took five(5) 4.0 sec stuns to turn the mob off the Shadow Knight.  Total time: ~67 seconds<br />
<br />
3.)  Paladin alternating between Stun and Force of Akilae with just enough time in between casts to see if the mob turned on the paladin. (Cast Stun, wait for the stun to wear off, cast Force of Akilae, wait for the stun to wear off, wait for Stun to ungrey, rinse/repeat) <br />
<br />
After repeating this with 4 mobs, it consistantly took five(5) stuns, regardless of the stun duration, to turn the mob on the paladin.  Total time: ~34 seconds<br />
<br />
4. ) Paladin cast Quellious' Word of Serenity (level 64 10.0 sec stun with 108dd, knockback:1) until the mob turned on the Paladin.<br />
<br />
After repeating with 8 mobs, it consistantly took three(3) 10sec stuns+108dds to turn the mob on the paladin.  Total time:~78 seconds<br />
<br />
5.) Paladin didn't begin to cast on the mob until the Shadow Knight had tanked for 3 minutes. Paladin cast Quellious' Word of Serenity (level 64 10.0 sec stun with 108dd, knockback:1) until the mob turned on the Paladin.<br />
<br />
After repeating with 3 mobs, it consistantly took three(3) 10 sec stuns+108dds to turn the mob on the paladin.  Total time: ~ 4:20 seconds<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, after the testing, it seems that, regardless of the duration of the stun, whether it be 0.0 4.0 or 10.0, they generate a set amount of agro. (Which appears to be between 121 and 149 points of agro)<br />
<br />
If a stun is between 121 and 149 agro, the Paladin casting Quellious' Word of Serenity (level 64 10.0 sec stun with 108dd, knockback:1), proved that the DD damage does at minimum .15 point of agro and at maximum 1 points of agro per point of DD.   I'll see if I can narrow this number down any more in a few days.<br />
<br />
Test #5 showed that hate doesn't decrease over time if there is only one person on the hate list.  I'll go back and run another test to check if hate diminishes over time with 2 people on the hate list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was all of the Paladin agro coming from the stuns? Or was he also meleeing during this time.<br />
<br />
The tests might actually end up differently if the paladin does melee damage as well.<br />
<br />
Other than that...seems interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No melee damage on either side.. just stuns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have allways belived you need three people to do aggro test, the two you used but adding one more to gain initial aggro then walk away from the fight to remove the inital aggro bonus from the test.<br />
<br />
Also, what mob(s) are you testing on? That has a factor on how much hate is generated per spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did the shorter tests on yard trash in PoN.  Did the 3 minute tests on the rats in PoJ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure you cant calculate stun value by dividing terror agro by amount of stuns like that.<br />
<br />
Try making 2 SKs, and do the same test. I think you will find that you will need to cast a fair amount of Terrors to drag it off the first SKs that agroed. Initial agro+hatebonus for proximity and all that jazz.<br />
<br />
Or, do the reverse test. Try to proximity agro with the paladin, and cast 1 stun. I am willing to bet you will not be able to drag it off the paladin with 1 Terror of Thule.<br />
<br />
Still interesting results though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree that you need a 3rd person to actually get initial agro. Have them pull, then have the SK pull agro off with Terror of Thule then cast stuns until agro moves to the pally.  I would have the SK and pally stand against a wall right next to each other to try and negate proximity as much as possible as well.<br />
<br />
Overall, good test, I think you are really on to something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, you need to test with a 3rd char who gets 'initial aggro' there is a hate value with that, or you can try to prove otherwise...<br />
<br />
Interesting to know that all stuns are the same aggro + DD + knockback though, maybe.<br />
<br />
This would put SoD around 288 + 149 = 437 hate at max.  And a minimum of 164 hate.  I'd say that it's at least 400 hate, since it seems to draw a lot more 'snap' aggro for me than EB does on HG.<br />
<br />
Norge'tal around 239 hate max per proc.<br />
<br />
You don't seem to have calculated the knockback effect on aggro?  Both SoD, Norge'tal have knockbacks.  Also Quellious' Word of Serenity has a knockback of 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Add Cease to your tests, please.<br />
<br />
Any chance you could also find a mob to stun that would be immune to it, to see how much aggro that does, a swell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just &quot;stun&quot; lvl 30 is a 4.0 second stun<br />
<br />
also your testing how much hate is needed to turn the mob. try it without tot on to see if it is different. if it takes 4 without and 5 with we know its more then 600hate unless you just needed 1 more hate point to gain agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a good idea.  A couple things:<br />
<br />
1) you don't really need a third person, but you do need a way to ensure that pally/sk are starting with approximately the same hate.  I think an easy way to do this would be to pull with SK, then have the pally taunt the mob till he has it.  Then their aggro should be right about the same.  At that point, have the SK cast his hate spell.<br />
<br />
2) how did proximity factor into your test?  It's alot easier to turn a mob than it is to make him run over to you and whack you.  Both characters need to be at the same proximity to do this test.<br />
<br />
3) I have heard long long ago (pre luclin at least) that hate does in fact decay.  I'd encourage you to try to deturmine this definately for sure or not with your test.  You'd probably have to find a little green mob so you could tank it for like 30 mins without needing a heal.  Pull, pally taunt, sk EB it, wait 30 mins then see if it still requires the same ammount of &quot;hate&quot; to pull it off.  Make sure to use factors #1 and #2 above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) you don't really need a third person, but you do need a way to ensure that pally/sk are starting with approximately the same hate.

You would need three people read the sticky at the top of this forum for details on how inital aggro can mess with taunt and hate values</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sscaley</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couldn't the SK just FD to remove aggro? Or maybe use a mage for coth, or cleric atone mob once in camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have a third class just have them aggro the mob then let the knights aggro off them. It's way easyer and less complicated than trying to figure out how another aggro effect would alter the results.<br />
<br />
<br />
Memblur( i.e FD ) might just give the inital aggro bonus to someone else.<br />
<br />
So in short, just get another person it's not that hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like Varaho said, it's much easier to just use a 3rd person to get initial aggro. Cuts out one more variable that way, especially considering different mobs can have very different initial hate values. <br />
<br />
Another thing to keep in mind is that stun hate probably still scales with the hp of the mob. All debuffs, stuns, snares, etc hate values scale with the hp of the mob...at least they used to. This may have been changed, but I'm guessing not. It might be interesting to try the same test on very low level mobs and see how that plays out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just thought I would point out that if your hate value does not change in a ten minute period you will be erased from the hate list.  Also, changing your aggro bonuses will not keep you on the hate list; only changes to your actual hate value keep you from being erased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went back and ran these again, but changed the parameters slightly.<br />
<br />
Initial agro was HUGE in the original tests, on the order of three or four hundred hate points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pulled with SK.  Taunted off SK with paladin using the Taunt button, ToT with SK.<br />
<br />
Took 3 stuns to get it back, or 2 stuns + dd in all instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how many taunts did you need? was it the same as the taunt test thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magg</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As pointed out, you need to change some things in your test:<br />
<br />
First you need to pull with a neutral party and have the SK pull aggro off the neutral party.  The initial aggro hate bonus is considerable.<br />
<br />
Second, the Paladin needs to have Cease loaded.   I would suggest you test with Cease, Force of Akilae and Quellious' Word of Serenity, as this is probably what most Paladins will have loaded.  Cease for pulling, FoA and QWoS for actually stopping the mob.<br />
<br />
Finally, the mob you are testing on is incredibly important.  Not every mob in the game responds to a stun in the same manner, so all your tests need to be done on one mob.  And perhaps you should repeat the same test on another mob in an entirely different zone.<br />

It is extremely easy to pull aggro off of the puller in a group if they pull with proximity aggro.  Sometimes hitting the mob with an arrow on inc and being closer than the puller is enough.  <br />
<br />
I seriously doubt that it is 3-400 hate points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget that JUST using pure hate is less aggro than using any spell (pick torrent of hate for the SK to pull with, it's low aggro) THEN pure aggro.<br />
<br />
A good test would be:<br />
1 - Have someone pull<br />
2 - Have SK cast ToH (or pain or shroud of either)<br />
3 - Have the SK taunt until they get aggro<br />
4 - Have the SK ToT<br />
5 - THEN stun<br />
<br />
There's a HUGE difference if you put yourself on the aggro list with a pure aggro spell versus doing anything else THEN the pure aggro spell (I tested that in the taunt thread, results are in there... somewhere).<br />
<br />
I did stun testing with a cleric, and wasn't trying to find hard values for stun, so I don't remember the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a HUGE difference if you put yourself on the aggro list with a pure aggro spell versus doing anything else THEN the pure aggro spell  <br />
<br />
What's the huge difference?<br />
What exactly are you saying?<br />
<br />
I find it much easier to pull with tash/slow (I box an enchanter) and then pull taunt (with warrior when she brings mob to camp) then i do If I pull...atk...atk...mob at 98%.. tash/slow... I have a TUFF time getting agro back, takes atleast 2 taunts.  But if my enchanter pulls I just atk and I have agro.<br />
<br />
That's how I pull.  Pacify adds, tash incoming, run to camp, slow incoming, warrior hits atk and the mob is on me like glue.  Enchanter rarely gets hit, max one taunt if I even have to press it at all.<br />
<br />
These are just my findings after playing an enchanter with my warrior.  I have performed no testing but i do let the enchanter pull 75%+ of all exp mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I'm saying is this (and it's actually pretty close to what you see - test results are in the 20-whatever page taunt test thread)):<br />
<br />
Pull with ToD (pure aggro spell adds 450 hate): 1 stun pulls aggro<br />
Pull with ToH (group ATK tap, does jack diddly for aggro normally): 1 stun pulls aggro<br />
Pull with ToH, toss on a ToD: 3 stuns pull aggro<br />
<br />
Conclusion: pure aggro spells don't add a lot of aggro IF AND ONLY IF you are not on the hate list already.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Pulling with Terror of Thule (as done in this test) is NOT an accurate measure of hate, therefore the results are flawed about stun aggro.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Based on what the terror spells do for hate, the test I proposed is a better measure of the absolute amount of stun aggro.<br />
<br />
And it's interesting, but not unexpected that casting high aggro spells before a mob gets into sumon mode has different effects on aggro.  That is, if you tash, slow, whatever, there is less hate than waiting until the mob is meleed (and flips into summon mode) then piling on the hate.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I wonder if slow on incoming would work with a warrior tank? You'd think so based on the previous post...</div></div><hr />

The 'initial aggro bonus' is thrown out the window once the warrior does a point of damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But what if that spell does add directly 450 hate?<br />
<br />
That means that whatever stun spell you used has more hate than 450.<br />
<br />
If that's the case, then something is horridly wrong.<br />
<br />
What stun did you use?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What stun did you use?  <br />
<br />
Ok, let me try this again:<br />
<br />
test 1: Pull with Terror of Darkness (450 direct hate), taunt off with Holy Might.  Took one stun.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: stun aggro =&gt; 450<br />
<br />
test 2: Pull with Torrent of Hate, taunt off with Holy Might.  Took one stun.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: stun aggro =&gt; ToH aggro<br />
<br />
test 3: Pull with Torrent of Hate, cast Terror of Darkness, taunt off with Holy Might.  Took 3 stuns.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: 3 stun aggro =&gt; ToH + ToD aggro<br />
<br />
It's IMPOSSIBLE for ToD to have a full 450 aggro if cast first and those 3 statments to be true (which are my 3 tests).<br />
<br />
Let's say stun has 451 aggro.  Then ToH followed by ToD is 1353 aggro, and since we KNOW ToD is 450 aggro, ToH is 903 aggro, but that's impossible since a stun &gt; ToH (second test).<br />
<br />
If I were to guess, I'd say that ToH has effectively zero aggro, so Holy Might (6 second stun, 60 DD) has between 150 and 225  direct hate (barring first aggro bonus).  Of course this is on a light blue to 57 mob, so who knows how it works in exp combat conditions.<br />
<br />
My point, however, is that any test that involves pulling with a direct aggro spell then taunting off is broken, since Terrors don't supply full aggro if they are the first spell cast to aggro.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;point of damage&quot; does nothing but add the warrior to the hate list.   It is proximity that is the key.  <br />
<br />
Actually, no. The attack is key.<br />
<br />
If you pull with a low aggro spell you can run a mob through a group and it won't look sideways at anyone else (did it all day in Droga yesterday).  If you pull with a low aggro spell, then FD while the mob is in the middle of a group, it will aggro the group (duh).  If you pull with a low aggro spell and someone tags with an arrow on the way in, it will peel straight off you. Point being inital aggro bonus is not that large, if you don't attack afterwards.<br />
<br />
Now, it is possible to pull with something low aggro, have someone tag on the way in.  When that happens it will head for the damager, BUT if the puller then attacks, it's a toss up whether the mob will turn on the puller or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sscaley</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This reminds me of the test someone did with taunt and stuns in FG (stickied).<br />
<br />
Seems to me that Holy Might taunts off Terror because it has an actual dd component and that makes it worth much more in terms of aggro than a pure hate spell.<br />
<br />
Maybe try a test where the paladin is meleeing the mob while the SK exclusively casts pure aggro spells and see how easily the SK will gank aggro, if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd think it might be easier to get more accurate numbers by having the SK do multiple Terror of Thule's or whatever you have available, so that you have a much bigger number to try to overcome with the stuns.  Like doing 10-20 ToT's before trying to stun the mob off, so 6000-12000 points of hate, that way you'll most likely get a more accurate number for your hate generated by stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW this could be important info when you're deciding if you want Anger III (300 points raw hate proc) or Wrath of Ykesha (stun 0 sec, 150 dd) for your weapon.  If a 0 sec stun is &gt; 150 raw hate and 150 dd = 150 raw hate then Wrath of Ykesha is actually a better upgrade to augment your weapon with than Anger III, since you'll have the same or greater hate and you'll have greater dps (assuming it's a non procing weapon to start out with, dunno what happens on a weapon that already has a proc)</div></div><hr />

Terror of Thule (http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?threadid=16350/) The Spll is very buggy at times. A better aggro test at 65 would be a pull using fear(which will be resisted) or the snap aggro spell-Clinging Darkness. A landed Clinging Darkness &gt; A landed Shaman Slow. It is also believed that Festering Darkness is &gt; 1000 Aggro. <br />
I know you guys are looking for accurate numbers, thus the reason for using Terror of Thule, but the spell does not work as it should.</div></div><hr />

I did a dungeon with a Pali as a tank and it sucked. I (cleric 280 wis 5k mana ft13) was constantly out of mana because the pali required 2-3 CH's per fight. Sure if the Pali/SK is full elemental/time he will be good, but a War with High end Velious/Medium level PoP is a way better tank for this expansion On average I only had to Cheal myself 1-2 times every 2 fights. I have also noticed when I play my war that it is much easier to control aggro than I have ever seen in pickup groups.<br />
I have yet to have an SK or Pali out taunt me, even with this retard pali who was chain stunning a melee mob just to prove he could get aggro...at the cost of half his mana. Palis need to stick to group heals and pickup heals in this expansion, not chain stunning mobs that don't cheal.<br />
...<br />
I have had no problems keeping aggro off rrog/mnk and hybrids<br />

While not everything is resolved, it's totally apparent that stuff like stun duration or stun level have no impact on aggro. Level 20 stuns are generating as much as level 62 stuns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think you guys are mistaking initial aggro, with &quot;sticky&quot; aggro.<br />
<br />
When a mob is on a person that mob has a resistance to change targets.  It doesnt have anything to do with being the first person to aggro the mob, it has to do with being the person that mob is currently aggro on.<br />
<br />
When I first did my AE taunt tests, I saw this and attributed it to AE taunt adding top hate + some extra hate.  In actuality, AE taunt just adds top hate + 1 and sticks the mob on you, but for someone else to taunt it off, they have to overcome the &quot;sticky hate&quot; factor.<br />
<br />
In my tests I had a cleric pull a pussling in CoD with 2-3 stuns.  I would then AE taunt off the cleric. The cleric would then cast DD spells to regain aggro while I did no more hate.<br />
<br />
The cleric could not pull the mob off me with 1 90 point DD nuke, but could pull the mob off me every time with 1 160 point nuke.<br />
<br />
I believe sticky aggro to be between 90-160 hate, that is when a mob is aggro on someone, you have to overcome that persons aggro + 90-160 hate to make the mob swap targets.<br />
<br />
Best bet to test aggro of stuns would be to pull with a 3rd party with a good amount of aggro and have the pally use stuns to pull the mob off the 3rd party.  Then repeat the test with a SK, using the thule line to pull the mob off the 3rd party.<br />
<br />
For instance.  Ranger snares mob a 10X and runs to camp.  Pally chains non DD stuns until gaining aggro.  Ranger snares mob b 10x and runs to camp.  SK thules mob until gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
That seems to be a plausible way to take sticky aggro out of the equation.<br />
<br />
PS: I have heard the EQ pen and paper role playing game, has a formula for what I am calling &quot;sticky aggro&quot;.  There is a certain amount of hate in the pen and paper version that a player has to overcome to make a mob swap targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt per the Pencil and Paper rules... .. quoting myself here from another post..<br />
<br />
Taunt<br />
<br />
Taunting is the art of angering and annoying opponents so that they attack you in preference to all other opponents, even if thats a tactically unwise decision for them.<br />
<br />
Check: A Taunt check is opposed by the target's Sense Motive check. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a tuantcheck. Four circumstances can work agains the taunter and they are the following<br />
<br />
1. The target is already attacking someone else.<br />
2. The target is of animal intelligence or lower (they don't understand what you said or are deadset on finishing one person off before the next)<br />
3. The target is above animal intelligence but cannot understand the taunter. (different language etc...)<br />
4. The target realize that attacking the taunter may be tactically unwise.<br />
<br />
Each of these circumstances adds a bonus to the sense motive check of the creature being taunted, as listed below<br />
<br />
Taget's Condition Bonus<br />
<br />
Attacking someone else +10<br />
Animal intelligence +5<br />
Doesn't understand the taunt +5<br />
Tactically unwise +10<br />
<br />
Taunting is a move action. A successful Taunt check indicates that the target MIGHT (yes the book says MIGHT) move toward the taunter --- depending on the targets intelligence and ranged attack options --- but certainly focuses all of its attacks on the taunter for 1 round (and possibly longer if it closes to melee). The target attcks the taunter as intelligently and effectively as it can, but if it knows it cannot attack him, it is likely to ignore the taunt. Targets affected by more than one character's taunt skill will attack the character who taunted tem most recently. If the taunter damages a target on the same round he tries to taunt it, he recieves a +5 circumstance bonus to his Taunt check.<br />
<br />
Scenario: be advised this is based on a D20 system and not 100's and over 300's for stats.<br />
<br />
Karesh, a warrior with Charisma 16 and 8 ranks in Taunt, sees a wolf attacking her wizard companion 75 feet away. She knows she can't reach the wolf in one round, so she tries to goad the wolf into coming to her instead. Karesh first fires an arrow at the wolf to get its attention, striking it for 7 points of damage; she then makes a taunt check, rolling a 9 and adding her taunt bonus of +11, and her +5 circumstance bonus for having damaged the wolf this round, for a total of 25. However, the wolf gains +10 to its sense Motive check because it is already fighting something else, +5 for not understanding Kresh's taunts, and another +5 because its animal intelligence, the GM rolls a 6 on the wolf's sense motive check, so, with its +20 bonus (and +1 for its wisdom score), it gets a total of 27. The wolf keeps attacking the wizard. If karesh had rolled an 11 or higher, the wolf would have turned to attack her isntead, most likely for the remainder of the combat (unless it were then taunted by someone else).</div></div><hr />

It sounds like he's grouping with pretty good Sk's and Pal's to me.  Why would you want them to out taunt him?</div></div><hr />

Sword and Sorcery (the game developers for EQrpg) have no more information about how taunt works than any other person who plays the video game EQ.  I wouldn't base any research or insight for how taunt works in a computer game to its D&amp;D equivolent.</div></div><hr />

ToT has a set hate value there buddy, which is why I used it.  I don't care whether clinging is better agro than ToT.. Clinging doesn't have a set hate value that we know.  ToT does</div></div><hr />
