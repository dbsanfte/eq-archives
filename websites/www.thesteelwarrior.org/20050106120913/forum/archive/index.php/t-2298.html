I'm wandering what is the drop rate on the weapons cause i'd like a pair of 1h's along with a GSoT. I really don't want to pay 20k for copper hammer and 10k for sword i know they'll go down but whats the point of playing when ya can camp?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience with camp... <br />
<br />
4 days 3-4 hours per day. King popped twice, Seer once.  Its a 20 minute spawn on the dot.  Camp it if you have friends , its good easy exp.  Buy it if you dont like to camp and dont want fun dungeon exp.  King is on the right of the furnace, Seer is second to the last on above on ledge.  We sat at Seer camp and pulled King room and top area and sides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were attacking the last king last time and we had one warrior with hammer, one warrior with hammer, one ranger with hammer and one bard with hammer in the group I was in. Everyone put on their hammers to pummel him<br />
<br />
The next one went to the enchanter hehe. We had 5 going at once against the seer when the other warrior actually got his sword of the bloodsworn.</div></div><hr />
