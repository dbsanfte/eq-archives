GM's are never in-game anymore, at leist not very often on my server. I can understand Sony downsizing to control costs yadda, yadda, yadda but when theres an issue that needs to be addressed in-game they need to have GM's on regularly. Afterall GM's are payed.<br />
<br />
I guess the virtual world should'nt be any different from the real world......&quot;X&quot; company needs to save &quot;Y&quot; ammount of dollars, so &quot;X&quot; company cuts from the bottom as usual. I mean how dare they even consider cutting a top exec's bonus of 1.whatever million and letting the poor little bastard on the bottom have a job that pays maybe 10 bucks an hour....FUCKTARDS i tell ya!<br />

It makes me gleem with joy everytime the feds drag one of them sorry mofo's to prison. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the problem is that GM's are busy doing petty BS like running zone to zone changing surnames. I have a problem with GM's being ineffective though. Just last night I have a perfect example. Our rival guild was making an attempt at MM, we didn't rush them, we never bothered them at all, didn't even zone into HoHb &lt;unlike there guild leader who zoned in and stayed for the entire fight when we did him last time just so he could watch how it's done&gt; So anyway they clear the triggers &lt;thanks for that guys, made it easier for us again&gt; pull MM and promptly wipe. We give em about 10 minutes to decide what there going to do, an officer sends there officer a tell, and they say there not going after em again, so we move in behind the fountain. 10 minutes later while were buffing the guild leader of the rival guild shouts Train to fountain inc shortly.  We /ooc haha funny, he responds i'm serious were CR'ing and will be training fountain.  So we decide to be the better guild /ooc we'll clear the GY for you so you can CR, so we pull about 6 mobs and kill em. We pull about 2 more and all of a sudden we see rival guild leader running at us with about 6 mobs from th GY area, luckily CC was on the ball and we survived with minimal deaths. The funny thing is that the other guild didn't know that there was a GM in the zone the entire time and he witnessed the entire event. What did he do? Practically nothing, he gave the guild leader a warning and /ooc'd you guys need to work things out. Now this GM is a really cool guy, but sony needs to start hiring some GM's with some balls. These are the police officers of EQ and they need to start handling there buisness.<br />
<br />
Sorry to bring a rant of a personal nature to this thread, but since we were talking GM's I though this would be a great example, and good way to rant at the same time  :cool:</div></div><hr />

They're supposed to be there to help out when the game screws up.  Personally, I don't think they should ever get invovled in cases of KS-ing, Ninja looting, trainning, etc.  Just be there to help out players when they're bodies are under the world, gear is lost through a glitch, etc.  Let the players deal with other players.  Someone ninja-looted you?  Train their ass.<br />

That said, I haven't seen a GM online for anything other than a couple lame Arena events in the past 3 months.</div></div><hr />

We let a couple of another guilds members come along so they could get their flag.  Well all goes well, dragon dead...loot bid on.  GL has dragon corpse covered so noone could come in and ninja.  Loot is awarded and had to be the damn second the GL stood up to let the person awarded the haste neck item, some crap shit gnome war (or was it halfling?) from the other guild ninjaed it.  He had disbanded from the raid, grabbed the item, and gated out via potion.  One of our guild officers caught up with him in POK about 10 min later and after much discussion, got him to admit that he took it.  Actually, his &quot;brother&quot;  had gotten on while he had a bio break, looted the item, and jetted.  All was recorded and sent in to GM.  Weve probably had half the guild sending petitions.  No Word yet from a GM.  The guild that he was in didnt even guild remove him, deciding to take the famous story of an evil sibling taking control of the character.  Man what a load<br />

<br />
I'm probably going to get blasted for this, so I'm putting on my flame proof long johns right at the start.  But if what Superchum says is true, and I have no reason to believe it isn't, then that causes me to stop and ponder.<br />
<br />
Being a GM in a game like EQ isn't really something where all your decisions are going to be clear cut.  Sometimes GMs have to exercise discretion and make decisions based on concepts such as fair play and reasonable compromise.  Sometimes those decisions are going to have to be imposed upon the players, over their objections.  With this in mind it seems to me that having Indian GMs potentially causes some problems.<br />
<br />
I'm not overly familiar with Indian culture, but I know for sure that it's significantly different from U.S. culture.  Or even the various European cultures for that matter.  What to an Indian GM might seem the height of fair play and resonableness, might to players from the U.S. and Europe seem like high handedness and shear arrogance or it might not make any sense at all.<br />
<br />
I mean, it seems like when interacting with customers it's probably best to have representatives who are more likely to be able to communicate with the customers on a level that both the customer and the representative understand due to some commonality in background.  Lots of assumptions are made when people are communicating and if both parties have different foundation assumptions, it makes communication that much harder.  And lets face it, not every customer who needs the assistance of a GM is going to be capable of intelligently spanning the cultural gap with an Indian GM.  For example, the U.S. has been trying to broker peace in the middle east for decades, and obviously there are some cultural differences interferring with making that successful.      <br />
<br />
Heck, I have a hard time just getting Indian telemarketers to understand that no, I really don't want their life insurance, mortgage refinance, double pane windows, or what have you.  How would I be able to explain to them some of the more complicated intraguild rivalries and why situation A should be decided in this manner rather than in that manner?<br />
<br />
Of course, this assumes that there are even GMs around to be communicated with to begin with, which might make the whole matter moot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd have a lot more faith in Sony's customer service if GMs and above weren't allowed to delete petitions they don't feel like answering (this was a rumor at Fan Faire, that I've assumed true based on my experience). If they aren't allowed to do that already, then enforce it. I've had 2 issues that required GM/GM-Admin support in the past 6 months and the queue &quot;mysteriously&quot; and very randomly deleted my petition on Sony's end about 10 times. Sometimes my petition would only stay in queue for 6 hours, sometimes 25+ days, without any actual resolution to either of my issues. Emails to eqmail@sony.soe.com are similarly ignored, except for the auto-respond email saying &quot;Oh we know you have a problem, but go to hell - it's Fan Faire time, bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
If devs still read this board and want proof, my petition and the associated /report were sent between 6 and 8pm PST, March 26'04, and was escalated to a &quot;Senior GM&quot; about 5 hours later by GM Vemonil, only to be deleted a few days later. The auto-respond email, which I replied to like it said, and got no answer, was marked &quot;KMM8700192I7L0KM&quot;.<br />
<br />
If GMs can actually resolve my issue and prove me wrong, I'll edit this post and have a success story to replace it with. Seriously, if Sony really wants to rebuild their reputation with their players - which might be a good idea since their rep is a big reason so many are planning on leaving for WoW - and not seem like some abusive drug lord that keeps thousands of people hooked while treating them like shit, little things like that is a good way to start.<br />
<br />
Even so, I shouldn't have been so frustrated with customer service that I had to resort to pandering on a fucking message board just to get any kind of response in the first place. Get to work.</div></div><hr />

HAHHAAHHAHA! Thank GOD it's not just me! I had a hell of a time trying to explain to my credit card company the other day that no I didn't want their special credit report service. The telemarketer was definitely indian or from that general area judging by the accent. And she mangled my name severely. Which cracked me up, because she pronounced it the same way people did in china when I lived in Hong Kong. It totally tipped me off to where the person was calling from.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I remember getting convinced by a telemarketer to send me some information on their credit card payment insurance.  I swear I only agreed to receive some information, but I was promptly signed up for it at about $50 a month.  So I call to cancel and they sell me on unemployment only insurance for only $10 a month, which is ok because I'm not feeling too secure about my job.<br />
<br />
Well I lose my job and can't pay my credit card, so I apply for the insurance.  They screw me around for two months saying they need more info and such.  Well finally they send me a denial letter because my account wasn't current.  WTF?  Well the reason I applied for unemployment insurance on my credit card was because if I ever became unemployed I wouldn't be able to pay my credit card bills, I'd have to focus on paying the rent.  So of course I let my credit card payment slide because I had this insurance, but it doesn't cover me because I'm not current.  Don't ever every buy that shit.<br />
<br />
As for EQ CS, yes it has always been non-existant.  It just seems like the wait has gone from typically a few hours to many many hours if you get CS at all.  Last time I waited four hours gave up, came back on, waited six, then had my girlfriend go bitch in the chat room.  After that a ton of GM's showed up on the server and I got prompt help.  If I'd just waited on my petition I never would have gotten help.  And this was an issue where I couldn't even sign on my primary toon, he had to be moved out of the zone he was in by a GM.<br />
<br />
The other day I got stuck in a tree, could not get out.  Good thing I had a gate potion.  Although I didn't logoff and back on... that might have helped.  But I just knew if I tried to get a GM I'd be waiting all night long if I ever even got help.</div></div><hr />

Well I was thinking maybe I should just wait till it zones or something? Well when it zones I'm in TD but I'm still on the damn boat. So I'm thinking well I'm a wood elf and in TD there are evil races, maybe the guards or something will see the boat docking and see me, and come kill me. But no they can't see me, so  I waited a little whil thinking it has to go back to OT some time, and  in the evil fort (thats where i got suck on the boat in the first place) there are of course evil races. So I was thinking yet again that maybe some of the skele guards would see me and come kill me. But they couldn't see me, or couldn't gome get me. So  I decided to petition. I dunno how to check what number my petition is in so I don't know if it got deleted or if its still pending. I got onto my main (the war) because on another server I got stuck in a building,  and logged onto another character (after petitioning) and a GM came on about half a day later and asked on my other character if my stuck char still needs help. So I'm guess they can check if that character that petitioned is on another char on that same account that they petitioned with.<br />

Well a GM of some sort (wasn't on the list of GM's) came on and  aided me, pretty nice too!</div></div><hr />

Starting March 28, I've been on line with an off box reading chat log files from work, and repetitioning every time that I've lost link in that time.  (Note it's coming up onto 3 weeks.)  I've seen 3 E-Mails to my GM about it referring to the trouble ticket number given in the first E-Mail to no response.  My character has aged 18 days of online time with one guide getting back to me at one time saying it will be posted as a hot issue on an internal board.  <br />

Excited, I ran upstairs to turn it in....And I got those fucking gauntlets.  I had no sooner typed &quot;waht teh fukc?&quot; then servers came down with no warning, and I lost it all. <br />
<br />
In the three to four weeks it took for a real GM to get back to me, I had talked to three guides of various rank who were mystified that my petition had poofed again. <br />
So petitioning every day, emailing the server gm every couple days got me jack shit. <br />
<br />
When GM Existan finally got around to telling me no sir, you get nothing I came unglued. Because, you see, they do not keep logs for activities such as the casino. Nothing was logged, nothing to /report and they wouldn`t accept a SS that proved I had won. <br />
<br />
I did learn a few things though from this:<br />
<br />
1 Camp your ass out and come back just as soon as you win something, especially  at the casino.<br />
<br />
2 There is on average one GM per three servers. Same GM that covers Brell also has Bertox and Bristlbane I think. <br />
<br />
3 This gm did not speak english well at all, so imma guess he is either an immigrant of some sorts or living outside the US.  ( even though the name on the email he sent was something very american, like bob smith)</div></div><hr />

one of the most overused lamest excuses ever.  i certainly hope few people are actually believing it. i mean .. imagine for the sake of argument that i am the worlds greatest a__. would i ninja loot something like that for the sake of my brother's toon? of course not. i get nothing out of it. besides whatever the toon does its owner is responsible for. just like what the dog does his master is accountable for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I completely agree that the excuse is lame and not believable, I can certainly see a circumstance where a malicious brother might ninja loot something just because he knew it would get his sibling in trouble and maybe even banned.   Brothers can be that nasty to each other at times after all.  Well, maybe not all brothers, but some.  All the same, not an acceptable excuse.</div></div><hr />

Making customers happy doesn't require a shitload of work.  Basic service and gms that can actually take care of business would suddenly make everyone a lot happier.  Of course, I haven't expected any real support since they came out with legends.  That proved to me that they didn't plan on actually providing support to the suckers who can't / won't pay a bunch extra for something you should fucking get in the first place.</div></div><hr />

I was there for several months and they still have multi-hour waits for petitions to get answered and the GM's still won't do jack.  Although admittedly it is better...  it's more like 25% better for 300% additional cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think selecting a surname should be something that sticks with you.  It shouldn't be something you can change every 2 minutes.  But...  I think either implementing a quest to remove your surname or putting a time limit (like a month) between changing surnames would be a good idea.</div></div><hr />

I petition every day and it's just deleted.  Fucking BS if you ask me.<br />

You might as well call ninja-looting legal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Woot got accepted into the guide program... 30th lvl warrior at the time, could not wait to help people out..  <br />
3 weeks later 50th lvl guide ready to kick ass<br />
Bam bam bam knocking out petitions at record speed.<br />
Need help with the new ui? (velious change) no problem<br />
corpse poofed and you have no gear.. ill send it up... less than 1 hour later resolved<br />
name change.. ok... done<br />
harrassment? loved thols ones.. laying the smackdown on some tool.<br />
<br />
life was good for about 6 months.. 20 hours or more a week as a guide. Actually dualboxed guiding and playin my warrior. Got to play a monster for the first time, and then a pally durring the de/freeport rush<br />
<br />
and then all hell broke loose.<br />
<br />
1 gm per server, ours was wed-sunday 9am pst - 5pm pst<br />
all of a sudden.. what? no more 1 gm per server? this can't be good. <br />
roving band of gms going server to server (read cut the gm staff in 1/2) &quot;knocking&quot; out the petitions (or so they claimed)<br />
<br />
fast foward 1 montha after that.<br />
<br />
petitions would go weeks without a gm taking a look at them. Basicly it was the guides running the server. But if you needed a quest item back.. please petition and then petition again in 12 hours is you have not heard from a gm.<br />
<br />
I quit at the point where i would talk to the same helpless fool everyday at 6pm est for 2 weeks. Why would I talk to him everyday? for 2 weeks he was trying to get his gear back from a server crash. corpse poofed and he logged on naked with no corpse.<br />
<br />
2 weeks, this guy never got a gm to help him. he was not allone, quests buggy? too bad, epic quest item poofed? too bad.<br />
<br />
and since then it has only gone from bad to worse.<br />
<br />
they breifly had a gm per server, but that ended very quickly as they moved most of the gm's they had to SWG seeing as that game is a shitpile and they need more gm's there (/mourn broma)<br />
<br />
the solution... /cheer roving gm's from another country that never played eq. <br />
remeber what soe said? now we can give you 24/7 support in game... im not shitting you.. thats what they said about outsourcing american jobs.<br />
<br />
as this thread shows.. there is no 24/7 support in game.<br />
<br />
and now im earing that ingame petitions are going bye bye. all of them are email only.<br />
no more guides as there is no more petitions (maybe they will allow the quest troop to come back but thats like hoping you will win the lottory)<br />
<br />
basicly soe thinks they can shit on eq players and they will ask for 2nds.<br />
<br />
well I for one was not one they could do that to, 3 accounts cancelled and in the wow beta and loving it. <br />
<br />
sorry for the rant but in my best carman impression &quot;I hate you SOE...&quot;<br />
<br />
oh and why do i read thesteelwarrior if i do not play anymore... I want to see what happens when knights get defensive ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that I supported Clinton or NAFTA, but you do realize that NAFTA stands for North American Free Trade Act and basically opened the borders for trade between Canada and Mexico right? I mean, I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it didn't have anything to do with India.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But a week ago our server crashed while i was in middle of looting my corpse....no biggie shit happens...server comes back up i log in to find my self un rezzed a bind point....send tell to cleric to rez me, go to loot my corpse to find 90% of my items missing.<br />
<br />
I petitioned, no reply for 2 days. Finally i get a reply saying they bumped it up and a GM will be in touch asap.<br />
<br />
2 more days pass and no word from anyone. So i bring up another box and join a chat room just to see if they could give me advice on how to get in touch with a GM (since SoE removed the &quot;contact your GM&quot; off there website). They all just ignored me...but some guy told me i should file a report with the BBB.<br />
<br />
Filed a report with the BBB that nite and 2 days pass, i recive a phone call from someone from sony explaining to me they are sorry for what happened and that everything should be back. Sure nuff it all was =)<br />
<br />
Sucks that I had to do what I did just to get my problem fixed =(</div></div><hr />

What I'm wodering though is if there is some kind of internet harrassement law or such. Maybe even some thing to get Sony themselves sued because they choose to remain idol when harrassement is happening. I've seen a GM log in, zone in, witness a huge friggen train then log out.<br />
I bet someone can say they are going to blow their head off in 7 days in a channel of 100 or so people and even if they all /petitioned (and they prolly wont) there will be no effort to trace this person.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I logged in a while back, and had a green name above my head, and /who all me showed that I was in fact GM Xarilok, lol...<br />
<br />
Went to Ssra to fuck around, was KoS to all the snakes as normal, but I could walk right up to them, sit down, hail them, etc, and no aggro.<br />
<br />
Hell, I could run up, smack one, run it past everything else in the zone, and nada, not a single add, lol.<br />
<br />
So, sure, you could run a bunch of them past the GM/Guide, and they would get to see your handywork, but it would not get them killed.</div></div><hr />
