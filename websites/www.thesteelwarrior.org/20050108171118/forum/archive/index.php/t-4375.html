<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was originally /Feedback'ed to Verant pre-velius in the hope of it being in Scars of Velius expansion.<br />
And that was 2 years ago it was released.<br />
I have updated it slightly, but it's basically the same.<br />
I'm a bit stumped that the suggestions could still be considered useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the changes needed for warrior should be rather fundamental and something they start out with.<br />
I have 3 moderate suggestions on improvements to warriors to make them more interesting to play with.<br />
<br />
First - Anger Skill :<br />
<br />
... A skill akin to Taunt, but instead it adds a fixed amount of hate, based off of Taunt skill.<br />
... A good amount would be 3 times the Taunt skill, for a total of 3 x 230 = 690 hate.<br />
... Warrior only skill. (knights can already do it with spells)<br />
... Cannot fail or resist, range 50 or so.<br />
... 30 second refresh. (approx the same time as between regular procs. except we can control this one)<br />
...<br />
... The refresh time on Anger will help keeping this from being overpowered, but will help with initial aggro.<br />
... Also, since it's locked to the Taunt skill, which is level dependant, it will scale nicely as you level up.<br />
...<br />
... Available at Character creation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second - Taunt Refresh :<br />
<br />
... For every 50 skillpoints in Taunt skill, 5% of Taunt refresh time gets shaved off.<br />
... (Note: Anger skill would be unchanged)<br />
... So you get :<br />
...<br />
... Skill 0 ----- 100% refresh time<br />
... Skill 50 ---- 95% refresh time<br />
... Skill 100 --- 90% refresh time<br />
... Skill 150 --- 85% refresh time<br />
... Skill 200 --- 80% refresh time<br />
... Skill 230 --- 75% refresh time<br />
...<br />
... While skill 230 isn't strictly 50 points more than skill 200, it's our max cap, and it seems prober.<br />
... Also, since it's locked to the Taunt skill, which is level dependant, it will scale nicely as you level up.<br />
...<br />
... Available at character creation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Third - Basic Combat Stances :<br />
<br />
... I would like to see 3 basic combat stances added, Aggresive, Neutral and Defensive.<br />
... This would be 3 buttons, where only one could be &quot;active&quot; at any given time.<br />
... If another is choosen, the previous will not be used.<br />
... Like a radio decks toggle buttons.<br />
<br />
Aggresive Stance<br />
-This would increase all damage given by 10%, but also increase all damage taken by 10%<br />
-You deal more out, but also take more.<br />
<br />
Neutral Stance<br />
-This Stance would give no positive or adverse effects and you would be  just like we are now.<br />
-Can use Disciplines in this stance.<br />
<br />
Defensive Stance<br />
-This stance would decrease all damage given by 10%, but also decrease all damage taken by 10%<br />
-You deal less, but also take less.<br />
<br />
... The Stances should be toggable while moving and in combat, though I think there should be a 5 second delay a Stance shift.<br />
... This would be much like Spellcasters have a Cool Down time on spells before they can cast another.<br />
... If you are ready for a stance Change, the change itself should however be instant though.<br />
...<br />
... In order to avoid overpowering Disciplines, the only stance to allow Disciplines should be the Neutral Stance.<br />
... Stances would automatically scale with equipment, offensive/defensive skills and the environment (how hard MOBs hit).<br />
...<br />
... Available at character creation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, the reason have Taunt and Anger Seperate is because they are used differently.<br />
Anger would be a preventive aggro method.<br />
Taunt only works after things have already gone bad and someone else have aggro.<br />
This is also the reasoning behind decreasing the Taunt skill, to help save someone if Taunt fails first time around.<br />
<br />
Thoghts and comments on my suggestions are highly encouraged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the ideas!  I have been noticing some strange stuff going on with my WAR since reaching about level 48.  These ideas would be a big help.<br />
<br />
1)  My Damage seems to have been reduced.  Im not hitting as often as I used to and for less dam when I do.  Same mobs, same dungeons, same weapons...  Only difference is higher level.  Strange...<br />
<br />
2)  I was grouping an LDoN with a Ranger.  I was declared MA and there was a Bard pulling.  Nearly every mob would lock onto me at first, but then would switch to the Ranger.  I was a bit confused, but at some point the Ranger made the comment that he was taunting.  My Taunt is 200, he stated his was &quot;about 9 or so&quot;.  This was just out and out wierd to me...  How could someone with a skill of 9 pull mobs off of me with a skill of 200?  Im still somewhat new and probably dont know what I am talking about, but  Geez...  I have spent hours and hours of my VERY valuable game time working my WAR up to where he is now just to be outtanked by a FREAKING RANGER?  Comon people, this is just NOT RIGHT!<br />

WoW is going with that for Warriors and probably SOE will be also.<br />
<br />
Any taunt/aggro increases for us will further trivialize the game.</div></div><hr />
