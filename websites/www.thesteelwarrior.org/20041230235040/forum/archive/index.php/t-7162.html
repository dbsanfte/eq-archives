<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are coming up to the end of the month only 2 weeks left basically we are half way trough the free month trail.   I am wondering how many of you that are playing COH now will continue after the free trail ends.  How many will be casual and use it as a break from EQ or how many of you will play it as a primary game.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me I will be playing COH full time I canceled my EQ account last week and I don't plan on going back.</div></div><hr />

Although my Tanker is lvl 19 and I can't solo my missions anymore like I always do so I am forced to group but to lazy to look for a team :p.  Started a Defender and I am loving him so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 18 I'm still soloing my missions, what changes at 19 to change that?</div></div><hr />

Other one is burn 10 bodies from Vahziloks I could do that one mega easy but I don't want to skip Dr. Vahzilok him being an Archvillian and all.  After those I have to be lvl 20 to get any more missions also I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">05-15-2004, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ill still play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did the ghost CoT's today, and the last mob got stuck in the geometry. So I have to do it all over again. That used to tick me off, but this time I was cool with it. Since missions do dry up till 20, having to redo this one just means more XP's for me solo.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
I've all but given up on EQ. The new expansion looks boring. The current expansion is beyond boring. I think I'm done.<br />
<br />
I'll still be playing CoH though. Fun game. And I really am into the superhero thing a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll most likely be playing CoH up until late september for sure; once my wife gives birth i think gaming is near done for quite a while.<br />
<br />
it was funny; sat AM CoH went down and i figured 'hell, lemme see what EQ looks like'...after 5 minutes logged on i finally deleted it off my HD. good riddance :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">05-16-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hoho congrats shik!<br />
<br />
btw, coh sucks, come play eq =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't been into EQ in a whiel I can see coming back to it, now and again. Maybe. <br />
<br />
Definatly paying for at least one more month of CoH. 2 of my close freinds jumped in at the same time, so we have a small (lol the 3 of us) super group in Virtue. <br />
<br />
And I have fallen from warrior grace...my main in CoT is Hot Pepper, 20th Fire/fire blaster. Though I do have Kailyn wondering around as a 9th BS/invul Scrapper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">too much eye_cutting in EQ dima. and i only got one good eye left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love combat.<br />
<br />
After playing CoH combat I went back to EQ to try it again.....that was when I cancelled my EQ accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">funny; CoH went down early Saturday morning for some maintenance; so i figured i'd go log into EQ to see if my account was dead yet. it wasn't; and i logged in for a few. game looks like ass; smells like ass; plays like ass...made room on my HD for some more music with the freed up space EQ took up.<br />
<br />
Now if only CoH had an in-game music player like EQ had...that'd be fun :D</div></div><hr />
