<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cattypult</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty new to the warrior game and was wondering how I was doing on equipment and wanted to get some suggestions on the direction to go from here.<br />
<br />
Magelo is &lt;-- of course.<br />
<br />
I have soloed to this point and am mostly geared for that.  The regen gear is starting to run out it's usefulness.  I expect I can solo for about 10 more levels without too much difficulty if I need to but not much more without some changes.<br />
<br />
I'm considering an Architect's Bejewelled Chestplate once the recommended level makes it more attractive but for now I still like the regen more than the stats I would get from that one.  Magnetic might be possible if I get a lucky drop or two but they are still a little expensive.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to look for some better agro weapons but can't really afford anything great so any suggestions there would be very helpful too. <br />
<br />
I have a 58 shaman main who I can farm with.  He's unguilded and also soloed most of the way so raid stuff isn't going to happen either.<br />
<br />
Thanks, in advance, for any suggestions or help you can give me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-02-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look into Architects Bejewled Bp (sp?). on Tribunal its 2k or less, and would be a huge hp/ac upgrade for you.  As for longer term upgrades, of if you have the cash to spend, i'd buy a Magnetic Breastplate/Legs. they go for about 20k or a little under each.<br />
<br />
I believe they are 51+ but Mosquito leg earrings usually run from 3-5k, id replace the brazen earring with one right away.<br />
<br />
Pick up the droga combo, sword of the bloodsworn and copper hammer of striking. look them up, they are very easy to farm in droga (i 2 box druid and war to farm droga) and otherwise cheap in bazaar. Those will have way more hp/agro than your current combo.<br />
<br />
As for rings, a couple velium fire rings is what i used until 60+, i used valorium rings after that until i snagged a couple steel rings for 20k (super deal). All of those are tradeskilled and should be common baz fodder.<br />
<br />
For the belt, Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide is a good option until you can get a Heavy Rubicite Girdle. Those tend to be expensive on my server though (30k wtf) but the putrid belt is maybe 5k tops.<br />
<br />
I cant think of a better helm atm, I wore a skull until i got my Kromzek Crown heh. On option might be ornate if you have the cash, otherwise id just search baz periodically for hp items in your other hard to fill spots. never know what ya might find.<br />
<br />
For gloves, i believe Silver Steel Gauntlets still drop in kael arena, i cant remember who drops them but i believe they are 16ac/80hp. <br />
<br />
For the back, go with a Conqurers Cape, these are as low as 1.5k on Tribunal atm, 105hp+sta+resists, its a damn nice, cheap back item.<br />
<br />
For the bracers, id honestly go with something with more AC than magnetic, but they will do fine until your high enough to work on armsmaster armor. usually they are 5-7k.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're doing okay on gear, though the BP's light on Ac, which you already know. AB breastplate will be a good option.<br />
About the time you hit lvl 50 (perhaps even before) you'll be sort of transitioning into the phase of the game where proc hate is a bigger and bigger factor in your ability to hold aggro. Hence the Sword of the Bloodsworn and Copper Hammer of Striking suggestions. <br />
I'd also start saving for better haste, because even after you get proc weapons, your dex and lack of AAs/weapon affinity will make the &quot;potential damage&quot; part of your aggro generation relatively important for several levels. The haste you have now is okay, but you'll be happier with 31% or better in about 10 levels. Until you can afford tribute haste, commonly available haste items include the soulscream belt, runed bolster belt, cloak of flames (listed in order from least to most cost).<br />
I'd also be aware that at least for now, most hate augments come from doing tons of LDoNs, so that might be in your future.<br />
Also, one thing you can do to sort of get an idea of what gear folks are wearing is to go to eqrankings.com and poke around looking at Magelos of folks at and just above your level (in your case, paying special attention to lizards).<br />
You have an interesting array of utility weapons. You might also check utility items listed in more advanced warriors' bags for ideas on resist gear, etc. No big hurry on that stuff, but it doesn't hurt to be aware of it. I see you have components for baking spider legs, heh. Check the bazaar for Halas meat pies and Grobb liquidised meat for cheap stat bumps.<br />
If your shaman has been supplying the SoW potions, see if he'll make you some Kiva's blistering (er whatever--flesh?) potions too. Kinda handy if you solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dirge</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take a look in the bazaar for the Issued Scout's Helm.  Should be a solid upgrade and can be fairly cheap (1k).  Stats are AC +22, Dex +8, Sta +8, Wis +4, Int +4, HP +25, Mana +20, Endur +20, Fire +8, Magic +9; recommended level 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">varill</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">screw over food completely lol ... carry around some water with some stats if you want but look for a stone of defiance once u hit about 48 .... when your hungry ( it goes in charm slot .... usually sells for like 1k or so btw) it should give about 7 to str sta agi dex wis and int ,,, plus around 50 hp ad 50 end ... with plus 10 to disease magic and pouison ..... at 55 its 10 to all stats and 75 hp ... at 60 its 15 to all stats and i think about 100 hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cattypult</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions.  Those were pretty much the same ideas I had.<br />
<br />
A lot of the gear I want is really hurt by recommended levels so I have been putting off a few upgrades till they make more sense considering that.  The Architect's Breastplate still only gives 38 AC so the regen still outweighs it a little but it's getting close to where that will change.  Once I start getting to things that can kill me in under a minute, regen or no, I will switch for sure.<br />
<br />
I have looked at the Conquerer's Cape and I do plan to get one but for now the stats aren't any better than the Officer's Cloak so it's not on my immediate agenda.<br />
<br />
The Issued Scout's Helm is nice but they go 2k on my server and I can get Magnetic Helm for 4-5k that gives me much better stats so I plan on waiting for that.<br />
<br />
The reason I haven't upgraded the belt is I plan on getting the Soulscream belt for the improved haste.  Didn't want to spend money there until I can afford it.  I like the Putrid Belt if another 30%+ haste item comes my way though.<br />
<br />
I have a Mask of Obtenebration I'm trying to sell now.  If I can ever get rid of it in the current market I will use the money for a Sword of the Bloodsworn and maybe a Copper Hammer of Striking If I can find a good deal.  Otherwise I'll wait on that one until it will proc for me.<br />
<br />
As far as the food goes I use the spider legs for a specific reason.  I have the Stone of Defiance and even though it lists as recomended level 60 it has given full stats ever since i got it.  If I get hurt I just make a batch of spider legs and sit down so that I get natural regen going without losing the stats from the Stone.  Without food I don't get full natural regen and if I have something I can eat all the time I lose the stats on the stone.  As a Vah Shir I go through the munchies pretty fast so the 8 yield on the spider legs doesn't last very long and I can destroy any leftovers once I am healed.<br />
<br />
For now I can't get a better charm and the Stone more than outweighs any benefit I could get from stat foods I can get plus a lesser charm.  I expect the Stone to be nerfed soon though.  I can't imagine SOE wants a 75HP item available to a level 1.  I just hope I get past whatever they nerf it to before it happens.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for the responses.  It did confirm a lot of what I had guessed.  I really do need to get out my shaman and tear up something for cash.  I'm almost broke again  :(   <br />
<br />
I'm just having so much more fun with my warrior.</div></div><hr />
