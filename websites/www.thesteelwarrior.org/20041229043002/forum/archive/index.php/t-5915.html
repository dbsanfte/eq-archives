<br />
For those that have sinister strikes, how are you liking it? I just got weapon affinity 5 last night, and I couldnt be happier with it, and am trying to decide if I want to put the 15 AA's into SS.<br />
<br />
So, opinions? Is it just ok? Worth the 15 points? POS? Any and all comments will be appreciated, or you can just tell me to stfu and find out for myself :D <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

But the few people I know who trained it like it just fine. It does exactly what it advertises it does. So on the one side, there's no hidden surprise that it's way cooler than it seems. On the OTHER hand, it does exactly what it advertises it does, so there's no disappointment.<br />
<br />
If you dual wield a lot (and I do), it's worth the investment. I'm currently 1/3rd of the way there, so will let ya know sometime next month when I finally get it. (I don't XP very fast).</div></div><hr />

The Return of... The Mossy Twig of Doom!<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe not. ;)<br />
<br />
I wonder tho, with sinister strikes, toss on one of the GoD 4 dmg augs I've see linked (right slot??) and it could  be a real *ssripper again, even offhand...<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone know if this adds any agro at all?<br />
<br />
Or if you will notice any agro at all if you practice it?<br />
<br />
I was wondering if it would help initial agro before procs kick in?<br />
<br />
Also the dps, anyone have any idea how much dps it might add avg?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the 4 damage aug is 5 or 6 type and requires &gt;40 delay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sinister Strike damage bonus is scaled to the delay of the weapon, at least that's what SoE said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
6 damage<br />
<br />
10 delay.<br />
<br />
This is your twig ... this is your twig on drugs.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
In any event ... the unrestricted DMG aug, I heard was 4 damage, but type 8, so could only go on some of the Gates weapons and Plane of Time weapons. I've not seen a link of it, just heard about it from friends so am not that sure about it. Either way, it's not going on a twig, and it's not going on the 6/10 monk claws. (Which are soon to be nerfed ... I've heard they were going to have a required level put on them, and maybe have their ratio nerfed ... so don't get too annoyed by these things ... they'll be made useless in the next patch I reckon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">delay div 3.5 = offhand DB<br />
<br />
Expect about 4-5 dps from it if you have ambidexterity and ferocity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With flurry AAs, you might see 5-6. <br />
<br />
Flurry has nothing to do with offhand.  Sinister strikes will give the same increase in damage with or without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">whoever said it above is right, the db to offhand is trunc(delay/3.5).<br />
<br />
Regarding aggro i'd assume it adds none, since it was proved that hit/miss/crit or whatever it was generated the same aggro. but then again, db was a significant part of the aggro on an attack so it might give aggro, though i doubt verat remembered how their aggro functions worked when they created this aa.<br />
<br />
as a rogue tho, i like it a lot =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought agro was determined by how much damage you could have done so a 5/30 weapon will have less agro than a 10/20 weapon.  Whether you hit for max, miss or crit you get the same amount of agro, but the potential damage and number of swings does play a part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a rather stupid warrior when it comes to the math part of the game.<br />
(I come here because you smart guys are all over it)<br />
<br />
What I be looking for in laymens terms is if it makes any significant increase in DPS and/or aggro, or if its a novelty AA that although useful, should be gotten last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;What I be looking for in laymens terms is if it makes any significant increase in DPS &quot;<br />
<br />
It's an offhand damage bonus. So yes, it increases your DPS ... if you dual wield. Much like Ambidexterity increases DPS, when dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Significant or insignificant?<br />
<br />
(Got 15AA's on the line here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korl</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Quarm Hammer offhand and typically post around 1.1 - 1.2 hits per second (hps) on mobs with it.  (This is with full pre-GoD offensive AAs).   Quarm hammer has a 7 damage bonus... meaning sinister strikes gives me roughly 8 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warcry</div><div class="date">02-29-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Said f it and bought it, 15 aa wham.<br />
<br />
Having done so, I have noticed a *slight*, very very slight<br />
increase in agro, dps? who knows.<br />
<br />
Seems just another offensive aa, that stacks with all the others,<br />
alone does nothing, combined with several, usefull.<br />
<br />
Very very high cost, dont bother unless you duel weild, and I mean alot.</div></div><hr />
