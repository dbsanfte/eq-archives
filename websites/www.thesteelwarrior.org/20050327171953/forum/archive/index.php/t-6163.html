Looking to make some nice steady plat without much risk (wouldn't mind some exp either). I pretty much such now, missing 8 pieces of armor, got only 50aas and the no drop gear I got isn't all that (stripped my char about 8 months ago).<br />
<br />
Would rather for stuff I could solo because a lot of my play time is for short periods or I need to be a bit afk during.<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Just kidding. :) <br />
<br />
I'd try going straight for the pieces you need - what exactly are you looking for? Chest? Back? Weapons?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
PoGrowth with a group....lots of gems drop there.<br />
LDoN's aren't bad sometimes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">golemn</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was missing Both earrings, both rings, waist, cloak, mask and neck item.<br />
<br />
I managed to save some plat over the last couple of days (Ok I got a handout form an old friend) and bought a soulscream belt. <br />
<br />
<br />
Groups are great exp, but usually not the best loot. And as I mentioned, I have a lot of play time in which I can't group.. <br />
<br />
so would really like a solo spot.<br />
<br />
I'll try to take a shammy to seb, if I can find one.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">golemn</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh btw, I am flagged up to sol ro.<br />
<br />
don't think it'll help me much, because I don't reckon I can solo in sol ro with my gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're looking to solo for cash, your bet is probably going to be some highly unpopulated greenie zone with plat dropping mobs.  Perhaps City of Mist, Kaesora, or even Kurn's Tower for Kunark level mobs (don't hit hard, have relatively low HP, can pull massive numbers of them without worry)?  I don't know off hand which actual zones/mobs have good plat dropping mobs unfortunately, so I'm making educated guesses rather than certain answers.<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns is another good place I believe; lots of lower level mobs packed together than can get you plat and random vendor loot.  You might also look into some Luclin lowbie zones, like Paludal Caverns perhaps.  A few LoY zones are pretty good for farming cash too, but the mobs there tend to hit a bit harder on average than earlier expansion mobs, so it depends on your setup and weapons and such.<br />
<br />
If you use this method, just remember to take full advantage of your discs (furious and a high damage two hander is really good for large trains when farming greens) and of course the new healing disc is quite handy for soloers now, with a reuse of 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

Mobs there drop blue diamond type gems and I was duoing them with a cleric in my low-mid 40s so I would think a 65 could solo em pretty well.  Might be able to sell the meats for illusion pots in the bazaar as well.<br />
<br />
LDoN groups can be pretty decent plat, usually get around 200pp from the split, not great but you get exp/LDoN points while you do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is at least 200k a week on most any server?  At least, it has been for me each time I needed plat.  Group and random the ornate that no one in the group can use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds really bad but even trashing the HG's in Rathe Mtns can net about 1k an hour. BTW bugs in Seb have been nerfed. They no longer drop anything. Cracks me up that SOE officially does not approve of buying plat (neither do I) but they nerf every old world money camp. Sebilis bugs used to net 2k each to a full group in a short night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bugs may not, but iksar jail still drops a lot of fire opals. Also when I need cash, I run to Unrest, I know it doesnt seem like much, but i can get about 250PP when i clear the entire house, and i clear from the tower to the Ghost pit in about 12 minutes,  by the time i get down, top is respawning. With plat and other drops I make about 1400PP an hour.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want some XP and nice plat but don't think your geared for sol ro, try Sanctus Seru, not the best xp in the world  but pretty gimp mobs, and when you get to third floor of some of those buildings lots of mobs drop 20-40 plat each. Though nobody xp's there so you would pretty much have to convince a group to go there with ya.</div></div><hr />

So they do still drop gems.<br />
<br />
Try sola, you can rip through goblins and they drop plat and fine steel.  You can sell the fine steel to the gnomish merchant in the zone who sells tink bags.  Should be able to net 1k an hour easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zugs Slugs</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good spot I found is Lower Guk. I didn't bother with Crown of Deceit so I just run around killing everything. Gargs drop about 15pp in loot each, spiders drop LOTS of silk that sells 5-15pp in baz, and frogs drop like 4-6pp each. Also if you run into a named, there loot sells for like 50pp to merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarvok</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I farm plat several different ways..<br />
<br />
Soloing:: Sometimes ya just gotta  hehe.....<br />
CC for velium<br />
TM for acrylia<br />
SH in the NE corner for swirling shadows<br />
EK for spider silks<br />
GD/kael for helms and toes plus ok plat drops and velium weapons ( vendor trash )<br />
DSP for rockhopper hides<br />
Natimbi ( bad drop rate but good cash if ya get either of the necks ) Turtles and stonemites can drop them.<br />
<br />
Groups::<br />
LDoN can win drops that add up plus ya get points that you can spend for good gear ( Some hard drops are pretty nice )<br />
OS for the Truncheon of doom<br />
PoN for arachnid silks<br />
<br />
Well just some ideas for farmin when you are bored, hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The high elf guards in Felwithe drop steel weapons that sell for like 20 or 30 plat each (been a while since I did it) and you can solo them easily.  They are paladins so you have to be careful to pull singles since they heal each other but it is doable.  If you have a friend to loot and sell to the vendor by the zone in it is a little easier but if not just kill til you have a full load and run to PoK and sell.</div></div><hr />

Getting lucky and winning rolls on ornate armor can pad your bank account in a hurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rahge</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a slower and a healer and break into Mauverns Hall. The long Hallway that leads to Mauvern has Enforcers  and punishers lining the walls opposite each other in the HAllway to Mauvern. their are Wraiths that spawn at the doorway into the hall 4 of them i believe. These mobs are easy single pulls after killing the wraiths. They drop al types of diamonds and after clearing the Hall 3 or 4 times and doing a split youll get 1.5 to 2k easy!</div></div><hr />
