<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pfft, cant find it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are listed at the top of http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=warriorbalance, under Current Polls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*shrug* didnt vote. Prolly just gonna leave that up to the rest of you all.<br />
<br />
well, didnt quite understand wth the vote was all about, so was actually afraid to push one of them buttons *blush*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You vote on each issue yes or no to remove it from the class issue list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why was the augment thing on the list in the first place? Was allready announced and in testing that it would be added... And it's not a warrior only issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">(little off-topic)<br />
IMO Warriors are fine.  I don't want this game to get any easier.  More HP at any level justs trivializes more content.  Better taunt, well what's the fun in not going into a panic every now and again when the cleric is getting beat on?  Shields, yea would be nice if they aggro'd a bit more, but /shrug I hold aggro fine with mine.  Basically I guess I'm saying that I don't care what the class issues are atm! :D  Ok well maybe I'd like to see a bit higher Darkblade droprate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only thing that I'd really like to see is more stuff available to the lower-level people like myself. Having 60% of the warriors on a server using the exact same weapons, and most of them in the same visible gear, is a tad sad, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I also want a 10% Echo of Anger on some ornate piece  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The poll is to remove items from the list that the devs say we can't have at this time so we can replace them with other suggestions instead of a stagnant list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just surprised people were voting against making disarm useful again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd just like to see a group /shield ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Again? It's never really been useful. Basically the key is that they said they're not going to look at disarm right now. I think it's a higher priority to drop it and check out some other issues that they may work on sooner. Note that shields are in the same classification by the devs, and the trend is to keep it up there. Disarm is simply not as important as most any other issue.</div></div><hr />

Well, it was only ever useful in PvP and thats what the focus would be if they decided to give it a look. I don't PvP, and niether does the majority of EQ players, so I'm actually surprised it made it onto the list to begin with. It should have been on the PvP issues list, not warrior class lists.<br />
<br />
Other issues that were on the warrior list weren't class specific either, making removing them from the class list appropriate.</div></div><hr />

Can't disarm magic weapons, so that's a no use on disarm.</div></div><hr />
