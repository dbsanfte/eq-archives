<br />
Anyhow now that the formalitys are gone heres what id like, if you have any idea to improve the state of LDoN do feedback while they still have their ear to the ground, im sure they want to keep pushing their product by good word of mouth.<br />
<br />
Now one idea i had was i have seen the items you can buy from the wayfarers as far as armor goes, the 750 point ones, now, i have to pay for 64 ac, 150 hp and 75 mana i dont use, my first feedback will be that they need to reduce the cost of the armor for warriors/monks/rogues because we share our armor type with others and it always has plus mana to it we cant benefit from so basicly i feel the non mana classes are paying hand over fist here, eather that or they need to give all none mana users a AA tree to convert that to something usable such as hit points or ac.<br />
<br />
now this isnt exactly a spam campain, i just think that we need to point out what is fucked up while we have the chance, and that you send some feed back, a little orignal each time as we dont wana seem like we are reading from a list, thanks folks and luck be with us this time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had an idea that they could implement something like Recommended levels, except that it works of your class.<br />
<br />
For example, <br />
On a 50ac 100hp/mana 10str/sta/agi/dex/wis/int/cha<br />
<br />
A Warrior would get:<br />
50ac 100hp/mana 10str/sta/agi/dex/wis/int/cha<br />
<br />
A PAL/SHD/RNG would get:<br />
40ac 80hp/mana 8str/sta/agi/dex/wis/int/cha<br />
<br />
A CLR/BRD/ROG would get<br />
<br />
30ac 60hp/mana 6str/sta/agi/dex/int/wis/cha<br />
<br />
-OR-<br />
<br />
PAL/SHD/RNG get 80% of AC, HP, STR, STA, AGI, DEX and 100% Mana, WIS, INT, CHA<br />
<br />
BRD/ROD get 60% of AC, HP, Mana and 100% STR, STA, AGI, DEX, CHA<br />
<br />
CLR get 40% AC, HP, STR, STA, AGI, DEX and 100% Mana, WIS, INT, CHA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully I will remember to feedback this soon. They really do need to have separate armor for pure melee, hybrids, and casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oron</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I truely doubt that they will change what is in there currently.  I think the idea of having it cost less for warriors would be much easier for them to change than adding/taking away sets of armor.  I like the idea of the sets costing less for warriors, and it would be an easy fix (at least it should be).  Plus it may make the palys mad!  Go us!<br />
<br />
Ill send a feedback tonight!</div></div><hr />
