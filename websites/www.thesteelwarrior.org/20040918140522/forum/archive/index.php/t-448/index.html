<br />
So just cause im a newer race automatically means im a twink.<br />
<br />
Just cause someone makes a new toon (yes, smakz wasnt my first toon, but that doesnt mean i twink) doesnt mean they twink, some of us like to play the game to play it, not to be the very best at everything.<br />
<br />
All my gear i have had, i bought, or camped myself.  All the cash i made, i aquired myself.<br />

Stop, let me get a couple taunts in, or proc EB... be comforted in the fact that there IS a cleric in the group, and they will heal you if need be. <br />
<br />
2. Rangers that deceide that they don't have to watch their agro, and then do the same kiting manuvers the above enc/shammy.<br />

3. Clerics that think they should be meleeing too...<br />

5. Humping crappy pick up groups for AA's in PoV.<br />
<br />
6. Overly amazed lower level players that think the fact that the cleric can crit heal for 25+k is just amazing! I only have 7k hp.... what differance does it make to me if she's hitting me for that much.... I mean really?!<br />

9. The cut and paste job the dev team did on the VT lay out. Also the lack of variety on the mob models there. There should Be some models there that you can see no where else in EQ except Aten Ha Ra... I mean really. <br />
<br />
10. Unmezable, unslowable mobs that hit in the 800's.<br />

<br />
17. Necros.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think the thing I hate the most is that SOE is trying their best to make people quit eq.  Lets tak a look at what they have done to facilitate this.  <br />
<br />
Make an expansion with only one real raidable zone and very limited content.<br />
<br />
Make an expansion that will seperate people of the same levels so they can't exp togather on off raid times.<br />
<br />
Implement overly powerful tradeskill items so that people will do combines and solo greens insted of interacting and having fun.<br />
<br />
Put content in that is overly hard that puts roadblocks up for 2 or 3 months. thax for poe /rude<br />
<br />
Sell an expansion that nobody wants except for the bank slots. WTF<br />
<br />
Make charm camps 120 hours long so that you have to further isolate yourself from friends to get one.<br />
<br />
Well I could go on all day about the things they have done to drive my in game friends away.  Maybe its time they added some free lvl 65 zones and said ya this is payback.<br />

<br />
1.  People who don't understand that I can pull.  Yes, seriously, it's called Pacification and it's better than a two-monk FD team in some places.<br />
<br />
2.  Brain-dead melees who don't think I should be allowed to melee.  Also, while I'm at it, people with Hammer Envy.  Yes, I bought Fury of Magic specifically to spam you with more proc spam; cry me a river.<br />
<br />
3.  Level 63- tanks with Baron title and a windblade who complain about not being able to tank or hold aggro.  Get the hell back to PoV and come back when you're bigger.  Yes the exp isn't as good there, call the waaaahmbulance.<br />
<br />
4.  Enchanters who tash and slow good and early from well outside melee range, way to go pingpong.<br />
<br />
5.  Anyone who wants to tank in my pickup group but is still wearing Kunark class armor.  Have you no pride or decency sir?<br />
<br />
6.  Wood elf druids.<br />
<br />
7.  Any newbie tank who tells me how to heal.  Listen, sunshine, the last person I had tanking had 9khp and 254aa, why are you surprised it takes me time to get used to healing your gimp ass?<br />
<br />
8.  Any uber tank who tells me how to heal.  Listen, sunshine, the last person I had tanking had 5khp and 2aa, it takes me a few pulls to adjust, k?<br />
<br />
9.  Any melee who throws a paddy when I don't call my heals, but is totally incapable of using an `inc` hotkey.<br />
<br />
10.  Dorfs who speak.  Dorfs should not speak.</div></div><hr />

2) Paladins who think they should tank on raids and non-stop stun (enjoy your death, dumbass).<br />
3) SKs who think they should be like paladins above.<br />
4) Add Tanks who try get on my target when they should be tanking a FREAKING ADD!<br />
5) People who don't listen to raid instructions.<br />
6) Short races who think I should shrink, esp if I am MTing.<br />
7) The fact that the SOE graphics artists decided that my being a barbarian means I never stand up straight, but am always hunched over like I'm a freaking ughre.</div></div><hr />
