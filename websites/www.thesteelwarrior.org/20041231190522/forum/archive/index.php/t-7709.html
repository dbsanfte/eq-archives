<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bedan</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been mining the Steel Warrior website for tips on how to be a better warrior for some time now.  It has been an invaluable resource. The expertise displayed in this forum is impressive and has exceeded every expectation I had when I first started viewing it. I feel its time I made a contribution. This information is targeted at mid-level warriors interested in knowing what their maximum skill cap is by level for all of their combat skills.  I looked for a post dealing specifically with this topic but I had no luck finding one. My search skills may be rusty. I decided to record the information as I leveled and share it once it was complete. I only started to carefully track skill max's by level at 51st. What the max's are prior to 51st will not be provided here. I believe those figures are available on other sites or could easily be determined with a little thought.<br />
<br />
Friends that I group with regularly could not play as often as I did so in order to maintain level parity I spent a lot of time working AA experience. That's not the recommended path for a warrior I know but it worked for me. Since I took a slower level advancement route I was able max all my combat skills at each level from 51st on. I was able to confirm this at each level by seeking out a warrior trainer and trying to gain additional skill-ups by allocating skill training points. When the trainer gave me the &quot;you are trained to maximum of your current abilities&quot; I knew I had achieved my maximum skill for that level. <br />
<br />
A few notes before I get to the numbers. I will list the skill name and then nine or ten values after each. The first value represents the max skill you can have at 51st level. The second value represents the max skill you can have at 52nd and so on. All skills reach class max at 60th but there are a few that max at 59th and some even earlier. You of course can still increase skills that are not at the class max beyond 60th but if you max your skills at each level like I did you will not be gaining any additional skill-ups after 60th.  Maybe the new expansion will allow higher skill caps. Here's hoping.<br />
 <br />
For me Hand to Hand (100), Disarm (200) and Swim (200) all max'd out at or before level 51. As I stated earlier I did not really start tracking it until then so I'm not certain at what level these three skills can be max'd. Also a few of the bind wound scores below are estimates (183, 187 and 195). It was the only skill that I struggled to max at each level before advancing. Other then those three scores I believe everything else is right on.<br />

<br />
I just want to pipe in and say that 2hs and 2hb both max at 205 at 51.<br />
<br />
If I come across any other differances I'll update this post.  :D</div></div><hr />

I was stuck at 204 forever with those two skills. Normal progression would indicate 205 is correct for both at 51st but it just wasn't happening for me.</div></div><hr />
