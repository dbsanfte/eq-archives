<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oulurok</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are refering to using the sword of runes in the Red Scabard to have the 2 one handers as well as the 2 hander, it doesn't work.  I just got my epic yesterday and I tried this, unless I'm doing something wrong, it no longer works.<br />
<br />
(make 2h, put sword of runes in red scarabard for the 1h's?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still works, You first make the 2hs version of your epic then place one summoned sword of runes in the scabbard and hit combine and you will have both 1hs weapons and the 2hs version at all times. I keep my scabbard in the bank and carry all 3 blades with me. Just did this a week ago so i know it still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Red Scabbard immediately you get after turning in Red/Green Scale, Wingblade, etc. does NOT work with this.<br />
<br />
In order to get the Sword of Runes &quot;trick&quot; to work, you have to get the 2 Blades and 2 Hilts and combine them in the Red Scabbard, this creates a NEW Red Scabbard which the Sword of Runes works in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys couldn't be more confusing. I'm chalking it up to being a hoax. =p No offence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a hoax in the least bit.  Sit back down and re-read it, it's pretty simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically they're saying there's two different versions of the red scabbard.  The first one you get is only used to combine the two hilts and blades to make the epic.  Making the epic the first time gives you the second red scabbard.<br />
<br />
AFTER you make the epic, you can make another set of 1handers by putting the sword of runes into it and combining it.<br />
<br />
Obviously it's not going to work on the first scabbard you get, before you do the final combine.  The epic would be more trivial than the rogue epic.  However the only way to get the second scabbard is to do the final combine, so that's why it works on one but not the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just woke up so bear with me, it basicly says to redo the epic?<br />
<br />
The reason why I mentioned it could be a hoax is because back in the day that would have resulted in a lost epic. Now someone is saying you need to do the epic again minus the red scabbard part, or the whole epic, thats where Baadan's post gets confusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrote that before Kaesorn replyed.  I think I understand now, thanks. Sorry for being so damn slow to comprehend. =)<br />
<br />
<br />
ps. Magelo backs this up by having 2 versions of red scabbard as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it for myself, thanks for the help, sorry I doubted it. <br />
<br />
Combine epic into 2hs, put the 2hs into a bag, put one summoned: sword of runes into the empty red scabbard, combine to get the 2 1hs epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oulurok</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, i just logged out, but I'm logging back into try this right now. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oulurok</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just DID this.  It is not a hoax.  <br />
<br />
The 2 differant 'type's' of scabbard are to determine what can be combined in it, whether it is the 2h or the 2 1hers.  Make the 2her and put ONE sword of runes in the scabbard and hit combine.<br />
<br />
This rocks, I was really missing those lost bag slots.  6 or 7 slots is a big deal.  Thanks all.</div></div><hr />
