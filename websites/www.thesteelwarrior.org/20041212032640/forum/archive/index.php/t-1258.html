<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahhj</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember back when I first started playing EQ, every person I talked with assured me Paladins were 75% warrior, 25% cleric... Shadowknights were 75% warrior, 25% necromancer... and Rangers were 75% warrior, 25% druid. Most websites described it that way.<br />
<br />
There was (and still is) an intrinsic problem with that. In a game that involves grouping, if the 'other half' of your job was being filled by someone, you were basically a sub par version of whatever the over untouched half was. In a group that can prosper when everyone fills their specialized roll, being a 'hybrid' or jack of all trades just isn't rewarding when someone or many people do your job better. <br />
<br />
This isn't so much a problem with the DPS classes. You can't have enough DPS. Luckily the many variations of monsters and DPS makes it so you are benefitted from varying types, even if one class clearly outdamages another (though Burst damage is in season with PoP). You can only have so many tank.<br />
<br />
It's interesting to see how the issue was addressed. From most accounts I've read on several boards, it seems more and more like SKs and Paladins are now 98% warrior (because regardless of how they began prepared to do the job in the original game, it's the roll they've had to fill as a plate/tank class)... and the other percentage of that 100 is negligible and debatable, but it is sweet wonderful solid aggro so who cares. You don't invite a SK or Paladin to the group for an AC tap or a resist poison buff... it's because they can tank all but a very small amount of encounters without the problems of a warrior. We'll say that small amount of encounters is that magical 2% warrior that's missing from the Paladin/SK equation.<br />
<br />
Rangers kinda lucked out in this field.... they were segued into a damage role (along with the traditional snaring/peeling/rooting job they've always had), and are kind of omitted from this job fight Warriors, SKs and Pallies are now in. <br />
<br />
Here's the problem.<br />
<br />
If Warriors are given their 25% edge back.... you're left with hybrids that have no function in a well designed party. At the same time, if nothing happens Warriors get, or rather continuing getting, the finger. &quot;You get no fun stuff and you're no better then those guys. Hell they aren't even penalized in XP anymore so they can have just as many skills and AA as you do&quot;. <br />
<br />
We saw what's happened with Monks. They lost their ability to tank and have become rogue-lites. In PoP pulling is such a menial task, that even though a monk is well equipped to do it, many classes can do it and often faster. Monks can and still do the job because they've done it for so long that if you're a monk that makes it to PoP, you probably know how to pull. It'd be nice to see monks compensated in some way for their not wearing plate armor. Nah they're just screwed for it, but that's another gripe for another board. <br />
<br />
If the next expansion suddenly makes it so that Warriors are the 25% more of a warrior then Paladins and Shadowknights again, what role will they have? Rogue-lite? I'm not sure if my group needs weaker cleric buffs or heals when we've already got them. And I certainly don't need my corpse found...<br />
<br />
If anyone wonders why they haven't given us warriors a step up to compete, it's because they can't... not because they've forgotten. Too many promises have been 'made' to start breaking hearts now.<br />
<br />
Maybe we'll get something cool like a big new sword. That'd be nice. I like swords.<br />

Only way I can see this as working out fair to all is if they make tanks 'stack' better in a group and/or make doubling up tanks far more vital to the groups safety/security....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will be in the next expansion warriors will really feel the crunch if the current status quo is upheld. <br />
<br />
By that time there will be a ton of Paladins/SKs in near full EP(sans bp/legs) whom all will be very effective tanks on all sorts of exp mobs and some mini bosses.<br />
<br />
If those mobs in the 6 man dungeons do NOT require defensive, then you effectively wont be needed at all and your group would be much better served with a paladin or SK tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-15-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said Mahhj.  It's a complicated problem.  A lot of people on this board just scream for warrior upgrades but don't want to aknowldege or consider what the results will be.<br />
<br />
And I don't think tanking ability nerf hurt monks in groups.  Nobody put a monk in group to tank unless they had to with the exception of the helpless exp mobs in Luclin.  Monks wouldn't be tanking in PoP before or after the nerf.  The problem with monks I think is that they're not needed for pulling anymore.  Rogues with SoS do a better job of scouting and CRing, Bards can pull way better than monks with pacify and fading memories, and most of the PoP are outdoor zones with no splitting required.  I think monks are in worse shape than warriors because they don't really have an important role in raids or exp groups anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe so.  But all the nerf really did was take them out of the running for tank in most situations where the mobs didn't hit horribly hard (anyplace you wouldn't want to use a ranger, you now don't want to use a monk either) and stopped them from soloing low dark blues.<br />
<br />
So I agree it didn't impact their group attractiveness.  They're suffering from the same problem we are.  They're much more a dungeon style class than not and there are too many other classes that can do their job just about as well while bringing other things that are considered important as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahhj</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, Brutul. No one really expected a monk to tank beforehand (they don't even have taunt, just have to hope for procs on the ole RNG even moreso then a warrior). <br />
<br />
A changing meaning to affect the very small percentage of monks at the top of the game has hurt many all the way down. <br />
<br />
They're stuck without a role in groups right now since pulling is almost a trivial matter. <br />
<br />
Maybe LDoN will require some heavy tanking/pulling and bring the monks and warriors back 'into the fold'. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about this. Mahhj was right about not nerfing knights or upgrading us to the point where its an inderect nerf of Knights. I know this idea has been posted before and they never looked at it but I'll say it again. We dont need any more hp or ac because with warriors breaking 10k HP the cheals are already there. <br />
<br />
    Take out defensive and place warriors level 55 and above on a different defensive migration table.<br />
<br />
 EDIT: cause i spell faster in my head then it comes out through my hands and i always forget to profread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monk's superior ratio weapons are a great source of aggro.  Back in Luclin monk weapons were about 10% better ratio than anyone else (Fangs 17/19 versus Bloodfrenzy/Khal 16/20).  DPS is the most reliable form of aggro.  Sure, Fangs aren't going to beat Bloodfrenzy over the long run anytime soon, but it will definitely beat a BF before it procs, and presumably your raid knows how to operate so that they don't have all important members instantly die if you just get a bad streak on the procs.  So it's certainly workable aggro.  <br />
<br />
Although monks have no good short range aggro abilities, it's not like Warriors are particularly good at short-duration aggro except our AE Taunt anyway.<br />
<br />
Besides, one of the monk usable weapons from Tunare procs Ensnare and has a tolerable ratio as well.  It might not be a Bloodfrenzy but Ensnare is certainly good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the hardest amount of balancing has to go to those who have basically the least amount of things they can change ( aka monks, warriors,clerics )<br />
<br />
while i'd love to see the warrior class become more of a useful member of an experience group; minor tweaking could theoretically become too powerful since .. well, ain't much a warrior does besides hit or get hit ( not counting the piles of utility weapons most carry ) .. same goes for monks.<br />
PoP is a puller's dream, pathing is basically irrelevant ( remember pulling PoH or some long dungeon where if you didn't know the pathing it could equal a wipeout ? )...and , bleh, i'm rambling.<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what can be done to the warrior class to make it more useful for gaining experience in order to get to the levels/aa needed to do our job...seiously as a personal observation; when did you ever hear a warrior ask what to do with &quot;spare&quot; aa's? prob could count them on one hand.<br />
<br />
simplicity is our downfall ( experience ). it's also our prime value for existing ( boss mob raids ). it's tough. i just hope they can take ideas from here and work with them.<br />
<br />
especially wielding two-hand weapons as one handers **shameless plug **<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Design encounter monster melee subclasses that are unstunable, unslowable and don't accrue aggro from stuns,slows (best tanked by Warriors). <br />
<br />
- Position multiple non-mezzable hard hitting mobs so you must have a skilled FD puller in the 6 man group (SK or Monk{Necro ?})<br />
<br />
- Throw in a few nasty C-Healing mobs and or undead (Pally stuns)<br />
<br />
Clerics,Enchanters,Shaman, Druid-(Cheal),Rangers,Rogue,Mage,Wizard,Beastlord are fairly straight forward.  I'm fairly ignorant about Necro's other than FD not sure how to make them more desirable for group.</div></div><hr />

This all sounds good, and I'm really into the talk about the new expansion, and dungeon crawling is what I enjoy most about EQ type games.  But, this cornholes warriors and monks into 1 type of game content and particularly 1 expansion.  Much the way the experience change was implimented because groups were similarly cornholed into exp in PoP, warrior's need some kind of fix.  I know not what or how, but Like Shik, I hope ideas from here can be reviewed and something be worked out.  I think the future updates said something about wanting to add some kind of bonus for using a shield, maybe Shik's shamles plug would be useful in conjuction with this.  Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;you were basically a sub par version of whatever the over untouched half was.&quot;<br />
<br />
In previous expansions, it was usually OK to get by with SUBPAR versions.<br />
<br />
I mean, really, in Kunark, ya didn't need to be maxxed DPS and maxxed healing efficiency. <br />
<br />
You had a lot more flexibility in group design and makeup. A group of ALL melees could actually find something to do.<br />
<br />
This doesn't happen in Planes of Power. So the disparities become a lot more obvious.<br />
<br />
Especially since the &quot;subpar&quot; hybrids aren't at all subpar.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
it's bad game design, not bad class design.<br />
<br />
The classes should have some level of interchangability, allowing groups to form easier.<br />
<br />
But the expansions ... read, content ... shouldn't FORCE you into NEEDING X, Y or Z before you do anything ... where x= slower, y=healer with CH and z=tank who can aggro in an instant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqin</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was attempting to find a way to make Warriors and  Knights situationally ideal, dependent upon mob.    If a group wants to engage multiple mob types then it would need some melee stacking, War/Pally  or War/SK.   <br />
<br />
The class balancing issue is so complicated whenever they touch a player class they screw something else up.</div></div><hr />
