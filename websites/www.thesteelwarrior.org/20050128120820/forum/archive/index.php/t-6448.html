<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Appologies if this has been posted before.  Was not able to find it in a search, but I'm curious to see if others are experiencing the same phenomenon.<br />
<br />
Ever since this DX 9 patch, I see a very strange graphic phenomenon.  This only seems to occur when my character is in a crowded area, (like 20+ other players in my immediate view).<br />
<br />
On about 3 or 4 of the character models I see in front of me, one corner of one polygon, on the secondary hand seems to stretch and terminate in the middle of my screen.  For all of the characters who are displayed incorrectly, all of the &quot;deformed&quot; polygons seem to terminate in exactly the same point on my screen.<br />
<br />
If I turn, or rotate my camera view, the deformed polygons will continue to stretch and deform, so that the one point is always terminating at the same spot on my monitor.  The end result is I see 3 or 4 very long triangles that continue to stretch and deform, as I walk around PoK, Baz, or during a raid.<br />
<br />
Here are my cpu specs,<br />
Geforce 4 Ti4200<br />
Pent 4, 2.4Ghz<br />
1Gb Ram<br />
Windows XP, Pro<br />
Latest DX9 installed<br />
Latest Nvidia drivers installed<br />
<br />
What makes it particularily odd, is that this phenomenon does not occur on my girlfriend's machine.  Her cpu is a little bit faster than mine (2.8Ghz) but the other specs match exactly (including the video card).<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?  Does anyone know of a work around or a fix?  Many thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

I had the same issue when the dx9 patch came out. I reinstalled dx9 and it went away. The next night I logged on and it was back. After I zoned into a LDON is was gona again. <br />
<br />
This is using the latest march nvidia drivers.</div></div><hr />

Cured all the issues I was having with the latest patch.<br />
<br />
Just have to ignore that message you get about needing the latest drivers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When moving backwards in GeForce Drivers, do I simply download and install the 45.23 version from this site?<br />
<br />
Or do I need to uninstall the existing Drivers before I install the 45.23?</div></div><hr />

I think its safer to install the existing drivers first.  There is a utilitiy called DriverCleaner (do a search of google to find it) which can also be used to make sure the existing driver is completely removed.  NVIDIA has a nasty habbit of leaving files lying around that sometimes can cause probems.</div></div><hr />

I think the lastest drivers before the 56.64 were the 53.03, not any 45s.  <br />
<br />
True but i had to go all the way back to 45.23 to get rid of all the bullshit introduced with the DX9 patch.   Havent had a single crash or glitch since reverting back to version 45.23.<br />
<br />
FYI Prior to the recent DX9 patch I was running with 53.03 w/o any problems.  <br />
<br />
This patch has to be one of the biggest &quot;unneeded&quot; fuck-ups in EQ history.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But then, that's the same for every patch SoE introduces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The stretchy polygon problem is sort of fixed...  But not quite...  Before, a polygon on the secondary hand would stretch to the middle of my screen.  This doesn't happen anymore... However now, a polygon at the Male High Elf charater's faces that become deformed.   grrrrr...<br />
<br />
I'll try to post a screen shot so you can see what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />
