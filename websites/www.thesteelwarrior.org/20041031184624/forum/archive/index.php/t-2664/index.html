<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=2664">Proc rate theory</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dugman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After studying some posts about procs on this board and data in Lucy, and my own observations in game, I have what seems to be a consistent theory on how procs occur:<br />
<br />
1) Player proc checks occur every two seconds or so<br />
First, player procs are different from NPCs.  NPCs proc on a per hit basis.  That is, every time the NPC swings and hits, there's a chance the proc goes off.  That also means that if you haste or slow an NPC, or evade the blow, it alters how often they proc<br />
<br />
The studies I've seen on this board indicate that players are different.  Base player proc rates appear to be constant for most weapons, regardless of whether the player hits or is hasted.  While I haven't seen much discussion about this, my own guess is that what happens is, for most weapons, every two seconds or so your character automatically attempts to proc his weapons.   The chance this proc works is based on your Dex, and your off-hand weapon also has to make an off-hand weapon use check.  Note that this rate is constant, regardless of weapon delay.  So in general a one-hander and a two-hander proc at the same rate per minute, for example.<br />
<br />
If you examine the raw data on weapons in Lucy, you'll notice that there is a &quot;casttime&quot; stat.  For most weapons, this stat is 0, but for some it is a -1.  The casttime appears to be a modifier to the delay between proc checks.  So whereas most weapons check for procs every two seconds or so, weapons with a casttime of -1 check every second.  Thus weapons with casttime -1 proc about twice as often as most.  Casttime -1 weapons include black acrylia weapons like the black acrylia rapier and the cleric's Hammer of Damnation (and if you've watched either of these weapons in action you'll have noticed how often they proc).<br />
<br />
<br />
Some interesting aspects of this:<br />
<br />
- Two-handers and one-handers proc at the same rate. So with the warrior epic, for instance, the 1-hand Blade of Strategy in your primary hand and the 2-h Jagged blade of war proc the same number of times per minute on average.  <br />
<br />
- You can ignore weapon delay when it comes to procs.  Black acrylia rapiers proc at the same rate as black acrylia battle axes.  Likewise, Blade of carnage and blade of war should both proc enraging blow at the same rate (although I can't test this out personally).<br />
<br />
- It should be obvious, but if you are dual wielding the primary weapon will usually proc first and proc more often than your off-hand, since you need to make your off-hand weapon check to proc it.  This comes into play when, for instance, you want to proc a snare or slow weapon ASAP during a fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's about it.  Afraid I don't have personal parses to make this a formal study, but feel free to post info, parses or comments about the theory.  Like I said, this is the theory I'm currently working under, and it seems to bear out when I watch my own proc rates.  But if someone has parse evidence to the contrary, I'd be interested in seeing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's much simpler to say that weapons have an innate proc rate, which does not show up in Lucy. This chance to proc is increased by your dex, and is propotinally scaled back according to your weapon delay and haste. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure where you are getting your every 2 seconds figure, but I can certainly proc more often than once every 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
The cast time theory doesn't hold up because there are multiple gradations of proc rates. The 56 hamer procs far more than any other weapon that is not a cleric hammer, the 58 hammer procs more than the 56, the 60 hammer more than the 58th, the 63 more than the 60th, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you examine the casttimes, the lvl 56 hammer and 58 hammers are both casttime 0, while the lvl 60 and 63 hammers are both casttime -1.  So it would stand to reason that the lvl 60+ hammers proc more often.<br />
<br />
Also, if there's a difference between a lvl 60 and 63 hammer proc, for example, it could be differences in the dexes of the lvl 60 and lvl 63 clerics.<br />
<br />
You might be right, but I'd like to see some evidence.  Can you point me to a post with parses showing any of the following:<br />
<br />
- More than two basic proc rates (normal and fast)<br />
- Weapons with casttime of -1 which don't proc faster than normal<br />
- Parses demonstrating that weapon haste speeds up proc rate<br />
- Parses which show that faster weapon delay implies faster procs<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm disinclined to think my basic theory is wrong without that evidence.<br />
<br />
P.S.  The two second value is just a guess.  The actual proc checks might occur more frequently, I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One final note.  I believe that whatever stats determine &quot;innate proc rate&quot; for a given weapon are very likely to show up in the raw data for the weapon in Lucy.  After all, if every weapon has a different proc rate, then it must be part of that weapon's data.  It seems very unlikely that the game would seperate the proc rate data for a weapon from the rest of the weapon's data. To do so would mean the game would have two seperate databases for weapons: one with proc rate stats, and one with all the rest of the weapon data.  That seems quite impractical.<br />
<br />
Lucy's raw data is just a data dump of that weapon's entry in the item database.  So whatever stats there are for that weapon that effect it's proc rate would very likely appear there.  And casttime seems like a very likely candidate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whats the entry for Bloodfrenzy? It procs more than normal. (Sorry, I cant access lucy from work.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You misunderstand me, I am saying that the chance to proc scales DOWN with delay and haste, therefore the change to proc per swing goes down with haste and lower delay, but procs/minute remains constant.<br />
<br />
I guarantee you that a 60 and 63 hammer proc more than any other non cleric hammer weapon with a cast time of -1. As for a weapon with a cast time of 0 with a crazy proc rate, http://lucy.fnord.net/itemraw.html?id=22907<br />
<br />
The data in lucy is all the CLIENT side data for a weapon, but not necessarily all the data for a weapon that exists. Procs are calculated on the serverside, there is no reason for that info to exist on the client.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Player proc checks occur every two seconds or so:<br />
<br />
Pretty sure I have double procced in the same round (same instant) from a double attack <br />
<br />
Also, cleric hammer procs like 5X as often as other weapons, so it would need to have a major modifier, yet its cast time is 0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, and I also guarantee you that the 56 and 58 hammers proc far more than any other standard weapon, which your theory would not pridect, since they have a cast time of 0.

<br />
<br />
Actually, when my Dex is at 255, I usually get about 8 procs in my primary hand within about 16 ticks.  That'd be a proc every 12 seconds, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was one every 10 seconds on a decent fight.<br />
<br />
You may be right about there being an additional factor for proc rate.  There may be, for instance, a server side stat for the weapon which affects the procs, or possibly the casting time of the spell it procs affects the rate (note that the Hand of the Gods proc used by all the cleric hammers has a casting time of 0).  But I'd like to see some parses to prove it, if that's the case.  So far all I have is anecdotal evidence one way or the other.<br />
<br />
We do seem to agree on one thing, though: weapon delay and haste don't affect how often you proc.<br />
<br />
As to someone saying they think they got double procs from the same weapon on a double attack, that may be but I'd like to see the parse.  I don't remember that ever happening to me.  Of course, it'd be a pretty rare occurance, so it's hard to verify one way or another.  I have proced both my right and left hand weapons in the same round, but I can't remember proc'ing my right hand twice in the same round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2+ procs in the same round are uncommon, but they happen. Wield a 2hander with a proc, or wield a 1h proc weapon and a non-proccing weapon in the offhand. Watch the screen long enough and you will see doubles. <br />
<br />
 As stated above, not all information is client-side. Hitting the Attack button is client-side, the calculations done as to whether you hit or not is sever-side. Loot is server-side. The Foraged Items table is server-side ( used to be client-side until people hacked it and foraged blue diamonds etc... ). SOE has been trying to keep combat info secret for a long, long time otherwise they would have released info about it in that crappy little book that comes with every expansion. Part of the fun for most of us is trying to figure out this &quot;supa-sekrit-infoz&quot;.<br />
<br />
I would think that proc rates are per-weapon, linked to the weapon server-side. Modifiers ( dex ) are added to the formula and the final check is made. Also, I believe it is per-swing checked, due to doubles I have personally done and seen others do. Now as far as what is the proc-rate? Shiz if I know. But as everyone knows there is some crazy proccing coming from cleric hammers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and its a common occurance for me to proc both hands at once, or double with one hand and single with another, happens quite often, a few times a day normally.<br />
<br />
It can happen, which throws your &quot;a check every 2 seconds&quot; thing out the window.<br />
<br />
There is no innate check for procs based on time passed, the check is made every time you swing, including ripostes...  ever gone rampage furious with an earthshaker ... do it, then tell me you only check once every 2 seconds for a proc.  after you do 6million damage from procs in 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
proc checks are made when you swing the weapon, for every swing.  period, thats how they work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, 5 procs in a round, nice.  Guess my dex just isn't high enough yet to see that.  I've gotten my dual wield double proc, but maybe I have to watch more carefully for the double attack procs.<br />
<br />
Sounds like I'm wrong about the autochecks.  On the other hand, weapon delay and haste don't affect proc rate (that's old news).  I'm also still convinced casttime 0 or -1 influences proc rate.  There may be another hidden factor, but either way the -1 casttime weapons all seem to proc much more often than casttime 0 weapons.  Have to keep an eye on it.</div></div><hr />

I'd guess its just a codestable on the server side.  Loads a proc value (pct occurance?) by weaponsID.  I'm assuming Lucy reads the client side data only?</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. This IS true for innate procs (like rampage, and most AEs), this is NOT true for any proc the NPC gains via a weapon (Like CBoL if Wuoshits has it, simple example).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hi all-<br />
<br />
Think this might be in the library in some form, but here goes again.  Think this is all correct:<br />
<br />
-there are two different types of procs; innate and weapon based.  This is true for both mobs and players.<br />
<br />
-weapon-based procs can occur on a miss; &quot;innate&quot; procs (most mob procs, player effects like call of sky) can only proc on a &quot;hit&quot;.<br />
<br />
-weapons have a &quot;baseline&quot; chance to proc; 2h baseline chance *may* be higher than 1h, but further parsing needed to verify.<br />
<br />
-each and every individual swing has a chance to proc, with the base rate modified by current dexterity.<br />
<br />
-some weapons (bloodfrenzy, cleric hammers) have modifiers to their proc rate that increases it.  Some suspicion other weapons have reduced chances, not well documented tho.<br />
  <br />
-for weapons, the chance to proc PER SWING is modified by the effective delay of the weapon *for that swing*; haste reduces the chance to proc, slow increases it.  This results in a generally constant proc rate over time, modified only by the number of actual swings (dual wield, double-triple-quad attack, flurry, rampage) vs. the number expected based purely on delay.<br />
<br />
-for innate procs, proc rate is proportional to number of hits, modified by dexterity.  It is unknown if effective (haste/slow) delay impacts innate proc probability the way it does with weapon procs, but the reduction in &quot;hits&quot; due to fewer attacks is probably the predominant factor.  Fewer swings = fewer chances to hit = fewer hits = fewer procs.  Avoidance has the same type of impact.<br />
<br />
Think that's most of the story anyway.  The most procs I've personally seen in &quot;one round&quot; of attacks is 13, which was done on a 65ish mob AE pull via rampage.<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
<br />
NOTE: since (most/all?) EQ &quot;success or fail&quot; and &quot;extent of success&quot; checks are based on the RNG output generated using a variable seed value, and all checks seem to be the same &quot;polarity&quot; (i.e. high = succeed / low = fail, or the opposite- it's arbitrary but consistent), multiple checks for success/failure in a small time interval are probably NOT truly/statistically  independent.  I.e. the seed used impacts the RNG output, and it is unlikely the seed value is updated on a per-event basis.  Empirical evidence suggests it, or part of it, gets updated on a zone-wide basis about once per tick, which explains how seemingly unbelieveable events like quad-flurry-crits or procs occur, despite the fact they'd normally happen about once in the time before a proton would decay... (exaggerating here, but you get the idea ;) ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look, I understand what you're saying about the cleric hammer, and I'm not saying you're wrong - it sounds like there might be a couple of weapons like the one you mentioned that proc more often but have casttime 0.<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is that the weapons that have casttime of -1 seem to proc more often than typical weapons.  So casttime might not be the ONLY factor, but it does seem to be a factor.  The casttime -1 weapons I've seen all proc more often than typical weapons.<br />
<br />
I fail to see why this is so hard to believe.  The casttime stat is there for a reason, after all, and intuitively you'd think a stat called &quot;casttime&quot; would have to do with the weapon's ability to cast spells.  <br />
<br />
All I'm saying is I think it's worth looking into the casttime stat and comparing proc rates of -1 vs 0 weapons.  If it turns out I'm wrong, fine, but what's the harm in looking?</div></div><hr />

No need to get personal, buddy.<br />

I'm not ignoring what he said. He gave an example of a weapon that is casttime 0 but has a fast proc rate. <br />
<br />
That doesn't contradict, though, my suggestion that casttime has an effect on procrates.  From what I've seen, casttime -1 weapons are faster than typical casttime 0 weapons.  So while there might be other hidden factors, my guess is that if you see casttime -1 on a weapon it will proc more often than normal.<br />
<br />
Now, maybe you don't believe casttime is a factor at all, and that's fine.  But then how do you explain the apparent correlation?  And what do you think the casttime stat does?  The name certainly implies it has something to do with casting spells, but maybe I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

Great post, thanks.  I knew there had been a more detailed study like this.  <br />
<br />
The only question really left is about the casttime stat.  So far, I have that:<br />
<br />
- Most weapons proc at the same rate regardless of delay.<br />
<br />
- The weapons with casttime -1 seem to proc faster than the normal proc rate.  So casttime seems to be at least one factor in proc rate<br />
<br />
- Gimmel has pointed out that there are some casttime 0 weapons that also proc faster than normal.  So there may be an additional hidden factor involved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anything I'm missing?</div></div><hr />

Actually, I thought about it for a minute, and it was immediatley obvious what casttime is used for. It is the cast time for right clickable items. For example:http://lucy.fnord.net/itemraw.html?id=25320<br />
Both 0 and -1 are more than likely placeholder values for items where that field is unused (though 0 is also used when an item is an instaclick item).  <br />
<br />
Good point about casttime on right clickables.  That's obviously the main use for the stat.<br />
<br />
Why do they have two different values for weapons though?  You'd think casttime would be the same for all weapons without a rightclick effect if it's only used for that.  Why have a -1 at all?  It might be a glitch in their database, but I'd still like to rule it out.  <br />
<br />
By the way, I sent email to Lucy asking if there's a way to search for or get a data dump of weapons with casttime of -1.  What I'm looking for is a weapon with casttime -1 that has the same common proc rate as most weapons.  That would I think completely rule out casttime -1 as having an effect on procs.</div></div><hr />

Try looking up the weapons used in the shaman test. Several of them (Gnoll hide lariat and Velium weapons) have a cast time of -1. Others have a cast time of 0 (Primal war sword and Dirk of the Dain). Yet in the shaman tests, they all had the exact same proc rate. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that cast time has anything to do with proc rate.  <br />

Thanks!  That's what I was looking for - a weapon that had casttime -1 but wasn't any faster.  (I read your posts in reverse order just now, which is why I replied to the other post first.)  That would indicate casttime -1 doesn't really have an effect.<br />
<br />
I'm still wondering, though, if casttime -1 actually means something.  It seems odd to use both 0 and -1 as just placeholders.<br />
<br />
This also begs the question of figuring out which weapons has faster than normal procs.  Most weapons proc at the same rate, so the list of faster proc'ing weapons can't be too large.  Too bad casttime isn't checking out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Very nice thread you all got going on here, just a thing or two i'd like to mention... firstly that 5 procs in one round is absolutely sick, i as a ranger sometimes have 4 different procs on myself and i've never procced every hit on a quad, nor have i ever had 2 innates or an innate and a wep proc go off in the same attack, at least not that i've ever noticed but im usually watching to see which procs go off when.  What parsers are you using? i'd like to run a few tests of my own based upon a few weps in my arsenal as well as self buffs... Call of Sky/Fire are imho some of the best things out of VT and would recommend any warrior pick up the items if they in VT and have the points to spend, they both go off more than any wep proc that i have and its basically just free agro $$.  On another not there also seems to be weps that proc a lot LESS than the majority, ranger mainhand epic being one of them.  I've gone for 5 mobs straight a few times w/o a single proc, in BoT thats easily 10 min or so w/ no proccage... this is definitly a thread im going to follow for a while and I hope it doesn't just fade into nothingness, keep up the good work Trojans.<br />
