<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawke</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering if this would be a good combination or not?<br />
I know very expensive, but dps wise in addition to aggro? <br />
I read a few posts on BoC and GBoS combination, that looked nice.. Was just curious. Currentlly using CHoS and Sword of the Bloodsworn and it just isn't cutting it.. A shaman slow and i'm lucky to see aggro again at the mobs 40% mark.<br />
Thats using Bellow and taunting after the slow? any ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm goiong to assume you are hitting -&gt; taunting after slow -&gt; using bellow. Using bellow before taunt is kinda useless and you need to do damage for bellow to take full effect. Barring that, your shaman is slowing to early. Droga weapons do fine right out the box.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you run into shamans that like to melee when they pull agro, /slap them, they are only making things worse by trying to be a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a good setup, but yes, very very VERY expensive. It'll be above droga weapons for sure. That being said, you are either exaggerating, or the weapons don't proc for you yet. There is no way those weapons can't hold aggro from people that aren't deliberately trying to take aggro from you. If you honestly can't keep aggro that bad, using taunt and bellow after slow, it's the casters fault not yours.</div></div><hr />

Have you changed the battiers in your droga weapons?<br />

<br />
No, it's a fucking horrible setup. What the hell are you thinking anyway? 2 aggro weapons? What the fuck dude.<br />

<br />
<br />
I agree.  The SoD isn't gonna be enough of an upgrade to merit the cost IMO.  GBoS would be nice if you can pick one up though.</div></div><hr />

All the tanks in my guild use the AHB if they have one. Sweet little wep, quick, lifetaps, makes a great offhand. Whack an Anger3 on there, and it's a treat :)</div></div><hr />

Grab a windblade!! ... LEET AGGRO GENERATION OMG!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd stick with the BOC/CHOS until you get something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lose the SoD, you can get way better armor for that price tag, and the aggro on it isn't much better than a CHoS, being off hand procs are cut in half, so its even lesser than if you were main handing a SoD. You're talking like 100 - 200 hate per minute at max difference... not worth the tag.</div></div><hr />

:D<br />
<br />
uhm... maybe the droga weapons were OOM,  let them med up some:p<br />
<br />
seriously tho. unless you are a lowbie, there is no reason to pick up a SoD these days.  too expensive for the limited utility.  but if money is no object or you are getting the SoD for free, then I guess it's still a fine weapon for grabbing aggro.  if you arent a lowbie then i'd suggest you sell the SoD and upgrade your other slots.</div></div><hr />

Seems like this is still a common belief, so I'll dispell it here again.  SoD doesn't proc until 46.  No twinkage for j00.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's something wrong here.<br />
What level are you, Hawke, and at what point is the shaman slowing?<br />
Is the shaman successfully tanking the mob until mob is 40%?<br />
Is your taunt failing several times in a row?<br />
<br />
Just doesn't make sense that CHoS and SotB are losing aggro for most of the fight because of one slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it's still a 12/18 with hps on it and no recommended level :)  but you can get something like a Horn of Hsagra much cheaper for your twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or a swiftblade of zek with even more HP and essentially the same ratio :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apokolipse</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As was stated above, the shaman is simply slowing too soon.  I have dual weilded the BoC and SoD , and tried each one mainhand and offhand.  And guess what I found?  If the shaman/chanter slows too soon, they will still get aggro.  And after that if my taunt fails, they will still have aggro. <br />
<br />
No matter how many times I explain to the mob that I'm a twink with 800k plat worth of gear they still won't give me unconditional aggro ( bastards! /grin ).<br />
<br />
If you like flashy numbers then get Ingenuity and keep your SoD.  If your gear lacks, sell both and droga weapons will do fine if they wait til the mob is at 90% to slow.  If your gear rocks and plat grows on trees?  I like the BoC for the aggro and HP, I sold my SoD and now I'm back to my sotbs with anger 2 and it works just fine.  <br />
<br />
my 2 cents<br />
