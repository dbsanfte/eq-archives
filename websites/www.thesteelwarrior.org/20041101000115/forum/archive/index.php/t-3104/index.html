<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With the new LDON augmentations, cant you augment the nonproccing epic with a 150DD+stun and make it worth of weilding? Can you also add the same proc to the 450hate proccing one? So, now you have your epics, one procs a 150DD+stun and the other has 2 procs, a 450hate+100DD and a 150DD+stun.<br />
<br />
I personally, wouldnt bank em if I could augment them that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Problem is he can put those augments on better weapons that he already has.  The delay on the 1hs epics is too damn slow.  I wish it were different, my epics are banked too...and I really love the lightsabres.  <br />

I remember seeing Furor wield his epics standing outside the bank in N.fp... I was in awe...I think he was first on Veeshan to have them, or darn near.  So sad to see them banked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also... I wouldn't bank red epic so quickly, hate proc are spiffy, it seems I proc red epic in my offhand about 3 times more than I proc great blade of storms in my main hand. With my red epic I don't see many aggro problems except when the beastlord is slowing and meleeing. Or when the ranger decides to be lazy and put away his bow (in which case it's because I turn attack off and let the ranger get aggro because no ranger with AM3 should ever melee, unless tanking for an exp group, hah).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Pusherman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im thinking,(Yea,yea look out a troll using a brain) that on over 60th level mobs the hate + DD  proc on the red epic would be better than the CHoS. <br />
Ive been reading that DD= 1pt of hate for 1pt of dammage SO... red epic proc is 600pts of hate<br />
<br />
CHoS = 179pts of hate + stun hate (no idea) X<br />
<br />
That would mean if the proc rates where the same and the ratio not with standing the 0.0 sec stun would need to be 421 pts of hate.<br />

I cant help but want to use the weapon that took me YEARS to get  over a shitty little weapon a druid/shammy/warrior can camp in 2 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Join the Club. Just don't ignore simple math and common sense :D<br />
<br />
epics are eye candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The problems with the red epic are numerous. First of all, there is the obvious - the ratio sucks balls and its too slow. You can get better than 14/24 for under 1000pp in the bazaar. Don't forget that the basis for a solid agro weapon is the underlying DPS. If your weapon isn't doing damage to keep the mobs attention between procs, then it's not really doing the job.<br />
<br />
Next is the proc itself. Unlike DD+stun procs, the DD+hate only has 1 resist check. When the proc is resisted, it results in little to no agro generation. This is where DD+stun procs have a huge advantage over any resistable proc. Not only does it get the advantage of having 2 resist checks - one for the DD and one for the stun portion, but a resisted stun still generates near if not equal to the amount of hate that a landed stun generates.<br />
<br />
Next we have the stats. While the epic does have some pretty decent stats - 15sta 50hp and 5 save all - they are not really all that spectacular when you consider there is no AC on it, the STA goes to waste rather easily once you are capped, and 50hp weapons are a dime a dozen.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there is the percieved proc rate. This has been discussed countless times now and other than a few well know exceptions - BF and cleric hammer come to mind - no one has shown any proof other than &quot;gut feeling&quot; that any weapon procs more than the standard 2 procs per minute. As a matter of fact, the only people who have produced parses so far support the theory of 2 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
My opinion is still the same as it was before LDoN, only stronger now. The epics are a fashion statement and a status symbol. There are way too many better weapons with better ratios, better stats, and better procs that are easily obtainable by any warrior at epic level.<br />
<br />
Why would you want to augment a mediocre weapon when you can augment an outstanding weapon and make it that much better??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wymp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Unfortunately, I have to agree that the epic is too underpowered to be a viable agro weapon nowadays in the high end.<br />
<br />
But, I am nostalgic and put WAY too much time and effort into finishing my epic, so I plan to put a good DD proc on my Blade of Tactics and use it as my offhand weapon when not tanking ... it'll still give me stats+atk and do better damage that way.<br />
<br />
I know that's prolly not the best use of adventure points, but I just can't bring myself to bank the damned thing, so I'll upgrade it to some extent and make it more useful.<br />
<br />
That's the nice thing about these LDoN augments ... if you need another one, it's just a few adventures away with no waiting for spawns or camps to get them.<br />
<br />
Hell, I may even put a Ykesha proc on the JBoW just for the hell of it to use in the odd xp group.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did this guy say he was high end? I don't recall weapons like sword of the blood sworn nor copper hammer of stiking being high end.<br />
<br />
Also, some of you may not know, but there's some warriors that aren't exactlt capped on the sta department, like me for example, I switched out a wicked shank for red epic and I don't regret it a second. Sure the shank is stronger and faster and has a dot on it.. but so what? The aggro proc from red epic is nice if you don't have a BoW, Bloodfrenzy, Hategiver, Cord Hilted Spiked Driver, or something decently close in the aggro department.<br />
<br />
Like I've said before, my main hand is a great blade of storms, it's a stun and dd, if it procs, I don't always have aggro afterwards, I've had 3 procs in almost chain succession and not had aggro, but for the most part in an exp group I have a dead lock on aggro now with my red epic. I was in Miraguls today and I was tanking 3 mobs at the same time while all the casters were nuking  and I didn't lose aggro because I waited for Rage of Vallon switched mobs, Rage of Vallon, switched mobs.<br />
<br />
Red epic is NOT eye candy unless you have better. The person who posted doesn't. Grats on your epic, and use it wisely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Red epic is NOT eye candy unless you have better. <br />

God, I don't know how to make this point any clearer.<br />
<br />

<br />
SWORD OF THE BLOODSWORN &gt; Red epic,<br />
<br />

<br />
Bottom line, period, 100%, end of discussion, DROGA WEAPONS ARE BETTER THAN OUR EPIC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You don't have a clue as to what you're talking about.

<br />
Your opinion is the minority.  The VAST minority.<br />
<br />
And I only speak of things i know.  Do you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If the red epic proc lands, then you do get more aggro than you would with a droga weapon proc.  If your red epic proc is resisted, then it is minimal aggro.  If the droga weapon proc is resisted then it is equal aggro to landing.  So if the mob is FR then droga will be much better.  But what if you don't proc, or it takes a while to proc?  14 / 24, even offhand, is sad, and makes it so that if you don't proc then the weapon is worthless.  Whereas the droga weapons have a good ratio to help aggro when you don't proc.  DPS is the most reliable form of aggro.  I've seen no parses to show that the red epic procs more often than most procs.  Given that info, I'd say that droga weapons are superior to epics, especially if you consider time vs reward.  Though I do have my epics, and really like them, they are bagged unless I'm just wearing them for looks.<br />
<br />
Also, 1 point of damage from a dd is a LOT smaller than 1 point of hate.  DD procs are very low aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Look, I've got a great blade in my main hand, so I got the stuns covered, the pure aggro doesn't seem to be reissted alot on the mobs I fight, so it works, if I find something doesn't like to hit me when I use red epic I'll grab my shank from my weapon sack, but until I do, my epic is the weapon I want.<br />
<br />
And I don't care if I'm in the minority, it's not like you're gonna have all your friends beat all of my friends up or anything. If you don't like epic, whatever. I'm just saying it's a perfectly viable as an aggro weapon. <br />
<br />
Also like I've said, stun aggro doesn't seem to help me as much as pure hate. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. But when my stun procs landed or resisted, I don't always have aggro, but if I see a &quot;your target has been weaken by the rage of vallon&quot; I know that aggro is generally mine. But then again I'm new at this epic thing just getting it recently, I'm sure after a few months the luster will wear off. But I don't care, red epic is my best friend until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wymp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, Haass has spoken so I guess it must be so.  :o<br />
<br />
Lay off, man.  Sure if you have a Bloodfrenzy/Hategiver (which proc more often) or a BoW (just nasty) then agro is probably not going to be a problem.  If you have Droga weapons, then you may usually have decent agro too if they proc consistently.  We all pretty much know this by now, as does this guy, or he wouldn't be using them.  It's all in the procs.  Even a BoC is just a 15/20 sword unless it procs .. and I am sure we all have had fights where it never did once.  I've had fights with 2 procs off epic that held agro for the whole fight.  I've borrowed a BoC and had it proc once in 2 fights and cursed it vigorously as I fought to get agro set.  It's just the roll of the dice, really.<br />
<br />
I doubt anyone really knows how good epic would be with a Ykesha or Anger proc added to it, yet.  It may well generate more agro than Droga weapons ... I don't know .. neither do you unless you have done the augment and compared them.<br />
<br />
I have tried a Sword of the Bloodsworn myself and I personally think it sucks ass for agro.  The damage sucks and it doesn't proc reliably enough, and I sold it the same day I got it.  I only use my CHoS as a dps weapon occasionally now, and I will probably be selling it soon, too.<br />
<br />
I use GBoS/red epic combo and Greatstaff of Thunder or JBoW as my agro weapons, btw; and I very rarely have agro problems in any situation.<br />
<br />
I'll be augmenting my epics as soon as I get the points I need, because I am interested to see if it does help them.  I love using them, and if a stun aug makes them more reliable for agro, I will be thrilled and use them all the more.<br />
<br />
And delay?  Bullsh*t ... with max haste, the difference in delay between 24 and 19 is not enough to make any real difference in damage agro for warriors.  The biggest problem with using the epic for agro IMO is not the delay ... it's the proc being resisted more often than EB or TB is.  That is the one thing I petition almost daily about with the thoroughly blind hope of having it fixed or at least looked into better.   I feel sure it never will be, but I keep trying.<br />
<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">All i'm saying is that you're biased.   You're biased because you don't want to see all the hard work you did on that epic go to waste.  But the facts are simple.<br />
<br />
Aggro is partially dependant on DPS.  13/20 &gt; 14/24.  12/19 &gt; 14/24.<br />
<br />
Aggro is partially dependant on weapon speed.  20 and 19 are both faster than 24.<br />
<br />
Aggro is partially dependant on weapon procs.  A Force Shock or a Planar Stun that lands will aggro.  A force shock or planar stun that is resisted WILL aggro.  Rage of Vallon when it lands, will aggro.  Rage of vallon, when it doesn't land, WILL NOT aggro.<br />
<br />
The vast majoirity of all weapons proc 2 times per minute, this includes the copper hammer, the sword of the bloodsworn and the red epic.  Every time the droga weapons proc, they will generate aggro.  The epic is not guaranteed to produce an aggro generating proc (resists).<br />
'<br />
If you completely ignore logic, yes, one could assume that our &quot;Epic&quot; weapon is better, but it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You wouldn't happen to know what the delay difference with max haste is would you? Because it seems to me that with maxed haste red epic is more dps than bloodsworn and copper hammer? Don't get me wrong, you logic is okay, I guess. Maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">*boggle* If one weapon does 20% more melee damage without haste, it will do 20% more melee damage with haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Boogle nothing omg, isn't there a certain point at which weapon delay cannot go any lower? and do not most weapons have a chance to reach this with speed of vallon and a bard? So... with haste if the delays bottom out... red epic has more damage on it because 14&gt;13 and 14&gt;12 dur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Part of the idea that weapons cannot go lower than 10 delay (one second) is based on the fact that the log doesn't get more accurate than seconds.  Some people have noticed more attacks than they should be able to have  in one second tho (and no repostes)...so it might be possible but the log doesn't get more accurate than a 10 delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Boogle nothing omg, isn't there a certain point at which weapon delay cannot go any lower?<br />
<br />
They cannot go below 0 delay :) The 10 delay limit is a myth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">You wouldn't happen to know what the delay difference with max haste is would you? Because it seems to me that with maxed haste red epic is more dps than bloodsworn and copper hammer? Don't get me wrong, you logic is okay, I guess. Maybe. <br />
<br />
There is no low end delay cap.  If the haste cap is 100% haste (reasonable to assume since bards kinda modify the system anyway), then the delay on the epics is 12 and the delay on the other 2 is 10.  Either way, as Gimmel said, it makes no difference.  13/20 outdamages 14/24.  It will outdamage it with no haste, it will outdamage it with 21% haste, 36% haste, 50% haste, 100% haste, 125% haste and whatever else you want to haste yourself at.<br />
<br />
Edit -- Oh, and might wanna leave the attitude at home if you're not sure of your facts, dur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I love the epic! The stats are good. It's still one of the best looking weapons and a symbol of warrior pride. I put alot of work in it, and getting it was one of my happiest days in EQ. Right now i use BoC in mainhand and epic in offhand. The epic proc is great, it's almost like EB, and it really doesn't get resistsed as much as you'd expect on tier 3 stuff and big bosses. And since it's in offhand, i guess the slightly high delay doesn't make a really huge difference in DPS. There is absolutely no way i'd replace my epic in offhand with something other then a TB or EB weapon or GBoS, or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I thank you GSW, that's something I've noticed on my server a bit.

You said it, red epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Ever stop to think they're using it because of the reason that they put way too much work into it to bank it?<br />
<br />
Just because people use something doesn't make something else worse.<br />
<br />
If you want to use the epic....that's fine, there's nothing wrong with that.  However, it is inferior, in all ways, to both weapons from droga.  Don't kid yourself of that fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Isn't procs worked into dps? If so then doesn't the 100 dd (200 if you have ingenuity) make it better dps than bloodsworn with it's planar stun?</div></div><hr />

Bullsh*t ... with max haste, the difference in delay between 24 and 19 is not enough to make any real difference in damage agro for warriors. The biggest problem with using the epic for agro IMO is not the delay  It doesnt matter what the differnce in delay number is, a big increase in DPS is still a big increase whether you are slowed or max hasted. No matter how you slice it, the epic sucks for DPS. The problem is not that delay, its the suck ass ratio.<br />
<br />
Those warriors with -just- one Enraging blow weapon tend to use red epic in offhand. I don't see them rushing to Droga to get themselves an UBER DPS UBBER AGGRO weapon, I see them using what? You said it, red epic. Any warrior who refuses to upgrade thier epic is either lazy or stubborn due to the effort involved in getting it.<br />
<br />
My experience with SotB and CHoS have been exactly opposite of what you are claiming Omni and GSW. I have to bag mine all the time in favor on no proc weapons because its too easy to grab agro. I routinely get agro from a GBoS+red epic, BoC+red epic, and dual epics. I could have easily gotten my epic a couple of times now, but after consistently pulling agro off of epic weilders I sold the parts and bought some good upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your epic will not crit, so now that's out the window, and your haste thing, so what else you got?  This is turning into a very long way of saying what I said about 10 posts back....the Epic is inferior to the droga weapons.</div></div><hr />

get a fellow warrior in a group with you. get a monk to pull, so he has the aggro bonus, then FD. you weild something crappy, like, say a 6/24 weapon and a shield. get your bud to weild his windy. both have no procs. neither of you taunt or slam. the mob might ping pong a bit in the beginning, but he will lock on the one of you that is SWINGING MORE OFTEN period. <br />

I do not think you will see any difference using these as baselines for your &quot;argument&quot;.   Hell, you could probably hold agro with these mobs with SBoZ and Disembowler.  If your fighting a &quot;raid&quot; mob you probably are going 5-8 seconds alone and no one else is trying to get agro from you anyways.  I think this is a moot point honestly.  <br />
<br />
Now take the same weapons and go do an exp group grind in Tactics, BoT, Droga, HoH ... whatever ... werever ... somewere you need to have agro now so that nuker/slower can NOT get agro or there raped.  <br />
<br />
Take your favorite chain casting SCF3 enchanter to Nurga for faction and try to keep agro as shes chain nuking Dementia / Dementing Visions / Insanity / Largarn's Lamentation ... red epic aint going to do it.<br />
<br />
Droga weapons &gt; epics in an exp grind were the dps/proc will take effect immediately. <br />

Now, if what you posted is true, then how the hell do I constantly keep aggro with my Greatstaff of the Four Winds?  41 / 31, pathetic 75pt dd proc, thats it.  I keep aggro off of monks wielding the same thing and out dpsing me.  DPS is a huge part of aggro.  Sure, others out dps you, but I guess you've never heard of aggro modifiers based on your class.  And the difference between spell and melee aggro is huge.  Archery gives hardly any aggro.  Learn your shit before you come here and post, unless you like sounding like an dumbass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Hussar, can  you tell us where you learned about &quot;class based agro modifiers&quot; ?  I can't recall ever hearing about this, reading it from the developers or particularly noticing it in action.. and I've been playing since 1 month after release.   <br />
<br />
Could it be you hold agro over the monks with the same weapons because you use taunt and they use fd? Or you're benefitting from initial agro tagging off a fd monk?<br />
<br />
Just the facts please, where did this notion come from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">For proof they can and do use modifiers, look at bards.  Not only can they slow on inc with very low aggro, they can also proc multiple stuns with the GBoS with no issues of aggro, even at the beginning of the fight.  As for the monk example, most mobs I do not hit taunt once and they do not fd.  Usually a bard pulls to camp and doesn't fade, so tagging has nothing to do with it.  Both the monks and I engage at about the same time, sometimes them before.  All I said in both this and my last post were just the facts.  Believe it, don't, I don't give a shit, but it is rare for me to make a post without knowing wtf I'm talking about, and in this case I do.</div></div><hr />

You MTed a raid mob with this? very nice DPS, for sure. I'd have liked to have seen it. You should use this nice piece when you do the test i suggested. Your DPS will undoubtedly own. make sure all the other factors are in control, like initial aggro bonus, no taunting, proximity...<br />
<br />
I've seen Warriors try to MT with windys. I see mobs Ping-Pong all over when they do; half a raid wiped while the MT still stood.<br />
<br />
I freely admit that I could be wrong about it... but I have never seen anything that concretely disputes my conclusion. I've been out-DPSed non-stop by a monk weilding a 2 hander and never had to taunt, he never had to FD. I've been in situations where i needed to not have aggro and after drawing it on several fights, switched to 2 hander. was out-DPSed before and after i switched. didnt gain it again. <br />
<br />
My post began with &quot;did i miss something?&quot;. <br />
class-based aggro modifiers. wow, warriors just inherently get aggro. wish I'd known this all along. seems like an easy code fix if this is true. raise warriors' &quot;class based aggro modifier&quot; and drop everyone elses. I'll keep looking for more on this. <br />
<br />
and i still dont believe a warrior can keep aggro by &quot;out dpsing&quot; everyone. I dont see it happening. I'll stand by they need to hit more often. Of course, with everyone max hasted the rogue is gonna hit a little more often, but that is what evade is for. the monk makes his choice, 2 hander or FD a lot... actual parsed DPS is not a factor. <br />
o'course what do i know, im just an &quot;idiot&quot; who &quot;sound(s) like a dumbass&quot; and gets info from someone's ass, right? <br />
no, I get info from playing the game and finding what works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">You're wrong dude.<br />
<br />
You can indeed hold aggro thru DPS and taunt.  If your DPS isn't high enough, then you get the ping pong after you taunt..it goes right back to someone who's cranking out more than you are.  If it's competetive, then it is enough to hold you there after you're on top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, you don't have to outdps everyone on the raid.  Rogues evade, monks FD, and Rangers can do virtually unlimited damage with little fear of aggro because of how archery works at the moment....it's broken, SoE admited it at one time, so it's quite obviously the case.<br />
<br />
When your competetitors are controling their aggro thru the means that they have, they can out DPS you and you will still hold aggro.  Wizards concussion, Necros FD, Chanters can Boggle, mages suck....every person who is doing more DPS than you has a way to control their aggro so that they're not at the top of the hate list.  <br />
<br />
Did I personally tank things with a TSBS? No, but when 2h got revamped during velious and early luclin people were definitely using it to tank and they were using it successfully.  Times have changed and it's not hard to get an aggro proc on your weapons anymore...that doesn't change the fact that you could hold aggro with it if you wanted to.<br />
<br />
6/24's on the other hand...well those aren't gonna be holding aggro worth shit.  Test it and try it, since it's obvious you haven't by how sure of it you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Personal attacks go a long way to support your argument. More of these, IMO and dont mind any of that silly stuff, like examples, tests, parses etc. <br />
<br />
Btw, where were your parses?  I posted an example that I've experienced, you just posted a test that I bet you never even tried.  But don't worry, you don't need to do the things you think others need to do. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
this contradicts itself. <br />
<br />
Um, no it doesn't.  Rogues do more dps, but don't get as much aggro from it.  We do dps, and although it's less than the rogues, we get more aggro from it.<br />
<br />
As for a TSBS, many people have MT'd raids with it.  Though you conveniently ignored the fact that I constantly MT raids with a DPS weapon without aggro problems.<br />
<br />
You still seem to think that you have to out dps everyone to keep aggro with dps.  That is still false.  I don't out dps my guilds dps people, but I still keep aggro with a pure dps 2hander.<br />
<br />
no, I get info from playing the game and finding what works. <br />
<br />
All my info is from playing this game, and all this shit I've talked about is exactly how it works for me.  And it does work, pretty damn well in fact.<br />
<br />
Also, run your own test before you post it again.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ok, was more of an ass than required.  After so many arguments where people insist that what I use to hold aggro can't hold aggro, I've become fairly pissy about it.  You aren't entirely wrong actually, you do get some aggro for each hit, no matter the damage.  But there is a different amount for 2handers than there is for 1handers.  Was doing the named Vamp in Tenebrus for my loyalist shield quite a while back, and I held aggro with my staff even though he was immune to the damage.  But, the two piercers I had on me (that had the required bane and were fairly fast) couldn't hold aggro worth shit.  The aggro was shakey though, as compared to fairly good aggro when I am doing damage.  Also, people continue to laugh at the idea of the class based aggro modifier, but they always ignore the fact that it is exactly that which is used on bards.  It may not be used on other classes, especially not to that extent, but it does exist and is being used on at least one class.  If it isn't being used on warriors, then maybe there is another reason that I hold aggro fairly well with my pure dps 2hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Having played a monk to 61, as well as my warrior, I personally don't believe in class based agro modifers... other than the effect that higher skill caps and aa's have between classes.  Hussar has PB3, so he has good results using a 2h weapon. Fair enough.  <br />
<br />
The bard slow example is kind of irrelevant.. theres nothing that says bard slow and enchanter/shaman slow have to create the same agro.  Having a 65 enchanter and 65 cleric I've seen various amount of agro prescribed to any number of spells.  I think we should keep the discussion focused on mellee damage, not spell/song agro.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that procs aside, 1h weapons and 2h weapons have seperate &quot;agro tables&quot; for lack of a better term.  I think that agro is generated as you try to inflict POTENTIAL damage, not actual dps as landed.  I think the agro calculation takes place based upon rate of swings, dmg/delay and max damage you could potentially do but before the actual damage is calculated.  This would explain why I can flurry and miss but still pull agro like I hit taunt and why I can hold agro on mobs that require bane damage weapons even if my weapons arent bane.<br />
<br />
Feel free to scoff :)  I have no way of proving this theory either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Im pretty sure that taunt is based on the potential damage of your weapons.  being able to hold agro on a mob like emp with out doing any actual damage is pretty good evidence.  <br />
<br />
As for more swings making a difference my personal experience makes me think this is BS.  I remember being told this 2 years ago when I was about level 50 being instructed by uber level 55 warriors duel wielding lammys while tanking in Kael arena, but come on, we've learnt alot since then.<br />
<br />
In XP groups the agro from BBB was always more solid than from a BoC main hand 15+1/19 offhand, and there have been numerous occasions where I have nothing but misses for the first 15 seconds of the fight and the mob would stick to me despite this.  <br />
<br />
Its not something you can take 3 months of logs and parse to work out, so the only way to know for sure is to do specific tests and to be honest I'm not the kind of person who can be arsed with that though there are several posters here who do.  However in the absence of such tests I'm going to stick with what I have experienced and that for sure indicates that weapon delay is not more important than weapon ratio when it comes to the agro generated.<br />
<br />
Edit: I have to add that another thing I disagree with Klomck on is this:<br />
Personal attacks go a long way to support your argument. More of these, IMO and dont mind any of that silly stuff, like examples, tests, parses etc.<br />
<br />
If you disagree with him then go for it, tell us why he is wrong.  He is, so it needs to be said, but there is no need to call anyone stupid or an idiot, it just degrades the whole discussion.</div></div><hr />

- the crappy ratio<br />
- the crappy delay<br />
- the crappy resisted proc<br />
<br />
Makes them subpar weapons compared to what can easily<br />
be obtained for less effort, and give much better result.<br />
<br />
As for some other info :<br />
<br />
- Bard melee is gimp, give a bard BoC/SoD ands he still wont draw agro.<br />
Their dps is pathetic, they dont really taunt/kick/disarm.<br />
However that doesnt mean they cant keep agro if needed (twist 4 dots)<br />
As for slow/debuff etc etc, they lowered the agro of all bard songs.<br />
To prevent bardsplat on every single raid during a pull.<br />
<br />
- DPS is universally the best source of agro for any melee.<br />
(Since spells arent accounted for). Get a clue if you cant Ebay for one.<br />
<br />
A 110 dps warrior will keep agro off a 180 dps rogue ..<br />
Why ? Proximity/Taunt/Kick/Disarm vs Evade/Distance<br />
<br />
A 110 dps warrior will keep agro off a 220 dps wizard ..<br />
Why ? Proximity/Taunt/Kick/Disarm vs Concussion/Distance<br />
<br />
This is why all MT get a small head start, avatar/fero<br />
and everyone stays at max range.<br />
<br />
 Procs are not needed for tanking <br />
<br />
Where do procs come into play ? AGRO LOCK<br />
<br />
2 Fine Steel with 1000 agro procs would probably be good for tanking.<br />
However if you dont procs (luck) and if ur procs are not well<br />
spread over time (luck) your agro will be close to nothing.<br />
<br />
Get 2 20/20 weapons without proc. I'm willing to bet<br />
they will just own 2x 1000 Agro Fine Steel in agro Quality.<br />
<br />
I have a 48/32 (BoW) and end up MTing often.<br />
During many fights i've been able to keep agro (notice keep) and<br />
let DPS do their job with ZERO, ZERO procs.<br />
<br />
 PROCS help you to LOCK AGRO. DPS helps you keep it <br />
<br />
While the difference may seem subtile its actually immense.<br />
<br />
I'll trade 50/30 EB  for 65/30 any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Beeing able to say &quot;LOCKED BURN&quot; is indeed nice.<br />
But having 5 to 50 people just waiting for you to proc in order<br />
to do their job is not efficient.<br />
<br />
True sometimes you need that proc to save the day.<br />
<br />
But i prefer steady medium agro (which means everyone can adapt to me once and for all)<br />
To great Streaky agro (which means they have to pray i proc or go splat and cant do their job)</div></div><hr />

More swings over the same amount of time with the same weapons is just like having better haste... it most definitely DOES increase potential damage and agro.  Imho my agro holding ability soared with ferocity 3, ambidexterity and Raging Flurry 2 (working on rf3 atm)  It's so evident once you get higher levels of flurry and pulll agro when flurry fires without hitting taunt or getting a proc.</div></div><hr />

Truly i came here to find out one question instead of starting a new thread since we started on the same general subject.<br />
<br />
My question is simple:  If you augment the RED blade can you combine it back to the 2hs again?<br />
<br />
Take it a step further:  Can you augment RED only,  combine it with BLUE for the 2hs  and THEN still in theory AUGMENT the 2hs as well?<br />
<br />
I'm just truly curious if its even at all possible, my gut tells me once anyone augments the red blade thats it - it cannot be combined back and forth unless you remove the augment with a solvent.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no facts to go on either way... any help out there?</div></div><hr />
