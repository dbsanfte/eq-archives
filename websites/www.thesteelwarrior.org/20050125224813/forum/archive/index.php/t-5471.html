<br />
I know there are potions and some items with this effect on it that we can get, what is the easiest/most productive.  I priced out potions yesterday and found that they go for on my server about 3k for 10 dose.  I also looked at Allakhazam's and found 3 items with that effect on it, 2 of which do not drop anymore.<br />
<br />
What are your solutions to this problem?<br />
<br />
P.S.  Pls post links to anything you can that might be helpfull thx :)</div></div><hr />

I typically buy for around 2800pp, once I use 9 of the 10 charges, I sell to an npc for 1800ish. So you only really pay 111pp per gate for those 9 gates. Just something to keep in mind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman can make potions that send you to the succor point  of various newbie zones (Field of Bone, Everfrost, Feerott, Innothule and Nektulos, I believe).  The component parts to making this potion are considerably lower than making the &quot;gate&quot; potions, and the savings is generally passed on to the consumer.  <br />
<br />
Thurg gate potions are a good option for those who are on OK terms with the coldain.<br />
<br />
If you are not KoS in the Outpost in the Overthere, do the &quot;hand in berserker tails&quot; quest ad nauseum.  Once your faction is high enough, you can get the Overthere Hammer, which procs a gate to the Overthere (near the PoK book, that's handy).  <br />
<br />
There is a quest in PoK for a necklace with gate.  All of the pieces for the first stage of the necklace can be gathered in Tier 1 PoP.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure if they still drop, but gloves with a &quot;gate to nexus&quot; clicky effect are one of the possible rewards for the &quot;escort the gnome&quot; event in Cazic Thule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He drops a potion with &quot;Overthere&quot; on it (same effect as the Worker Sledgemallet but accessible to people without good Venril Sathir faction).  This potion is lore and no drop and has one charge.  The main benefit is that it's instant-cast.<br />
<br />
The potion appears to be part of a quest which is either broken or at least not solved as yet.<br />
<br />
NB:  While you're in Chardok looking for useful clickies, it's worth killing Gravemaster Zo`Lun - another rare spawn - who has a chance to drop an item with clickie Summon Corpse.</div></div><hr />

Only then, grasshopper, will you be albe to properly curse gate.<br />

You don't really need faction to get it, but it takes a lot more work if you don't have it.  I personally got mine while max kos to the faction.  Have to get a hold of Puppet Strings, either by buying or killing golems in Fear for it.  If you go alone, there is a good chance it will be resisted at least once.  Using a bard for HoS, a shammy for Malosini, and a tash proc, my guild has gotten quite a few hammers with no resists at all.  Just turn in one jade while you have him charmed, and now you have a proc hammer =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, getting a 10 dose gate potion is definately worth it. I'd rather spend 3~k PP a month to make sure if it hits the fan or I'm stuck in a zone with no safe way out, that I can get out. <br />
<br />
Spending PP &gt; Getting stuck in zone and spending hours on corpse runs/paying out the ass for corpse summons and rezzes later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-01-2004, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, something else I forgot.  The main reason I don't like potions with the effect &quot;Gate&quot; is that there is a chance that your gate can collapse, just like with the actual spell for casters and it does use a charge when that happens, unless things have changed within the past while.  The ones that are a gate to a place other than your bind point don't have that issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fyi, to make a 10 dose gate to bind potions it costs approx. 2550PP assuming no failures, so 3k is a reasonably fair price. Costs alot less to make the newb zone gate potions. Thurg is good for emergencies as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of other ideas/random thoughts:<br />
<br />
1. The &quot;follow the gnomer&quot; in CT maze can drop gate gloves...rare drop though<br />
<br />
2. The OT hammer...if you can't get puppet strings but DO have a VP key you can fairly quickly raise OT faction (at least that was the way it used to be) by killing there.<br />
<br />
3. The pop talisman quest isn't that hard (until the last leg) if you have a guild is fairly well progressed into PoP</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't have the time for the Thurg potion quest, you may wish to check with your guild shaman.  Most are usually willing to make it for you if you buy the components to make it.  May be a cheaper alternative?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bought a 10 dose gate potion and have had a gate collapse first shot both times I went to use it. Basically I have used up 4 swigs for 1200pp and got 2 actual ports. I sent a feedback on this. It really sucks to have it happen so much. I'm batting 500 right now with it.</div></div><hr />

Easy camp in front of CT in ferrott (facing in, mob pops at the top of the pyramid directly right of the ramp up) for the cazic cenobite, drops a lizard blood potion.  Instant cast, gates you to the CT wizzie platform tho.  Emergency GTHO (get the hell out) use.<br />

The rest is just too much of a pain in the ass unless you have an overthere hammer.<br />
<br />
Regular gate potions take an extra 80pp herb per dose...80pp for a 1 zone run?  No thanks, drop me off in Everfrost, I'll hit the book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You simply use 9 charges of the potion and then sell the last charge to a vendor with max vendor cha and recive 1904 pp for it,If you have a shaman make them for you they cost around 2600 pp so your getting 9 shots of gate for 700 pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, well then that's a fuckin bug.  I wouldn't come to rely on that.  Expect that to be corrected soon.  <br />
<br />
You shouldn't be paying 700pp for almost 2500pp in herbs.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't be doing it now, because it's obviously the best thing to be doing, but it will eventually be fixed, especially since SoE is very mindful of tradeskill combines that produce money.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, but it shouldn't.  It should sell for under 250pp per charge left on the potion, not 1900 no matter what.  That's making money because you're getting uses of a gate potion for free essentially.  They did not intend to have melees gate for 50pp a shot, I guarantee it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed it is but it has been around since gate potions have been available and for some reason it has never been fixed,Afaik its pretty common knowledge to.I guess since the shaman making them is making them ins't losing money and the purchaser is still lsoing a certain amount it isn't seen as a huge deal.I dunno or maybe SoE jsut has their heads that far up their asses that somethign so obvious as this has managed to slip by them since the release of LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sell back on the shaman potions is the same bug with all potions. NPC merchant will pay same price for a 10 dose potion if it has 10 doses left or it has one left. And its not like its a bug that can be used to Gain plat. It still costs more to make then the sellback and thats without any failures. The shaman with maxxed alchemy skill still averages about 1 failure in 20 combines at 252 plat lost per failure.</div></div><hr />
