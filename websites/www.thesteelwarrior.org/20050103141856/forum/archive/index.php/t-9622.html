<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i've read the 10 chapters of lore on the EQ2 site. The moon explodes, blah blah, there's a big war, and so on. But what in the world happens to Faydwer, Kunark, and Velious continents? And why do all the races decide to suddenly live in 2 places? I think i understand what's happened so far but i have no clue what brings the world down to 2 cities and 1 continent. Lore-wise, not money/future expansion-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">afaik there are lots more than two cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...countries? So far from what i've seen on the site it looks like 2 cities divided into districts or someit o.O</div></div><hr />

1. EQ2 dev are lazier than original EQ 's one thus they don't want do deal with travels (no continents thus no boats, no moon thus no teleportation).<br />
2. when luclin explodes it creates huricanes that destroy all the lesser islands and continents.<br />
3. when luclin explodes it falls on Norrath. Unlickyly it actually falls on Faydwer, Kunark, Velius and Telanosa (you forgot this one).<br />
4. In the futur expensions (or maybe already in OoW) Druzzil is either destroyed or Imprisonned (maybe that Mata Muram is the beginning of Trakanon's prophcy about Gods' war) thus Major gods are truly destroyed in PoTime and Zeb is successfully freed. The gods' war could then face Kerafin to the lesser gods destroying everything under gods control : Faydwer (Tunare), Kunart (Cazic), Velius (Velius), Luclin (Luclin), and Telasonna (?) ; but then I wonder why Antonica didn't  sink pieces by pieces (plan of Karanna, Inni's swanp, ...).<br />
<br />
All in all I don't care much of EQ's lore since Luclin (never liked this space advanture).</div></div><hr />

Here is a nice site with EQ2 Lore, it's WAY down at the bottom, but it's quiet complete.  It's called &quot;The Shattering&quot;<br />
<br />
http://clanwhitestorm.com/eq2lore/<br />
<br />
I do like how they started the EQ2 Lore<br />
 &quot;Then 500 years passed, with history unknown.  And then... The Shattering... &quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, and the cryptic version from SOE themselves ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everything hasn't been revealed yet AFAIK. SOE seems to be using the mysterious past to make the world seem more magical. (Jedi were cool until you read, if you read the extended universe, or heard in the new movies that midiclorians are responsible for &quot;The Force&quot;.) Its a old story telling trick that is surprisingly effective, even if you realize that it is being used. I've been impressed with the lore released so far. Its enough to let you have a general idea of what went on without really telling you anything specific.<br />
<br />
I think I remeber reading somewhere that new lore and contients will be released as players unlock them. take it with a grain of salt though, as I follow a bunch of MMO lore, so it could be another game. I am pretty sure that some zones won't be open in EQ2 until a player discovers them, at which time then other players can travel there. i can't seem to recall any specifics though.<br />
<br />
I think I've read that FAQ before, but its been a while, I'll have to dig through it again. I'll repost if I find anything. BTW the CWS page is very good for official quotes on EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bullix</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what i have Plaied on Beta  or heard on Beta is  alot more  Lore is in the game  but you have to do Quests to Learn more about it or some quets just tell you about it and  some of them ask for your  help to find out more about the lore.  Like Naggy  she  has a Big story tell all about her and others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Naggy was the guy and Vox was the girl? o.O<br />
But anyway, that's cool i guess. Same thing FFXI had -  you discover everything through missions. I was just worried that it might be EQ1 style...buncha messed up nonsense &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bullix</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about naggy or Vox been 3 years  sence EQ and why i don't remimber i have no  clue<br />
I Plaied EQ for 3 years before i couldn't take  the Nerfs and they just keep adding more and more  stuff every 3 month i had to Buy a upgrade for 49.95.<br />
<br />
been Tanking  on other games  0<br />
 CoH Invin Tank  those are the Boom to bad that game has nothing to it but kill kill kill  the missions  you don't even really find ot crap[ no contect to the game really it to bad also it has great  Game play .<br />
<br />
So Hopeing EQ2  will  have  what  i want</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh you havent done any research on Jupiter or Saturn's moons then :p<br />
Im pretty sure its Io (Jupiter) that has the active volcanoes...think there are more too...moons are very interesting if you think about it, especially the fact that there might be life on Europa (Saturn).  Europa is basically a giant ocean with a surface composed of a miles-thick layer of ice...below it there is speculated to be an ocean, and near the core of the moon where it will be warm or hot, life that can withstand the intense pressure and heat could exist.  Maybe even some life forms a bit closer to the surface then right near the core because the farther up you go, the less pressure but also the colder it gets...all very interesting stuff to me, but then again i want to be an astrophysicist.<br />
<br />
what were we talking about now?  oh yea Eq2 lore.  i just heard from someone that the whole planet was being torn apart or something or there was this big event somewhere that all the races had to move to freeport and qeynos.  at least thats what i heard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep!, Moons follow the same rules as any other massive bodies in space. Physics doesn't distinguish between a planet, sun, or moon, They all follow the same laws. The only reason they are called moons is because they are in stable orbit around another planet. If they orbited the sun, their primary orbit was centered near the sun then they would be called planets. Pluto is smaller than many of the larger planets moons.<br />
<br />
Not that any of those concepts even necessarily apply in a fanasy setting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor Gnawbones</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could it be possible that Luclin controlled the waters, pretty much like our Moon does.  With the tides rising and falling.  Thus with it all blown to hell (blame the gnomes) the water began to rise, and it engulfed all the other continents.<br />
<br />
Better have your swimming skill at (200)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a way to destroy a moon is to decrease its speed it. doing so it will get closer to the planet thus incresing the tide forces.  repeating this process the moon will cross a threshold after which tide forces are greater than structural cohesion forces thus the moon's shape will get from a spheroide to an ellipsoide. and then the moon torns  appart into a pack of  asteroids. some of the asteroids will fall down but some can get a new equilibium and rotates around the planet again but at a much lesser altitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jupiter's moon Io is almost at its Roche limit, that is what causes it to be so volcanically active.  If you were to set off, say, a 10 million megaton nuke (Do it on the 4Th of July) directly in front of Io as it orbits Jupiter, you could possibly slow it enough so that its orbit crossed the Roche limit and the tidal forces from Jupiter will then tear Io apart.  This would not, however, just result in a nice little bunch of asteroids orbiting Jupiter in a clump.  Due to collisions between the debris and the slightly different orbits of the big pieces, there would be a lot of debris ejected into the rest of the solar system (very bad for us on Earth) and a lot would also fall into Jupiter.  There would also probably be a large ring formed after a few hundred years from what did remain in orbit around Jupiter.</div></div><hr />

Haven't read all of lore so may be some repeating.<br />
<br />
From a Troll - The swamps boiled killing all in it (Frogloks?)<br />
<br />
Gnome - Believes all the ice has melted because the Ocean has risen.<br />
<br />
Cats on Eurodites - Mist came down and covered island.  Thought all were dead until the Eurodites emerged changed.  Nothing revealed about Mist or what happened while it covered Odus.  Evil and good Eurodites joined forces for some mysterious reason but built some place of power under the city that the cats tried to sabotage.  Then the Mist came and new looking eurodite.<br />
<br />
Human on Rotanga - Appeared in small numbers at first, but once Lucan recognized thier race they appeared everywhere.  They appeared shortly after the cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Dark Elf on Neriak - Halfing (Yes Halfling) invaded Neriak and kicked DE Butt (Stop Laughing) then the foriegn sector collapsed cuting off access to neriak (Would a Dark Elf lie about losing to halflings?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats all I know from the freeport side.</div></div><hr />

which is where the current theories about saturn and uranus' (i think it uranus, might be neptune though...need to brush up on my planetary properties a bit hehe) rings.  The rings are possibly remains of moons that were ripped apart, or material that was left over from forming the solar system and did not become moons or planets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well its OBVIOUS that Will-E-coyote (super genius) filled the moon with TnT and then a train ran into it...hence the &quot;explosion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, Brutul its obvious you were wrong about &quot;global warming&quot;...the gnome sausage factories in Akanon caused a build up of greehouse gasses melting Velious and submerging most of the known world.<br />
<br />
Love the game and its fun to see the decimated moon greet you everywhere. Reminds me of the cartoon &quot;the tick&quot; with the begining of the word &quot;chai...&quot; carved into the moon.</div></div><hr />

Something about rings and uranus in the same sentance dont mix :)</div></div><hr />

wait i think i remember hearing about that, they discovered a few small faint ones on the last remote flyby a couple of years ago.  id like to see a link to see if i remembered correctly lol</div></div><hr />
