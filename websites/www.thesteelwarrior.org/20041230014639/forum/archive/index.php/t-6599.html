<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two questions here...<br />
<br />
1) Our Incite line. Lucy lists incite as: <br />
1:  Increase Hate by 398 (L63) to 400 (L65) <br />
2:  Increase Modify Hate by 68 (L63) to 70 (L65) <br />
<br />
1 is simple. 2 is what I have a question about. Does that give that amount of hate every tick or what?<br />
<br />
2) When I checked warrior &quot;spells&quot; on Lucy I got a huge list back with tons of things I had never seen. Examples)<br />
<br />
Slice   <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Skill Attack(6) <br />
2:  Increase Hate by 225 <br />
 <br />
Power Slam     <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Stun(4.00 sec/65) <br />
<br />
And a lot of others. All of these were verified Live as of 3/30. Wtf are these skills?</div></div><hr />

And Incite gives a boost of hate at first then adds hate per tick afterward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">04-08-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it being verified live 9 days ago is a lie?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.<br />
<br />
That means the info was verified to exist in whatever files contain that information. However, atm they are not in use in the active game.<br />
<br />
It's still just a guess whether they'll get used in the future in some way...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that they just never removed the &quot;spells&quot; from the file they get them from (sp.dat?)<br />
<br />
<br />
They are currently not in the game.</div></div><hr />
