<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doraar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok need you guys to take a look at my magelo profile. I want my ac to be up to 1000 but it's only 987. What could I do to get it up to 1000, you know like upgrades etc. Any input is appreciated. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get a 2nd Silver Chitin Wristband, get a Clattering Bone Necklace, get a Crystal Spider Eyes, get some Forged Shoulderpads. <br />
<br />
Nodrop stuff I'd go to UP and farm some Moktor stuff if you're interested in better ac...not great for hps, but the ac is fairly high. The guants and the boots would be especially beneficial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what your budget is like, but here goes:<br />
<br />
Earring: Replace Wolf Fang Earring with Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
<br />
Bracer: Replace Bracelet of Might to Silver Chitin Wristband<br />
<br />
Neck: Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
<br />
Arms: Underfoot Platemail Vambraces<br />
<br />
Feet: Steelslave Bladed Boots<br />
<br />
That should easily make you cross the 1k mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Axterix EnObelix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cheapest way is to ding a few times, get some more defense skill.<br />
<br />
Although I'd aim quite a bit higher than 1k;)<br />
<br />
Bracer of Might, your boots, and your neck seem to be the weakest AC spots you have.  Some brellium/underfoot should give you nice increases in AC and hp there.  The amulet of mummy wrappings for a neck item is another option.  12 ac, 3 sta, 45 hp on it.<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest brellium for gloves, arms, and mask.  All offer more AC and should boost up your hp more as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, you coul re-roll as a iksar shaman....<br />
<br />
My newly named main char:  Iksar Shaman (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=758124) <br />
<br />
Joking aside, my necklace, back, and mask are quite a bit higher AC than yours, and perhaps a few other pieces as well...take a look, most is /bazaar stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Doraar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for your help will look into the stuff that you guys posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, you are getting zero AC from your neck, mith torque is ac 15, and generally pretty cheap.  Also, cobalt arms or boots aren't too expensive.  Blood runed greaves are ac 39, they're pretty uncommon, but should go for around 5k or so these days.  Horn of Hsagra in offhand rocks, it's AC 35, plus 10 sta and 75 hp.</div></div><hr />
