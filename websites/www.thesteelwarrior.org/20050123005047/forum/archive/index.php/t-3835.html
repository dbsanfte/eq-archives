<br />
At level 34 there really aren't many immediate options as far as upgrades.  When is a warrior able to Quest for his next set of armor? and what is the average progression through the sets avaliable?<br />
<br />
Many have similar stats yet opposin factions to obtain.  Do I mix and match from this point on and dance around with my faction? or are there certain sets i should aim for at certain ages?  <br />
<br />
So far I plan on aiming for full sets of Cobalt, then later Skyshrine armor.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a set of warrior only armor quested through the Twilight Sea in Luclin. It's called Soldier's Armor. The quest pieces are all tradable but many pieces are annoyingly hard to get due to the spawn cycles of certain Luclin mobs.<br />
<br />
The armor is roughly equivalent to Crafted, except it probably has a few more HPs due to having more warrior centric stats (read= STA) overall than Crafted.<br />
<br />
A lot of warriors do not deem this armor worth the effort because many of the mobs are hard to find, and hard to kill at the levels you would be running around in Crafted.<br />
<br />
The next step up would be Champion's Armor, given through the dwarves in Thurgadin after you collect gems in Velious and corroded armor drops in Kael Drakkel.<br />
<br />
Then Skyshrine armor quests.<br />
<br />
Then Kael Armor quests.<br />
<br />
Then Ornate.<br />
<br />
Then Elemental.<br />
<br />
This only refers to warrioir &quot;quested&quot; armors.<br />
<br />
ALSO consider that there are levels of PURCHASABLE armors from the Adventure Merchants, and the 760 point armor pieces are quite good when compared to Velious quested armors.<br />
<br />
And also consider that there are sets of diety specific plate mail armors that tradeskillers make, if you're looking to get armor upgrades and/or collect armor sets.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;and what is the average progression through the sets avaliable?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's a lot of stats to write about. Your best bet would be to compare them on a site, like Allakhazam, where you can get all that stats in front of you at once.<br />
<br />
But I think there may be some websites out there that compare the warrior velious armors (I remember seeing them ages ago). Maybe someone else will have a link for you.</div></div><hr />

It mostly comes from killing fairly low level dragons in skyshrine.  Pieces drop randomly off of the Golem like guards in skyshrine.<br />
<br />
You might also check out the Ry'gor armor set.  It drops from Ry'gor orcs in Eastern Wastes and might be better than crafted in a few slots.  Really though there isnt a hard and fast progression of going from set A -&gt; set B -&gt; set C -&gt; set D of armor.  Just check the bazaar and stuff for items that are upgrades for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the path of least resistance is to get a few levels and start kael mini-raids. the arena is good for all armor quest drops and great exp at your level. the armor drops are relatively slow. at some point, you can also do the manor house in kael. you trigger a little ring and plate drops at a high percentage. farm the quest gems in SG and in velks. all good progression at this point.  grab your friends, schedule a weekly min-raid, lots of fun for the whole family. <br />
<br />
alternatively, you have the option to get cultural smithed armor. this is race/deity dependant so I suggest a little research on eq traders for stats and components. to pursue this path, you will want to farm the components and find a friendly smith who is willing to make the armor. this stuff is trivial &gt; 250 skill so you really want a GM smith. Some smiths who are skilling up &gt; 218 &lt;250 will do free combines if you provide the materials. remember that there will be a high failure rate. find a smith chat with them work something out. Regardless of deity, bracers are probably the most worthwhile acquisition and also the cheapest to make from the smithing perspective.<br />

i wouldnt set my sights way beyond thurg quest just yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a Barbarian warrior following Ralos Zek for he who asked.<br />
<br />
I've got a comparison list for the armors (except elemental) but quests can sometimes sound much easier on paper and be very impractical once attempted.<br />
<br />
While I do use the bazaar for filler peices, i.e. chitin breastplate until i can get that infernal werewolf talon from mistmoore, my cashflow is nothing more than 30-40 pp each outing, so theres a real limit to what i can afford. Similarly i've only gotten 10pts in LDoN so far and it seems until i age a bit i wont be accumulating points fast enough to really set a goal on the higher point items.<br />
<br />
I'll look into the Ry'gorr armor since I've been leading raids into Eastern wastes for ulthork tusks and i'll be near the orcs anyway. <br />
<br />
Lots of good information folks, I thank ye.<br />
<br />
I'll try when i can for Thugadin with Cobalt fillers for the boots, greaves and one bracer. Then i'll keep skyshrine in mind for later in life.<br />
<br />
Does anyone by chance know where I can find information on the Elemental armors? I hardly hear those mentioned anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisthar</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is because the elemental armor drops in a place that not many guilds in the game are even flaged to go to. You will also need to be 55+ to even try to get there I think. I myself doubt I will ever get to see anything like that and am very glad Ornate sells in the bazaar as that is my upgrade really for where I am at now.</div></div><hr />
