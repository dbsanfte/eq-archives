<br />
I asked Kytherea what the status was of the shield review that SoE was going to do with adding blocking to shields, this was the reply I got:<br />
<br />
The information I received...<br />
<br />
&quot;This was idea from long ago that we never really finalized. Shields do help more than most players realize - they increase your AC cap directly - but this is still a possibility. Various other game and class balance issues have and continue to take precedence over this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ky<br />
<br />
So, adding a shield directly raises the player's AC cap.<br />
<br />
What's interesting about that... hybrids could possibly have a higher AC softcap than warriors when using 1h +shield, because warriors almost NEVER use shields.<br />
<br />
Not that that really matters much, for a variety of reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slein Jinn</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) She said cap, not softcap - going on that and what I've observed of her posts in the past, I doubt she was referring to anything beyond the player's AC.  Parses have shown that shields give no benefit beyond their AC.  <br />
<br />
2) With the way the &quot;softcap&quot; on AC worked (I say worked because it's basically non-existant in current content), a shield raising the softcap is simply impractical and improbable.  Mob damage is calculated based on mob atk vs player AC - when AC reaches a certain point versus mob atk (we can't determine that point since we do not know mob atk values) it becomes less valuable, almost certainly due to the nature of the formula used.  <br />
<br />
3) Alot of warriors use shields at the high-end, and very few knights do at the low end.</div></div><hr />
