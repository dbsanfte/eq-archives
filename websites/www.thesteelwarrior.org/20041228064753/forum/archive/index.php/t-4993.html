Having Most DKP by 30 points than anyone else in guild i can afford to be picky. Ive already passed on Reax's Gaunts smoke ring last night until i nail down what haste i want to end up with.  I know of the haste bracer in poE and the haste ring....what are the drop rates of these and which would better me in the long run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomercy</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After looking up wrists and ring slots in the future i think PoE bracer is best bet. Close to Reax's and not mush better out there as far as wrists go whereas i see many rings that just own the Avatar of mist ring. Any feedback on being right or wrong about this would be nice please.</div></div><hr />

 Pretty common/important topic. Maybe should get some library love or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have preferred a Bracer of Earthen Energy, but I went with the haste ring from Plane of Air. AC is hard to come by in the finger slot so no big loss, and it was a 55 hp upgrade in that slot and 30 in another when I switched to a Crinose Cape of the Werewolf on my back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earth bracer is pretty common. Solid choice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe haste ring is more common since they fixed isle 2 but air wears out real fast, i wouldnt count on getting one. only real options are earthen bracer and flowing moss mantle.<br />
<br />
it wasnt worth it to me at least to upgrade my haste bracer from dozekar. GoDs arent that bad of an item, i wouldnt spend huge DKP to upgrade them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brohm</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a similar situation. I am still using the Dozekar cloak for haste and am debating on when and what to upgrade to. I have two Raex Bracers and I doubt we will do Air again anytime soon so its basically FMM, Corinav's Belt, or wait till I can get something in Time. I am leaning towards just waiting.<br />
<br />
How common are the Haste items in time? <br />

<br />
Cap of Flowing Time<br />
Coif of Flowing Time<br />
Helm of Flowing Time<br />
Earring of Corporeal Essense<br />
Shroud of Survival<br />
Cord of Temporal Weavings<br />
Silver Hoop of Speed ( overhaste )<br />
<br />
Thats a lot of options there, if your close, just wait till time honestly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raex Gauntlets are a massive upgrade from your current gaunts.  I think in your place my decision would depend on how much longer I thought we'd be in EPs before moving to time.  If you just broke into EPs, hold out for the bracer.  It's the nicest of the EP haste items IMO.  If you've been there for awhile and aren't doing the mud ring very much, grab the first 41% EP haste you can get, whether it's the mantle or the ring or whatever.  The upgrade to Raex is worth it.<br />
<br />
I took a BP of Speed in VT in order to avoid exactly the problem you're facing right now.  I didn't want to have to worry about speed until I get my Raex BP, and it seems like half the items in time have that cheesy 40% haste/+ ATK effect so when you hit time haste is pretty much a non issue anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's from Mist, fixing Smoke didn't change how often the haste ring drops. Puremetal Band (the caster ear/finger), on the other hand, became much easier to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HamkChai</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">personally i would not suggest FMM. the shoulder from mist ring bird (warrior only one) is much better, if not the best pre-Time.<br />
<br />
earth bracer is a good choice to go, if ur guild is light on knight classes, as, imho, it would be better for them for the focus effect.<br />
<br />
mm belt is fairly low on AC, and a bit low on HP compared to EP drops. leave them for rangers. :p<br />
<br />
air haste ring is the best choice out of these 4. just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, you should go with the Flowing Moss Mantle. Decent stats (not great, but decent) on it, and you can keep your haste in your shoulder item in time, by getting a Shroud of Survival, which is a pretty good stats item in addition to being a haste item. In my experience, changing haste slots is a pain in the butt, and should be avoided if at all possible... FMM/Shroud of Survival is one of the only options for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hit up the haste Ring and I have much &lt;3333 for it. Granted, its got shit for AC, but it will hold off for you untill time no prob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gromlok</div><div class="date">01-03-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I echo the previous statements.  The ring from PoAir may be better but Air sucks.  The bracer from PoE is much easier to obtain and you don't lose much by using the wrist slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shardonis</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest going for the PoE Bracer from the mud ring. In all honesty it is probably the best set of haste items you will find in the game until you hit Time.  Once you are in time Haste items seem to drop like candy, and you have a very good and wide range of choices as to what you may upgrade to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree haste bracer is what i went with, common for us nice stats and AC</div></div><hr />
