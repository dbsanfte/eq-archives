Oh and blizzard, get stuffed about taking down my firewall for your patch conviniance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
last time it got a LOT better after 5 CST when more folks were taking part in the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If its anything but hardware related some programmers need to get to work ;)<br />
<br />
or... ask the fanbois to code something up /shrug god knows theres enough addicted cs majors that would code for free just to play another 6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">recurse</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another gritch I have is that the patcher they use.. <br />
<br />
Under the hood of the patcher is bittorrent. <br />
<br />
So for a example request:<br />
Your machine -&gt; bliz tracker(s) tell you to goto -&gt; peer machines<br />
<br />
Why this sucks for example:<br />
Your machine + Other machines behind the same firewall -&gt; bliz tracker (s) -&gt; outside world peers<br />
<br />
You don't get routed to the peers that would be the lowest latency, ie the ones behind your firewall. I don't know if this is a function of the machineIds they use, but it seems all the ones on my local nat'd network are all showing up with the same id. I can imagine this problem exists for larger isp's also.</div></div><hr />

If you look, you can find places to dl the patch.<br />
<br />
Just gotta be careful of what you dl so it's not a virus, or altered in anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it downloads an actual patch file.  What I usually did was download it on one computer, so that one was the only one that was held up for a while.  Then I brought it over to other computers so they wouldn't have to download it.  Especially useful in networks.  It's the only saving grace I've found with their system, being able to simply copy the patch file after downloading it.  EQ may have actual servers to download from FTP/HTTP, but you can't just bring a patch file over to other computers as it downloads each file changed.<br />
<br />
I kinda prefer the SOE method, but I'm glad Blizzard allows you to copy the patch file itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mine took all friggin night.  Got home from work around 6:00 and the download didn't even finish until 11:30.  Then it had to install.  I don't know what the point of the port forwarding was, because the only port that seemed to be coming across was 3427 (or whatever that number was)  None of the other ports seemed to show up.  Since my cable modem doesn't seem to have a problem with any other aspect of downloading on the web, it only leads me to believe that something is fluxxed up with Blizzards d/ler.  Oh well.  Maybe I'll be able to play tonight.</div></div><hr />

If you think it's taking to long turn on port forwarding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a guide on the blizzard forums some where. When I patched I clicked on the help link and found the guide. I only know how to do it for a router though.<br />
<br />
Router:<br />
1) Make is so your PC gets the same IP address from your router. Most routers you can reserve an address for a mac address.<br />
2) Find the port forwarding option for your router ( this is all in the configuraiton menu, probably connected through an internet browers ) and set the ports that blizzard specifies to be forwarded to the IP address that you reserved for your PC. <br />
<br />
That's it. These are pretty simplistic instructions but there is a full guide for lots of different specific routers and firewall options on the blizzard support site.</div></div><hr />
