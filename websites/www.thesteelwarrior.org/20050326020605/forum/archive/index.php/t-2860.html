<br />
If those are too easy, move upstairs to the east tower (the one with warrior, cleric, and a few other trainers) and do the Centurions.  Shammy should be able to slow them because they don't have a high MR but they do summon.   They're level 52-54 with 12 minute respawn timers.  They drop VC armor and weapons that sells for like 4-7 pp each as well as dropping 2-9 plat / kill.  They don't run.  They're melee so there's no spells or healing or anything you have to worry about.  <br />
<br />
Myself (65 warrior) and 53 shammy duo'd there and we could do 6 Centurions before the first would respawn.  (the 2 guarding the door, 2 inside, and 2 by the steps).  I'm pretty sure you 2 could do just the 2 inside and leave the other 4 alone.  You can sell the stuff in the building across the street, and the bank is just down below.  There are faction hits but very minimal.  I went in Katta as amiable, killed for about 6 hours and left as indifferent.  Shammy was dubious and still is dubious.</div></div><hr />
