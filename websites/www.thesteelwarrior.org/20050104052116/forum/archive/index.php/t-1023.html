I can get about 5k in a short amount of time and would like some suggestions based on my current gear as to what I should replace.<br />
<br />
my profile is &gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=562832<br />

Any other suggestions or comments on gear are appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not worth it to be honest with you. Dex has little influence on procs. Something like increasing your proc rate by maybe 5% with an extra 100 dex. Just keep piling on hp/ac :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree, the effect of DEX on procs is not very substantial. And if you are soloing and can not rely on shaman's buffs, even then, HP / AC will server you much better.<br />
<br />
The frquency of procs seems really down to the type of proc or the unique weapon that holds the proc.<br />
<br />
For example.. Frostbringer procs a lot, even with my crappy base 107 dex. Ykeshas proc a little less, and some weapons just dont proc much.<br />
<br />
After you get a shamman buff and your DEX is over 160 or so, the difference in terms of 'proccage' is hardly noticable.<br />
<br />
That said, if you want to boost your Dex a little and do a good upgrade you could buy a Cloak of Maestrom which has 10 DEX on it and some very nice HP as well, since you already have a low AC back item, it won't hurt your current AC It sells around 3k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PS: also loose those crusty legs and buy the Enchanted Dwarven GReaves. You will get rid of the neg 4 Dex , and will loose 8 sta but gain some much needed AC. Just my 2 coppers ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skullreaper Zek</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proc rates do vary from weap to weap, but higher Dex is not a waste at all. I noticed a difference of 1 to 2 procs per engagement with Wavecrasher before and after Shammy buffs. Of course primary concern is HP, AC, STA, STR.<br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
Cloak of Maelstrom (+10 Dex, 55HPs)<br />
Seawind Necklace (+15 Dex, Resists)<br />
Mushroom Veil (+12 Dex)<br />
Runebranded Girdle (+8 Dex, 27% Haste)<br />
Belt of the Great Turtle (+10 Dex, AoB)<br />
Justice Fruit Pie (+15 Dex)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree with dex being underestimated. I seem to notice a huge difference in procs with dex maxxed (~275 atm) then when its mid 100's.<br />
<br />
Being a warrior though, I'd never buy gear specifically for dex. Go HP/Sta/Ac as the stats sought for each item. You really want to ensure that once you hit 60+ your sta is maxxed, your HP items are good, and your ac is 1300+. When you have focus etc. you'll find you dex will be suffice. Don't forget, illusions also add dex (scare crow being my fave)<br />
