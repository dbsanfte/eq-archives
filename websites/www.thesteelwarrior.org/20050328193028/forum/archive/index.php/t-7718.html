Same raid force as the first time ect.  The lowest we got her in about 5 minutes was 97% and she ticked back to 100% immediately.  She mitigated most melee.  She is basically in the unkillable state she was when god came out.  Has anyone else had this experience since last patch?</div></div><hr />

We were able to reduce her hps but very very slowly.</div></div><hr />

Got her to 87% with 50.<br />
Never bothered again<br />
<br />
Ps : Localised server so our patching times are different.<br />
But she is back to a badass version.</div></div><hr />

The fight is all about DPS really.  Nothing special to it.  If your combined DPS barely beats her regen then it's going to appear nearly impossible.  We had about 45 people, only one rogue, so it's not like we had any special setup for her.  Just make sure every melee has some kind of decent piercer if you can't use H2H (all but two classes).  If your people are really lazy make some of those 16/20 piercers smithing daggers from GoD and get some Velium Lances for the Knights.  With the 30% bonus on piercing weapons 16/20 is like using a 20/20 which is at least respectable.  One Paladin did 170 DPS while healing the group at the same time with the javelin from Uqua, and that seems like pretty good DPS production from what's definitely not a DPS class.</div></div><hr />

That's so fucking weak.  Paladins definitely need an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrowsong</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just curious how long did it took for u guys to get her down to 80% ? is this fight just all about matching the raid's dps vs cragbeast's regen rate? heard rumours tat u could reduce her regen rate if u sorta kite her or keep her moving around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Triangle</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">she despawns after a set amount of time, i forget exactly how much it is, but if you were to kite her around for a while, you wouldn't have enough time to kill her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SincroFashad</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">She killed me last night when we had her at 53%.  Raid force of about 50.  When I landed at bind I saw the fun messages of: Her hp are going up now, this is bad.<br />
<br />
Was our first attempt, and we didn't account for the AE ramp.  I'm sure we would have done better had we been ready for that.</div></div><hr />
