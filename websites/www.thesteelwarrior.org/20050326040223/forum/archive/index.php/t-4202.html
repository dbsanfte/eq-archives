<br />
jump at every chance to sacrifice a ranger!!~ can always apologize and tell him that you overestimated his HP and pressed your AE taunt key a sec too late after AoW is dead.<br />
<br />
30ish is enuf for him at ~ ssra level i d say. he is nothing hard anymore.<br />

<br />
with CCH chance are some one can be a second to late....<br />
if MT dies .. everyone off attack until MT gets agro again....<br />
<br />
we used 4 clerics and had a necro fedding when they got low...<br />
as for cch i'm not sure what it is....but AOW is insane DPS...so have spam heals ready....<br />
<br />
first time you may wipe .... so dont' get discourage.... but he is diff a benchmark to see how good you guys are....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple helper ideas for ya-<br />
<br />
-use clicky snare items to build up good aggro on the pull, might allow you to use a good 2h if you have one (to reduce ripo dmg).  Snare glands or sceptres are best.<br />
<br />
-2x shrunken skele form seems to be the smallest player size obtainable for warriors (only smaller I know of is ench minor illusion), very good for cornering mobs.  Note- AoW is a tall mob, and distance is checked from your toon's &quot;chest&quot; to it's &quot;chest&quot; (i.e. where arrows hit it)- AE taunt checks z-axis, so have backup tank(s) lev'ed if they are shrunk, so they will be &quot;in range&quot;.<br />
<br />
-Divine Intervention works; use it if it's available, have your clerics read up about it over at one of the cleric forums.<br />
<br />
-Big damage shields help a ton, especially if you are low on dps; he's gonna hit you a LOT more than you are gonna hit him.<br />
<br />
-Watch out for enrage. ;)<br />
<br />

<br />
Don't worry about rangers weaponshield pulling and all that stuff...that just complicates things. Just have a monk pull him and have the MT tag. Clerics should start their 1st CH as soon as he's in sight. <br />
<br />
DI DI DI DI DI DI....if your clerics aren't DI'ing tanks 1 thru 3 for every raid mob...look for a new guild. <br />
<br />
Your biggest responsibility as a main tank is to make sure you get him cornered properly, after that, the rest of the fight is cruise control. <br />
<br />
As an 2nd or 3rd tank ..... let AoW eat a few people before you AE taunt. If you pull too fast, your clerics won't be able to switch with you. If you know they're fast with the /assist spot heals, go ahead and jump in there quick.</div></div><hr />

Nonsense in my opinion ... if u dont try how u gain exp with it?<br />
thats the thypical ubber guild thinking of &quot;all is ours, dont even touch it noobs&quot; bah ... leave something for others, u not alone in the server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krorghar</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think we got enough punch to do it or at least make a decent engage. In my guild, raid officer carefully choose targuet by considering late progression, skill, numbers, and previous experience on similar nameds. Dont think we just wake up one morning and say &quot;hey guys just got an idea...lets kill avattar, will be fun&quot; nah... every raid is carefully planed, and in the case of first engage, we carefully consider posible strats. When i started this post I just wanted to knew the point of view of the more experienced guilds in order to discuss it and add it to our battle plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wish i was one of the ubarz, my guild still hasnt gotten a shot at the AoW due to the rampant blowing of the spawn on bertoxx and guilds bottomfeeding on him. like i said the unslowed idol has about the same dps as the AoW so figuire out how you can do it based on that, if you do the idol np then go ahead and try the AoW but i was saying if you really didnt know what was going on then you shouldnt be trying to spawn as youd waste it for another guild who could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RystarVZ</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This mob is extreamly simple if you have decent healers with a tight Cheal Chain.  The reason he is so simple is he only hits one person if you position him correctly.  The following tips will make this encounter tivial.<br />
<br />
First make a group with 5 clerics and a necro that can feed the group.  This should be the Cheal chain group.  Make a second group of your extra clerics/druids/shamans they will patch heal during the fight depending on how well your Cheal chain is doing.<br />
<br />
Second make a group with your MT and 2nd, 3rd, and 4th tanks and a Enchanter that can project Illusion wood elf.  You may need a shrink class in this group if non of your tanks have a shrink item. <br />
<br />
Third explain to your guild what max melee range is!!  Nothing can mess you up more than a idoit that turns AoW around so he starts reposting your DPS classes to death.<br />
<br />
Turn your tanks into Wood Elves and shrink then as much as you can.<br />
<br />
Now just have a monk or ranger with WS pull it to corner and then once the Cheal chain starts on you AE taunt take argo and establish a decent amount of argo before calling in your DPS.  Once DPS is in makes sure they fight at Max melee range and this will be a very easy fight.  <br />

thats the thypical ubber guild thinking of &quot;all is ours, dont even touch it noobs&quot; bah ... leave something for others, u not alone in the server.  This has nothing to do with any uber attitude. You have to kill the idol to spawn the AoW to begin with, so if you have never done it, do the idol unslowed. If you can't beat the idol unslowed, the AoW is going to smack you down anyway so why blow the spawn?</div></div><hr />

did that to me once on the pull and it GOT ME REALLY MAD!!!! :D</div></div><hr />

AoW is blowable.<br />
<br />
If you wish to train on AoW, go work with unslowed idol.<br />
If you cant kill the Idol unslowed, AoW will RAPE you.<br />
<br />
Blowing spawns when u can prevent it is the sheer proof<br />
of stupidity and player grief.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on how much dps you have.  4 clerics can keep a 9500-10k warrior up pretty much forever using 3 sec rotation as long as they have mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tdog</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am trying to talk my guild into trying AoW but so far they think it will be a slaughter.<br />
<br />
MT is a 65 war with 8500hp raid buffed... have 6 clerics and 3 CH druids... I want to do a 2 sec rotation with the Clerics and spot heals with the druids... have a necro to pump mana in.<br />
<br />
We have killed Vinidi, Statue, idol (slowed). <br />
Going to try to get them to do idol unslowed soon.<br />
<br />
Btw before you flame me after we killed idol another guild was there ready to go for AoW... it was adeal I had worked out not to waste his spawn if we killed idol<br />
<br />
anyways think we could hanlde that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8500hp is about 2khp more than the first warriors who tanked the AOW and they also didn't have all the fancy defensive AAs they are available now. The AOW really is not all that hard if you can get enough clerics to do a 2-3 second rotation. I think there is an auro of mystique surrounding the AOW that makes people think he is a lot harder than he really is. Most PoP gods tier 2+ would tear the AOW a new one without even breaking a sweat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">have a necro to pump mana in.<br />
Please don't do that.<br />
There's plenty caster giants in kael, tankmez one with a pal/sk (for damgeless tanking so it lives through the fight) and have necros grouped with clerics.<br />
<br />
mind wrack can be cast once a minute and gives 300 mana.<br />
that's FT 30.<br />
if you can afford to group 2 necros and 4 clerics, you can double that.<br />
having your necros twitch would leave them at 10% efficiency if that. there's better ways to spend their mana ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing if you want to guage your changes on AoW by trying Idol unslowed you also have to make sure to not use spells that are resisted by AoW.  For instance fire nukes are resisted on AoW. So you shouldn't use fire nukes ( and magic I guess since those are probably resisted) on Idol because it will report an inaccurate length of time it takes to kill Idol in comparison to AoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first thing to do is try statue unslowed. idol/aow has roughly twice the HP of the statue. if unslowed statue is no problem, then give idol a shot unslowed.</div></div><hr />

Magic (and Cold, but you didn't say anything either way about Cold) lands fine on AoW in my experience.</div></div><hr />
