9k hp 1500ac war<br />
Sham is 120aa , well equipped<br />
<br />
Looking for a place with blues that can be singled easily.<br />
Been using plane of nightmare, but the nature of the zone (adds + trains) = having to zone out way too much.<br />
<br />
I've even considered PoI mix of LB / blue, but once again too many trains. <br />
<br />
I can do BoT /  PoV with just shaman healing, but it ends up being more trouble then its worth w/ time invested.<br />
<br />
I've even considered chardok / velks for steady LB's but they are so out of the way.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Maybe a place im missing in PoN thats safer/ easier? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I took note of the plane of hate DE's i read elsewhere on board, and drolga, but looking for something more easily accesabile.</div></div><hr />

Either GY, basement, or hero1 (not sure what its called on other servers) are places I do with my war/sham and a bard friend for pulls. You would probably get double pulls most of the time, but you should easily be able to tank two at once with your stats.<br />
<br />
Also, are you ele flagged? PoEarth or PoFire group exp blows duoing out of the water, but if you are dead set on duoing, this probably isnt a viable option.<br />
<br />
Edit: How are you having trouble healing the war? Slow the mob, get aggro on war, throw on pet, epic dot, and maybe disease dot with shammy, tank with war. Shammy using Qbob for heals should be more than enough for the places you listed. I can duo there without trouble with only 6400ish hp and 1300ac unbuffed, so you should be doing even better.</div></div><hr />

They WILL dispell you so make sure you have a few dummy buffs up at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the chance of you tanking 2 mobs at once with the shaman healing? If you'll do ok with that, definitely just head to HoH. Invis to a basement and fight two at a time for starters. Spread out the timing when you kill them and you should be able to turn it into single pulls. HoH is very decent experience, especially compared to tier 1 planes. If you're flagged for Sol Ro, one of my guildies DC'd a shaman there alot for ornate and experience. You will be fighting 2 at a time there though. You can also try out fighting deeper in PoJ. Not very likely for trains, and I can solo some blue mobs there (OMG! I CAN SOLO SOMETHING!). There should be some mobs high enough for ok experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo a war and shaman both with fewer HP and AA then you have a lot. Lately I do Tactics a lot for exp. The Diakus near entrance and around top of pit can easily be pulled solo and arent too bad, except for the Death knights. I always avoided HoH because I couldnt get singles there. Also Droga can be a lot of fun and pretty profitable, and its easy to tank multiple pulls in there.<br />
<br />
The Stormriders in the BoT upper courtyards are another decent spot. Just fight them near spawn spots to avoid gaters. And even the Gamite Frogs and worms in Valor are better exp then PoN mobs, and easy to get solo using shammy malo to pull the groups of frogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamce</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are dead set on duoing in PoI, then I suggest you work your way back to one of the side rooms left of the zone in.  It has been awile but there should be one on the right that you can open the door.  It will have about 5-6 mobs that spawn that can all be single pulled and should all be DB to you.<br />
<br />
If you run out of mobs you can pull inside the area, then you can pull from outside.<br />
<br />
Altough, if I were you I would head to BoT or HoH.</div></div><hr />

Also fast repop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you considered doing the Velium Vapors quest ?<br />
<br />
That would make places like Droga far easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devastate</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry was away for the weekend so didnt get to check thread, im ele flagged etc, the problem with bot / pov and even HoH is that it takes forever to kill, and those zones took a huge experience hit it seems with the ZEM Reduction, comparitive to tier 1 anyway. (1-2% in pon or 3-4% in bot the risk v reward seems better to me in pon)<br />
<br />
HoH is alright ive done it but its a pain in the butt to get around. When i need to atm i  do bot and pov, but BoT is hard to pull, and pov is perma camped. CoD is alright, but i find myself having to zone out often. I might actually go check out drolga, ive heard good things about it, mobs are blue? If i could find a nice place to set up camp w/ the revamp that might be viable, though i have nightmares of that place from years ago.. heh. Shaman has extended enhancement 4, scm3, and scrm along with quick buff 3 and speed foci, and mana pres 4, so he has a Qui that heals for about 3k and casts in 2.5 seconds for about 180 m, essentially i can go non stop, and even tank 2 at once w/ tnargs thrown in if neccesary.<br />
<br />
Stormriders are great, except they gate like mad, but overall atm id say that is my favirote spot, just slow and a pain sometimes.<br />
<br />
I hate tactics, ive never really tried solro always figured it was out of my 2 box league, i may throw that down.<br />
<br />
Also, i dont know if its posted elsewhere but ill post it up because i have a hunch its gonna be nerfed in the future, in natimbi near the ruins is 6 ghosts, blue about 75% of the time, and soloable - im pretty sure each one is a PH for a named that pops pretty often, drops some gimpy baz items but also a 20(?) hp slot 7 aug, been farming those since GoD release, also a mob drops that 50hp aura of courage neck there in the water. But most everyhting else is LB and thus, worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any mob can drop this.  I got mine of a Hynid and a guildie got one of a totile.  Have you tried PoFire for douing?  I got a guildie pally that was 2 boxing a 63 shaman and doing fine w/ topur/krags and the occision self heal.  You should be in a better position as your sham is better off then his was.  You could even add a 3rd person and still be getting 2-3% per kill at zone in.<br />
<br />
He was doing single pulls w/ the occasional add and when that happened he would just zone out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried PoFire for douing? <br />
I'm gonna second this. I did PoFire with a cleric DC'd, slowing with my ToD and got respectable experience. With haste and a reliable slow, you'll be able to do just fine. I personally chose a spot a bit to the right of the enterance and single pulled most every time. You can shake adds by just zoning out, too. Also, with the occasional tradeskill drops, you can make a pretty penny. Hope stone MQs can go for a chunk of change as well.<br />
<br />
You could also *try* PoEarth. It's easy to pull singles, but the mobs do mitigate slow quite a bit. Your shaman might have trouble keeping up the heals there.<br />
<br />
  Lastly, make sure to buy virtue and KEI if you're not. They're worth it.</div></div><hr />
