<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzen Whacksem</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings!!<br />
<br />
I have been a lurker for quite some time and give a big wave of thanks to the players who contribute the information I have learned about some of the finer points of warrioring in Norrath.  I also have had the great fortune to run across some really excellent and helpful folks on my server (Saryrn).<br />
<br />
I am not currently and don't have immediate aspirations to be a 'raiding' player.  I participate in raids on occassion, however.  Most of those are outings that friends in other guilds invite me to attend.  My guild is not overly large and is more of a 'family/social' group than some of the larger and more actively raid oriented guilds.  Plus, my work schedule doesn't allow me to play on a consistent basis.<br />
<br />
I prefer actually doing something as opposed to sitting around LFG when I don't have a readily available plan, so I run around quite a lot in Kunark era zones, since I can solo there in reasonable safety.  After the discs were split up, I started to actually use the offensive skills.  My observation is that Mighty Strike is the most beneficial to me, as a solo warrior.<br />
<br />
I typically wait until berserk to launch this skill and am dual wielding my fastest weapon combo (Fleshgrinder and Sword of the Bloodsworn).  In contrast, when using Fellstrike, I am wielding my Windblade, becuase of the insanely higher base damage.  While I get a few really massive hits (945 cripple with Fellstrike is my best), the overall numbers don't appear to be that much higher than a normal attack sequence.<br />
<br />
I am self buffed and Magelo should reflect my gear just prior to the patch of April 14th.  I haven't had a chance to update that profile yet.  Because of the rather lengthy recycle time and that I don't consistently use it against identical mobs, I haven't gotten a large enough parse sample to crunch data to compare Mighty vs. Fell.  Any input you folks could share to help me better use the available discs would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If you are playing in Kunark this is probably the case.<br />
<br />
When mobs are hitting for 700+ its harder to stay below beserk level for 30 seconds so I find fellstrike puts out better average damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, its situational. If you happen to have two relatively fast weapons and can keep yourself frenzied, then mighty strike will dish out more DPS, but thats not really an option when your doing anything in the planes. Use fellstrike for everything else.</div></div><hr />

:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Mighty strike For Plane of Tactics and lower.<br />
Maybe Ill switch to Fellstrike when I hit Elementals.<br />
<br />
But so far zerk tanking is the norm for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-18-2004, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use fellstrike, personally. 1600+ damage crippling blow is MUCH cooler eye candy! Mightystrike when 'zerked is probably more DPS and definitely more mitigation due to stun.</div></div><hr />

With Mighty Strike:<br />
Max Crit - 528<br />
Max Crip - 827 (I think)<br />
<br />
With Fellstrike<br />
Max hit - 605, Max Crit 1011<br />
<br />
So with Fellstrike your max hit is more than your normal max crit and if you crit on a fellstrike hit you hit for more than a max Crip under mighty strike.<br />
<br />
I havent intentionally gone out of my way to use fellstrike while berserk but I know I've seen crippling blows in the 1600's, no idea what the max Crip under fellstrike is with a 48 damage weapon, someone will have the formula to work it out.<br />
<br />
As far as eye candy goes, doing 1x 1011 crit is far more impressive than doing 3x 528 crits (and I've had runs of 3x 1k crits in a row).  Fellstrike is more DPS and IMO much more impressive eye candy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A fellstrike crip is better eyecandy than mightystrike on berserk IMO.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike does more damage if not berserked.  If berserked, Mighty will do more damage, but I feel getting a 2k crippling blow with fellstrike justifies the DPS loss.</div></div><hr />
