 Keep 2 tanks not dead and dmg Noquel to dead</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really though, it's not a good idea to ask for high-end spoilers. I highly doubt any guild in Txevu wants to compete against you for loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Safehouse Back Alley is the place where disgruntled failed-apps to uber guilds and disgruntled ex-uber ebayed players love to post high end spoilers. If you really want to cheat yourself out of the experience of trying and figuring it out for yourself (Noqufiel is NOT rocket science), that's your best bet.</div></div><hr />

People are making it hard by reading into it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most fun thing about GoD is that there are very few strats circulated. Trying and dying a few times, comparing notes with guildies after each wipe to try and piece together what really happened, tossing ideas around, formulating a strat for the next go, and the feeling you get when all the shit starts to fall in place and your Guild has just beaten some high end content completely on your own terms...<br />
<br />
...that's the best feeling in EQ. I hope for the sake of everybody who still plays EQ that GoD strats remain hard to look up for a while to come. Following some cookie cutter strat just doesn't feel the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well GoD raids are fairly straightforward.  They might not be a simple CH MT deal  but there isn't any tricks attached (except the early Ikkinz mystery class/archtype kills without clues).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except they added clues to those like 5 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nothing cooler than writing out a list of every class, and chosing one person from each class on the raid, and going down the list having a player from each class get a kill shot to beat those stupid sentry's.  ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gundahar</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Noqu doesn't need a special strat, the script is as simple as it looks. It's more a matter of control and accomplishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone will kill me but ill give you the run down.<br />
<br />
1st you gotta save the True Image of Noqufiel till the end, dont attack it till you have the mirror image below 10% and alive before you kill the true image.<br />
<br />
2nd Each mirror image has to be killed by a different class. Look for the emotes that tell you what class, if you dont see the emote your doing something wrong and need to leash and restart the fight.<br />
<br />
3rd Noq is susceptible to blunt damage, make sure your tanks use blunt weaps.<br />
<br />
4th and most important, only small characters can open the doors to his room.<br />
<br />
5th For the DT mobs try and get a few together, have your warriors AET and ripo the DT mob (they are different DT mobs than previous event). <br />
<br />
With this strat you will get to Txevu in no time</div></div><hr />
