<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy, Fellow Warriors,<br />
<br />
I need your guidance. My magelo is here. (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=755955) As you can see, the bulk of my armor consists of the gear you receive as a result of completing newbie armor quests. (If I had known that the Kelethin newbie armor was NEON green I swear I would have made an ogre ....)<br />
<br />
Now that I'm 25th level and tanking for my guild-mates, I'm finding that the mobs we're introducing to Tunare are dinging me for some pretty impressive damage.  <br />
<br />
I'm on Stromm server and have about 150 platinum to spend right away. What's the best approach? Blow it all on a single item? Make incremental upgrades to everything? Save the money and quest for better gear?<br />
<br />
I look forward to your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">stromm is a newbie server right? if so; just keep levelling and start filling in your armour with crafted and go from there.<br />
<br />
i doubt you guys have much of a mudflated economy like the rest of the servers; but overall crafted would be a big step up from what you got now ( i wore mostly crafted until the mid-40's as a reference )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looks like the biggest upgrades would be Crustacean Shell Armor, I know they're around on Stromm, but I don't know how much they go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh wow. It was actually really neat to look at your profile. Brings back memories. :D Even though the noob quest armor didn't exist then. ;)<br />
<br />
You can hit highkeep for better ac but no stats by getting bronze off the gobbies. I have no idea what level Runny Eye is these days but perhaps Blackened Alloy is an option. You can also start your Crafted quests. Man, it feels nice to think oldshool. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Without any PL whatsoever, and not buying the armor, the Crafted can be a pain at the real levels you are talking about atm.<br />
I remember from 1999. level 24 was just too low to get some of the items.<br />
<br />
P.S. the werewolf that spawns at midnight at the border of Qeynos Hills and WK does NOT drop a talon, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Start with Bronze. A good set of Bronze will help the AC get up.<br />
<br />
btw, your 150pp will only net you one piece of crafted total if you try and quest it yourself due to the cost of gems.<br />
<br />
The way in which I got myself from level 24 with all leather and some bronze to full Crafted and an exe axe in a couple months was to trade in the market.<br />
<br />
Buy low in the bazaar and try and sell high. In the n00b economies of 1999, 150pp was absolutely enough money to make 10,000pp in about 3 months...<br />
<br />
Just remember that you wont be levelling during that time.<br />
<br />
With no PL, trading was the single fastest way to improve your equipment, Bar NONE.<br />
<br />
Boy does that equip bring back memories :)<br />
<br />

BTW LOL - nm the cube I was thinking of dropped 3 int earrings, which were the bomb back then, easy easy sale...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I still have a werewolf talon banked from a trip to mistmoore... long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got mine from a RAID on MistMoore, then got 2 Rubies from a Guild Cleric who EXPed in this unknown place where all the ubers hung out but I never ever would be good enough to go to called Sebilis, and the 3rd I saved and saved and finally had 160pp and got it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the good advice, Warriors.<br />
<br />
Lately I've been picking up Blackened Alloy and Blackened Iron in Runnyeye as an intermediate step towards Crafted. Killing the mobs that drop the stuff you need for Crafted has been a good activity for guildmates, too.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting!<br />
