<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chaotic Black Scimitar is a good weapon, i like mine, my aggro is fine with it, its a good pickup imo if you can get it.  Something else you might want to look at that alot of peeps swear by are Demerix's.  Jagged Onyx Staff is real nice too if you guys still do Ikkinz stuff.  Spiked Steel Baton just does nothing for me to be honest.  Its like the ED 2.0 and the ED 1.0 was god awful.  <br />
<br />
The Deathshead Mace in Tacvi is another offhand you could look at.  Im assuming since you are talking about a Zun weapon you're a tacvi guild.  In your shoes id shoot for a Demerix, the Scimitar, or the Deathshead mace.</div></div><hr />

Has a normal proc rate mod and the ratio isn't horrible.  One of our war's uses in offhand tanking with DB.  Mainhanded its damn nice dps. Wouldn't rule it totally out of the picture.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since you already have a FLeshbiter for your mainhand, I would recommend looting the next warrior usable offhand weapon that drops. Seriously, anything that you have access to is going to be better than a BoC offhand. Just about any weapon you can name is going to have an agro proc that is just under EB, with the added benefit of a truckload of HP/AC more than a BOC, plus an pretty health amount of DPS. If you really want to bepicky, wait for a CBS, but personally I would take the next drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is some pretty good advice Injektilo,  <br />
<br />
1) Death's Head Mace<br />
2) Chaotic Black Scimitar<br />
3) Demerix the Painsipper <br />
also verge of the mindless servant, jagged onyx staff and edge of chaos <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Any of these are very good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katanna Steele</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just picked up a CBS the other day. So far I definatly like it, however I was hoping for slightly more aggro from it... I got it to replace my EoE, and I would have to say that the EoE generates slightly more aggro due to proc... CBS wins the dps bout.  When coupled with A3 aug, CBS will be more then enough for offhand aggro, and the rune definatly helps with tanking if only for a small amount.  Now just need to get me hands on a BBoB  :D  love my JOS aug'd with Bloodstone of Force, but me wants more aggro now...<br />

Which mob in Tacvi drops the Death's head mace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard that link was mined, we may have to wait a little while to find out what drops that item.  It's probably from either the aoe snake of one of the two mobs which follow him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was from Beta.  Every DW class gets their class weapon + Death Head's Mace if you're beta testing anything that requires good gear.</div></div><hr />
