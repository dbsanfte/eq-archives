<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warriors have been crying for groups have chosen knights over them. Well, I think it is perfectly logical for many this reason:<br />
<br />
According to history, knights are always superior than warriors in all ways (remember that &quot;Every knight is a warrior, but not all warrior can be knighted&quot;). Therefore, it is perfectly fine that knights should be picked over warriors since they are always superior.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that all knights SHOULD have the same amount of hps and AC as warriors, plus their combat skills -duel wield, doulbe attack, etc- should also be at least the same as wars (or even higher since knights are supposed to be a superior warrior). Also, they should receive all of the war's disciplines.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that all of you warriors will yell up &quot;Hey, that isn't fair. You throw the balance off the hook&quot; Blah blah blah. But hey, there is a hierachy in very where you go, and if you want to be as powerful as a knight, then delete your war and start a knight!<br />
<br />
Now, I know some body will yell up from the background &quot;Then why on earth make a warrior class? You may as well remove the warrior class from the game&quot;. No offense to you wars, but I think a well played knight takes much much more effort to achieve than a well played warrior since knights are more diverse and more complex in design than warriors. So, if you just want to log on to do some slashing and take some beating, and have an easy time, then go ahead and play a war. However, if you want to do more than just tanking. You want to be able to help the chanter in ground control, to assist the cleric in healing, etc, then play a knight since it is more versatile.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I think that Veran should, at the beginning of the game creation, makes all paladin/shadow knight start out as regular warriors. Then, after they level up for awhile, and if they want to achieve their knightly status, they have to pass some kinda tests (like have to go through the leveling with twice as slow as a regular war, do some very hard quests, etc) before they can receive their spells and become a knight. I think Veran realize that, but what is done can't be undone, so they make EQ2 to make up for that (we all know that in EQ2, after level 20 or so i can't remember atm, the char has a choice to pick which class to specilize in).<br />
<br />
Nerfing a knight? Heck, it doesn't sound right. Instead, knights should all receive warrior's combat skills and defensive skills.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat:<br />
<br />
&quot;ALL KNIGHTS ARE WARRIOR, BUT NOT ALL WARRIOR CAN BE KNIGHTED&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dito --  <br />
<br />
Take it easy, folks. This is just a game after all :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/sigh troll.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Veran*t* is no longer on the EQ scene bud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it would be in the best interest of class balance and inter class relations if blatant bullshit troll posts like this just got deleted immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think someone should reread their history regarding knights and warriors because they are wrong. The primary difference between a warrior and knight was their bloodline, it had nothing to do with combat ability. Also remember that a knight was not necessarly the historical version of a paladin. There were only certain segments of the knight class that were considered to be what we would term a paladin (Templars, Hospitalers, etc.).<br />
<br />
Also consider the fact that historical paladins were not able to cast spells and didn't fight dragons, trolls, elves, etc. If you want a game based off history you may want to look at something other than EQ. Then again, with your poor grasp of history you may not know the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well given that. Knights should be slaves to their faith, with their will and entire being devoted to their deities whim. Like one of those puppets with the strings.<br />
<br />
Puppets! Puppets I tell you!!<br />
<br />
And also they should be broke, as in penniless. They should give any loot they get to their temples and not be allowed to use more than ten magical items at a time.<br />
<br />
And should knights not conform to such standards, they are to be Deathtouched on the spot as a sign they have miffed off their gods. Also they should be Deathtouched whenever their god is killed as their conduit for energy has been cut off. And they should also be Deathtouched at random because gods can be fickle like that.<br />
<br />
Yeah that should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Knights were warriors you jackass. They were just warriors with noble bloodlines, land,  and titles.  Because of that, they could afford better gear and heavy armor.  This line of reasoning has nothing to do with a fantasy setting.  But if it did, a more accurate way of summing it up would be &quot;Knights should have all of their spells taken out of the game, and be given all the same abilities as a warrior, given a title, and allowed to start the game with a suit of fine plate armor and a fine steel sword.&quot; Because that's what a knight really was, a warrior with the benefit of noble birth.  I repeat: Jackass.   I'd say worse, but it would just make Shik angry.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, knights no longer seem to be with us in RL. The Battles of Crecy, Poiters, and Agincourt have a lot to do with that. Knights did quite well fighting mythylogical dragons, but against warriors trained to use bows - not so good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">C'mon warriors, how could you guys even validate this loser's post with thought-out and informative responses? <br />
<br />
Standard policy for trolls on this board should be hostile, insulting responses that discourage further trollage, rather than sending a message that we have time to read crap like this.<br />
<br />
Stand united warriors! We have enough shit to deal with without educating every ignorant knight that posts here telling us, of all people, that we don't know what's going on.<br />
<br />
So, in the future, I'm hoping to see you all post two-line responses, one to inform the poster that he is nought but slime on our boots, and the second to insult and degrade him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, &quot;Paladin&quot; was an order of French knights that began around the time of the Battle of Hastings. They were a holy order that was almost wholly made up of peasant ranks (which included women). They were a religious order primarily and were not as combat oriented as their trained warrior counterparts.<br />
<br />
The image of the holy knights as we know it today has been fostered by the historical accunt of the Companions of Charlemagne (a group of noble holy knights fiercely trained but rarely seen in actual combat) as well as the knights of Morte D'Arthur (Who were not all truly holy knights. Galahad was, surely, but almost none of the others could claim the necessary religious frenzy to warrant the title.)<br />
<br />
However, that's all irrelevant to the world of EQ. The classes as we know them have been taken almost directly from the annals of Dungeons and Dragons. From the fantasy genre, the pure fighters were always better at combat than their hybrid counterparts. They develop very quickly to deal with the rising threat higher level creatures pose.<br />
<br />
But since you're a troll as well as a blithering idiot, I'll just tell you this:<br />
<br />
Go back to your own boards, Corky, you're out of your league here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's what I think.<br />
<br />
I think clerics should have their combat skills upped to 252.<br />
<br />
I think level 65 clerics should get a 2hb version of their proccy hammer of doom, and it should have FT 15 on it, so all they have to do is summon forth their proccy blunt stick of doom and let the thoughts flow.<br />
<br />
I think clerics should have their HP modifier upped to that of paladin levels.<br />
<br />
I think clerics should have their defensive skills upped to match that of paladins.<br />
<br />
I think clerics should get double attack, and some AA skills that enhance their offense.<br />
<br />
And then we can finally just get rid of paladins, replacing them with their rightful heirs, BATTLE CLERICS.<br />
<br />
Cleric/Shaman duo box setups will rule the world.<br />
<br />
And knights will still have all of their UTILITY and their fast horses to ride around between camps while LFG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And lessee, pally skills..........<br />
<br />
1)mob inc, lets stun, mob turns away, lets stun, add, lets stun, pull away, root and stun the first again for good measure<br />
2)ooo undead, use disc<br />
3) Caster being beaten up, light of knife or LoH<br />
4)MGB BSS to the raid<br />
<br />
Yup lots more skillz needed there. Pallys are so skillfully skillage. We would be to dumb to do that fo sho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The age of Knights was brought to an abrupt end by the common man becoming better at war than the nobility. Look at how Cromwell was able to dethrone a king in England using an army of common men, the foot soldiers. King Henry V of England laid waste to French nobility at the Battle of Harfluer, with over 14,000 French Knights brought down by a ragtag army of mostly Welsh Yeomen (archers) and men-at-arms. The greatest force to take the field during medieval Europe was none other than Swiss Pikemen, and the only time you saw them on horseback was when they were traveling from battlefield to battlefield. Spanish Tercios brought an end to the heavy cavalry charge that was popular on European battlefields. These men, armed with 14 foot long pikes, would break almost any cavalry charge on a forest of spears.<br />
<br />
When these common soldiers began adding the raw force of gunpowder, you saw a change in the armor of all soldiers. It became more important to remain mobile then to be able to shed the sword blows of your enemy. Cavalry charges became more rare, used only when a line of soldiers began to break, in order to rout the enemy.<br />
<br />
Knights are an anachronism. Warriors, the common man taking up a weapon and going to war, put the feudal Noble soldier out of a job. So put that in your pipe and go smoke it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Alright...I won't reply to the &quot;nerf not nerf&quot; stupidity because everyone else pretty much has that covered.<br />
<br />
But if you're going to try to compare EQ to history please for the love of God do so right.<br />
<br />
Allow me to educate you on &quot;Knights&quot; and &quot;warriors&quot;.<br />
<br />
Knight:<br />
<br />
This was the name applied to mounted warriors of aristocracy in western Europe from the ninth century onward.  The paladins of Charlemagne were among the first knights of European ages.<br />
<br />
Knights were born under a noble roof and granted knighthood, thus allowing them to command troops and throw them head on into battle to do their bidding.  On average, one out of sixty knights was valorous, on average only one out of ninety would show this, and on average only one out of two hundred put themselves in harms' way when it could be avoided.<br />
<br />
For a few reasons this occured:<br />
<br />
1) The knight wasn't the superior in fighting in every situation.  You had specialty orders of knights who were well trained in a specific style of fighting, and then you had the average knight.  He was nothing more than a noble who was given a sword and the right to fight/command troops.  On the battlefield the knight, if under command of another noble, would be in a division of horsemen, would charge the enemy and generally leave the battlefield.  They and their training were useless in anything but their initial charge with a handful of exceptions.  While yes it can be argueable that knights were trained to use swords, it more got in the way to have big, bulky horses that can't manuver wasting the lives of knights then it did to have them plough through and wait for other orders.  Again there were specialty knights who charged on foot, or it could be argued that they were called around for another pass, but this was not the norm, nor did it have desireable consequences more than 95% of the time.<br />
<br />
2) A Knight was the intellectual superior to the common warrior.  There was no question about this.  The average warrior's intellect was not on par (on average) with his knight or his lord.  The lord got greater education, had access to more books and writings, and spent more time reading them than a warrior would choose to.  The warrior would generally spend more time tending to his family or training in the ways of war.  The warrior, when it came to battling on the battlefield, was the superior in using his weapons and utilizing himself, while the knight was the superior in navigating him for optimum effectiveness.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Given the choice between death or having a nameless anonymous soldier dying in  your stead, the knight would choose 95% of the time for the anonymous soldier to die.  That's what he was raised to believe, that his life was far more important.<br />
<br />
<br />
Allow me to educate you in a few knightly orders.<br />
<br />
Knights Templar:<br />
<br />
These guys started out as paupers, part of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon...religious orders formed during the Crusades into the Holy Land.  Being inspired by the idea, a large portion of nobles joined in with them, bringing along their craftsmen and troops etc. etc.  However there was more to this order then &quot;freeing the Holy Land&quot;...in fact much more.<br />
<br />
They began setting up nearby churches and religious buildings as banks for themselves and other nobles, funded by those who had come under the promise of glory and valor.  After the Crusaders were pushed from the Holy Land in 1291 they set up a major financial business as bankers, drawing the envy from both the secular rulers and the clergy.<br />
<br />
In essence, they were financially holding a large portion of Europe by the balls.  (Funny this doesn't sound like an order of valiant soldiers and warrios to me).<br />
<br />
Now bare in mind, whlie the Knights Templar were in the Holy Lands they were some of the most ruthless and foul persons there.  Their names were struck with awe by those whom had heard the bard tales and malevolence and fear by those who had witnessed first hand what they had done.<br />
<br />
Several historians agree that they brought about a huge reform in the ways Knights and their counterparts were looked at by nobility and royalty, causing a tighter leash to be placed on knighthood on the whole.<br />
<br />
Some have even compared them to Hitler's S.S., as a kind of bully force that would go around and not only try to quell Islam, but slay any who defied christianity in the harshest senses.<br />
<br />
They would ride onto the battlefield and fight Muslims...along side their warrior counterparts (men-at-arms, sergeant at arms, pikemen, archers and the like) and would get slaughtered in the process.<br />
<br />
In 1307 the monarchs of France, England and Spain began attacking and shutting down Templar Headquarters, arresting them and charging them with heresy, witchcraft, and immorality.  Though the Pope had originally brought forth most of the ideas for, funded, and championed the Knights Templar, in 1314 he had the leadership of the Knights burned at the stake for herecy and witchcraft and the order disbanded.<br />
<br />
Knights Hospitalar<br />
<br />
<br />
These knights originally helped serve as hospitalmen to the order of Saint John in Jerusalem...an order formed by crusaders in the eleventh century for clergy attached to a hospital that tended to sick and needy pilgrims in the holy land.<br />
<br />
Now after several defeats at the hands of the Muslims in Jerusalem, the Clergy reformed the Knights Hospitalar to take a more aggressive military role in crusade matters, moving from their healing duties to defensive duties.  <br />
<br />
Being sent to Jerusalem in 1187...the city fell and so the order transferred next to the city of Acre, a fortified coastal city.  There it resumed its duties of caring for the sick, while in turn patrolling the lands for infidels and killing them on sight.<br />
<br />
In 1291, Acre fell and the hospitalars moved to Cyprus.  A few decades later, in 1310, it moved to Rhodes, which it took conquered and ruled as an independent state.<br />
<br />
In 1522...it fell to the Turks of the Ottomon Empire.<br />
<br />
After being given the island of Malta by Emperor Charles V in 1530, thy ruled that and finally with the help of the Holy roman Empire held off further Turkish Assaults.  When left to their own devices in 1798...they fell to General Napoleon Bonaparte.  Now they exist as a military order in the island of Malta.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Great warriors/tanks huh?<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I need to go on about specific orders?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's look at warriors vs. knights historically.<br />
<br />
Battle of Creciy.<br />
<br />
This was the first horrific slaughter by the French to the English Bowmen, the casualties by the former being far too numerous to count.  However it has been estimated that it is close to the ten thousands.<br />
<br />
The French knights were ordered to charge an inclined position of well set up English Bowmen who fired an estimated thousand arrows a minute onto the knights and Genoese Crossbowmen.  Panicked and enraged, and using typical military sense (horse &gt; bow) the knights charged.<br />
<br />
The knights ran down their own crossbowmen in this frenzy and in turn were butchered by volley after volley after volley of arrows by King Edward III's troops.  Edward the Black Prince, &quot;earning his feathers&quot;, led his personal warriors (groundmen and knights) against various French positions, routing them out and turning them.<br />
<br />
In a fit of rage and denial, the warriors turn on the knights for sending them into such a havoc and begin killing them by the hundreds.  The French are turned, the English are victorious, and the knights were laid to waste by common warriors.<br />
<br />
Do you want me to explain Poitiers?<br />
<br />
Agincourt?<br />
<br />
Stirling Bridge?<br />
<br />
Dozens of swiss battles?<br />
<br />
There really isn't a way around it.<br />
<br />
Knights were rarely if ever superior warriors to the &quot;warrior&quot;.<br />
<br />
A knight was a man of nobility.<br />
<br />
A warrior was a man of action.<br />
<br />
Don't go and watch the movie Excalibur and then come in here trying to use that for historical accuracy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">WOOT go eze!<br />
<br />
also you know that about 20% of all the knights were sentanced to death by their king for abusing their post? thats right, in the ceromony, the knight would be repeatedly based over the head with the flat side of his sword untill it broke, then they would throw his bloody body into a coffin and have a mock christan funeral.<br />
<br />
the best warriors in war, where the english trained footmen, they had good skill at quickly killing others, the best on 1 on 1 man duels where the samari, and i beleave the close second was the scotish as they had a large important placed on 1 on 1 combat(didnt have enough people around to fight big drawn out wars, so they had the clan war leaders duel)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Have to disagree with you about who the best warriors were Gerick. Three words.  Spartans at Thermopylae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Actually, I'd have to say that some of the best warriors were the CeltIberian warriors. Not only did they develop the first knightly hierarchy (where the guy on the horse really was the best trained fighter but he was still a warrior) but they also developed chain mail and some thoroughly evil weapons (falcata, gae bolga). There is even some evidence that they taught the Mongols to fight from horseback. The CeltIberian armies washed over the European world like a bloody wave, destroying every single army they came against.<br />
<br />
In the end, Julius Caesar knew his losses to them during his British conquests would be so severe that he hired other Celts to fight for him. :p</div></div><hr />

And especially paladins should pray every 5 minutes that SoE never decides to really implement that.<br />
Can you imagine how your 'God' would react if you attack or even worse kill someone/something without being attacked first?<br />
Like no spells for 24 hours game time ?<br />
I remember playing D&amp;D and the GM sentencing a Pally to go on an extensive quest after breaking the code of his order.<br />
<br />
Would also be interesting for shadowknights(aka anti-Paladins), as no more grouping with rangers, or clerics following the good gods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would also be interesting for shadowknights(aka anti-Paladins), as no more grouping with rangers, or clerics following the good gods.<br />
<br />
The problem with that kind of thing being implemented into Everquest is the fact that the lines of paladins are so unbelieveably skewed in this game that they have left the bounds of what paladins were in D&amp;D to a whole new genre of paladin in this one...which is fine.<br />
<br />
Where a paladin was a shining idol of chivalry and perfection in a man, upholding the codes of his order and remaining truly lawful good in every action he did, it doesn't seem so as a paladin in Everquest.  Here you have examples of them worshipping a neutral to neutral evil god (Brell Serilis), attempting to commit political assassination and lead uprisings to seize a city that never belonged to them (Freeport/Knights of Truth), and an order of paladins devoted to love that have only ever brought strife and suffering (Priests of Love/Paladins of Erollisi).<br />
<br />
It seems that with Everquest, the whole lawful good thing has been removed entirely, and that a new kind of knight has been placed in.<br />
<br />
I personally don't believe that with the lore in Everquest...some of the gods (Mithaniel Marr specifically) actually does remove someone's powers for their actions.  For example you have liars, cowards, and murderers who preach about Truth and Valor in North Freeport, and you have Lord Inquisitor Seru who still is granted the most holy paladin ability (to lay hands on himself), despite the fact that he is torturing his own people once every two years and betraying his best friend, dispatching Death Squads to eradicate anyone loyal to him.<br />
<br />
So in my estimation...the paladins we witness aren't the same that we met in good 'ol fashioned D&amp;D, but rather a kind of person who has proven himself to his god and has been given powers...which come in a kind of one shot deal.<br />
<br />
At least it would explain most of the inconsistencies I've seen in &quot;paladins&quot;.<br />
<br />
I personally don't trust Sony Online Entertainment to properly implement such a thing...and would loathe to have my powers taken away for killing something evil that they put on an inherintly &quot;good&quot; faction.<br />
<br />
Paladins in Everquest seem to be more like Inquisitors from the old Spanish Inquisition.  Find what you think is evil and deal with it in the harshest manner possible.<br />
<br />
Not the holy defenders of justice and virtue that we all came to appreciate in Dungeons and Dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">To be honest, I think that &lt;&lt;&lt;SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT&gt;&gt;  should, at the beginning of the game creation, make all &lt;&lt;CHARACTERS&gt;&gt;&gt; start out as a regular &lt;&lt;BASE CLASS&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Then, after they level up for awhile, and if they want to achieve their &lt;&lt;NEW&gt;&gt; status, they have to pass some kinda tests (like have to go through the leveling with twice as slow as a regular &lt;&lt;BASE CLASS&gt;&gt;, do some very hard quests, etc) before they can receive their spells and become a &lt;&lt;SPECIALIZED CLASS&gt;&gt;&gt;. <br />
<br />
If you take out the class names this is actually a cool idea.  Of course each tree thread would need its own weaknesses and would actually have to DIVERGE (I believe some other MMORG actually do this now?).<br />
<br />
Other thing I have learned from this thread:<br />
<br />
1. The French have always been pretty poor tacticians<br />
2. Historic paladins (IRL!) couldnt kill a dragon<br />
3. D&amp;D has been imperfectly used/mapped/referenced in EQ (G Gygax spinnin in his grave)<br />
4. That a giant bat exists somewhere in Kentucky<br />
5. That I don't ever want to be hit by said bat<br />
6. That we shouldnt use giant signatures in these forums<br />
7. The Pope used to be a bad *ss in the middle ages<br />
8. That ANYONE who EVER played a warrior did so because they were <br />
      a) too stuopid<br />
      b) too lazy<br />
      c) just too deranged<br />
to be a paladin (last point was a just me havin fun).<br />
<br />

The fact that the longbowmen at Agincourt when out of ammunition took out their bows and kicked the shit out of the knights with the bows as blunt weapons indicates that we're not dealing with mere rangers here.</div></div><hr />

I think Beastlords came from Tarzan, so in these lines A Human beastlord should have a Monkey for pet.<br />
