<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rheven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.<br />
<br />
Wood elf warrior girl, 55 redhead, can hit 4500 hp with virtue only, no AA, reasonable equipment and weapons. So I started Rheven In July. Brought a cleric along with her but not 2 boxed. I had a 39 shaman at the time and a 20 ranger and 20 mage. Frustrated with where the shaman was going I started her to fight.  And she fights pretty well.<br />
<br />
I thought they would be fixing warriors so she was sorta of like a gamble. And now I guess they are. I have a couple questions about being a fighter maybe a few of you might answer. I'm on the edge of a new level of play and it's unfamiliar territory to me.<br />
But please, answers or pointers would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
1). I want more hp? What to do.<br />
<br />
2). I am fighting the way I did at 30 I think. Go get in their face and pound away trying to capture and maintain aggro. Should I be doing something different. What are these skills or abilities that I'm missing?<br />
<br />
3) Gosh all this about opening and timers and stuff in these coming changes? I have the feeling we are getting spells with long refreshes based on what we do in the fight. Yes? How do I play that. I'm sorta missing the idea.<br />
<br />
4) How do we use these proposed changes to our advantage? <br />
<br />
I want to be the best melee fighter there is, me personally, as a warrior. How do I get better now? What do I need to learn. Oh, and I don't want to be a utility player. My friends handle that for me just fine. I fight. <br />
<br />
Thanks, Rheven</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1)Gear choices,AA abilities etc etc Nothing magical, compare magelo's of people around your level for options then use allakhazam or similar to find out where to get 'em.<br />
<br />
<br />
2)That's pretty much it til the changes go live, time your taunts, don't mash, work on good group awareness, identifying which mob is the priority, positioning relative to healer/slow so you know where the mobs headed if you loose control, use of proximity for aggro, piggybacking hate from high DPS pets, watching for slow/debuff messages so you're prepared etc, etc. 'Pushbutton ability' wise there's not much 'yet' you can add.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)Opportunities open up during combat at infrequent intervals, you will have a choice of abilities depending on the opening type, hit the appropriate choice of skil before the opening 'fades' and continue. Depending on choice of ability you get a different result.<br />
<br />
Limited use ranged hate ability (provoke) offers a one time hate increase without requiring an opening, not snap aggro like a knight but an additional aid.<br />
<br />
<br />
4)If you hit the correct ability it gives you a little bit more than if you don't. :p<br />
<br />
As far as what to do now - see 2) Abilities help but it's only if you are an active and aware participant in the group that you'll tank 'well'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, a good trick to position mobs is sitting.  That can pull them off your slower sometimes until taunt refreshes.  Takes practice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gosh? <br />
<br />
*Blink*<br />
<br />
You mean people still use that word? I thought it would have been regulated to archaic usage only by now.<br />
<br />
As for your questions.<br />
1) Get better gear.  Yeah levels and AA give you hps too but getting better gear is faster in most cases below level 60 and you really want to get allot of hps unruffled before you get to the higher levels of the game. (This isn't going to change btw)<br />
<br />
2) Nothing much, yet.<br />
<br />
3) The best way to learn would be to go to test and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
4) See 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mhila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I did when I was leveling up...  Stats really are not that important because more often then not, you can get the buffs you need to max everything.  Try to get your Stamina to 195 unbuffed so that the shamans who you'll be grouping with can max that stat at 255 giving you the most possible hit points from the buff.  Other then that, you want as many raw hit points on your gear as you can possibly get.  There is really no problem trading off some of your strength gear for hit points.  Strength is by far the easiest stat to buff.  <br />
<br />
Once you get over level 60 and can start raising your stats higher then 255 you'll want to add to your stamina so that stam buffs will just max you.  At level 65 I try to keep my unbuffed stam at 274 so that the right click stam buff on my greaves will max me at exactly 305.  <br />
<br />
Thats just how I do it.  I'm sure there are many other ideas which may or may not be better for you.<br />
<br />
As to the new melee changes, I haven't played with them at all but I'm not all that excited about becoming a caster...  I'm holding judgment till I see them for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rheven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Equipmentwise, yeah there is only so much you can do. I do tend to carry a wide selection of weapons with me and switch them around testing the various combinations: windblade, Zek's, snowchipper, lammy, centi long and maybe some others. It's hard to say what are good weapons I guess. I look at damage/time ratio, buffs and am beginning to consider processes. Anything I could do better in the weapons category?<br />
Rheven Songbird, Povar, gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=779922)<br />
<br />
Valeris, thanks for your comments. Please, what did you mean by piggybacking hate from high DPS pets? Those other things are good and I have them in control. I'm just now learning not to mash or not taunt but to time it for max efficiency. Position is important relative to the slower and healer I agree. Normally in a high danger situation like say the slower went down right off, I find the cleric and try to stay with her. IMO that's the best chance of surviving for both. I can see I'm gonna have to study this openings and abilities thing. It confuses me already. But I do want to learn it.<br />
<br />
I had to laugh Bonequest cause I died in PoV or somewhere like that yesterday pulling when I accidentially hit sit instead of target. I sat right down and both those guys just hammered me. Was over real quick like, lil naked elf girl standing by the Soulbinder in PoK, good reminder of the beginning back in Kelethin. I never mind too much. It had been a while.<br />
<br />
Thank you Varaho. How do I access the test server?<br />
<br />
I'm going to check on my stats today and let you know unbuffed, Mhila. Thanks for your comments. I know when I was trying to gear up I paid the most attention to strength and AC and after that hp and then probably stamina and dexterity. I know I have a lot of strength, 255 maybe. After I look today I'll get back to you and perhaps we can talk about any stat changes I might need to make. Thanks again, all.<br />
<br />
Rheven</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your gear is good, imo.<br />
<br />
Although I'd ditch the Lodi shield for either a Maelstrom cloak or that one 80 hp cloak, forget the name.<br />
<br />
Sell the Lammy, Frosty, SBoZ, Snowchipper, and all that. Get the droga weps. Better aggro and have nice stats. Keep the Windblade for when you don't want aggro.<br />
<br />
Perhaps pick up a snare whip, ToD, Kunzar Kujuch, and use them when you need to.<br />
<br />
You get on test by going Start, Programs, EverQuest, Test EverQuest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well did not see anything about money so ill assume ya have little of it. Here are cheap upgrades and some suggestions.<br />
<br />
I agree. camp the chos and sotbs, you can do it with 3-4 people. Not a long camp and should be ok exp at 55th.<br />
<br />
camp stormfeather for a better mask<br />
<br />
kael should be your friend about now at 55th you should be getting into a guild that can do plate cycle or raid the arena. If nothing more than to get you cr gear for later. BP legs, bracers helm should help (also sell your droppable gear as you upgrade helps too)<br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice, 3-4 k now can replace that other earing.<br />
<br />
Always liked my epic. might not be a huge thing for you but a 100hp 2hs (crappy rate but not the worst) with resists and stats sword is not bad.<br />
<br />
could do this quest for these if you have 3-4 friends and have the right velius faction. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">All of the above represents good advice.  Equipment is the single most important factor as it plays such a vital role in the task of a true warrior, mitigation and aggro.  Since these are the most obvious, I will throw out some less obvious small things you can do to get better.<br />
<br />
Good warriors are also masters of positioning.  These may seem like small things but they will make you appear experienced and polished in a group setting.<br />
<br />
Little things relative to positioning are always appreciated.  If you have a slower make sure they are close to you so you can &quot;taunt&quot; if you lose aggro and not get a &quot;too far away message&quot; if you don't hit it fast enough.  Save taunt for when you need it.  Have plenty of arrows and always tag on inc to get yoruself on the hate list.<br />
<br />
Turn the mob to put pets at its back if possible (for better group dps - some pets actually backstab) and all other melee if it is an LDoN enrager.<br />
<br />
If you have a ranger (using bow) or a rogue keep the mob out of the wall.  They will love you for it.  You get an overzealous monk, a beastlord pet and a mage pet all in the same group and you may have to use &quot;sit&quot; aggro to get it out and centered.  If they are pushing it into the wall just back off and sit down.<br />
<br />
Seperate mezzed mobs.  Although it is easier now to target with the target ring on an inc of two or three, once mezzed move the mob you are fighting away from the other to get a clear seperation so your CC can tash and slow it while mezzed easier.  <br />
<br />
Always call the target when more than one mob.  When no CC kill healers first.  If CC ask the chanter if they would prefer you kill casters last, some like to play with their sieves.<br />
<br />
Make sure your healers cap your health between pulls.  I dislike the cleric who leaves me at 60 percent between pulls as it is not as efficient to CHeal me.  Inevitably a three pull will get the cleric throwing a fast heal on me before they are all controlled and taking some aggro.<br />
<br />
FOOD - a warrior should never be in group asking &quot;hey does anyone have some water&quot;.  Go to the bazaar and buy Halas 10 lb Meat Pies (1-2 pp each and Tormentor Stir Fry is too expensive for main food for me) and Grobb Liquidized meat (5-7pp) and always have a steady supply.  I carry regular rations/fizzlecutter and I switch out when I am tradeskilling or LFG.  <br />
<br />
FOOD is the PERIDOTS of warriors. <br />
<br />
Nothing big or important there.  The other guys got the important stuff these are just things you pick up with experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Please, what did you mean by piggybacking hate from high DPS pets? <br />
<br />
Taunt puts you on the top of the list + a very small amount of hate, right? So, Beastlord, Mage (mostly with stunning weapons) and other pets, can generate more agro than you, cause they have innate procs (added by their masters) or summoned weapons that stun, have DDs, and of course, generate agro. You can see a Mage pet chain stun a mob with a few procs, and that is some big agro, but since you are tanking and are near the NPC, the mob is on you, but still, the pet has the higher agro. Piggyback the hate of the pets, means that you taunt and 'hop' over the pet's big agro, that is, of course, over yours, and which puts you, way higher than the other meeles/ casters :)<br />
<br />
You can use this tactic with BST and Mage pets the most, other classes pets might not generate as much agro with their procs (unless a Mage gives those pets some stunning weapons I guess).<br />
<br />
I think that kinda covers it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bracers of benevolence are another good quest you can do at your level. last a long time too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rheven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks all. I appreciate each of your comments and suggestions. I did upgrade to the Bloodsworn, using it right now with the snowchipper since they both process. Aggro is noticeablly better. I expect to bring in a Copper Hammer for the offhand. Although 1hb is like 20 I think. That should prove interesting. I also traded for that 80 hp cloak as well.<br />
<br />
One of the times I died yesterday I took a look at my base stats unbuffed. <br />
3026 - hp; 1087 AC; and, 1061 ATK. <br />
strength - 200<br />
stamina - 159<br />
agility - 123<br />
dexterity - 160<br />
wisdon, 95, intelligence, 92, and charisma 75.<br />
<br />
Agility bothers me somewhat I guess. And charisma. You'd think a redhead would have a higher base rating. *laughs* I starting to put some of the disciplines into use. just /shield %Target for example? Taunting mezzes first. I learned yesterday that this is very important to your health.  Positioning *nods*. I'm glad we have this board. Tactics are very important when you have to go earn your aggro.<br />
<br />
Rheven</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One thing I found handy, as I think a lot of tanks do, is to make shield hotkeys for your group.  Depending on the situation, I have up to 3 shield hotkeys.  One for the healer, 2nd is for slower or crowd control, and 3rd key is sort of a utility key... usually I use it if there's both a shaman and a chanter in the group, or if there's a squishy caster of some kind who might need it :p  Mainly tho, I always have the healer and the slower hotkeyed.  <br />
<br />
Something else that might work for you, is shaman potions.  I don't know if your shaman does alchemy, but a number of those potions are damn handy, especially in pickup groups where often as not, you can't get all the buffs you want.  I usually keep sta buffs, damage shields, invis, lev, and gate potions on me.  At the very least, they can be really handy when you have to travel through a zone to join a group that is already at a camp.  Groups love, and tend to remember, players who come equipped like that and don't need the group to send someone over to invis them, etc.<br />
<br />
As other people have said, positioning is huge.  Pet classes love having a tank who compensates a mob's position for their pets.  And as someone else said, separating the mobs on mass pulls is nice for everyone involved, as it not only helps your crowd control, but it also helps the rest of the group avoid breaking mezzes.  Ask the chanters you group with which mobs they want deaded next.  Seems they all have different styles of playing, and until you get to know a person, they often seem to want it done differently.  Biggest thing is, be adaptable in different situations... there is never a case of one particular thing/style/whatever always working the best in every single situation.<br />
<br />
I'd comment on your gear, but magelo is down, and other ppl seem to have done it well already.  But, the basics are pretty much the same... raw HP, AC, saves are all important, as to a lesser extent are stats.  I wouldn't worry too much about your agi stat, as parsing has shown it really doesn't make that much difference in avoidance.  As for the cha.... well, no accounting for NPC tastes somedays, is there?  :p<br />
<br />
-Edited to add-  As Valeris says below, once you have the Copper Hammer, just train up that skill as you can; higher dexterity helps that.  You'll be getting most of the aggro from that weapon from the proc, and the proc will go off no matter how weakly you are hitting the mob.  If you can, keep all of your weapon skills trained up.  It can be frustrating to get a really nice weapon that you have very low skill in, and you have to take the time and train up that skill before you see the full benefit of said weapon.<br />
<br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't sweat the agility for the moment benefits beyond the point you're at now are very minor bang for buck. Charisma is pretty much irrelevant at this level of gameplay apart from RP considerations.<br />
<br />
You should aggro just as well equipping your 1hb even if you don't hit much - get dex buffs and practise to get it up as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">arf arf<br />
<br />
/agree Rheven - I haven't found a class board yet as good as this one, I am 10 times the warrior I would be if I hadn't been stopping by here over the last year or so.<br />
<br />
Tactics are very important when you have to go earn your aggro.<br />
Tactics are always important IMO, but I take your meaning.  Even if aggro lock from spells makes it viable to skip them, the group is going to work and survive better with good tactics.  I've grouped with knights who understood engagement strategies and those who don't, and I tend to avoid the latter ;).  And so, even tho the upcoming Provoke line and other changes should soften the curve for the warrior class, these are important tricks to know.<br />
<br />
One further note about pulling mobs off the wall ... you will sometimes have to stand in the center of the room hollering 'BACK OFF NOW' repeatedly before the party dials in.  Especially with non-pet class pets (ie: Shaman spirit wolves), whose masters are yet learning the knack of controlling a pixel critter. (And you may have to howl to get them to take /pet attack off their assist key.)<br />
<br />
Sitting in the center of the room also pulls MOBs effectively, but if the party health is good I like to remind the group why they need to pay attention from time to time.  With regular group mates this is more effective in the long run.  But with p/u groups you may just wanna hold their hands as they won't learn quickly enough and may only remember that they stole aggro, or that the MOB got walled, and blame you (and thus, becoming your future naysayers when your waiting for a p/u invite).<br />
<br />
One further note - experiment with your camera modes (iirc, F9 is the default key) ... I almost always am using the chase 3rd person camera, set overhead and back in a nearly isometric viewpoint.  I can see all or most of my party at camp this way, and when I am line the mobs back to the casters, I have 3 cues available to me that they are casting - the text message, the spell particles, and the casting anim.  (If they're smart, I have the fourth cue in my /gsay window ;).)  It's at the point now that I'm pretty certain what the spell is by the animation and the timing alone.<br />
<br />
I love positioning the mob, it pulls me into the group dynamic and I enjoy the game a lot more since I started paying more attention to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its more useful to make just 1 Shield key.<br />
/assist mob<br />
/shield PC<br />
/assist PC<br />
And you are back targetting the mob :)<br />
Simple, doesnt require that you make 6 hotkeys and has no chance of you shielding the wrong person by accident, plus, it works on a multiple groups enviroment  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">arf arf<br />
<br />
Re-assisting the PC sometimes targets me, if it's the healer, or if I've regained aggro by the time I hit the key assisting the mob gets me and I can't assist myself.  So I just have a vanilla /assist key and a /shield key.  The assist key I use to assist the puller as well, so for two hotkeys I'm gtg on pulls and shields.  My target toggle key is set up on the Num pad, as are my hotkeys, everything is handy dandy.  Of course, the most important thing is to do what works for *you*.<br />
<br />
One note about sitting to move a MOB ... tried it tonight in PoM to pull a MOB outta the corner.  It didn't work, and it just summoned the pet back everytime we tried to back it off.  There are times the bastige just won't move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I used shield a lot in raids so had /assist and /shield on seperate keys - adds a little extra clunkiness and you need to be sure you don't rush the keypress and miss the assist when lagging, but is more flexible. I had the 'switch to last target' key mapped right next door (look for it in your options menu's) to return to the mob once I'd shielded - or if another offtanker had just grabbed the mobs attention and shielding wasn't required :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I tried setting up my /shield key to<br />
<br />
/assist %T<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
But everytime I do that the %T get replaced with the curent mobs name and the /shield key has the target name behind it.  so it winds up looking like this-<br />
<br />
/assist a Moss Snake<br />
/shield Tashnslow<br />
<br />
where Tashnslow is the name of the chanter :P<br />
<br />
I've just gone back to having 2 /shield hotkeys, one with the name of my groups slower and one with the name of my groups healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Learn about the other classes as much as you can. Learn about their possibilities. Have a look at your group and look what they can do ( chanter and chanter is a big differenz ..... ) Try to bring out the best possible out of that group.<br />
<br />
Learn to be the tactician of the group. Don't be the stupid tank standing there fighting what someone brings to you. <br />
<br />
When you see something disturbing the mashine youre group should be ... use tell to inform the &quot;Moron&quot; to fit into the group ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Alot of good advice here.  Only thing I'd add is that kilva flameshield potions are your friend.  They stack with most anything and can swing a LDoN in a poor group.  Personally I use them like candy.<br />
<br />
Also (if not mentioned above): get a slowing weapon (ala Truncheon of Doom, Wavecrasher)...you'd be amazed how much groups will love you if you can swap in this weap after your slower takes a dirt nap.  There are other weaps out there with nice utilities (snare, root etc) using them appropriately also can make you stand out.</div></div><hr />
