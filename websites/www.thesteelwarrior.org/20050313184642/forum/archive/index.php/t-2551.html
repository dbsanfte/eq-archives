<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Foog</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the moment I am looking for suggestions for belt and cloak upgrades.  My main conern is ac/hp.  Problem is without checking every loot table out there I only know what I have seen.  Hoping to get a sample of suggestions of items I may have possibly never even heard of so that when I ask for an upgrade it will be an informed opinion. *edit* Do have elemental access not Time access atm.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

You will have to have some knowledge or cross referance with allakazam or a DKP database for drop information.<br />

Is there any information about where it drops.  Like what zone or even mob although zone would be enough atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't take this wrong, but looks like a lotta spiffy VT gears there and SSRA etc... for ya not to know what waits in ELE's... anywho no biggie.  Look up a couple of these gems (I'm way to lazy to put links :P).<br />
<br />
First, I'd almost figure you'd want a Stonewood Bow b4 gettin rid of your only haste but who am I?  :P<br />
<br />
Back items of note:  <br />
<br />
Exquisite Phoenix Feather Mantle - off Xegony<br />
Drape of the Agile - PoF mini<br />
Leaf-Jointed Cloak - PoE<br />
<br />
Belts:<br />
Girdle of Earthen Stability - PoE<br />
Cord of the Pyre - PoF<br />
<br />
Personally I'd focus more on molds than secondary slots.  Your existing cloak ain't bad and your belt ain't bad either.  Better upgrades are available to you via Raex imho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Foog</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have molds on the brain they're kind of a given as far as upgrade path.  Was just thinking of the slots I couldn't say ok yeah I want item_xx in that slot.  The lucy look up thing is cool though because I do want an upgrade in hp but I want a balanced upgrade with some decent ac.  There are some nice belts out there for instance but a few only have 15 ac.  As for knowing what's in the EPs we just broke in so I can't recite what drops off of who just yet like I can some of the older zones.  But I agree Raex is definately something I want as well if not first.<br />

Bracers of Earthen Energy (Earth)<br />
Flowing Moss Mantle (Earth)<br />
I'm sure I've forgotten some, but they're fairly solid options without losing too much from Raex.<br />
<br />
For back slot, if you want a fast upgrade, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option than:<br />
Cloak of Combustion (Fire)<br />
Drops on Quavonis, one of the minis, 23ac 140hp and +5dodge, together with 35sv magic/cold. Pretty nice all round cloak.<br />
There's also:<br />
Ensorcelled Metalcloth Cape (Air) which is pretty nice<br />
<br />
Problem is without checking every loot table out there I only know what I have seen. <br />
<br />
Not a problem if you use a site as cleanly set out as http://loot.darkwind-guild.com. By far the most convenient and well thought out high-end loot overview I have seen. You can't search by slot or stat or anything, but you can browse by zone and mob and get the full known loot tables. I wouldn't take too long to go through all 4 ele zones and look at every single loot item, then note down the ones you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cloak - Leaf Jointed Cloak (Perfected Warder of Earth)<br />
Belt - Cord of Pyre (Fennin Ring)<br />
<br />
That's probably the best two elemental item you can get.  Of course, there are better items off the gods if you want to go there.<br />
<br />
Cloak of Combustion (Quavonis) and Ensorcelled Metal Cape (some Avatar in Air) are okay too for cloaks.  Girdle of Earthen Stability (Peregrin) is okay for belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure how your guild works, but getting a cloak of combustion is bound to set your wizzies / druids / ranja and shammy's for a loop as the effect is a 25% bonus on cold n00ks...  drape of the agile has a bit less still has an 8% dodge mod and solid hps / saves...<br />
<br />
He's pretty right about the haste items too, although I forgot to mention Band of Swirling Air.  9AC 135hps etc... and 41% haste.  Personally saving up for a FMM or Bracer like he stated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skycrasher</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd go for the mantle from xegony and girdle from poe rock ring, if you cant get the mantle from xegony any time soon, go for the leaf jointed cloak from dust ring in earth</div></div><hr />
