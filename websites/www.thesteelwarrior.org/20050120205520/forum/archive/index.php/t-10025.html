Backflagging * <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
As you know, when a guild gains or loses members, they often find themselves dedicating a large amount of time re-playing content that they have long since completed in order to gain access to zones for newer members. During our Community Summit this last summer, and in many subsequent discussions, we have heard the recurring desire to find a way to ease the frustrations associated with this backflagging. <br />
<br />
While the issue is not as simple as removing flags altogether (we feel flags are necessary for the zones they are currently attached to), we have looked into ways that we can reduce the frustrations of backflagging and feel that we have arrived at a fair and equitable solution, which is detailed below. <br />
<br />
- A new implementation of the 85/15 rule has been introduced into Planes of Power zones including the Plane of Time. This should resolve the outstanding problems that occur from time to time with the current 85/15 implementation. <br />
<br />
- The new 85/15 has also been introduced for the locked zones in Gates of Discord. <br />
<br />
- An alternate means of flagging guild mates for locked content in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord has been implemented that will allow you to flag raid members for the zone you are in by completing raid content within that zone. <br />
<br />
The implementation varies slightly from zone to zone to fit the story and nature of the zone, but in general will involve killing a raid target within that zone, looting an item, and completing a single group quest to change that item into a zone flag. This only applies to zones that don't already have a single group task or system to gain access. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AA Changes <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- Reduced the cost of many Gates AAs. Players will receive a refund equal to the difference on AAs that now have a lower cost. * <br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Crippling Strike to an activated ability that does an eagle strike attack as well as a snare. <br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Stunning Kick to an activated ability that does a round kick attack as well as a stun. <br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Eye Gouge to an activated ability that does a tiger claw attack as well as reduces the targets offensive ability. <br />
<br />
- Due to major changes in how these work, AA points for Crippling Strike, Stunning Kick, and Eye Gouge have been refunded. <br />
<br />
- Reduced the reuse time of the Ranger AAs Frost Arrow and Flame Arrow to 3 minutes. * <br />
<br />
- Hobble of Spirits will now stack with the Beastlord's proc buffs. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take. <br />
<br />
- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs. <br />
<br />
- If your stored AA's go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA. * <br />
<br />
- If your character was created before EQ started storing starting location data, when you log into the game you will now be prompted to choose your home city from a list of valid starting locations for your character. You will only need to do this once and once this has been set, it cannot be changed. This will correct the problems with the Origin AA not returning some characters to their expected home city. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone and NPC Changes <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- Hot Spots have been moved (level ranges are approximate): * <br />
Shadeweaver&#8217;&#8217;s Thicket 1-30 <br />
Kurn&#8217;s Tower 10-25 <br />
Unrest 15-30 <br />
Crystal Caverns 25-35 <br />
Solusek&#8217;s Eye 25-45 <br />
Katta Castellum 30-60 <br />
Lower Guk 35-55 <br />
Nagafen&#8217;s Lair 40-55 <br />
Umbral Plains 50-60 <br />
<br />
- Respawn time for the bosses in Tacvi has been increased from 3 to 5 days. <br />
<br />
- Some Tacvi loot has been upgraded. Bosses now drop more items per kill and some all new items have been added to the zone. * <br />
<br />
- An alternate entrance into Tacvi has been added in Txevu that will allow guilds to bypass the Zun&#8217;Muram after they have defeated him at least once. Guilds that have previously defeated the Zun&#8217;Muram will need to do so at least once more before they can use the new entrance. * <br />
<br />
- Gilipus of Ak`Anon has joined the Beta Neutral Faction. You will now be able to complete his quest without having to raise Gem Choppers Faction. <br />
<br />
- The 3 Tormentors in the Jelvan event now share hatelist when idle or aggro. Anyone that is on one Tormentor's hatelist, but not on the other 2 Tormentor's hatelist will be added. This should make it difficult (if not impossible) to avoid AOEs. <br />
<br />
- Modified the Warden Hanvar event, all guards should appear in their appointed places. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug in Anguish that could make Warden Hanvar unkillable. <br />
<br />
- Clicking on the door to Anguish while having the Seal: Mastery of All on your person will now prompt red text indicating your flag has been granted. <br />
<br />
- The respawn of Globes of Discordant Energy are now tracked on the event timer for Anguish. The method for obtaining the Globes has not changed. <br />
<br />
- The pile of stones that was used as a secondary zone between Dranik and Bloodfields has been removed. There is now an actual zoneline there. <br />
<br />
- Plane of Justice - previously, you could not click the red teleports to leave the Seventh Hammer's room unless the Seventh Hammer was dead (or not up). This has been changed so you can leave the room as long as it is not aggro. If you click on a portal while he is aggro, you should get a message and remain in the room. <br />
<br />
- Grennet Stormhand in North Qeynos is no longer a task master since he is part of a quest. His task master job has been taken over by Jorren Boxmover. <br />
<br />
- Increased the maximum duration for all Labyrinth Trials from 1 hour to 2 hours. When an event is successfully completed, the instance will shut down in 30 minutes. If it is failed, the instance will shut down in 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
- Changed the reclusive Girplan event in Bloodfields so that each NPC in the sequence stays up for 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes before depopping. <br />
<br />
- Elemental NPCs are once again Charmable in Bastion of Thunder. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskill Changes <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- The Tradeskill window will now allow up to 500 favorites (up from 100). * <br />
<br />
- The drop rate of spiderling silk has been increased, as there are many new combines that require this item as a component. * <br />
<br />
- The Rune of Zephyr should now drop off of the appropriate level of NPC&#8217;s. * <br />

<br />
- Fixed a few grammatical issues with the &quot;Forge of Icewell Arms&quot; book. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Item, Spell, Discipline and Skill Changes <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- Auto range attack implemented, no longer will it be necessary to range attack manually - /autofire is a toggle command that will fire your ranged weapon until you run out of ammunition, turn on autoattack to switch to melee combat, or use the /autofire command again. * <br />
<br />
- /melody ability implemented for bards - To use /melody, type /melody &lt;song#&gt; &lt;song#&gt; &lt;song#&gt; &lt;etc&gt;. The numbers are the same numbers you would use for the /cast command. The melody will repeat the songs in the specified order until a note is missed due to an interruption. * <br />
<br />
- Modified Mirrored Mask, so it is no longer no rent and poof on death, however the click effect only works inside Anguish. <br />

<br />
- Fixed a bug with the Frenzy of Conquest benefit. <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
- Holyforge will now increase your chance to slay undead, and if you have the Slay Undead AA you will have an even greater chance of a slay with Holyforge. * <br />
<br />
- The spell Nature's Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn't have. It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments. <br />
<br />
- When combining the aegis of chaotic worship with the soul temper and a flask of water, you will receive the temper and the aegis of chaotic worship back if you don't have the correct flags instead of just the aegis back. <br />

<br />
- Fixed several inconsistencies with pets affected by focus items. <br />
<br />
- Increased the mana regen gained by Elemental Simulacrum. <br />
<br />
- Touch of the Devourer was changed to allow partial damage when it is resisted. This is an increase in the overall damage of the spell. <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
- The effect on the Wristband of Secrets no longer works on other players. <br />

Hastening of the Ikaav <br />
Quickening of the Ikaav <br />
Alacrity of the Ikaav <br />

<br />
- The the class-specific quest chest armors from Omens of War now have a .8 second cast time. <br />
<br />
- The pre-nerf LDoN armor sets can now be sold back to the merchants, like other LDoN items. They are the versions with two type 2 slots and one type 3 slot (instead of one each of types 1, 2, and 3). These items are those with the following in the item name: <br />
Royal Attendant * of Sand <br />
Incorporeal * of the Specter <br />
Mucus-Drenched * <br />
Immortal's Bloodied * <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- Multiple procs on a pet are now working properly. * <br />
<br />
- A resource leak in the graphics engine was corrected and we have seen a measurable improvement in client stability as a result. <br />
<br />
- The sky system now influences the ambient lighting. <br />
<br />
- Animated traps such as the ones in soldunga/b are now detected by the collision system and will cause a small amount of damage. <br />
<br />
- You can once again target things on the other side of a water surface and other passable surfaces. <br />
<br />
- Added code to check and validate specialization skills. If the values are not legal, the player will be informed why they are not legal and they are reset. <br />
<br />
- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC. * <br />
<br />
- Added optional parameters to /book command -- /book open, /book close. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed bug where a player who had more than 2 million plat in his inventory was unable to purchase anything from a vendor or trader. <br />
<br />
- /yell messages are no longer displayed if the yelling player is in your ignore list. * <br />
<br />
- Some models that were scaled dramatically could cause the collision system to fail, resulting in warps to ceiling and other strange side effects. For example the vases in dranikcatacombsa at 1000,-1011, 0 would always cause players to be pinned to the ceiling due to this bug. <br />
<br />
- Players standing on the lip of an edge should now slide down off them more smoothly. <br />
<br />
- There have been some optimizations to the collision system. You should see improved performance in zones with very large stationary objects (potimea, bloodfields, etc). <br />
<br />
- Fixed a number of small bugs in the zoom camera behavior. These fixes include removing the possibility of having the first mousewheel click causing the camera to bounce back into first person, a bug that could cause the camera to get stuck &#8220;one click&#8221; out of first person, as well as smoothing out the camera motion a bit. <br />
<br />
- Scrolling to third person and tabbing to another window should no longer cause the screen to bounce back and forth. <br />
<br />
- Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through geometry. <br />
<br />
- Getting out of water should be much easier to do. * <br />
<br />
- Mounts are no longer dismissed when zoning. * <br />
<br />
- Spell scribe timers (putting a new spell into the spell book) now take only 1 second. <br />
<br />
- Players should no longer experience 20k falls when standing on cliff edges while suffering from low frame rate. <br />
<br />
- The bounding radius for small races was too tall, preventing them from accessing some areas. For example, gnomes couldn't enter the small huts in Steamfont. This was a global problem that is now fixed; that is just one example. <br />
<br />
- Weather effects are now working properly when the Wake of Karana spell is used. Additionally, sounds related to starting <br />
<br />
- /who commands now display both class title and base class name for players over level 50, e.g. &quot;Bedazzler (Enchanter)&quot; * <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone Revamps - Mistmoore (Legends) <br />
----------------------- <br />
<br />
In Mistmoore's Catacombs, the servants of the Trueborn, a sect of vampires with Mayong Mistmoore's blood flowing through their veins, grew tired of their masters throwing them into the fray against the Norrathian intruders. They came to desire more power for themselves. <br />
<br />
It was not long before the first words of dissension crept through the catacombs on the will of whispers. The Trueborn servants congregated in dark, musty halls away from the eyes of their masters and over time their numbers grew along with their ambitions. Their time had come and soon they would rise up to claim their rightful place in Mistmoore Castle, gaining accolades from Lord Mayong Mistmoore himself for their brilliance and bravery -- or so they supposed. <br />
<br />
Over several months, the Trueborn traitors recruited an army to their cause. On a black night as the moon was swallowed by a thick veil over Faydwer, they struck, killing their masters and leading their army toward Mistmoore Castle. They slaughtered all in their path and many masters of the Scions sect, the Trueborn's rival blood-children of Mayong, were destroyed that night. <br />
<br />
The fierce wave of the lesser Trueborn rushed into the cellars of Mistmoore Castle without detection. Unbeknownst to all but the servants, Norrath's adventurers had uncovered winding caves beneath the surface that bypassed the castle&#8217;s defenses. In a matter of hours, the castle was overrun and the servants of the Trueborn declared themselves the true Children of Mistmoore. <br />
<br />
Since taking control of the castle, many Children have busied themselves repairing the damage from the battle while others continue to seek the magical ore that was uncovered in the catacombs. <br />
<br />
They all prepare, waiting for the day their master returns to grant them glory. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone Revamps - Splitpaw (Legends) <br />
----------------------- <br />
<br />
Farsoth Mal, son of the Ishva Mal, leader of the Verishe Mal tribe, sat by his father&#8217;s side watching him rule his minions in Splitpaw Lair. His father may have conquered this lair some years ago, but Farsoth believed they should rule far more than just one underground kingdom. He grew to despise his father for his lack of ambition and many hours were spent in bitter arguments between the two. The Ishva Mal grew tired and angry at the ceaseless challenges to his authority, gaining as much contempt for his son as his son had for him. <br />
<br />
During a particularly heated argument of growls and grisly barks, the Ishva Mal reminded his willful son that his power was absolute and that he shared his throne with no one. With one quick motion, the Ishva Mal brandished his spear and sliced off his son's paw, determined that he would finally win the respect he deserved from his son. But the Ishva Mal's cruel methods would prove to be his downfall. <br />
<br />
The Ishva Mal grew to be a greater tyrant each day, so much so that the Verishe Mal mages and warriors secretly formed the Council of Nine to challenge his rule. Farsoth saw the plans the Verishe Mal had in store for his father, but did nothing to stop them and instead chose to use them to his advantage. <br />
<br />
Farsoth learned much from the council's mages and became obsessed with the summoning arts they practiced. His fascination eventually led to a plan that would secure the throne . . . for him. <br />
<br />
Through all he'd learned from the Verishe Mal mages, he believed he could summon a powerful entity from the Plane of Fire itself. Farsoth thought with such power at his side, nothing could stop him from ruling the Splitpaw Lair and any lands he desired. <br />
<br />
He prepared for weeks, researching and gathering the reagents he required and finally he set to work to summon a terrible beast to bring an end to his father's rule. <br />
<br />
Farsoth was distracted by his own anger, forgetting vital components as he wove the spell and the unthinkable happened. Flames shot out of the portal that Farsoth opened and, at the same time, rocks rained down upon the inhabitants of the lair. Then, the portal shifted its focus and water flooded into the corridors, extinguishing the flames and washing away the rocks. The portal shimmered once more and waves of all types of elementals poured into Splitpaw. <br />
<br />
Farsoth certainly attained part of his goal. His father was killed, but so to were most of the gnolls he wished to lead to greatness. <br />
<br />
Now he is a prisoner to the swarms of enraged elementals that have made Splitpaw Lair their new home. <br />

Now all the woodelf rangers will spend 98% of their time foraging and attempting to fit more roots into their bags during fights, rather than the 80% of their time before.I didnt have a chance to play around with autofire on Test, but I'm gonna go out of a limb here and assume it works the same as autoattack. Which will mean you'll have to turn autofire off to Forage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1. Piggybacking into KT for yxxta/ikkinz (doing tipts everytime we have a new recruit who needs it, are such a pita.)<br />
<br />
2. Getting rid of the splash screen, they said they would do it months ago when they put it in, but they haven't. <br />
<br />
3. Fixing Weaponry trial so its not so insanely close, i've beaten it 4 times all within like 10seconds remaining.<br />
<br />
4. All no drops get a tribute value. So much shit we have rotting in elemental and nothing to do with it, we got almost a full set of leather in Fire yesterday and it all rotted along with 5 pieces of silk.<br />
<br />
5. I wish they'd fix damage spikes in OoW... I was tanking the boss in Weaponry with defensive and 30 avoidance/15shielding, 14400hp and he had a damage spike of 7k on me, 1700+1900+1720+1750+400  and we lost trial, complete bs when i've beaten it with ease over 30 times.</div></div><hr />

Just saying that damage spiking in OoW is pretty bad, from zun`muram volkana's hitting for 1500'ish then suddenly hitting for 4 rounds of 3500 then procing his 4k ae.  Bridgekeeper, Feratha, Tarn, Chailak and a few other OoW raid encounters have big damage spikes, i'll download YALP for the next time I play and parse their hits.<br />

There are just 4 mobs in weaponry and they wake up in a random order so I don't see how one could be called a boss. Weaponry mobs don't do much DPS either, certainly not 1700's hits under defensive (which no warrior would ever use on weaponry in the first place)...

and to be frank, I've never in all the runs I've done with ingenuity had a bad dmg spike that a shaman + cleric couldn't handle.  Some nail biters yes, but nothing horribly f-d up.<br />
