Drops, rare and common, vendor trash, rare and common gems. something of value usually drops of every other mob, so if u are duoing or soloing there, you can make quite a decent amount of money in a short time, plus on the rare RBG/SBC (not sure if sbc still drops or if it is really really really uberly rare) but it would probly be your best bet for cash, unless you like tradeskilling a lot :p <br />

If you bazar items, you can make nice money off items that you xp off of which are used for trade skills or research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As an alternative to seb or until you are high enough to get there, id go to Crystal caverns and farm acrylia bricks and crystalline threads. On my server the bricks alone go for about 50pp each or more and they sell pretty easily.<br />
<br />
Seb used to be a great money making area for me. In the days before PoP i could clear on average 1-2kpp a session in loot /gems/pp. However, since PoP, although its still good, its not as great as before - e.g BDs have dropped from 2k to about 500pp now, and a lot of other items which used to sell well have also dropped quite substantially. All the seb scale stuff that drops there is pretty much worthless now or vendor fodder. If possible, try and get to the decent camps like crypt or discos and dont waste time in the main areas, unless you can get a necrosis camp.<br />
