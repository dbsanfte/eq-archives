<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everybody :)  I've currently been doing a lot of LDoNs recently, for points and adventurer stone upgrades, and every single one of them has been a normal risk adventure.  I wouldn't be too annoyed with it, except that the normal adventures are ridiculously easy, and the experience and loot kinda suck.<br />
<br />
My gear is average at best (although I have upgraded significantly over the course of the last few weeks, see magelo), and with virtue/focus I buff out to around 5.6k hp and 1195 AC.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to start doing them with a group of friends, which consists of myself (obviously, 57 war), 57 ench, 56 monk, 55 cle, 55 sha and 51 rogue.  The chanter is very very good and everyone else is solid with their classes.<br />
<br />
I expect mobs to be in the mid 50s, and hit for low-mid 300s.  The only real X factor I can see is the ability of the monk to get single pulls, but like I said, the chanter is very very good.<br />
<br />
I'd probably stick with collects, as our group isn't high end on DPS, so slaughters might be a bit much.  What do you think, would I be able to adequately tank in hard difficulty LDoN adventures?  Feedback would be great.  Thanks :)<br />
<br />
BTW, anyone having problems with Magelo?  I have a few minor upgrades that I tried to make in my profile, yet nothing seemed to take.  Ah well, will check it tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nezlok</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like a nice, solid group you got going there.. As long as everyone gets c3 before doing the ldon,  should be ok. If the cleric knows when to CH, and the shm knows how to slow, and the monk can single pull, everything should be super easy esp. for collects. Since monk is pulling, best is to give him the most space possibly, therefore Rujarkian Hills is probably the absolute best choice to start. Also, Takish would be good, but htere are alot more small tunnels that make it harder for hte monk to pull, just depends on his skill hehe. And you cant forget about snares, otherwise youll be really screwed; so take that into account....<br />

Aye, have had quite a few problems concerning augs, wont lemme aug some of my items that definetly have a slot open.. wonder whats wrong with it, heh?</div></div><hr />

Those will last you a good looooong time.  Same case with the greaves.   Other than that, looking good for your level. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would most likely be wanting to LDoN in Miragul's Menagerie, because I desperately need EF points for Anger III augs.  From what I've seen, it's pretty easy to get single pulls in there, although one of the dungeons is this hazy light blue that's quite annoying.<br />
<br />
The velium geode bracelets are most certainly the next pieces to go.  I have about 10 pieces that I want to replace, most of it with Fierce Heraldic cultural armor.  I have already replaced the leggings with Kylong Shinguards, but I'd forgotten to update the magelo.  That's fixed.  Also, some of the equipment that I'm wearing isn't actually mine, but on loan from a guild member.  I will have to eventually return the Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement, Livestone Plate Boots and Valorium Ring of Gallantry.  I don't expect that to happen for another month or so, which gives me pretty ample time to get replacements for them.<br />
<br />
Another question:  I've been considering purchasing a Mosquito Leg Earring to replace the Dark Hoop of Spirits.  They run about 9k on Torvonnilous (haven't seen them any cheaper than 8.9k).  Aside from the fact that I can't afford to buy one, though, I've been holding off on upgrading that particular slot because I would eventually like to get 2 Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement.  Would it be worth the interim upgrade to get the Mosquito Leg Earring, knowing that I'll have to upgrade it again down the line?<br />
<br />
I'll try to set up my wish list when I get home (at work right now) for you guys to pick apart.  Any further advice would be appreciated.  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

I'd go for the mosquito leg, myself.  It's a dang nice earring in it's own right.  Once you have enough for another bloodmetal, you can always sell it.</div></div><hr />
