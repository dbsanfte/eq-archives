<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They asked before what mods/proc etc we'd want on epic 2.0, I missed that thread. It did get me thinking though, and I thought there were 3 elements to tanking... Aggro, Avoidance, Mitigation. If they were to make the epic 2 weapons I was thinking something like this would be really cool, and could also add a bit of lore to the blades. Have one blade have a history based on avoidance, and being quicker than the opponent, enhancing the reflexes, etc., the avoidance blade. Have the other be based on mitigation, it offers shielding. Both would offer significant aggro via the proc, but do it different ways. The shielding blade being the pure rage inciting, and the avoidance blade getting aggro through stuns (i.e. further avoidance). So the two blades would pan out to:<br />
<br />
Avoidance Blade:<br />
+ Avoidance<br />
+ Riposte/Parry/Dodge %'s (whatever is appropriate)<br />
+ Combat Effects<br />
Focus: Improved Riposte 3 (or parry)<br />
Proc: Whirl of Blade (1.0 Sec Stun/80 200DD -300mr check)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mitigation Blade:<br />
+ Shielding<br />
+ High AC<br />
+ Combat Effects<br />
No focus (as that would make us have 2)<br />
+ Lots of HP<br />
Proc: Incitation of War (80-100dd, +x hate (appropriate amount) -50ac)<br />
<br />
Just spouting off ideas, if there's a better spot for this, feel free to move it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">does anybody remember the shield of the slain unicorn?<br />
<br />
so what about :<br />
<br />
Shield of the Slain Dragon<br />
 * bad ratio cause of big delay<br />
 * big AC (with the shield flag so we can bash and pump up AC soft cap)<br />
 * shielding and avoidance<br />
 * some DS<br />
 * normal  HP/stat<br />
 * Focus : Parry 3 or if availlable/possible Ripost 3<br />
 * Proc : Dragon's Bash (1.0 Sec Stun/80, -50ATK, -50AC, -300prismatic check)  (with the increased debuff slot on mob it should be ok)<br />
<br />
Razing Sword of ***** (I can't find any cool name of god/dragon that would make other say &quot;cooooolll&quot;, maybe Kerafin since he is still in the legend)<br />
 * top ratio (I mean like DBotW and top GoD dps 1Her)<br />
 * big Combat effect<br />
 * normal  HP/stat<br />
 * focus : Double attack 3 (or better flurry 3)<br />
 * proc : Frenzy Slice (32-60DD random, +200Hate, +500% proc rate, unresistable)<br />
note : on this one I choosed a gimp hate spell but a monstruous proc rate in order to make the Hate generation smoother and (this is the main reason) more reliable during short fight (afterall even with WA5 and some CE we can still see one full minute without any proc, so increasing its appearence is much more important than anything else. So basically I putted the proc mod to have a sixth more chance to proc, and then divided the proc by five to compensate).<br />
<br />
PS : yes I miss the old world, but I think it would be great to have the link with it (at least with the naming). And yes I know tha the RSoSkarlon is a 2Her, but we can make the new one a 1Her and still keep a related name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note that Improved Riposte isn't a focus effect. Focus effects affect spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saw that thread, but the due time is way passed for suggestions, which is what i thought that thread was for, was just kicking around fun ideas now.<br />
<br />
Ha, I remember that Yoda, is a cool idea too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep for focus.<br />
they have been created for spell, but the melee effect that we have appeared with GoD are global multipliers of the result, not bonus for the skill number (ie is you parry 5.6% of incomming attak from Da_Big_Mob_05 them with 24% in improved parry you will then parry 6.9% of its hit).<br />
this is why we speak about melee focus and not skill bonus (remember that 8% dodge skill bonus whose effect wasn't parsable, this was skill bonus, not melee focus).<br />
<br />

<br />
something like~<br />
200ac 400hp<br />
Shielding +10<br />
Avoidance +50<br />
Worn Effect similar to Echo of Anger...only 4x or 5x stronger<br />
<br />
Would give us everything we want but dps...and we arent a dps class<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the shield of the slain unicorn is a piercer that has been created at the time only slam and bash were able to stun. so a non-giant race wasn't able to stun its target without a shield. to balance the different races in the tanking role, they created this weapon that allowed to DW and to Bash.<br />
so my proposition is still superior than a normal shield (if we don't compare the stats and effects).</div></div><hr />

Are you positive about this?<br />
<br />
Cleave on the Tipt bracers allow classes without crits to be able to crit. If, as you suggest, it was a modifier on existing rates, it shouldn't make any difference to those with no ability. A % increase to 0 is always gonna be 0.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep you are right. I forgot about this. I got hang by dev standpoint that EoA was like focus (well yea 'like' not 'is', make a difference afterall).<br />
then it means it's a constant % bonus, which is interesting for low apperence skills (flurry less than one per min) or for classes that don't have it.<br />
This gimp even more our Vadd's Breastplate, we have a bonus that we don't care about, and now it apears that we may have the less profit from it compared to other classes with the same effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We aren't a dps class, but we're still suppose to have more dps than knights, which we wouldnt with a normal shield. Essentially there's an order of balance that was suppose to come into play with originally just rogues and monks ahead of warriors in melee dps. Things have changed but I still wouldn't want to see us turn into just blobs that tank. I like the shield of the slain unicorn follow up though, that'd be nice to see again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tekt`Urok</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, cant bash with shield of slain unicorn unless you could right before kunark came out. thats when i got it. i remember cause i was mad i traded my bronze longsword for it. and 15 plat and couldnt even bash with it and my peircing sucked. :cool: but i thought about a shield that could do that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, shield of the slain unicorn was not a shield at all. It was just a sub-par piercing weapon with 10 ac, and an incredibly awesome shield graphic. I would love to see a shield for an epic, maybe with flat-out insane stats (like 200ac, 500hp, lots of saves), maybe a decent chunk of shielding, and some sort of focus/ability that makes the Bash skill worthwhile. Not just a furious bash type mod, but more of a mod that makes you bash for like 200-300+ and maybe some kind of bash-haste so you can bash faster too. Either that, or make it an offhand weapon with insanely high stats/ac (like shield of the slain unicorn type idea), with a ratio something like 40/50 or something to that extent, slow and hard-hitting. And, for the love of god, give it a cool shield graphic... no puny ass round shield type thing, make it like a big ass tower shield or kite shield almost as tall as your character. That would be straight up awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get back on my previous statment on melee focus (post #5 on this thread) because Cleave (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3883&amp;source=Live) isn't a focus but Improved Dodge (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3889&amp;source=Live) is. As you can see on lucy, cleave effect is &quot;give x% chance to crit&quot; but dodge is &quot;increase chance to dodge by x%  &quot;.<br />
so melee focus exist, and cleave isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />
