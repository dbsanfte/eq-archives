Recently after being ST in flagging PU raids due to my HP, I've been thinking I need to improve my AC.  I'm just not quite sure how at this point.  I get so sick and tired of the warrior measuring stick always being HP.  I mean for goodness sakes, if you have no AC, it's going to tear through your HP.  But, I myself have taken the more HP route so I can get groups.  You know how it is, you're lfg and get the random tell asking for your HP.  I actually had the experience of being told 8.5K HP was not enough for a hard LDoN.  Didn't even ask if I had LR5/ID5 which I do.  You don't need 10K tanks for everything.</div></div><hr />

I'd probably throw one in your shoulders and maybe belt. Get 5 ac augments for your neck, mask and cloak. That right there would be 35 raw ac, or about 56 visible. Other than that, just look for gear using 1ac = 6hp or so and you'll be fine. Hp surely isn't the end all if the mobs can't one round you.</div></div><hr />

O goshers no.  I run 8.2k buffed with 9/Kizaad's and 1590ac.   There starting to become &quot;easy&quot;.  If I shaman/bst buff to 8.6k there just about getting easy.  I'd image 1600ac+ and 9k those hard ldons would be pretty basic.<br />

I think this is still reasonable for a bazaar geared casual warrior, then as you move through the content it goes up.<br />
<br />
The huge ACs you see in end game warrior magelos are required for tanking mobs that quad for 3k, or for 2k in single group settings.  That kinda AC isn't required for casual grouping or even mid level raiding.<br />
<br />
Aim for 1600 as you finish VT / Elemental Flagging / LDoN points farming, then 1800 after some elemental farming, and 2k once in Time.</div></div><hr />

If you aren't raiding these places, getting more AC is hard.  HP wise, you need to be roughly 6k unbuffed.  Hard LDoNs might be somewhat difficult with these stats, but with a  good group you should see no problems.</div></div><hr />

The reson for that is are that mobs ATK very alot. The real isssue is:<br />
<br />
If you AC is lower than the mobs ATK you will get hit harder than if you is AC is higher than the mobs ATK.<br />
<br />
Thats why I feel that a comparison of 1 AC = 6 Hp is a incomplete answer.<br />
<br />
I try to get items that are high on AC and HP. I will never stop againing AC or HP because you will need more of the bouth as you tank harder and harder mobs.<br />
<br />
I know there are alot of &quot;AC freeks&quot; and &quot;HP freeks&quot; playing the warrior class. I try to place my gear somewhere in the middle with good AC and HP<br />
<br />
I think Beam (tide) posted a &quot;dmg healed&quot; parser somewhere with a tanking situation of a pop boss with different AC. If someone could digg that up, you will soon make up your own mind.</div></div><hr />

There are still quite a few items that offer 3-7 times more tribute than the plat they cost to buy, so getting enough trib points to keep ac3 or so, as well as hp6, running at all times isn't too bad. I took like 10 minutes a day on an alt in the bazaar looking for cheap prices on a few items, and acquired 80k tribute points for around 12k plat. All the items I used are the same plat/trib value today, and many of them can be found in the other thread on tribute items that's floating around. The tribute knocked me over 1500ac and 6500hp, and I feel it's worth the 1k plat or so I have to spend every once in a while to maintain my tribute amount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Well, the point is that a balanced formula will keep you balanced between good ac and hp. Of course more of both is better. Yes, it does depend on the mob's attack which is why AC got so important in PoP and even more so in GoD. The 1ac = 6hp formula is an approximation; it's a general statement that tries to do pretty well in all situations.</div></div><hr />

Max ac trib is a bit more, I think the 2 come out to 300ish an hour. Crap in ldon easy is great for tribute.<br />
<br />
The 10 ac augs are a good way to go and ferubi has 2 15 ac as well.<br />
<br />
Do some hard MM for the bloodied boots of dark rights, nice ac and hp upgrade.<br />
<br />
Sewers have a nice mask that used to drop fairly commonly, not sure now after the nerf. The amy chain mask can be bought and is ok as well. I'd suggest sewers though then stick a 10 ac aug on it.<br />
<br />
I'm hitting about 10500 and 1950 fully buffed and only focused on HP, only time I was concerned with ac was the slots where hp augs wouldn't go.</div></div><hr />

I've had it happen once in 3rd zone of GoD when it was new which is understandable..  other than that only time I've been asked for hp/ac/aas is during open raids decideing tank which again is understandable.. they want the best tank (was raid leader asking)<br />

If you're not in a stacked group you need to know that your tank isn't buffing out to 6k hps.  But 8500 is more than enough.  If you're going to GoD in a pickup group you have to be a little big masochistic, but asking hps is definitely not innappropriate there IMO.  If you're grinding exp in valor and want to know my hps, bite me.</div></div><hr />

As for the HP/AC, I run the max tribute for hp/ac all the time and its made a big difference.  I'm a pre-elemental/non VT tank and have seen a lot of improvements as my ac went up.  Recently, I tanked for some friend's alts in POI and was only getting hit for 29.  It was rather amusing and a good benchmark of how far I've come since last yet in terms of gear and aa.</div></div><hr />

With dyes, plus the none-too-reliable graphic system, you can't really look at someone and see how uber they are. Similarly, a guild tag is not worth much when it comes to judging someone's aa/items/stats. I know of warriors not in a guild that buff to 10k, and I know of warriors in ele+ guilds that buff to 6.5k. Honestly, if you refuse to answer someone's request for hp/ac/weapons/aa/whatever when it comes to doing stuff like ldon hard, GoD, ele/solro/potact groups, then it's your problem, not theirs. If you are LFG in poearth with 7k hp buffed, and nobody will group with you, there's a reason. Either make your own group, or go somewhere that's better suited to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact is, on hards you will get people asking your hp and ac.  We don't want to have to quit out because you thought you could tank.  You don't like it?  Tough, don't go /lfg then.  Class/level is understandable if you're not anon/role, but hp/ac is the reason I'm actually looking for you.<br />
<br />
It's not a practice to be discouraged.  It should be recommended, in fact.  When you're going up against mobs that hit for 990, you want a tank that won't fold like a wet paper towel against them.  There's a significant difference between a 9khp/1500ac tank and a 7khp/1300ac tank on those, and an even more significant difference on what weapons you're using.</div></div><hr />

I had a cleric tell me the other day in BoT that I had more HP unbuffed than the last 2 warriors that had tanked for the group had group buffed (cleric+shaman buffs) - news flash, I only have 6450 with tribute. I get asked how many HP I have pretty often, I usually reply with AC/HP/and full tanking AAs. It does make a difference, particularly if the group healer is sub-par or doesn't have KEI or FT to help out.</div></div><hr />

Reasonably 1300-1400 unbuffed which can take you just over 1500 raid-buffed. It's enough to do the job most of the time considering the non elemental targets.</div></div><hr />

Actually I have started putting people on ignore who are crazy/repetive about asking for this in group.  Its just plain annoying...if a cleric asks nicely in tells that is one thing but in group its different altogether.  I once actually had an idiot tell me 9.2 buffed wasnt enough for ferubi...this after I spent 8 hours there the day before.<br />

Hard ldon is mostly about the group.  7.8-8k and 1400-1500 ac buffed is fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
8500 hps fully buffed is plenty for hard LDoNs.  If it's a healer saying it's not enough, they suck at their jobs.  :)  If it's someone else, they're just ignorant.  That said, those who are offended by people asking for hp/ac for some zones are just being unrealistic and overly defensive.  Maybe if we could actually view someone's AA we wouldn't have to ask as much, but there's a massive difference between players who are all L65.  One warrior might be 4.5k hps unbuffed with no AA while another is 9k unbuffed with 500 AA.  But they both show up just as &quot;L65&quot; in /lfg.<br />
<br />
I'm closing in on 1500 AC unbuffed with no elemental and no VT gear and have something like 6300 hps unbuffed with sturd3 and all the older hit point AA.  That's with the north ro bp, ornate or equivalent or better in all visible slots, and okay stuff in the non visible slots.  As someone else said, get the loyalist shield.  It's huge.  I've got that with an ac10 aug on my back.  I doubt AC60, +75 hps in the back slot is going to be beat pre elementals.  I threw an ac10 aug in my haste collar from the poi dragon and am working on another aug for my mask from the sewers lair expedition (get it if you can... ac13 +90 hp +10 str/sta mask... add aug to make it ac23).  <br />
<br />
I list all that because I'd be curious to know how to upgrade myself, but I've looked up quite a bit of stuff and the fact is there just aren't many upgrades for me now without hitting VT/elems.  There's expensive hit point augs from LDoN, but I'm getting really sick of LDoNs.  I'll add at least one more ac10 aug as I mentioned above.  For 60k each I could by the earthen resistance rings and gain all of about 50-60 hp and 14 raw AC while losing 16 dex/agi.  That would cost me about 120k total in the bazaar.  I've got the plat, but that's most of many months of savings for a very minor upgrade.  :/<br />
<br />
I guess i could gimp my aggro/dps and put a horn of hsagra in my offhand instead of my great blade of storms or 17/20 aug'ed ldon weapon that I spent 3,450 points on.  Nah.</div></div><hr />

Eh, I once grouped a paladin (a main, not an alt) from a Euro guild which was halfway to Time, for a normal LDoN really late/early without thinking twice about it. Visually all was normal, he showed up to the group weilding Ornate Greatblade from PoFire. The normal mobs were eating him up really bad, so I asked his hp. With virtue, focus (and boar), and his bss - he still was buffing out to under 6khp.  Which was less than my unbuffed HP and AC at the time, as a rogue. I didn't ask about his AA, but my guess is he was lacking defensive AAs too. Our guilds were roughly at the same point content-wise.  Assuming isn't always the best course of action.<br />
<br />
It's a reasonable question. If folks want to know what they're getting, what harm is there in answering?  I can't imagine getting upset about it.</div></div><hr />

Then he gets a group with a Druid healer with a small mana pool and no FT, so the Druid struggles to keep him alive on every single pull. Then next time the poor Druid asks the tank next time... ok, or maybe they are just anal. :)<br />
<br />
As for hard Ldons, ya i noticed that lots of people worry a lot about getting a good tank. But most 65 tanks, especially warriors, can handle tanking 1 mob that's slowed quickly with a good healer keeping him up. But from what I've seen, success of the group is like 90% the puller. A good puller will keep the singles coming and at worst die himself away from camp once in a while. A bad puller will die while training camp with 3 or 4 mobs every other pull. So if you have a shitty puller and nobody else in the group who can croud control, you better be over 10k and have HI maxxed cuz you will need to fire that AT and tank a few unslowed mob every other pull. :) I can see somebody wanting an 8500+ HP tank if he doesn't have confidence in the rest of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coroq, in the example you gave for BoT the reason the warrior has difficulty tanking is as much because of a poor healer as a poorly equiped warrior.<br />
<br />
When I hit 65 I was in a mix of thurgadin / skyshrine armour and wielding my epic 2hs, I had 20AA already inc ND3 and hit about 4.4k hp unbuffed.  Add a Virtue and still shy of 6k.  I could tank BoT without too much difficulty.  Sure with a badly equiped druid healer I was gonna have problems, but with a badly equiped healer the only tank who isnt gonna have problems is one equiped to the point where BoT is pretty much trivial.<br />
<br />
These days there are plenty of bazaar twink warriors running round with considerably better HP/AC than I had.  For under 200k I could equip a warrior with better gear than I had back then, Ive seen plenty of baza baby warriors in RZ gear hitting 5k+ with nothing no drop or even excessively expensive.<br />

These days its not uncommon to see lvl 58ish Paladins with less than 3k hps unbuffed tanking in PoValor, and if they can tank valor mobs a 4khp 65 warrior can sure than BoT mobs, they arent that much harder.</div></div><hr />

HOWEVER -- I have the dilemma you do, Taelindar. If you've chosen a &quot;non-standard&quot; race to play as a warrior, you really do need to work a bit harder to get the right gear, in my opinion. Work hard to acquire gear with lots of stamina and raw hit points.<br />

Good luck with your wood elf.</div></div><hr />

However, I say play what class you want period. There are way to many ogres running around. There is a thread around here that goes into all the race issues and it all I mean it ALL boils down to equiptment for a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

Gear and money, or is it money and gear, (kinda like the chicken and the egg dilemma) comes with time and levels.  Besides, you have it way better than I did at your level.  I thought I was doing good when I bought my bronze BP!  Back then bronze was sold at the rate of 2pp for every AC.</div></div><hr />

But seriously folks, some people have a ridiculous idea of what gear a low level tank should have.  If you're in some combination of crusty, crafted and such, wielding centi ss or better (which with mudflation should be easily doable), then odds are you're waaaay better off than most of us were back in the day. Don't sweat it, just get upgrades when you can, and when you get to the planes and higher level LDoN, your gear will catch up reasonably quickly.<br />

Edit:  If you don't know what a LoW is, it's a Langseax of Wolves, and was an uber 2 hander 4 years or so ago. :)</div></div><hr />

How's this for a shocker Isk...if I had it to do over I would re-roll as a Wood Elf for the charisma.  Here is my take on races:<br />
<br />
Ogre: no frontal stun - great benefit but you can essentially buy it with aas<br />
Iksar: ac bonus - very nice<br />
Wood Elf/Half Elf/Human - highest cha which is the hardest stat to raise.<br />
<br />
It really pisses me off to no end that all the advantages that I chose Ogre for, and the xp and size penalties I paid for it (at least until cobalt came out) have been given to every other race...but their advantages I do not have access to.  And to top it off YEARS after the game is created they essentially change what stats mean and make cha important for warriors...Yah me with my 39 cha.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that really matters for PoP xp'ing  and regular ldon is the weapons you wield and the aggro you can generate (assuming you buff to over 6k hps).<br />
<br />
If i get asked for hps/ac for a hard ldon, GoD trials, GoD xp, or Raid invites, i always cough up the info.<br />
<br />
The most important thing in any of the higher xp areas after you break 7.5k hps is to make sure you have moderate ac (1250-1400) and all your defensive aa's out of the way.<br />
<br />
i've watched 8.5-9k tanks with no defensive aa's get torn to shreads in hard-ldon/GoD, while a 7-7.5k warrior with good ac and all defensive aa's do just fine.<br />
<br />
Myself, i raid buff out to around 8900 atm, and average group hps run right around 8500 unless i'm packing a paladin or begged for the extra buff.  my hps havent gone up more than 250 in the last 2 weeks, but i'm almost done with all my defensive aa's now after some serious grinding sesisons.  The aa's have done more for my tankability in Hldon/GoD than anything else.<br />
<br />
That said:  defensive aas &gt; Raw hps &gt; AC  (assuming that you already have a decent gear base)</div></div><hr />

Then you can ask what you should concentrate on.  To me that is a better way to ask about what you are doing than just saying &quot;Am I a Papertank?&quot;<br />
<br />
At 37, your numbers don't appear too badly, but it would help if people see what you had in each slot so they can get a feel for what you have compared to what they had at that level.  It just doesn't seem like you are too far off what you need.  My BL is 37 and with Temp is 1800 HPs and around 700 AC.  He isn't geared greatly, but he takes a hit just fine from dark blues.</div></div><hr />

I re-geared my Bazaar mule with gear that was appropriate for the 30s (Crafted BP, Crusty some LDoN Bracers and other assorted items, none of which was over 400PP. in our Bazaar and I should project to about what you are. At 37, find a healing partner, preferably a Druid and head to Crystal Caverns. You'll both make a pretty plat farming Velium. Enough to be able to purchase upgrades.<br />

As far as a guide, the benchmarks I remember were 1000 AC and 3000 HP at level 50, 1100 and 3500 for 55 and 1200 AC and 4k HP at 60. I don't remember  numbers like that for say, level 40 though.</div></div><hr />

To anyone who won't group with someone who asks your AC/HP, get over it. You are the same one that will complain when a CH lands a little late, or the Druid doesn't heal the way a Cleric does. A GOOD healer gets the facts and plans accordingly. You could probably learn something about AC/HP from asking these folks about their experiences. They get a pretty good idea on when to land a heal based on HP, and how much damage you are gonna take based on AC. I play a 65 Druid(main kinda), 4500 Mana Pool, and have been lone healer on lots of Luclin Bosses and several Tier 2 Mini's(BoT Tower bosses quit often). I ALWAYS ask. I don't have rez, so a mistake on my part means some long CR's. Would you rather have the healer informed, or would you rather they be ignorant? <br />
<br />
The exception to my rule is on PvP servers, I never give any stats on PvP. That would be silly.  Flame if you must, but alls a healer cares about is keeping you alive when they ask.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind being asked about hp/ac, but what's funny to me is I rarely get asked about my defensive aa's.  The defensive aa's make a huge difference - more than an extra 1 to 2k in hp or a couple hundred ac.  Personally, I think all 3 (hp, ac, defensive aa's) are very useful - it's just funny to me that I've only been asked about the aa's once in the last 6 months. :p</div></div><hr />

Reality is, the only person who is going to care about AC is the guy on the recieving end of the beatdown.  And you should.  Examples.  Don't settle for 10 ac / 100 hp shoulders when you can get 31 AC, 65 hp shoulders.  Dont get a belt with 8 ac and 100 hps, when you can get a belt with 18 ac and 80 hps.  Too many people make stupid decisions in the quest to break hp benchmarks.<br />

Although you wont like that people view hps as more important than AC, it doesnt matter, you have to do what is best for you, not what pleases the crowd.</div></div><hr />

So true.  <br />
<br />
I went through a bit of a dilemma back during early PoP when it was hard as hell getting a group on my main but my twink chanter would get tells within 15mins of logging, so every day I'd log on the warrior and sit in PoValor with LFG on for about an hour, get bored, log on the chanter, get a group within 15mins and XP for the rest of the night.  I was unguilded at the time and not many guilds were recruiting warriors so I was pretty close to changing mains and putting on a dress full time.<br />
<br />
The main reason I didnt is there just wasnt the feeling of progression and achievement as a caster that I got as a warrior.  Every bit of loot I could get for my warrior made the character better, I could see the improvements as HPs and AC went up.  Playing a chanter there just wasnt that same enjoyment in progression for me.  My ability defined my limits and I could do everything I needed with the gear I had, there wasnt a &quot;one day I'll be able to tank xxx uber mob&quot; feeling at all, and a &quot;one day I'll be able to tash xxx uber mob&quot; just wasnt the same.<br />
<br />
If gearing up your character is a measure of how well you are doing in EQ then succeeding as a warrior where that gear is so much more significant is much for enjoyable (for me) than suceeding as a caster.<br />
<br />
/derail off<br />
<br />
When I get asked how many hps I have I usually tell them &quot;5k&quot;, &quot;unbuffed?&quot;, &quot;no with buffs on, better start that CH before the monk runs off to pull&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
An 8k tank is more comfortable in terms of fubar factor, but a good healer can work with what they have.<br />
<br />
It's all about timing the CH and using the right heals in panic situations.<br />
<br />
IMO, asking a tank their stats before you invite them to a group is rude, but asking them after you invite them is a necessary and crucial aspect of group success.</div></div><hr />

Hard LDoNs are all about the healer and puller.  If you are 7.5k+ hp and 1300+ AC buffed you will do fine if the healer and puller are good.  If you die 3 times in the first 5 pulls then your hp/ac won't matter anyway because your puller and/or healer sucks.</div></div><hr />

Everyone needs to know how to play their class above competant.  I've done LDoNs with very good monks but a shitty slower, and though we win its tough.  I've done LDoNs with no puller, but a damn good shaman and never died to 3 mob pulls, but because ranger was snaring properly, I could back my cleric up everytime taunt failed and work around not having any type of traditional CC.  DPS has the easiest job in the world, tank healer slower are the keys, and those need to be especially competant.<br />
<br />
I'd say be atleast 8500/1500 to do Hard LDoN if you have a very well geared healer, otherwise its tough on healers assuming your duel weilding and bending over for those riposte.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my recent experiences, that sounds about right.  I'm a little over 8500 hp but only 1450 ac and hard ldon's are a little tough on the healers mana (only died on one of 4 attempts though, so not too bad.)  However, the first time I died we didn't have a shaman or druid for buffs, so we did the rest at 7.6k - I died again near the end, but that was due to bad luck - charm broke on a 2 pull and I had no discs available  :rolleyes: ...</div></div><hr />
