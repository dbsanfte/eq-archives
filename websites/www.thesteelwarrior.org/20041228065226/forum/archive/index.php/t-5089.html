Changes that would occur:<br />
<br />
The Forums would not change. Moderators remain the same, No censorship that isn't currently censored. <br />
<br />
1 Advertisement at the top of each static page (Armor, Weaponry, Trainin', Questin', Links).<br />
<br />
We would be on a new server - without the need to pay hosting fees.<br />
<br />
Yantis would not be involved with the forums at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grobsmashprexus</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know alot of people do not agree with what yantis does but I look at it like this.  He makes money off of eq and if he wants to spend some of that money so I can enjoy eq more, then more power to him.  I would never click the link he puts at the top of the page so it wouldnt bother me there.  I do not have the extra money to donate to the message board so I feel I have no right to step in the way of some one willing to use there buisness to fund the site.<br />
<br />
I would recommend getting a ironclad agreement in writing with him if you where to sell the site because I would hate for the steelwarriors team to get screwed after they put so much work in to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah He will sell you email to the email spammers to make more $$ of you.  He does not give two shits about you or the game all he cares about is using cheats hacks and exploits to make more money. FUCK YANTIS and FUCK IGE.  They are ruining the game for you and me and here you are seriously contemplating selling this site Raaj seriously man I am dissappointed in you.  That probably doesn't mean much coming from me but still don't sell your integrirty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evilsofa</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yantis is currently attempting to buy out a lot of class boards, and even server boards, throwing around a lot of cash.<br />
<br />
Quoting a web admin of EQ Diva, a bard class site regarding Yantis' unsuccessful attempt to buy them out:<br />
<br />
&quot;Without Kocho's approval, I wouldn't want to broadcast exact numbers. Yantis started out offering a 4-digit sum for the site plus something like $200 a month to maintain the site. Today's offer was 4X the original and into 5-digit territory to buy the site outright. Kocho spends around $100 to $200 a month to maintain the site and occasionally collects donations for EZ-Board payments The new site she is migrating to -- www.dotnetdiva.com -- won't use EZ-Board for the message boards at all. What alarms me is that he makes enough money with this 'business' to be able to spend that kind of money acquring sites. I just felt a certain pride in being a small part of Kocho's team, given her stand on this issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you want to see the kind of approaches Yantis makes towards site owners, here's his proposal (also turned down) to eqluclin.com:<br />
<br />
Hey there =)<br />
<br />
You sound like a nice guy who wants the best for his community.<br />
<br />
I really do want you to run the boards just like you have been. I am<br />
not about to step on your toes and you are going to have 100% control<br />
with everything. Heck, if you want to post a * sticky<br />
I am not about to stop you, (I wouldn't be thrilled about it but like<br />
I said you control the boards).<br />
<br />
The only thing I have is that small text link and I will take care of<br />
all the gold costs.<br />
<br />
Other than that you won't even know I am here. I will point<br />
luclin.com to these boards as well to bring is some more traffic and<br />
get links to them on major sites like Monkly-Business etc.<br />
<br />
I would also like to talk to you about handling some basic news for<br />
the luclin.com I would like to see it succeed as well and some good<br />
server based news would be a good thing (like we do on<br />
monkly-business and I could pay you $500 a month for your time of<br />
just adding a 2 or 3 news articles every day or so about the luclin<br />
server etc).<br />
<br />
I hope we can work together with this and keep the Luclin community<br />
strong. It is really in my best interest to see it succeed and think<br />
you are the right person to do it.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Jonathan Yantis</div></div><hr />

It is nice to have at least one serverwide community that isn't whored out like the rest, hopefully it stays this way.</div></div><hr />
