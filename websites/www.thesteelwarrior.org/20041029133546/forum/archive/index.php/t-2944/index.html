<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started to level again after a long and boring HG farming break, and wondering where should I go exping at 61 with this gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170660) ? I'd like some input on the fastest way to get level 65, and then get some AA's. Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kabal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well i wouls look around POD and maybe POV i wouldent try tanking in POV till you have around4.8+k hp once you get to around 63 you can try a bot group mad xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, Kabal. So you think I have not enough HP to tank in PoV ? I wonder how I could get 4.8k unbuffed as a skinny Dark Elf LoL<br />
<br />
In fact my question is bad formulated. I would like some advices on good exp camps where I could tank effectively and eventually some gear upgrades I could make, knowing that I'm a casual player, not guilded and my only source of income are Hill Giants. BTW I'm getting sick of them, so I'd like to avoid them if possible.  At 58-60 I was usually exping in PoI / PoD, and was doing really okay, but I noticed that the exp slowed down dramatically when I dinged 61. I suppose that I have to move to some other place where the exp is better, but if I understand well,  for PoV or PoS I'm screwed because of my sucky gear and lack of defensive AA's ?<br />
<br />
I presume, I could try to stop levelling to get ND3 but most of warriors I talked with said to get 65 before any further AA's, so I'm a bit confused about the best strategy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tank in PoV when someone will have me at 58, I have about 3800 hps and do fine everytime I tank there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have you tried Nadox?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are gonna laugh but Ssra emperor key camps were pretty good exp (mines, com1/2) when i was there with my cleric helping guildies with their parts after i got mine.<br />
Actually my cleric dinged 62 is ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well people, thanks much for all your advices. But I'm pretty lucky there, cause I think that LDoN is going to solve the issue for me.  I tried it yesterday, and came out with 2 conclusions : 1st, 61 appears to be something very close to what was called a &quot;hell level&quot; - with a group of friends, 30 min of LDoN dungeon crawling brought me something like 3 % of exp, so, I'm going to have to just suck it up to ding 62; 2nd, when I switched to AA exp out of curiosity, I saw it just flying and ended up with almost half a full AA point at the end of the adventure (1hour... it is something like 2 hours and a half to get a full AA point with a group of 60+ in LDoN so. I'm pretty sure it could be greatly improved cause our group lacked some DPS and mana regen). So I'm pretty happy, I was thinking that exp sucked at 61 cause it has something to do with the exp you get from a dark blue mob, but it is not this at all, 61 is just a very long level.<br />
<br />
I think the best strategy to hit 65 at this point for a non-guilded casual player like me would be to grind first the defensive AA's (ND3 CA3 CS3) wherever I can group, then try to get into some PoV / PoS groups. I'm afraid I would be a very light tank if I go there at this point of my carreer.<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW, we ended up with 200 plat of cash each at the end of the adventure, what is not bad at all, plus 2 or 3 stat augments. Nothing uber but still cool. And, an advice - don't play with the chests, or, at least, finish the mission first LoL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well i guess i must have been lucky or something because even with my shitty gear and hp i still managed to get groups in PoV. A good thing to do is make your own groups. go into the lfg window and if you see a slower and a healer up grab them and then get sme dps and voila you have a group. And if your goin somewhere where your sure yourprobably gonna get owned then get a higher lvl tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im lvl 61 with 4003 hp and I would say my stats are barely adequate for PoV.  If you have a good slower and cleric you can tank there effectively, your biggest problem will be losing aggro to the slower - if you can avoid that (have him hold off on the slow, etc.) you should be OK.  ALWAYS get a virtue before you go.  I was in a Droga group also the other night, and you'd be fine at 61 there, just get some magic resists, they're nasty casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I usta solo spiders in Velks when I was bored...<br />
<br />
The best exp for a 61 is probably PoV. <br />
<br />
LDoN is decent and the only way I exp now. <br />
<br />
CoD Chapel is the best exp I've found pre-Elemental.<br />
<br />
The problem with going anywhere else that is out of the way is finding a group, unless you've got friends ready to travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm a level 57 Troll Warrior, I have 3850 Hp and got a tell today asking if I wanted a group in PoV.  Well not a lot was happening in LDoN so I said sure.  Got there and buffed up.  Shammy and cleric buffs put me at 5500 ish hp and 1300 ish AC.  I tanked fine, cleric never went below 80 mana.  We was at the east camp and yeah the mobs hit hard 550ish tops but once that slow has landed tanking there is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hehe if you think 61 is the hell lvl well wait till you get to 62 now that is the hell lvl 61 is the fastes lvl to go threw i say and 62 needs twice as much as 59 did. But back to your question i say try PoD or the LDoN adventures they rack up nice exp my wifes 63 ench is allmost out lvling me lol so try the LDoN camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dakatsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would say Droga was where I saw the best exp. I grouped there as much as posibble. The pp drop is nice and usually not very crowded so pulls are constant. stayed there until 63 then went to BoT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoD is a wasteland on my server.  At most times, two people tops are in there now.  <br />
<br />
PoV is nice experience, particularly the cave camps (one camp on some servers, two on others).  PoI factory is good too.  If you can get someone with harmony, you can get the same sort of experience at the High Guardian of Justice camp down in PoJ.  Veksar isn't bad either.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is finding a group.  Unfortunately, most groups don't want warriors, they prefer pallies or SKs for on-demand aggro control.  Even a well-equipped warrior depends on procs for aggro control, and that's not appealing to exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm I think I went to BoT at 61 or mebbe it was 62...  I think I had around mid 4k hps... and mid 1200's AC.  I think my only bonus going there was I have good aggro weps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Have you tried Nadox?<br />
Mobs too low there, too many hitpoints.. die too slow. IF you are a good puller, hobgoblins will be good, same for gargoyles at PoN castle. Factory as mentioned as well and Droga is also very good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks for the advices, guys :) Well, I finally tried Valor, just to see how it goes, and it was really great exp. I had big aggro problems the first time, but maybe was it because everyone in the group but me was lvl 65, dont know, at least I didnt got chewed, but my gear improved since my last post (gained like 200hp and made ND2). <br />
<br />
It was funnier the second time, it was at the cave by the river to west of ZI, and this time the group was around lvl 60 with a 65 ranger pulling. Hadnt any aggro problems with Windblade, maybe because everyone was focused and watched their aggro carefully... Really good exp there.<br />
<br />
The best exp still is LDoN, mobs dont give as much of it as in PoV, but you can kill more of them faster and easier, so it is more profitable on the long run. I try to create my own groups as often as possible, usually I try to get at least a rogue and a bard. And, LDoN is FUN ! I love it hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drumin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Another place to consider if you can bring your own group is the armadillo camp in PoS.  At 63 I get about 1%xp per 2 mobs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">but my gear improved since my last post (gained like 200hp and made ND2). <br />
du-eh, how about getting 65 instead of a pure HP AA ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">[/quote]du-eh, how about getting 65 instead of a pure HP AA ?[/quote]<br />
<br />
Heh here comes the big thing... EVERY fuking one is telling me to make 65 instead of AA's... But wait, how could I make 65 if I cannot do my tank job properly ? :) Getting decent exp at 60+ requires to fight big mobs - like those in Valor - and those big mobs hit for 500+ most of the time (except in LDoN normal mode). If I dont have enough HP's to tank them, I just have no point to be there (unless I'm the 6th slot exp sponge in a group already strong). At least that's my philosophy.<br />
<br />
It will probably make you all scream, but I'm planning to get ND, CA, CS and CF 3 and maybe AT and Flurry before any level 65s. I just dont want to ding 65 &quot;AA naked&quot;, I wouldnt feel being a viable tank.  Anyway it doesnt change anything on the long run when you do your AAs, before or after the 65th ding. And I'm not especially on a hurry, why should I ? It is just a different strategy :)<br />
<br />
So far, no one was able to PROVE me with concrete arguments and proofs that it is more efficient to do 65 first then AA's instead of the contrary. And right now I'm a bit disappointed with regular exp, it just seems to go very slowly after lvl 60, so I'm doing AA.</div></div><hr />

I dream of being that guy! :)<br />
<br />
But then again, I'm a coward. :D</div></div><hr />
