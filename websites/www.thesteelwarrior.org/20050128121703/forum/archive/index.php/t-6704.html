I have one cluttering my bags atm, on Tunare, and I'm considering selling it.  Due to the age of Tunare and ease of plat there, I initially tried 500k but only 1 person showed any real interest, he just didn't have it right now.  Of course I got the normal &quot;??!!&quot; from newbies in PoK, but we know we can disregard that  :p <br />
<br />
I've had my fun with it, and I know an Ornate BP and Legs would do me far more good, but I'd like to have enough left over for something else &quot;fun&quot; to replace it.<br />
<br />
Should I hold out at 500k or drop it to around 350k?<br />
<br />
(Ornate BP and legs will cost me at least 300k together)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Earthshaker should be no more than 150k if that, and yes I know you can't get them anymore. It is a crap weapon and usefull on very few fights.</div></div><hr />

I got mine for under 200pp, long ago.</div></div><hr />

Didn't think those would have any kind of trouble selling at any price from the way they went.<br />
<br />
I wanted one myself (mainly for RP) long before the AE madness that took over everybody, but when I finally had a couple of thousand to spend on one the prices skyrocketed to unreachable (for me) levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn, I need a new keyboard after i just spit my beer from laughing so hard.  But a shaker is not worth 500k ever.  It is only a toy.  If you happen to find someone who buys plat from yantis everyday and dumps if off to you, then consider yourself lucky.  Hell, I paid 2k for mine like the week after it stopped dropping.  Then the week later it was 150k+.<br />
<br />
I think it is one of the most screwed up weapons because it is only a &quot;toy.&quot;  It has no real use and is very dangerous to go around trying it out.  But I would never sell mine not because of the function, but more so I can say I have something not may others do.  But to your question, just raid BoT towers and get BP yourself, legs will come in due time.</div></div><hr />

last night I got my 3rd for 250K, gonna trade for AoN. AoN are very high on SZ cause of some targeting bug...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, sounds just like the PvP servers.  AoN's have always had high value on PvP servers due to the difficulty of targetting skeleton models, but I imagine with how screwed up targetting is right now that it has gotten even worse.  Sucks that people on PvP servers flock to exploit any exploit they can as soon as it becomes known.</div></div><hr />

Most beautiful log clip ever!<br />
<br />
While the coral hilted tuwar has a similiar effect, the much lower delay means it's less effective at stacking death and doomnation on one swing of the rampage button.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I guess the ES prices started soaring after &quot;that post&quot; about warrior AE, I think that was a month or so after the thing was removed from the revamed Hole. I picked mine up for 2k the day we did the AE group, and the next month it was selling for hundreds of K in the bazaar, on my server... It's not worth it. You could just ask your close warriors friends, if you have any, to borrow theirs for when you want to toy around with it.<br />
<br />
As for the original poster's question, I think it would be very unwise to sell your own ES, even for 500k. One, you will be losing a cool toy, two, you will want to rebuy it later, and three, you keep the price on ES high and that's not a very nice thing to do to your fellow warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sold mine for 350k.<br />
And I promptly bought a Helm of RZ with the cash. I haven't looked back - I don't even have Rampage yet, and probably won't get it before I leave EQ :)</div></div><hr />

I would have paid 500K though.<br />
<br />
You dont have to exploit the game to get that kinda money.<br />
There comes a time when the only thing plat is good for is tribute.</div></div><hr />

Still trying to get a decent offer for mine though - knowing that i'll probably never be able to replace it, it'd better be an offer i can't resist :D<br />
