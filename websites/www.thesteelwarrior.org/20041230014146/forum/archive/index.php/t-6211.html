<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devastate</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, ive read around a few class boards, including here, and this is what ive gathered<br />
<br />
Aggro is generated by swing, rather then by actual damage of the swing ( a miss is same aggro as a hit) yet the POTENTIAL damage of the swing, has a bearing on the aggro generated<br />
<br />
PPM primary 2 - offhand 1 with exception of a rare few weapons<br />
<br />
Im aware of disciplines incite spirit of rage etc, but i want to keep it to pure facts<br />
<br />
Assuming the aggro generated by swing theory is true, then wouldnt offensive AA's such as ambidexterity, ferocity, speed of the knight ( thats the name of + chance for extra attack for knights not sure for wars and too lazy to look it up atm ) with their increase of swings, would thus increase aggro generation correct?<br />
<br />
Now, iwas talking to a warrior in my guild, and i had remembered seeing a post here about ambi dexterity increasing ppm in offhand slightly? If this is true, then wouldnt extra swings mean extra chance to proc in general? Which would also fit in with what i mentioned above. However, he mentioned that it could be coded that there is simply 2ppm /1ppm , unfortunatly i did not parse myself before i loaded up on offensive AA's, so i have nothing to compare to atm, and was curious what the general consensus, or facts i'm unaware of are in regards to this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, when you augment a weapon (a bit off topic) in primary/ offhand, does it also follow the 2ppm / 1ppm? <br />
<br />
<br />
Im curious if im going to notice a discernable difference in aggro generation once offense is maxed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and just to make sure, im assuming combat fury doesnt have any effect on aggro? Since dmg per hit isnt consequential, its potential?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">when the 2/1 procs per minute theory holds true, it holds true weather you swing 1000 times per min, or 2 times per min.  so adding swings wont increse your proc rate. only weapon affinty AA, combat effects effect, and more dex increases proc rate<br />
<br />
if aggro is generated by &quot;potential damage&quot; then sure, more swings = more aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grud</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amidexterity would most likely give a slight increase in PPM in the off hand, since it actually gives you a higher number of &quot;rounds&quot; swinging that weapon. The other AAs (other than Rampage) add extra attacks in an existing round, and since you can only have one proc per round, it will not add any procs. The difference however would be very small. The primary benefit of offensive AAs is the extra aggro from melee, not additional procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Foulsbane</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it a fact that agro is generated by swings and not dam? My monk can pull agro off ANY war, if i dont FD alot. He uses a REBB, with the 150 cold dd proc. The delay is 28. No way a war isnt swinging more with 2 1h weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're going to proc more in your offhand with ambidex.  Every time you're offhand doesn't attack (dual wield didn't fire off), it's like turning off auto attack for your offhand.  The PPM for that weapon is the same with and without ambidex, but without ambidex the time you're actually attacking with your offhand is less, resulting in fewer procs.<br />
<br />
I'm a big believer in (potential damage per swing) * (# of swings) generating your aggro.  I've seen it several times where I attack and miss all my attacks (say 5 attacks; triple attack main hand, double attack offhand) on a mob that someone just pulled and it turns on me.  Eventhough I've done no damage to it, my potential damage was pretty high with 5 swings.<br />
<br />
As far as what offensive AA's to get for aggro: just get them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agro has been proven, about 10 months ago, to be based on 'potential' damage, rather than actual damage.  That was well tested.  So, it didn't matter if you missed 10 times in a row, you generated the same amount of agro as if you had hit, for max damage 10 times in a row.  The reason the monk pulls agro is because you have a heck of a lot of 'potential damage'.  <br />
<br />
For what it's worth, the study was done with fairly decent methods using shadow knight agro spells.   It convinced me at least.<br />
<br />
In fact, if I remember right, it ended up not being based on even the 'potential' damage of the weapon, but on the delay of the weapon, and it follows thresholds (ie, rounding issues).  The delay was rounded off to the next 10 (10, 20, 30...).  <br />
<br />
The original study showed, quite surprisingly,  that a weapon with 14 delay had less agro than something with a 18 delay.  So, for agro purposes, a 14/14 would be worse than an 8/18 because the 14 was rounded down to 10 and the 18 was rounded up to 20.  <br />
<br />
I might be a tad off somewhere in there, but I'm pretty sure that this was what was decided.  The end result is that people say, DO NOT rely on dps to generate agro.  If you do, you'll probably not be happy.  Get some good procs (ie, greatstaff of thunder, copper hammer), use your agro tools (incite), or get some proper buffs.<br />
<br />
Hunt well,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devastate</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, that was one of the threads i was referring to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See this thread for what I got out of the thread Gimmel linked (his thread is in the Library on this site).<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5864<br />
<br />
Perhaps I missed something (happens a lot, heh), but I didn't see anything about rounding up or down.<br />
Uh, okay, and I apologize to Devastate because in this I'm not actually answering the core of his question, which is about whether certain AAs increase agro &amp; proc rates and whether augments increase proc rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The threads also showed that offhand agro was pretty minimal compared to main hand agro so ambidexterity wouldn't have much of an increase as it only effects offhand swings.<br />
<br />
Ferocity, Punishing Blade and Flurry are winners though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming the aggro generated by swing theory is true, then wouldnt offensive AA's such as ambidexterity, ferocity, speed of the knight ( thats the name of + chance for extra attack for knights not sure for wars and too lazy to look it up atm ) with their increase of swings, would thus increase aggro generation correct? <br />
<br />
The thing the &quot;potential dps agro&quot; crowd tends to ignore is not the question of if it induces agro but HOW MUCH agro (that library thread is very convincing in proving potentail dps agro exists btw no argument here).  <br />
<br />
I hold with the notion (until proven otherwise) that &quot;potential dps agro&quot; is not material when compared with &quot;proc induced agro&quot;. <br />
<br />
There was a &quot;hate value&quot; calculation bandied about here recently but really no empirical data submitted to back it up.<br />
<br />
Raised here: <br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5968&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=4<br />
<br />
Until proven otherwise, I would suggest maximizing a &quot;4 EB/stun&quot; weapon set with weapon affinity 5 before taking offensive AA skills for &quot;potential dps agro&quot; reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wyndaria</div><div class="date">03-19-2004, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The part of 'rounding' was referring to deep in the thread, but it was a rounding of the damage of the weapon, not the delay... something like RND(dmg/10) being  used so a 14/20 and a 8/20 weapon generating the same agro.  However, through testing, this was believed to be incorrect... <br />
<br />
To quote:<br />
<br />
Playing with the numbers a bit, the formula DB + 11 * MINIMUM seems to be a reasonable fit for all types of weapons. Sounds like the kind of thing someone might have hacked in as a guess of average weapon damage (11 is close to the average of a 1 to 20 roll).<br />
<br />
MINIMUM is the minimum possible damage for the weapon ignoring damage bonuses, i.e. RND(DAM/10), so 2 for a 15 dam weapon. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
If this theory is right, a 15/20 offhand should get aggro exactly twice as fast as a 14/20. Should be easy to test, if someone has the weapons.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
And then from Brodda: <br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
I think it is safe to say that DB + 11 * MINIMUM does not work as the damage rating of the weapon does come into play. I through in the 8/28 to show that agro is determined by damage and damage bonus alone. We can see that a 9/36 has approximately 10% more agro than a 8/20. And if the agro was determined by Damage + damage bonus then the agro would be 22 for the 9/36 and 21 for the 8/20 and 28 for the 15/32. So we would have 39 * 28 = 1092 and 54 * 21 = 1134 and 49 * 22 = 1078 which are pretty close. The 54 * 21 seems to be the farthest off, but it only really needs to be withing two swings (one from double attack and one from being on the 'edge', and it is damn close. But that still seems fairly loose. Also, when you are looking at this the values don't actually matter. This is all relative.<br />

The ratio/potential dps agro of a weapon is a mere baseline; procs are really much more significant.<br />
thus, without actually having hard agro values for various procs, I'd still be inclined to follow Flair's suggestion (&quot; Until proven otherwise, I would suggest maximizing a &quot;4 EB/stun&quot; weapon set with weapon affinity 5 before taking offensive AA skills for &quot;potential dps agro&quot; reasons.&quot;)<br />
I assume that for warriors who have not maxxed DEX, some attention to gettign some gear with that stat would yield improved proc rates and thus pay off.</div></div><hr />
