<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oloth</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been 2 boxing my shaman in Tier 1 zones for a while now and have found that I've become quite poor :P Do to the lack of loot and coins off mobs. So I though maybe I'd give CT a shot. So I was wondering at what lvl would my war and shaman need to be to be effective in CT and also since I did not have the opertunity to group up in CT since most ppl seem to prefer PoP zones now, how easy is it to pull single or double pulls in CT. As I can always have the shaman slow an add and tank it till first mob is down. <br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i duo my 65 warrior and 65 cleric (ft12, 4500mana) in CT occasionally. First off i'd say it's not worth it, the trash mobs don't drop plat, although they do drop the equivalent to fine steel weapons once in awhile. Secondly, while it's possible to kill 3 mobs at a time, its an incredable drain on mana, and the fourth mob is pretty much a guarunteed wipe.<br />
<br />
Single pulls leading to named mobs are pretty much non existant, i think dreadfang is the only one. Everything can be pacified though, so it helps a ton. The exp sucks too compared to first tier planes. Not really a great option for making plat, although with the right gear and aa's, it's generally trivial and safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will not get a decent amount of cash duoing in CT.<br />
<br />
Rare spawns were nerfed shortly after the zone opened.   I never did see ANY rare spawn in Grid or 4c.  Mobs don't drop cash, don't run, casters are a massive pain in the ass, and loot is far too rare.<br />
<br />
Good change of pace, but going there expecting to make money as a duo is the wrong reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually ya can make some pretty good cash in CT and never go near a named mob. The Tae Ew blood is rare, but sells for a decent amount, and if ya have access to a 250 Smith, the Tae Ew armor sells for even more.<br />
<br />
But with a 61 war and 62 Shaman, I have still been wary about trying to duo in there. With no way to pull singles it can be rough. Of course the Goo type mobs in the sewers seem to be easier and there are some safe spots to set up camp down there, and the mosquito leg earr and FT3 boots from there are worth a bit, but are real rare drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I two-box a war/cleric, and a friend boxes a shammy/monk, and we barely have the dps to keep 3 rooms in sewers open.<br />
<br />
If we add a third person, 4c/zig becomes possible and thats where its at.<br />
<br />
You could easily do the zonein I am sure, as I see a shammy/war there quite often.<br />
<br />
I don't wanna tell you how much cash I made there in 8 hours one excellent weekend.<br />
<br />
Edit: opps btw our class makeup is 65 war, 63 cleric, 62 shammy, 62 monk.</div></div><hr />

Just keep on the four enforcers in the hallway before the hall to Mauvin. Just pull with slow and tag. Once you split the two in the middle it's an easy camp that seems to spawn perfectly with a shammy 4kish mana pool. The drops are great - raw diamonds, boxes, coins, etc...each selling for @ 200+ pp on venders. Each cycle of 4 mobs is worth at least 400-800 pp per 15 mins. <br />
<br />
The secret is out! Lol<br />
<br />
(PS - Don't group the shammy and power out your AA's as well!)<br />

I can usually keep the hall and about 4 mobs into the big room cleared each repop when duoing my war/sham, and I don't get anywhere near that kind of drop rate, and the highest stuff sells for like 188pp with 175cha.  I could equip an army with weighty polearms, though. ;)  That being said, it's still a pretty good camp if you want some loot along with your exp.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and on the original topic, I've only attempted entrance in CT, and that wasn't too bad.  Think I got 7 blood in the few hours I was there, and sold them for 1500pp each, so it was reasonably profitable. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've 2-boxed a 65 war/63 dru in the sewers, and the best I can keep open is red mass and the first mosquito spawn.  DPS really slows you down, and I have to use harmony to break.  Without some way to harmony or pac, you'd have a difficult time 2 boxing that particular spawn, although a good war/shm team (2 people, not 2 boxed), would have a decent shot at it.  I try to evac if I get more than 2 mobs, since I'm at the mercy of my ToD with my pair.</div></div><hr />
