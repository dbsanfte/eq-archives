<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In light of the recent casual vs. uber, raider vs. non-raider discussions, let's get some unscientific numbers about how most TSW readers play.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just realized Raaj did almost this exact poll not too long ago hehe, but what the hell, mine has a hardcore non-raider option and the UI thing had been up for a while :cool:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Normaly my guild raids almost every day I would say. But latly we have not been raiding as much. We have sort of taken a few weeks off to give members time to get Emp keys and bane. Becuase we will be doing boots on those that dont have at the end of the 2 weeks. We have been keying for a better part of 4 months now so we said you have 2 weeks to be partly done now we gave them another 2 weeks to be finished.<br />
  So ya we are hardcore 5 times a week raiders most of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The problem with this pole is that I'm both a casual raider and a hardcore non-raider.  I raid once a week because that is the only time I can join the guild I'm apping for, but I play almost every night for 5+ hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ziggurat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I play Every night of the week for atleast 5 hours usually 6 or 7. <br />
I would love to raid 4+ a week however I am not currently in a &quot;uber&quot; guild. most activities that my guild are things that i push them to do, with the exception of the 1 raid they have a week, which personally I think is more pushed from my guilds &quot;alliance guild&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was in my 40's when i join'd this guild. now I am 64+70%. (should DING tonight '-) )<br />
However everyone else in my guild has only DING at most 4 times'  =((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>beolen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with this pole is that I'm a hardcore non-raider.  I raid only once a week, and when I do, I play for almost 9 hours straight!  Let's see someone top that, bad-asses!<br />
<br />
Normaly my guild raids non-stop during those 9+ hours, and I have YET to find anyone else with the same stamina.<br />
<br />
Latley though, I have not been raiding as much. I have taken a few weeks off to give other members time to catch-up to my seeminglt easy &quot;shift&quot; of destruction and mopping-up.<br />
<br />
You have 2 weeks to get up to my speed, or you might as well &quot;stick a fork in it&quot;, 'cause you're done...<br />
<br />
That's all, just 2 weeks...<br />
<br />
So, you say you are hardcore 5 times a week, and raiders most of time?<br />
<br />
We'll see.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im a casual raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fightingeverly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am an elemental flagged warrior that is a casual raider. I work 12 hour shifts for three days one week and four the next, so on my work nights i play for a couple hours (if i log on).  but on my off days im on from 12 to 16 hours straight. I raid at least two to three days every week but my work keeps me from doing the friday thru sunday guild raids.</div></div><hr />
