<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay here is the deal. I looked through the library and other areas of the board and did not see anything on this so if this is repetitive please just point me in the right direction and tell me to shut up.<br />
<br />
I recently joined a smaller guild who has never had a Warrior Tank. I have in the past been in guilds where only Warriors tanked and I have been called on to tank myself on occasions. When this happened I have never had an issue once in my career holding agro. Now with this new guild who has had a Ranger and a Pally doing the tanking forever they have asked me to start tanking on raids. I can't get agro from these guys to save my ass the mob is stunned tashed and slowed before I ever get to the damned thing. so my questions are.<br />
<br />
1.) Is there a guide to teach people how to let a Warrior get agro and when and how much they should Nuke and how to handle agro issues.<br />
<br />
2.) How do ya go about teaching people that it is not my responsibility to taunt the mob off someone every 30 seconds when the pally re stuns and the casters over nuke.<br />
<br />
3.) I guess the primary thing I need to know is how the heck do I show people that agro is not just the Warriors responsibility. I know it is my job to get it and try keeping it but others definately have a role in that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I am not the kind of guy to jeopardize an encounter out of stubbornness. I am in need of serious help of how I can lay it out for them without letting em die or going back to a pally tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Is Guts</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make 3 hotbuttons<br />
<br />
1 = Please dont assist till its called<br />
<br />
2 = Assist me with &gt; %t &lt;<br />
<br />
3 = Stop attack moving mob !! (very usefull for 'walled' mobs )<br />
<br />
Works for me ... had a little problem when I first joined they were used to a knight tankin so tended to tash slow etc very early, but we soon got it sorted.<br />
<br />
Get the healers to point out its better on mana if mob is hitting you and not ping ponging all over the place.<br />
<br />
Oh and dont forget to add /rs to your hotbuttons when raiding.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

The best link (http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/raids.html)  I could find to a raiding guide.  This covers more than what I was looking for -  the bit I was seeking is authored by Vellen (et al), and it's about halfway down.  The heading is:<br />
<br />
Raid Rules<br />
By Vellen (Vanayr) (contributions by Darxil, Zaelin and Igneoble) - Tallon Zek<br />
<br />
Not only is it well laid out, but the tone is spot-on perfect.  And the *other* material looks like good reading too.<br />
<br />
EDIT :: Whups, forgot to point out the section under the heading &quot;Raid Rules&quot;.  Which is perhaps closer to what you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're at a raid ... and you're the main tank ... simply be the one that calls attack.<br />
<br />
Then give yourself a 15 to 30 second head start to establish aggro.<br />
<br />
On trash mobs, eh, aggro isn't all that important. But you could still teach them to give you a 5 second head start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see two options:<br />
<br />
1) Tell the guild to let you tank, or assign someone else.<br />
<br />
2) Leave guilld.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we have a raid rules section of our website, might want to take a look at it, we pulled from our own experience and the experience of friends, along with stuff we had read on various message boards to put it together, friend of mine in a PoTime guild read it and thought it was excellant /shrug YMMV<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One note I would like to add:<br />
<br />
Oh and dont forget to add /rs to your hotbuttons when raiding.<br />
<br />
This may not be an issue for everyone, or maybe it was just my server, not sure, but when I used /rs in a hotkey, no one saw it in the chat except me. I had to change mine to read /rsay.<br />
<br />
I was tanking a Carpin raid once, and no one was assiting, and I died several times. I finally asked why no was assisting when I called for it, and they said they never saw it. After messing around, I figured it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only is it well laid out, but the tone is spot-on perfect.<br />
<br />
The tone of that thing may be perfect for pickup groups, but for regular Guild raids it sure as hell is not.  If my Guild raid leader had a shitty tone like that with me I would tell him to stick it up his ass, as would everyone else.  And rightly so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this guide, little outdated but it does get the point across about giving the MT time to build aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I - Assisting the Tank<br />
<br />
Ok, so groups are now formed, people are buff, and the casters have good<br />
mana once again. Now for the fun part:<br />
<br />
- Figure your who your Main Assist is. The Main Assist is your GOD, he<br />
is the one who decides what to attack and when to attack it. You DON'T<br />
attack a MoB unless he says its ok, his word is law.<br />
<br />
- Figure out who your Secondary Assist is. In the event that the MA<br />
dies, go LD, is AFK for an extended period of time or else cannot<br />
perform his duties then the SA takes over. While the SA is in charge he<br />
has the full Rights of an MA and is expected to be treated as such.<br />
<br />
- When a MoB is pulled into the raid camp, they may sometimes stop to<br />
cast a spell at the puller. DO NOT RUN OUT TO ATTACK THEM, WATCH YOUR<br />
CHAT SCREEN TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON!!! YES, THE MOB WILL COME TO YOU, BE<br />
FREAKIN' PATIENT!!!<br />
<br />
- When a MoB comes into the Raid camp, the MA is FIRST to engage it.<br />
This is done to build up the MA's aggression, the entire idea of an MA<br />
is to keep the MoB on one and ONLY one target during the course of the<br />
battle, this target is preferably the MA.<br />
<br />
- The MA shall call out to the entire raid that he has engaged the MoB<br />
and is building up his aggro. Now is the proper time to /assist the MA<br />
(But make FREAKIN' SURE that you have typed &quot;/assist off&quot; prior to doing<br />
this!!!). Do NOT engage the MoB at this time.<br />
<br />
-Unless you are the MA: DO NOT TARGET MOBS WITH THE MOUSE!!! You should<br />
NEVER use the mouse to target a MoB because you WILL break a Mez! ONLY<br />
use /assist &lt;MA&gt;. ONLY!! ALWAYS!! If you don't know how to make hotkeys,<br />
ask someone.<br />
<br />
- When the MA has built up sufficient aggro they will call out to kill<br />
the MoB. Each MA may have their own unique Kill message so be sure to<br />
figure out what is what among your MA's. DO NOT ATTACK THE MOB UNTIL THE<br />
MA CALLS IT!!! DO NOT THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE THE MA IS ATTACKING THAT<br />
YOU NEED TO BE AS WELL!!!<br />
<br />
- Once the MoB is dead, the King Looter from the group that got the kill<br />
should immediately loot the corpse. If there is droppable loot, loot<br />
it. If something is no-drop, announce what it is, unless its some junk<br />
that we have told you to destroy beforehand.<br />
<br />
II - Aggression Management Guide (also called: &quot;Taunt Sucks&quot;)<br />
<br />
When we attack a normal MoB on a raid, the idea is to keep that MoB on<br />
the MA at all times. Complete Heal is very mana efficient when used on<br />
characters with a High HP level. Hence it is best if ONE tank with a lot<br />
of HP tanks the MoB for the entire fight, it is NOT mana efficient to<br />
Divine Light 9 or 10 peeps who can't control their aggro.<br />
<br />
Here is the Golden Rule for ALL Main Tank situations:<br />
<br />
IT IS NOT THE MA'S JOB TO HOLD ONTO AGGRO. EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE<br />
GAME CAN OUT-TAUNT THE MA. IT IS EVERYONE ELSE'S JOB TO MAKE SURE THE<br />
AGGRO STAYS ON THE MA<br />
<br />
Read that line. Now read it again. Copy it, print it, hang it right over<br />
your monitor where you can easily spot it. Above all: Worship it<br />
<br />
(Author's Note: The following insults apply only to the major raid<br />
proper, the ones doing most of the damage. They do NOT apply to the<br />
Healers, Slowers, Mezzers or Debuffing team, which typicaly take aggro<br />
only because they absolutely have to land those spells. Thank you and<br />
have a pleasant day)<br />
<br />
The premise is clear: The skill &quot;Taunt&quot; really, really SUCKS. This skill<br />
WILL NOT save your weak caster butt from the MoB man quadding you for<br />
300 . If you get aggro, do NOT say &quot;The MA needs to taunt more&quot; because<br />
the MA IS taunting, your own epic incompetence and failure to think<br />
properly has gotten you aggro (Yes, I detest aggro stealers) Now GET<br />
YOUR BUTT OUT OF IT. EVERY SINGLE CLASS should know by the time they are<br />
46 how to get something they don't want off of them. This is NOT done by<br />
spamming your &quot;Help, Beastiez is on 'da n00ker!&quot; hotkey and running in<br />
big circles around the camp. If its on you and it looks like its gonna<br />
stay that way for awhile, do everyone a favor and STAND STILL. If you<br />
die, you'll be rezzed, and the longer you stand there and let the melee<br />
beat on the baddie the faster it will be to that rez.<br />
<br />
Hopefully by now you have identified when to cast to avoid excessive<br />
aggro (if you are a caster) or how to ditch that aggro if you out-melee<br />
the MA (if you are a melee).<br />
<br />
For Nukers: Learn how to play your freakin' class and WAIT TO NUKE. You<br />
are NOT quad-kiting here! Your entire mana bar DOES NOT need to be<br />
inside the MoB within the first 5 seconds of combat. Wait until the MoB<br />
reaches 50% health, that is the accepted time to start nuking.<br />
<br />
For Melee: For Warriors, Paladins and Shadow Knights: If somehow you<br />
out-aggro the MA the best thing for you to do is STOP ATTACKING. Just<br />
turn off your auto attack and take a few steps back. NO, you are NOT<br />
cool because you got more aggro, you are merely a threat to the entire<br />
raid.<br />
<br />
For Rogues: If you haven't figured this one out by now... That's all I'm<br />
gonna say.<br />
<br />
For Monks: I play a monk. I read Monk discussion boards. I know this<br />
class well. Stealing aggro from the MA seems to be a &quot;Big Dick&quot; kind of<br />
thing among Monks. Apparently they seem to get a real rise out of it. If<br />
you are one of these monks, then you can take aggro once and log to go<br />
beat it off for the duration of the raid. YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL because<br />
you did more damage than the warrior. Turn off your &lt;expletive&gt;<br />
auto-attack and FD. I also understand that in some zones FD is bugged<br />
and this will not work properly. Under these circumstances please just<br />
stop attacking for the love of god and let the MA get his MoB back.<br />
<br />
For Rangers (Thank you, Fenia): Jolt jolt jolt jolt jolt. If you don't<br />
have this spell your entire life outside of raiding should consist of<br />
trying to get it. It's low enough level that you can reasonably be<br />
expected to be that level (51) and it's vendor sold. Weapons are also an<br />
issue. You're a dual wielding blender death machine in the eyes of<br />
mobs--never mind that you're being out damaged by the bard, they don't<br />
care. This means one thing--WOODSMAN'S STAFF. Or a better 2hb, but<br />
that's the old-school death weapon for rangers. Woodsman's Staff out<br />
damaged a surprising number of dual wield combinations, believe me, I've<br />
been in on tests. This is an uber enough weapon and generates FAR FAR<br />
less hate than just about any dual wield combination for comparable or<br />
better damage. If you're raiding, use this for Pete's sake. And if<br />
you're 54 , go hunt in Fungus Grove and get Jolting Blades. Remember,<br />
it's the lives of EVERYONE on the raid that depend on you not taking<br />
aggro, so don't.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dokor</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had that kind of probleme back in velious time when my guild start farming hall of testing.<br />
<br />
I just let them die a couple of time, they learn very quicly how to control their agro ^^<br />
<br />
With time i came to believe that nothing is more efficient than a MT who just step back from the mob and let those stuning paly or overnuking wizard tank a mob that can wipe their ass in no time to let them learn agro control in raid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's not really letting them die if they over agro, there's not alot we can do once they get summoned aside from taunting. usually against big mobs, the caster is dead before i get a successful taunt (tends to resist more on higher lvl mobs or maybe it's just me). for the adverage person in a raiding guild, they learn how much agro they can dish out before getting summoned very fast. as a warrior, grouping with your guild members is also very important as it'll let them get more fimilar with your personal agro capibalities. <br />
the most important part, like said before, is that no one jumps agro before you call assist. for junk clearing mobs, a good 10 seconds if fine, i usually just call assist right away after my first round of combat. the typical clearning mob doesnt last too long against raid DPS. boss mobs are different tho, take as much time as you feel you need. when i do a big mob, i watch all the debuff messages and call assist right after slow lands. if debuffs and a slow didnt pull the mob off me, nothing will, least not right away. since incite and opening up discs, initial agro isnt really a problem now that i can open up with furious (12 seconds for the CH rot. to set up) and a guarateed 400hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The advice you were given was fine and maybe that's all you need. But here's my take on the same subject.<br />
<br />
Your Responsibilities<br />
<br />
1. Own a bow with a decent range, buy decent arrows, max your archery skill and tag every incoming mob possible.<br />
<br />
2. Own either an aggro 2Hdr or 2 aggro 1Hdrs and put an Anger or YKesha aug on them. Make sure you are using a genuine aggro weapon - none of this half-baked aggro weapon stuff. It must have a proc that generates X Hate in it's description or procs a stun.<br />
<br />
3. Get in a group and practice with Tash and Slow on incoming. Tag with the bow, intercept the mob, hit it, press Taunt when it's on top of you, etc. Do this until you always grab the mob and the slower never ever gets hit.<br />
<br />
4. Know when you have real aggro. Practice with someone hiting the mob with a moderate nuke when you say Go!<br />
<br />
5. Group with your guildmates and practice your skills while they learn the limits of what they can do without you losing aggro.<br />
<br />
And Your Guild's Responsibility<br />
<br />
Experiance group play has gotten so sloppy that learning precise play and practicing it on raids is getting far too rare even among level 65 players.<br />
<br />
There is generally no reason for another player to stun a mob that someone else is MTing. No one else should be using aggro weapons if the MT is not holding aggro securely. Any melee other than  the MT that gets hit stops attacking and uses aggro shaking counter measures if they can. When they have paused three or four seconds then they can resume attacking. Nukers that get attacked get to use lower aggro spells or use aggro counter measures (Concussion pants, etc.).<br />
<br />
As a guild, do each pull by the numbers. Assign someone to Tash, Malo, Slow, Resist Fire debuff, and Cripple. Have them announce resisted attempts and success. Figure out what order debuffing should be done and when it should start. Announce when melee should Assist. Announce positioning instructions. Announce when to Nuke.<br />
<br />
When everyone knows exactly what happens and when without error the Raid Leader can stop spamming each and every instruction.<br />
<br />
Until your guild learns how to raid like a well-oil machine they are a mob, not a raid force.<br />
<br />
I don't know what your raid targets are, but I guarantee you that if you are doing content where sloppiness is OK, things like NToV Flurry Drakes or BoT Tower named are going to rip you apart until your guild learns raiding.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaboo</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the truth bud.  If you are at a point where the guild's clerics can keep the knight up, then by all means let them tank.  Aggro-lock is very useful.<br />
<br />
As you progress, you will face encounters where a defensive/evasive warrior is the class your clerics can keep alive.<br />
<br />
Finally, when you get VERY uber and your knights have high AC and Defensive AA's, they get to tank again. lol =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Zaboo I just won't accept that and have no intention of accepting it. We have been working on it and it is getting better. People need to learn their roles and how to deal with a Warrior. Not to mention what difference does it make if when I am needed to tank noone knows how to let me have agro. Our guild is making the right changes to make sure this goes well and all of the advice is/was appreciated.</div></div><hr />
