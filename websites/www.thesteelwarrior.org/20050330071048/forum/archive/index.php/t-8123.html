EoE was always great arggo imho, but the stats are really nice on the JoS. Arggo wise I am curious which would be a better choice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saint28</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have EoE and JoS both atm and both are A3 augged, was wondering which would be better in that comparison</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The two weapons are close enough when it comes aggro.  I think JoS has more AC?  Certainly JoS has better stats overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Midasa</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have both and end up switching off a lot.  With the JOS I have about 20 more hp and 5 more AC.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I use the JOS most of the time, but I haven't quite figured it out yet but it seems like some mobs get more pissed off at the speed of the EOE, and it does seem to proc more often.  I use EOE a lot vs. casting mobs, and when I'm lagging more.  But I don't do studies or anything, just go by instinct, and what seems to work at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EoE is better aggro than JoS (but not that much). But JoS's hate is much more tight to its DPS.<br />
Thus my suggestion would be do equipe EoE main when you plan to make a long fight (tipically as a Raid MT) and to eqquipe JoS main when you face mob with few HP (tipically exp group). Like this you will built up over time the more aggro when EoE is mainhanded, and you will get a faster early aggro to let the slow land sooner, etc ... when JoS is mainhanded.<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go with the JoS, better stats. Close to the same ammount of agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i usually use JoS offhand for the dps and EoE offhand for the neat stun proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you have Anger 3 on both, i'd suggest using JoS, for the better ratio/stats</div></div><hr />

Aug the JoS and there's no competition provided there isn't a primary hand proc frenzy.</div></div><hr />

questions about EOE, if it may be a few months before you had a chance to get a DB or fleshbiter, would anyone here suggest going for the eoe if it drops? would with jos with eoe suffice for agro ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavariel Baenre</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ofcourse it would</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I use that combo atm(F RZ).  Only peopel to pull aggro off me are generally other warriors... generally.  It's a good combo IMO if you've got a long wait for Darkblade or Fleshbiter.</div></div><hr />
