I plan to start anew on the Firionia Vie server as a dark elf warrior and rp my arse off. I would like to get one thing done right and that is the initial allocation of starting stats since the DE Warrior is lacking shall we say.<br />
<br />
I am a huge fan of Dexterity, would it almost trash my character to dump enough for a starting Dex of 100?<br />
<br />
I want to do one more shot at EQ before I quit for good as a Dark Elf warrior. I had it well as a Barbarian warrior, had almost as fun living the life of a Wood Elf Warrior, any advice for my last shot in EQ as a Dark Elf?</div></div><hr />

And truthfully, there could come a time when your melee stats are maxed, and you are using divine intervention (chance to ch you if you are below 15% health, chance goes up with more cha) so cha would be useful then =p.

<br />
I started out with 80 str and 80 sta.  (Dunno the base stats offhand, but I guess I put most of it into agi.)  Going through levels, the lack of hitpoints didn't bother me.  The low strength got to be pretty annoying at times though (bronze armor was heavy).<br />
<br />
If you think you're going in for the long haul uber end game, starting stats aren't going to matter a bit.</div></div><hr />

In the end you are going to have your stamina capped, while others like AGI, despite their smaller use will be much harder to cap. Sure STA is the most important of the stats, but its not going to matter when you are capped and those extra stamina points are just wasting away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having sta below 100 means you have negative effects if your sta bar goes empty.  When you get to the point you are capping sta, dex and str will probably be maxed also.  As for agi, 5 (or was it 7?) equals 1 actual ac, not even 1 raw ac.  Thats all.  Agi does nothing else.  Agi isn't worth jack.  From tests, 100 added dex was shown to increase proc rates by 1%.  Not worth bothering.  Str is the easiest stat for a warrior to max.  Now, as a dark elf, his sta starts below 100, which is why I still say he should put points into sta at least up to 100, after that the points don't matter much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have absolutely no idea why people are saying stamina.

Because there are quite a few people who can't hit 255 stamina..either thru gear, or maybe they don't have a shaman around all the time.  The deal is that the only way you're going to max stamina is if you meet one of the 3 conditions --<br />
<br />
1) You rolled an Ogre.<br />
2) You have enough platinum to get the correct stamina maxing gear in the bazaar<br />
3) You're in a high end guild.<br />
<br />
Guess what...the majority of the players in this game DO NOT meet any of those requirements.  Stamina is the best choice for them simply because the 150 extra HP they could get from 25 stamina points at level 60 would be a HUGE deal....far more benefit than 25 points of AGI or STR or anything else you want to put your points in.<br />
<br />
If you don't meet those requirements above, stamina is the way to go.  If you do, I guess it really doesn't matter where you put your starting stats, because sooner or later you'll end up with 255 anyway.  I'd even go so far as to say that it's useful for ogres and rich people too..because the sooner you cap stamina, the sooner you can start dropping stamina for HP gear, giving you yet a bigger lead over someone who didn't pump STA at creation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">STR and STA.  Unless you're going to be a PL'd toon in twinked gear.  Get STA over 100, get STR up enough to carry all your armor and the big bag of weapons you're going to need.  Your dex and agi should be pretty high already. (and they dont matter as much)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;2) You have enough platinum to get the correct stamina maxing gear in the bazaar&quot;<br />
<br />
Well dropping points into Charisma (so you get better prices on your vendor loots) and Strength (so you can loot more coins) means you have an easier time of gaining enough platinum to go shopping in the bazaar for STA increasing gear.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
So I say, as I've always said, put it all in CHA. But if you're a dark elf, maybe save some for STR since you guys start off like stringbeans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends what your goal with the character is...<br />
<br />
At low levels strength will make the most difference because it effects your attack so high strength will make it easier to clear through the moss snakes.  Early on stamina makes very little difference to your HP total at all.<br />
<br />
When you hit 50-65 ish range and your building up your gear and assuming you aren't a filthy twink (filthy twink being one with a BoC at level 10, not some dude with a couple of bits of cobalt and a lammy at 30) you'll be watching your HPs and at this stage as people have mentioned the extra HPs you get from 25 stamina will be significant.<br />
<br />
If you play your character all the way to uber raiding guild level, (or your the type of filthy twink that I mentioned above) then your stamina will be on of the first stats you cap.  I have a naked stamina of 80 and at the moment it buffs to 281 (1 point over my cap) so I'm not upset about not putting points into stamina now, though when my gear was lacking I used to really lament the number of HPs I lost to fattys just on the account of starting stats.  Now my only stat that doesnt cap is agility and seeing as I rarely bother getting this buffed it would probably be the most useful place to have put my starting points but it doesnt really matter that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea is to have fun, if he will have fun RPing a DE warrior by then all means he should go for it, instead of being cliched for some minor advantages in the beginning.<br />
<br />
As for the stats thing, I put 10 into str, 10 into sta and 5 into agi for 90 str, 90 sta, and 100 agi.  I admit I had no idea what I was doing when I made my char and it was right after Kunark came out when MoB's didn't hit as hard as they do in PoP.  With the advent of PoP, I wish I had put my points that I had put into agi into sta, but who knew....<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and female half elfs are much sexier than inkies imho :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but the sooner you have STA capped, the sooner you can start putting more importance on pure hp gear.  You can correct any starting stat weaknesses, but for a very long time, you will be glad you put those points into STA.</div></div><hr />

Everystat you can fix over time, some harder than others. If you don't put your starting points into stamina it's not like you'll be an awful tank. It sure as hell helps though :P</div></div><hr />

I easily hit the stamina cap of 280 with raid buffs (don't have PP AA) but I still just put some AA into inate stamina because sometimes you just don't have a stamina buff and even at the equipment level I am at its pretty hard to have unbuffed stamina at 255.  Examples of situations where extra stamina is nice would be in experience groups without a shaman or after a battle rez.  I am a level 65 dark elf warrior and I really wish I had put more points into stamina when I created my character just for these situations.  Once (if) your guild is in VT or the elemental planes this will most probably be different but most players never go to those places, at least in the first year of playing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say STA and the Tad of AGI also or maybe STR.  The STA to get over 100 like stated before. I would drop the rest in AGI because it seems to be a little more difficult to get with STA items (not impossible, a little more difficult). If all of your stats are maxing at the high end anyways then it wouldn't hurt having the xtra in AGI. My DE warriors lowest stat is AGI unbuffed. They all max when raid buffed though so..../shrugs  The STA will help lots on the way up and open up more options at the top end for gear. STR would probably help more than the AGI for leveling up.</div></div><hr />

Running out of stamina is a major problem when under 100 stm, and something you never notice when over 100 stm. And I beleive its still reletively hard to twink up to a reasonable level, though the crustation shell armor may be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do plan on serious raiding at higher levels, cha really is a good choice.  When I was lower I thought it was a mistake, but now I'm happy I put some into cha =p.  If you will just be taking it easy and not doing much raiding, sta is the way to go imo.  You won't have to bother with sta bar regen, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to disagree with the sta....as a 65 warrior I now find myself constantly maxed, and looking for items with less sta to trade for better str/dex/agi.  forget sta/str *starting points wise*  imo a warrior will easily come accross these stats in his travels.<br />
<br />
Of course if you don't plan on playing your warrior into the later levels sta/str are the best way to go, but sta/str are quite easy to come by on warrior items ...and in great quantity. I am sure this will be an unpopular post but too many times have I thought gee that 40 sta over cap would have been nice in my non maxed agi/dex.  Of course now days with a shm I max all melee stats regardless /shrug<br />
<br />
If I could redo my start, I would go Ogre dumping all that I could into Dex...the only reason I would even switch to an Ogre is the not being stunned from the front.....otherwise Barb is far better starting stats imho.  The ogre just starts to far behind in Dex/Agi and considering dex = procs and agi = less dmg( AC )...thats sort of important. Str just = better attack and sta of course *IS* important with it being HP.....I still chuckle when I think I put 10 points into INT.....long story lmao...first char etc...<br />

Whatever you do, GL with the warrior =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tam, you're a barbarian and had you put no points into stamina you would still have a base of 105.  An Inky however with no points into stamina would only have 75 stamina.<br />
<br />
The stamina modifiers on your gear give you 146 stamina, while this maxes you out with a stamina buff as an Inky with no points in stamina it would give 221 Sta, so with a shaman buff they'd be at 281 buffed which leaves a fair bit of room for growth once they start getting planar power AAs, and puts them at a small disadvantage HP wise when XPing without a shaman.<br />
<br />
Personally I think Inky strength of 70 is a bit low aswell and would make the character hard to start without twinkage, so I'd probably go 10pts into stamina and 15 into strength to bring them both up to 85.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think STA is the way to go. For most people getting to 305 unbuffed sta isn't easy without sacrificing raw hps or tons of AC. Even if you strive for the end game I doubt Str, Dex, and Agi are going to help you - simply because those stats are so easy to buff. My sta is my highest unbuffed stat but the only stat which I can't get to 305 with shaman buffs. Focus gives a ton of Str and Dex. Enchanter haste gives Agi and Dex. <br />
<br />
If you're in a high end guild with plenty of shamans, you'll probably be walking around with permanent Ferine Avatar as well (140 to Str, Dex, and Agi). If your guild doesn't have a bunch of shammies for this you may have primal instead (100 Str, Dex, and Agi). <br />
<br />
Cha is the only thing I might believe as being the best choice over sta for an end game warrior.<br />
<br />
 Speaking of which and kind of off the subject, but is the check for Divine Intervention based on your Cha when you receive the buff or when it attempts to fire? Anyone?</div></div><hr />

Not a hard stat to raise tho.. Hope u get that raised soon. Its a good thing they start out with AGI at 95. That will do u fine til later levels.<br />

You already having all those warriors..  especially  Elvan War's u should know about what to do. But maybe you should give an Ogre a shot for a Warrior before u quit ;) I'm exchanging my DE War for one. Not pretty to look at, but not playing a Warrior to be &quot;pretty&quot; ..  im playing her to kick arse!  <br />

If I do change to an Ogre War, then I'll start a  Dark SK. At least then i can utilize my intellect  , plus be sexy in my shiny armour :)</div></div><hr />

I refuse to take any graphical helm or weapons that aren't 'pretty'.  I'm my guild's main tank and buff to 9200 or so. You can do pretty and functional.</div></div><hr />
