<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JagdDoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys and gals.  Im getting back into playing after being gone for a few months.  Since then some things have changed and it seems like I'll have to be tanking more than I used to rather than just hanging out while everything beat on my ol' Ogre buddy.<br />
<br />
I'm not doing too badly I don't think but I'd like some more HP for sure and I think a couple of my stats are really lagging behind.  I only have about 10k to work with immediately but I'm sure I will be spending time farming HGs and Geos and whatever else I can.  My guild can only really muster probably one, maybe two groups 55+ to kill anything so keep that in mind as well.  I can do LDoN just fine but finding groups was always a pain before I left.<br />
<br />
Not worried at all about the IGS I'm wearing as I've been factioning for CoV for the Draconic Pauldrons.  I think I'm in good shape for weapons too at the moment, but I'm open for suggestions for just about everything else though.  Thanks in advance to anyone that can help me out a little.</div></div><hr />
