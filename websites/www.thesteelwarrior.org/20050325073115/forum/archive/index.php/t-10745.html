If caster types are doing double the dps to you that a melee does then your not taking advantage of pummel in Berserker stance. I usually charge switch to berserk wait for them to begin their cast then pummel. I hold off on MS til my first pummel then unload. I usually go a few fights to see what casts the particular mobs use. So I know if its a cast worth Pummeling or if its just a movement slow. I usually Pummel fire based casts and let them use frost if I know they commonly use it to slow me. Fire Rocs in Tanaris are great to use this on as their melee is very weak and they only have 1200-1800 hp.</div></div><hr />

He probably had mage adds, which can deal tons of damage and you can't do much about it when you're trying to finish off his buddy.</div></div><hr />

You have to go in and manually get the time you killed the mob in and divide away by it.</div></div><hr />

It should tell you on the on-screen read-out what your / fight dps was.  Doesnt store the info though, far as I can tell.</div></div><hr />

It's probably a feature of the UI then, I looked through everything and couldn't find anything on the actual parser program itself.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, thats possible.  Didnt think of that.  I assumed the Cursed-Gaming parser you linked would be just a part of the UI bundle, and would be the same one I use.  Im sorry, guess I was wrong.<br />
<br />
The UI is nice if youre looking for a new one.</div></div><hr />

It's cool, I may break down and get a UI here sometime.<br />
<br />
Do you find the dps parser to be accurate when running, unlike the cosmo's one that fluxuates wildly unless you stop/start it each fight?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is completely automatic...runs from first damage to death.  You dont have to start it or stop it.  It does run...you can see time between swings/casts affecting the dps.<br />
<br />
Also you can use a filter after the fight to see all the different aspects of your damage taken/given.</div></div><hr />
