<br />
Gemdiver covered all of this stuff better than I could have hoped to, so I'll just link it for you guys to check out...The meat of the post:<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that none of this should be considered an official statement, or guaranteed to happen. <br />
<br />
This week (as of Noon EST Friday):<br />
<br />
Total posts: 426<br />
Total threads: 39<br />
<br />
Topic: GoD Riddles<br />
Issue: Random people can ask for a riddle in zones such as Yxtta and then when others come along they wont be able to get a new one, effectively locking them out.<br />
Resolution: Corrected riddles to allow them to reset - Will be live in next patch.<br />
<br />
Topic: AAs being linked to levels in OoW and lvl 65 exp nerf.<br />
Issue: People were concerned that you would need a certain number of AAs in order to level up 65-70. They were also concerned that level 65 exp would be nerfed to 50% as it was in Kunark.<br />
Resolution (AA): &quot;There are no plans to require AAs to level from 66 to 70.&quot; -Rytan<br />
Resolution (Lvl 65 exp nerf): &quot;Also false.&quot; -Rytan<br />
<br />
Topic: Raid content for non high-end guilds<br />
Issue: Provide raid content that casual/family guilds can do.<br />
Suggestions: Ideas for scalable content, decreasing respawn time on more casual raid mobs. (Discussion still ongoing)<br />
<br />
Topic: Update on Class Issues<br />
Response: &quot;As to answers to the compiled class lists. Right now the team is focusing on things that are broken or bugs. Many of those changes will be coming in the next few weeks. Anything involving changes to DPS, is being evaluated and will be a longer term fix. Wish list items will be evaluated after those changes.&quot; - Brenlo<br />
Note: We have 2 interviews planned in the next couple weeks. One with Brenlo regarding the current state of the wizard class. The other with Rytan focusing specifically on the class issues we submitted and changes he's thinking of making based on those issues.<br />
<br />
Topic: GoD Baking<br />
Issue: There are no recipes for Taelosian Wheat<br />
Resolution: No response yet (fairly new thread)<br />
<br />
Topic: Exodus Bug<br />
Issue: If you spam click Exodus but still die when you get back to your bind point exodus goes off anyway.<br />
Resolution: Waiting on response<br />
<br />
Topic: The Level 30-50 Number<br />
Issue: Lots wondered how they calculated it (did it include bazaar mules, etc)<br />
Resolution: &quot;It is true that most accounts are in that range. However I do not think we will be releasing the exact numbers. We do take mules into account as well and have an estimate as to how many of the accounts are secondary or tertiary accounts. <br />
<br />
One thing to remember is that EQ has over 500K subscribers worldwide. That's a lot of folks spread across 48 servers, plus the foreign servers. The casual gamers will not have the same play habits as the &quot;Uber&quot; gamers and thus it is rare that their paths will cross. It is also a matter of perspective. The hard core player tends to hang out in hard core places while the casual game is putting along in many other zones. Thus the perspective among those groups will be much different. It is easy to say, &quot;well all I see are high level people,&quot; when you only frequent high level places. There are nearly 300 zones in this game. People are everywhere.&quot; - Brenlo<br />
<br />
Topic: Breakdown in Communication Quest<br />
Issue: Primals dropping pages, Night Watchman Fxi spawn<br />
Resolution: Primals will now drop pages 100% of the time. In addition mobs all across the zone will drop the pages (though much more rarely) allowing a single-group progression through this step. Night Watchman spawn has been tweaked to make it a more common.<br />
<br />
Topic: Guild Wars<br />
Discussion (ongoing): Ideas for having an instanced Guild war zone with certain rules and such. Could have instance specific win conditions, durations, etc.<br />
<br />
Topic: LDoN<br />
Issue: <br />
(1) Request to be able to return items for a refund.<br />
(2) Request to be able to remove augments without destroying them.<br />
Resolution: <br />
(1) Rytan is looking into a system for refunding items. Almost definitely this will be implemented in some form although the exact percentages and such are still up to debate (many people suggested 50% return).<br />
(2) Looking into trade-skill based solvents that could be used to remove augments without destroying them. Most likely low level augments would use simple easy to get components and type 8 augments will require a stronger solvent that will require a little more uncommon components (my suggestion was using some of the GoD tradeskill stuff - or making these components drop in hard ldons) They're also considering making the solvents straight up vendor purchased.<br />
Note: Discussion still ongoing on both points, will keep you all updated.<br />
<br />
Topic: FV Roleplaying<br />
Issue: Many people go to FV for the no drop rules rather than to roleplay<br />
Discussion: Two senior SoE staff (not sure if they'd want their names here) have been very active in this thread. They're looking into ways to reward those who do RP along with other suggestions. (Discussion ongoing)<br />
<br />
Topic: New PC Models<br />
Issue: People were curious as to new PC models that Smedley told us would be released hopefully sometime this year. There was concern over them being outsourced.<br />
Response: All artwork goes through SoE art people before hitting the game to make sure its how they want it. There's a rumor out there we get pointy hats, but the only official word I got on that when I asked was: &quot;I am going to make you sit on a pointy hat. Silly Wizard. Trix are for kids.&quot; -Brenlo<br />
<br />
Topic: Spell Recovery Bug<br />
Issue: With fast casting spells sometimes you can't misplaced error messages casting.<br />
Resolution: (What spell recovery bug? =D) Being looked at.<br />
<br />
Topic: Experience in Natimbi/Qinimi/Riwwi<br />
Issue: Exp is very low for these zones which are aimed at casual non high-end players<br />
Resolution: Just posted today, no response yet<br />
<br />
Topic: Norrath-themed Expansions<br />
Discussion: What expansions could be done using Norrath lore (no aliens!)<br />
Lots of good ideas here including an 'underground norrath', miners stumbling into the Underfoot through the hole, adding a bunch of new zones off Antonica and other old continents (Dragonscale Hills anyone?) Still going on here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a refund plan is established, it seems to me that they should change it so normal no drop items are good for tribute, at the very least, and even that seems weak in comparison to refunds of adventure points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I Like the AA deal not requiring 500 AA to level Post 65(100aa per level 66-70) Even though AA is do-able just teadious to spend so much time to grind in fire or kod groups.<br />
<br />
PC models - I like this as I take pride in my character and would like to have a more variety of chosen looks, hope that it comes with this, different armor types would be nice. Different template armor-looks that you could switch between much like the Face ability that you can change around your eyecolor and hair color, the same for armor would add much more variety per race would be a good addition.<br />
<br />
2Handed Combat animation(1Handed as well) could use an overhaul to make them look much more realistic, add a couple combat animations, a few for 2handed for different swings and a few for different 1hand swings... <br />
<br />
Discipline Stances- It would be nice if they also implemented Discipline like animations- One for Defensive Stances and one for Offensive stances- Nothing to much to ask for In my opinion.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting animations- It would be nice if they had different animations for casting spells as well just a few more so you could know what a wizard was casting over an enchanter ^^).<br />
<br />
LDoN Refunds should be a nice system, it will result in people not having to spend countless hours just to get another 40hp aug for their new piece of hardware that requires 1150 points- As well as the piece of elemental they just banked for Qvic armor with a 40hp aug to allow interchangable augments for a price that would make it somewhat burdensome to do this many times over and require people to be selective because of this reason.</div></div><hr />

I hope they also look at the Sewer parts, killing 4-5 named per part is fucked up when they come on average 1 name every 3 expeditions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">be able to remove augments without destroying them. <br />
<br />
Please tell me they aren't considering restricting this to LDoN vendor augments only (I couldn't but notice it was under the topic: LDoN).  Being able to preserve your mob-dropped augments (lots of GoD augments and a few of the LDoN raid augments in particular) is much more important, IMO.<br />
<br />
Any new information pertaining to this particular subject that anyone out there feels like sharing?</div></div><hr />

Because LDoN purchased gear isn't dropped off a mob just for killing it. There's a bit more work involved. Refunding points allows purchased gear to be used more in a progessive style format more in line with the LDoN storyline/quest. LDoN can and is considered by many to be one really long all progressive quest, except that right now, unlike the shawl/ring quests, there are no interm rewards that go towards the final reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would go a long way towards a feeling of *progress* in the LDoN/non-raider game - build up to one level of gear, trick it out while you build up to the next level of gear, etc.  All you'd haveta do is turn a blind eye to the repeated maps (and changing your theme selection every couple of nights goes a long way there).  Raid loot always felt to me like it was attached to progress (*Woo!  I'm closer to being able to go to zone X and raid for ...*).  LDoN never felt that way, as there was no way I was gonna spend any points for items or augs that were not my final objective - the time sink wasn't worth the payoff.  It felt like slowly saving up for a new bike, one which I better be ready to enjoy for a good, long time.<br />
<br />
I agree that no-drop items should have a Tribute value as well, that they did not  just shows how much Tribute is a cheap item sink.  But comparing one approach (or customer group) to another is an apples:oranges error.  If LDoN is broken, fix it.  If raid/high end loot upgrades are broken, fix them.  Assign each upgrade path a template (*LDoN is less risky, and so should take more time investment for significant upgrades*, *Raid loots are more random, and so should be bigger one-shot payoffs when people do get to loot*), then tune each path to its template, not to the other path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One thing to remember is that EQ has over 500K subscribers worldwide. That's a lot of folks spread across 48 servers, plus the foreign servers<br />
hmm, <br />
500000 subscribers, across 48 servers = 10416.666 subscriptions/accounts per server.<br />
hell, even if there were 10 foreign/ubisoft servers added to the 48 that's...<br />
500000 subscribers, across 58 servers = 8620.6896 subscriptions/accounts per server.<br />
<br />
so as a base; 500000 subscriptions multiplied by the monthly fee ( last i knew ) of 12.95 = $6,475,000 US Dollars.<br />
<br />
if it's $13.95 it's now $6,975,000 US Dollars. <br />
<br />
500K subscriptions? I highly DOUBT there's 500k subscriptions ( 10K+ subscriptions per server and IF half were logged on there's be just over 5000 people online at any given time. ) . too bad you can't see server populations any longer. i'd like to see the #'s .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Back when things got laggy a while back there was 10-12k people on each server though max was around 3k at any one time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious as to where you're getting those numbers from. 'Back when things got laggy a while back' (started right before LDoN release, if you're referring to what I think you are), the server populations being displayed at server select screen was already long gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Before they removed the numbers, Solro had spiked up near 3000 during prime time. Then the first server splits came, etc - it was a long time ago.</div></div><hr />
