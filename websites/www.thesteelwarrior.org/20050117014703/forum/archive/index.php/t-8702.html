<br />
I have joined a Raiding Guild been raiding with them for the app period and now 2 weeks full member. I have gotten some significant upgrades lately and wanted to hear some oppinions please. I did not post this in the normal gear thread due to the UBER/Casual Threads flying around. I am working on cranking out some more points to get Anger 3 Augs but is not really top on my list as I am not MA and will not be for a bit. I am used as TM on somethings already. Any suggestions would help for gear and AA. <br />
<br />
I am not Time Flagged but am close only Rathe is holding me back at the moment. <br />
<br />
My guild is not really doing Elementals anymore we are concentrating on GoD and Time.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well, if i was you i would take whatever i could get, just about anything at the level that your at will be a crazy huge upgrade, as for AA's there are many discussions for AA path, most aren't that different from one another</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minet</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">go in on everything  or buy all the cheap items with dkp.<br />
<br />
only one slot looks good :) some are ok , some are poor<br />
<br />
dont waste yer dpk/merit on weapons, but spend all you have to for the right one, find a good one/ set and make it a one time purchase</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was posted here Kilzalot due to the raging threads of uber vs causal and I am sick of seeing them. I did not want to post a check and ask for help in the normal area and have people scream and whine that they cannot access even what I have now. <br />
<br />
Minet thanks for the thougth of not getting any weapons I was wondering about those. The slot that looks good I am guessing is the Bracer I got yesterday :).<br />
<br />
The reason for the eclectic mixture of gear is due to the very cheap cost on anything that is not God/Time in my guild. Also some of the items I have came from the multiple times I have done tipt/vxed and the ton of time I have spent in KT farming so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reviction's in a position where you actually could get some weps pretty cheap I bet.<br />
<br />
First thing's first, though, pick up all the Time gear you can. I've been in Triune for about 2 months now (from a non-elemental guild) and it seems to me the actual plate armor from Time tends to go for crazy cheap these days since you're seldomn competing with caster / hybrids because of the lack of focus effects. (Faerune on Armguards, Strike Through on P3 gloves, etc)<br />
<br />
GET ANGER 3 AUGS. Fenny and co won't always be online, and god forbid they quit playing one day. Are you gonna just say, &quot;Well, I've never tanked before, I prefer the life of a non-tanking SK&quot;? Your goal should be at all times to be building yourself to one day be Reviction's MA. You never know what's gonna happen man. (get the type 7 A3 augs for now, or at least one of them, and when you have a cheap shot at an EoE or JoS, I'd jump on it and snag the type 8 anger 3 for it, with BoC for off hand)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks man I appriciate it <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ketel kaotic</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would bet ya guild has top geared warriors.<br />
<br />
You can blow all you points catching up to them or atleast trying by buying pahse 1 loot in time and some phase two gear. <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
You can hold off see what rots.  How long have they been in Time?  You can probrably get some phase 4-5 drops that are better upgrades.<br />
<br />
Basically it all depends on how long your guild has done time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I see that your guild is in Qvic. Getting in to PoTime does not seem very likely for you unless you can get lucky on the Rathe, but I wouldn't count on it at this point.  You need to spend every waking moment grinding AA. Make sure you finish off any tanking and HP AAs as soon possible.<br />
<br />
I would suggest grinding in LDoN hards if at all possible. You need to rack up LDoN points to get some augments I noticed you are missing. You need to at least get the 5 10ac augs from LDoN. They are cheap and you can't pass up 50ac. Work on getting A3 and the 40hp augs as well. Any dropped augs you can get your hands on should go in slots that you cant put 10ac or 40hp LDoN augs in.<br />
<br />
When you are not grinding AA, you need to try and get in on as many Qvic mini kills as possible. All of the drops you don't have are pretty substancial upgrades to what you have now. You should also have access to some pretty sweet weapons as well, a Fleshbiter or Jagged Onyx Staff should be easy enough for you to get. You are going to get kind of hosed on non-visible armor slots as you probably won't be getting Time gear and the GoD stuff is likely to carry a pretty high price tag. If you have your PoEb key, then you need to find out who is killing the Rathe still. Do what ever you can to get on a raid for the flag. Getting in to Time before your guild stops farming there would be tremendously beneficial just by picking up the rot in the early tiers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I forgot to mention one other thing. I noticed that you mentioned that you are not likely to be MA any time in the near future. Forget that, that's rubbish. You never know when you will be called on to tank. You might not be the first choice for the job, but you need to be prepared for the occassion in any case. Any number of events could lead to you having to step up and tank. Having the proper tools - A3 augs and the necessary AAs - is up to you. Always assume that you could be next, because it might save the raid to have a warrior who is paying attention and steps in at the opportune moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ketel they have been in time a long time they normally clear it in one night. I still need rathe to get to time.<br />
<br />
Wandor I am working on LDoN when I have time for sure I have been the only tank up and had to clean up so could rez. Thanks for the sage advice Wandor I really appriciate that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that and it's a valid question and gripe.  However, I don't see how this in any way pertains to the &quot;high end game.&quot;  A thread with the title of &quot;New Raider Questions&quot; isn't something I think should show up here.  But that's just me.<br />
<br />
As for your question... F PoTime.  If your guild is farming Qvic hard, then you'll get a full set of Vadd's fairly easy I'd think.  There are a few nice items to be had for sure but there is a replacement for just about everything in GoD.... definately don't take a bunch of P1-2 shit loots.</div></div><hr />

Then I'd have to talk to him =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
caldron, to get good loot you must pull down demani's pants and spank her!<br />
<br />
but yea, just focus on the qvic equip.  the only thing from time you should be looking at is quarm bracer.  and im sure youll get into Time soon enough with discos now downing rathe and multiple other guilds still doing them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was like the first item I looted from Time and I was a recruit at the time and didn't know any better :P  Tell Cyno to stop being such a homo and cough up some rings =/</div></div><hr />
