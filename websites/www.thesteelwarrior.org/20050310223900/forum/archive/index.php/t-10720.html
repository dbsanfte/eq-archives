I don't mean on the message boards.  People seem interested around here.  I mean in game.  I log on and look at my guild manager.  During prime time non raid nights we might have 40-50 people on.  I've hardly seen any of them in DoN zones, maybe 1 group at a time.  Most are still in PG, Riftseekers, RCoD, and elsewhere.  I check /lfg, which hardly seems to be used anymore.  There might be 10 to 20 people L65-70 /lfg, and of those that have comments, only a couple mention DoN.  But most want GoD/OoW.  I'd really like to do DoN missions, but usually can't find a group for it.   Bleh.  So I've completed 1 mission.  It's far easier to find a group grinding exp in OoW.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this lack of interest in the new expansion?  How do you explain it?  When most any expansion except maybe LoY came out, lots of people rushed to it for at least a few weeks if not longer.</div></div><hr />

Having the weaps go live at 15/19 kinda took the wind out of my sails.  I'm sure I will get an EB aug, maybe Chaotic Strike, or whatever, but the weap being what it is has made it much less of a priority for me.</div></div><hr />

I want to and I plan to but there is just so much other stuff to do still.  I think expansions are coming way too fast now.  I haven't finished everything I wanted to do in GoD yet and there is tons still to do in OoW and now DoN... I still love EQ and am happily playing and plan to keep playing... pretty funny that my biggest complaint is too many options!  ;)</div></div><hr />

If so, there's absolutely no reason to complain that the top of the line armor/weapon aren't that great because you can just get them from people who didn't need them, or you can say do it with 4 people and then invite 2 bots before the turn in and then split the extra crystals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you give a very very short summary of those?  Do you just hand in faction tokens to one side and get more faction or is there some other activity you need to undertake?</div></div><hr />

And the items that drop suck, the augs and gem purchased items being nice but no eye openers.<br />
<br />
Though the exp you get is very nice, there is no chalange there, mabey I need to get higher in the mission progression for the hard ones that will chalange time+ guilds. The only saveing grace is that you can go with very unbalanced groups and do well because of the ease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless some other things become apparent as we learn more about the expansion, I'll not linger in DoN and will only do it if my guild finds a raid target.<br />
<br />
It's appears to me that it's targeted at lower level casual/family guild players.<br />
<br />
The dragons are fun to kill though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I'm in a fairly casual guild.  We're elemental and need coirnav and rathe yet for Time, but we don't require members to come to raids and we have a lot of more casual players.  So I figured they'd like this stuff.  :p  I can't get people out of OoW though, where I'll still hunt but I'd rather do both for variety.  <br />
<br />
I /who a couple other guilds from time to time and don't see them in DoN much either.<br />
<br />
I suppose more things to do, which is great to keep things interesting, is making it harder to get people to agree on what to do any given night.  Right now I want to work on Ikkinz group trials, PG and RS in OoW, and progressing through DoN missions.    That doesn't include simple exp grinds which add more zones like RCoD or even Plane of Fire if we're really bored.  Then of course people want to work on their epics too.  pffffft....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which one is that?  The collect 15 fangs took us far longer last night.  Granted we didn't have a good dps group, but fang drops were not all that frequent.  I'd say we had to kill around 50 drakes, maybe more.  There were a couple dry spells where we took down 8 or so without a fang drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You picked the only straight LDoN type mission. <br />
<br />
It's a nice one tho if you want to farm points with a less optimal group set up (no CC say) or just don't have much time for something more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the animated statue plans takes maybe 20 minutes, usually have a 20 minute lockout when it's finished.  just slaughter to the warlord room, he usually spawns as you get there, kill him, mez statue, kill staute, loot thingy off warlord, zone out and you're done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">u can do statue without mes, just agro the goblin, then FD, his guard will run threw and pop statue, kill statue, then pull gob... cake...<br />
<br />
By far the easiest one i have found is the first Norrath's Keepers, mission u get with faction.. its goal is just to kill a goblin.. 50% of the time u can run strait to boss.. the other times u might have to kill 1-8 mobs on way, never takes more then 20 min tops... and the boss mob is gimptastic =I</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gimblax mission for good side is the fastest mission.  It's not really an exploit.  It's just that absolutely nothing sees invis in that mission besides 1-2 mobs so you can just invis your way to his spawn and kill him in 5-10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Like others said, animated statue is pretty fast too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep.  That's why I did it last night.  We couldn't get an optimal group set up.  <br />
<br />
It's  one of the answers that proves the whiners wrong on everquestlive that claim DoN is &quot;too hard&quot;.  Give me a break.  You don't need anyways near the perfect group for this one, you certainly don't have to be 'uber', and you still get better than 3% AA per kill too.  It's an easy place to earn some pretty good exp and you get mission credit and crystals on top of that.  It doesn't get much easier in EQ than that.</div></div><hr />

A would just and play around in one and see for my self  but my comp wont let me log in... =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'd say WoS ish max on the first Missions you can get.  Im still way way rookie at the DoN stuff, but seem easy enough so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the best gear you get off the DoN merchants is, IMO, around OoW tier 1 stats.  You don't get the effect, but the rest of it is up there.  So it's another route to upgrade besides the OoW stuff (and most pieces of oow tier 1 are quite doable by non raiders).  Beyond that you can progress to Riftseeker's and Ikkinz groups (off the top of my head) for more upgrades.   Ok, i'm off topic... lots of ways to gear up in EQ now... though it's still a very time consuming game.   :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
and that why i play this game  :D <br />
<br />
as a follower of Rallos Zek i started as threatening to the good side 'Norrath's keepers' and am still dubious now , however the raid levels stuff is not 'easy' altho it may seem it , without revealing anything to those who are gonna try them , the dragons are FUN, with a capital FU , and can really mess you up until you work out a strat<br />
<br />
the Augments seem cheap until you realise that they're all lore , and they're not a HUGE increase over the LDon augs that a lot of people who can farm the missions easily , probably already have.<br />
<br />
<br />
but if you CAN slap the dragons ,there's a couple of really really nice items but be prepared to die like a ranger while you find out what they do , and one of them ( not saying which ) is bugged and unkillable  :eek: <br />
