<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorvak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What race/deity are you?<br />
<br />
If you are rallos zek, id suggest fierce heraldic armor.  It will not give you the best stats at low levels, but twinked you should be able to level fast anyhow and it will last you until raid gear.<br />
<br />
Possibly to help you level id look into an iksar regen breastplate - will give you the ability to solo to at least 25-30 if groups get slim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For 50k you might be able to get a fungi tunic and with that you could probably solo til high 40's or low 50's if thats your thing.  Once you get to 50 you could sell it and get a bunch of fierce heraldic or similar armor.   Its something to consider at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Look into cultural armour. If nothing appeals to you, or you are not RZ. Then try for a fungi. Fungi only lasts so long though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a question.<br />
what diety does everyone prefer and why do they prefer it...<br />
I have a barb warrior of the tribunal but i hear everyone talking about RZ and not a lot about the tribunal...<br />
is their a reason for this??</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Most people can't choose the Tribunal. Most warriors can choose RZ. The armor is approximately equally as good, or maybe the Tribunal specific armor was better... I forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Helanic Tundra is The Tribunal deity culture armor. I use it and it's about the same is Fierce Heraldic. I think it's same hp's/ac just different stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For the first poster: take 1K and search the bazaar for the highest AC shoulder piece you can wear for the money. Save the rest of the plat.<br />
Then go out and fight, develop your character, and level. Learn to play the class. You are decently geared right now. Do not end up being one of those lvl 60 warriors who has never heard of Splitpaw or /shield.<br />
I have a 31 shaman alt who is often main healer in pick-up groups. I can tell you that if two warriors are standing in front of me, and one of them is decently geared with a mix of stuff I'm sure he earned, and the other is twinked in full cultural, I'd just as soon pick the adequately geared warrior over the twinked one. That's because adequately geared warrior probably knows how to play. The twink is going to be either a highly skilled player on an alt, or (much more likely) a complete idiot who will get me killed over and over while telling everyone that this group sux and he solos these mobs all the time. <br />
When you get to level 40 or so, you'll have a much better sense of how to get the best bang for your 49K buck. If you spend it now, even on stuff like cultural, your gear will hide your mistakes from you. When the cultural needs to be upgraded, you'll be broke.<br />
A 36% haste item would last you for months after you get to 65. Cultural armor in some slots is still respectable at 65, but what with LDoN and other armors, you'd be looking to replace it. Fungi will need to be replaced much sooner than Cultural.<br />
<br />
Tribunal and RZ cultural armor: as far as complete suits go, I believe they have exactly the same AC. The RZ has 15 or 20 more hitpoints and some more DEX. Tribunal has more STA (thus probably more effective hitpoints, but it would be pretty close).<br />
Basically, they are equal.<br />
More RZ armor around, probably, because RZ is more commonly worshipped. But Tribunal is not rare by any means.</div></div><hr />

( Fierce heraldic has more +Agi, so the +/- AC can be taken in stride - this is problably mostly avoidance AC that you gain from agi )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Most of your equipment are good for your level and will take you far. You could however, at your current level, benefit from:<br />
<br />
A pair of ac6, hp65 rings (about 600 for both).<br />
Iksar Berzerker Club (procs at level 10, good for training 1hb).<br />
A good haste item is a must. Here you could go for the average silver chirtin handwraps or flowering black silk sash, both give around 20 % haste and cost 1 - 2k.<br />
<br />
Save the rest of the money for now and start looking for improvements mid 40'ties. By then, you should have a reasonable feel about prices for warrior items in bazaar. Don't rush out now and throw away alot of plat.</div></div><hr />
