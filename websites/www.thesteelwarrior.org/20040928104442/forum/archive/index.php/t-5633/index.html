<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone seen any big winners on the casinos yet ?<br />
<br />
I've spent about 2k and have only seen some stat food and 2 - 10 tokens prizes =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I spent 30k or so. Got lots of stat food, illusion potions, a +35 mr range thingo (woopie) and other minor stuffs.<br />
<br />
Golden ticket WRU?!<br />
<br />
I've spent a lot less than some people I know though...<br />
<br />
Why, oh why did they have to make a casino? <br />
<br />
Now my alts will starve. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bashemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my first 2 tokens yeilded me 20 more tokens, then +5 and +2 tokens in and out of misses. then all i got was kabobs and a hobbit illusion.<br />
<br />
i couldn't go to vegas, i'd be broke in 30 minutes =/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only big winners you see in casinos are playing blackjack, because that's the only game you can beat the house at.<br />
<br />
You're throwing your money away doing anything else.  SoE isn't giving you even odds on anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Casino is an obvious attempt by SoE to create a never ending Plat sink to correct the ecomony.FIGHT BACK,SAVE YOUR PLAT :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">but the casino is alot more fun than the bank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got the Guise of the Deceiver yesterday after only spending 500pp, i had bought 7 tokens and i got my golden ticket after the 5th hand in.  Needless to say my wife spent almost 5k and got nothing but food and extra tokens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent 2k and won another 20 tokens and got nothing but stat food, the casino is a waste, my extra plat and junk will go into the much more rewarding tribute system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guildie spent 170k (Yeah hes way too rich and was bored).<br />
<br />
Best thing he got was beer goggles... which of course I've had ever since griegs came out, cuz they're leet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">but the casino is alot more fun than the bank <br />
Cowboy bebop eh? :P<br />
And i gotta agree. People are willing to spend money for a chance to win something really cool, even if it is extremely rare. Not many will win, but this will sure get rid of some plat. And yeah, casinos are fun...would be nice if there were some prices somewhere midway between sandwiches and guise of deceiver! But what are ya gonna do...Don't like it, don't play. Wanna bash casinos, go to Vegas. Casinos were not made to give you money, they were made to take your money unless you happen to win. Anyway...glad the casino is back, looking forward to blowing some cash there soon!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I much prefer pulling with incite,  seems like it takes an act of god to take aggro off me when I pull using incite, plus you can cast on the run which is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">little by little they are plat sinking us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hmmm.<br />
Reading this thread has given me an idea. It comes in 3 parts:<br />
1) Instead of turning your money over to the casino, give it to me.<br />
2) I *might* give you something nice, but then again I might not, and I'm certainly not going to tell you what your odds are.<br />
3) I promise not to give you stat food.<br />
<br />
See? I'm a much better deal than the casino.<br />
Eh, no need to push and shove. Just form an orderly line please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Ummm let me think about that ...... NO!!!1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'll stick to the 1:1,000,000 odds for my Guise kthx<br />
It's not like plat does much for me, there's maybe 1-2 items I could upgrade in bazaar, other than that all i need plat for is twinking alts, i'd rather blow it in the casino and try to get 1-2 new toys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">100k got me a guise. worth every penny!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Reply to Haass first post... Blackjack isnt the only big paying game in the casino. I just recently got back from Vegas and Let It Ride payed me nicely.  Carribean Stud has a progressive jackpot, all you have to do is play the additional dollar to get a chance at it, you can even take a portion of the pot starting with 3 of a kind. Let It Ride has bonus payouts if you play the additional dollar, I won $8,000 on that table in one hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kxorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Playing blackjack 'perfectly' still won't tilt the odds in your favor.  Most medium or large casinos use 8-16 deck shoes, so the benefit of card counting is completely mitigated.<br />
<br />
It's never a good idea to go to the casino to make money, unless you are there to play poker.  That said, I like blackjack the best because if you play it well you can spend a lot of time and have a near 50/50 chance of winning, get comped drinks, etc. <br />
<br />
Did I mention comped drinks? :D <br />
