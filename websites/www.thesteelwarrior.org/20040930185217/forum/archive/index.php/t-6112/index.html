<br />
All HP/Mana regen, atk bonus, and DS effects have been removed from the Talisman of Vah Kerrath, leaving the effect as UV only.<br />
<br />
Luclin's been out for HOW many years now, and NOW they figure the effect's too powerful?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
edit: good, the effects were just changed.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the new messages in EQ. god.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/em hands the &quot;I'm an arrogant prick&quot; award to Fulorian.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the insults, asshole.<br />
<br />
Quite thankful itwasn't a nerf, it would have been uncalled for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No problem. Your welcome.<br />
<br />
In other news, could you investigate before you throw a tantrum?</div></div><hr />

If only.  It would be amazing how many less posts there would be if people would do that.</div></div><hr />

Tossing uncalled for insults and judgements like you're king shit and own the place... talk about elitism.</div></div><hr />

He's got a point. It's been like that for a while, and you HAD to know that they wouldn't do that without reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Jboots effect is now slower, fungi is now no drop.  These are well known sayings for a reason.  People who post reactions like this before actually checking do nothing but cause pointless annoying spam.  And frankly, it makes you look like an idiot.  Especially since they put this in the patch message:<br />
<br />
We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics. The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future.<br />
<br />
And it's not elitism to get annoyed by people who spam pointless bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I definitely missed that sentence.<br />
<br />
It IS elitism when you throw around needless insults, acting all superior, and when this is not the only message where behavior like that is seen.<br />
<br />
Myself, I'm glad I was wrong, but the insults were uncalled for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I called you stupid not to pad my own ego, but because you flew off the handle simply seeing the effect was changed, and you YOURSELF own this item and didn't even look at it.<br />
<br />
Calm the hell down. This so deserves lock.</div></div><hr />

A certain proverb about pot and kettle comes to mind :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sargman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I found it rather amusing online today to hear people at first panic in guildchat because they didn't read the message or just skimmed through it. Before realizing that the effects were no longer showing as effects, but rather what the effects did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the warrior forum, right? I thought being an elitist stuck up arrogant prick was a core class skill, so I've been using it as often as possible. If you want to be all huggly and egalitarian, go roll a woodie druid with a woodland-animal inspired double barrelled name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Note: the above druid REQUIRES an anime icon on all posts. It's kinda a legal requirement I think</div></div><hr />

<br />
first, throwing around needless insults has nothing to do with elitistm<br />
<br />
second, they were not &quot;needless&quot; in this case =P</div></div><hr />
