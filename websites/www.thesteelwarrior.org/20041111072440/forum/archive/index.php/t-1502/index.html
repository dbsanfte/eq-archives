<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aegamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm getting closer to my champion title and it's time I started thinking about my AAs.  Unfortunately, my knowledge is limited about them and where to start.  Do I want to start with defensive or offensive.  When I get exp from a mob, what % goes towards exp and what % goes to AA skills?  Is that something I set?  I apologize for my naïveté.<br />
<br />
These are just a few questions I seek the answers to.  I'd like to hear any opinions, strategies, and/or advice you can offer a warrior about to move on the the next level.  Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tenakha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my opinion you should get level 65 first then worry about aa's.  Defensive before offensive.  Xp is set by you on your aa page to what % goes to normal xp and what % goes to aa xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have heard arguments every which way about when to start doing AAs. I started when I was 52 because I had a friend who was gearing up for a fight with Naggy and I told him I would help. This let me still play and stay below the level cap. I am level 58 now and am nearing my 10th AA.<br />
<br />
I agree with most people, and from what I have seen with guildies it's true, that post 60 the AAs fly. However, I love having run 3, it has saved me too many times when crawling indoor zones. I would say if nothing else throw 10% of your exp into AAs while you are leveling and get Run 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I waited till 65. Since I rely on pickup groups, yet  also raid 65 was a greater thing for me. I got into groups easier, and also let me resist things on raids I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to stop at 60 or 61 and get Baron (run3 and seriously considering metab3 or regen3) then I will go to 62-63 and get some more Arch AA's (prolly just ca1 and cs2) then at 64 get ca3 and cs3 then go to 65 and do the rest. might get nd3 before 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dall18or</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since nobody else told you, the percentage of exp to normal level or aa is something you set. In the aa box there will be a bar where you choose. at lvl 51 the mobs you will be fighting are going to make getting aa's fairly slow, while normal leveling is slower then aa's it is more rewarding, get to at least 60 before doing aa's but only a couple at most it would be ideal for you to just work on leveling till you get to 65. When you do get to doing aa's go defensive. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turgan7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am currently working on my first AA and plan to get at least Run2 before leveling up any further. Run can save your but and make life much easier but after that I think just go for level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm of the opinion you don't want to be 65 by the time you decided to START getting your AA's. A newly levelled 65 tank with a good amount of AA's under his belt is always a better option than one who hits 65 and has none. <br />
<br />
I got run 3 as soon as I hit 51 as it was just too valuabe to ignore. Then a whole bunch more AA when i got to 60...that included AOE taunt (priceless ability this one). Each level after that I stopped level exp for a bit and got 3 or 4 aa more. By the time I hit 65 the aa collecting had paid off. Sure it took me a few more weeks to get to 65 than someone who went straight level exp until 65, but it was well worth it. I never did this divide some exp into aa and some exp into level exp, i just chose 100% one way or the other....made either levelling or aa exping simpler. Can't stand the way it drags along when you divide the 2<br />
<br />
Just my opinion. Gluck in whatever you choose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure what the point of this statement is?  Of course a level 65 tank with 50 aa points is better than a level 65 tank with 0 aa points.  <br />
<br />
IMO its up to you whether to level to 65 before getting aas or not, but I think that you should definately wait until 60 before working on any aas other than run3.  AA points are nice, but they don't compare to levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree on levels before AA.  Especially since they adjusted the con range for good exp and opened up the tier 3 planes there's no reason not to go straight to 65.  I'd take a 65 tank over a level 60 with ND3 any day.  What Binnamer posted about pick-up groups is definitely true also.  If there's a level 60 and a level 65 warrior LFG groups will take the 65 every time, and they won't ask how many AAs he has.<br />
<br />
I have Run2 from the flag turn-in thing and it's definitely nice, but SoW pots or J-boots arent that expensive and most of the good exp zones these days are flagged outdoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aegamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow, some really great responses!  I respect all your opinions and am looking forward to utilizing them. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did Run 1 at 55, Run 2 at 62, then levelled to 65.  My only two regrets in the entire process was getting Run2 at 62, I should have just waited until 65 and getting Regen over Innate Metabolism.<br />
<br />
Unless you are holding at 52 for Naggy/Vox, I would strongly recommend waiting on Run1 until about 55.  I seem to recall that each AA is about as much xp as is required to go from 51 to 52.  If you are doing AAs at 51 or 52, it is gonna be sssssssssllllllloooooooooowwwwwwww.  At about 55, you are at least past the KC stage and are probably getting xp in Seb, Velks, tier 1, etc and the xp moves a whole lot faster.  Instead of grinding out an AA in a week, you can grind out an AA in a day or two, then go back to levelling.<br />
<br />
As for my recommendation for getting Run1 and then heading for 65, the reasoning goes like this.  Run1 gives you enough of a jump that you can outrun just about anything in a dungeon situation.  If you are outdorrs, Run1 or Run3 doesn't matter much since you'll usually have sow.  Sitting around, grinding out the 5 more AAs to get Baron and then grinding out the additional 12 AAs for ND3 is just a waste.  The xp for those 17 AAs is better spent levelling, which gets you more hit points, better resistance to spells, better damage, higher skills (up to 60), triple attack (at 60), higher stat caps (61-65).  Once you get to 65 you can quickly blow out AAs on Run3, Innate Metabolism (stuff in PoP hits so hard that Regen becomes useless, imo) then ND3, AE Taunt, then whatever you want.<br />
<br />
Would the additional hit points from ND3 have helped on my way to 65?  Yes, absolutely.  On the other hand, I'd probably still be 62 or 63 right now and in the mid-60s hell of begging friends for groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My impression is similar to Brutul. The benefit of increase skill caps and hp from levels outweights any benefits. Lvls increase your wpn skills, your offense, your defense AND your actual taunt ability (thus DPS, AC and taunt ability are all affected). I see a lot of people mentioning that they are getting run3 as soon as they hit 51 and I kinda question that.<br />
<br />
However, I was 60 before Luclin, so I had to take that pain. I also had a few AAs before PoP, so you can take that for what its worth. My situation was different from what you face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">and remember  if you can somehow complete the poj trial that = a free aa if you 51 or up from the dwarf. My secondary warrior just got 6 aa's at level 51 for run 3 and regen 3 free )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>judorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well for me it is about getting groups. Since I used to due more than anything I stopped at 61 to get some of those AA's. I did regen and wished i had just put those points else where. <br />
<br />
It is true that AA's fly at higher levels. The other problem you face at higher levels is finding a group. I group mainly in the guild. But night after night I see warrriors LFG over and over. <br />

When or what you do is really your choice but waht ever you do...<br />

<br />
Yeah but second tank is going to be 65 and have more aa's in the same time it took the first tank to do aa's and then level to 65. Basically if you are looking for overall efficiency, get 65 then do aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am an absolute believer in run3 as soon as you feel it is feasible to get.  I can't tell you how many times it has saved my butt, saved me a boatload on sow potions, and made pulling so much easier.  When you are in an outdoor zone, sure, get the sow, but indoors it will save you quite a beating on a long pull, which may make the difference in life or death.  Now at 55 I have run3 and don't plan on adding any more AAs until post 60.  What I did for the AA was I only went 100% each direction, either EXP or AA, but I only did AA when raiding or in zone where I knew the exp was going to be negligable.  In these two instances your actual EXP will seem to hardly move, but with AA when you are done you may be pleasantly surprised how much you've actually gained.  Basically I saved the EXP for grinding, and the AA for raiding and questing.  Worked pretty well for me, and in the long run really didn't cost me very much EXP, maybe half a level at most.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think whether you pursue AA or level and when should be based solely on your equipment.  Many of the people who say get 65 first were 60 when PoP came out and already had 30+ AA and all their defensives (ND, CA, CS etc...) and as a result they were better able to XP in PoP, regardless of equipment.  If you have an unbuffed AC of less than 1180 I don't think you can be effective above Tier 1 in PoP without some defensive AA.  Shit above Tier 1 hits hard and you are gonna get pummeled.<br />
<br />
Because I am not as well equipped, ie at 60 was only about 1140 unbuffed AC, I spent the time and got RS3 and IR3, Baron, at 60, while still grouping in Disease (right and left corners).  At 61 I moved to Storms and Valor and found I was a mana sponge and did CS1, CA1, and ND1 to make up a bit for my poor AC.  The biggest difference in any of these for me was Combat Agility.  I  use Yaulp as a parser and the biggest damage drop came from CA1.  I got ND first because everyone, and I mean everyone, preaches that HP HP HP are where it is at.  This was true for Velious and Luclin when as MT in HoT you are getting hit in the 300's and taking minor AEs, but not so much in PoP.  I'm sorry but I would rather have the 500+ hitters hit me one less time per 10 swings than have an extra 400hp to buy another second for a CHeal to hit.<br />
<br />
If you have under a 1300 AC buffed in xp groups and are 61-63 you are a &quot;Tweener&quot;.  You cant get good level xp in Tier 1 and yet can't effectively tank Razorfiends.  So here is what I think...<br />
<br />
Over 1300 AC in reg grouping...get 65 then speed thru your AA in BoT, PoV, HoH.<br />
<br />
Under 1250 AC in reg grouping...<br />
Get to 60<br />
60 - Baron with Run Speed 3 included<br />
61 - 6 AA on CA1, CS1, and ND1<br />
62 - CA2 (and finish up CA3 only if you want the tag Veteran, but I didn't ;P )<br />
Get to 65<br />
<br />
<br />
As a 63 War with about 1240 ac in xp groups and CA2, CS1, and ND1 I am tanking effectively in HoH and PoV.  Next stop for me is 65 and then will finish my defensive AA.<br />
<br />
There is no right and wrong way to do it.  Look at 1) what is my equipment and 2) where do I want to hunt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When PoP was released, I had 23aa  (RS3, regen3, ND3, AoE Taunt).  <br />
<br />
At level 60, those 23aa made absolutely no difference in the amount I got my ass kicked around by PoP mobs.  Level 65, on the other hand, made a HUGE difference.<br />
<br />
Get 65, get aa.  A level 65 warrior with no aa is still more effective than a level 60/61 warrior with 100aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">AAs didn't exist until I was 60, so it was a non-issue for me.  IF I made a new character I would do a 90% real, 10% AA exp split all the way to 65.  You won't notice the loss of 10% exp too bad.</div></div><hr />
