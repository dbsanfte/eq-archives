Any wizard will keep/want the noq wand or even the CT wand instead of the tacvi weapon, the 25hp/mana and something like 15resist doesn't even justify the upgrade from the CT wand.<br />

Same I guess for the necros.<br />
These &quot;weapons&quot; are just good for new recruits or people who have missed every other primary items in GoD until tacvi and joined the guild before farming time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll agree on the wizard part that theres no reason to upgrade from CT wand<br />
<br />
As for the cleric weapon,  The main attraction (to me atleast) it is that the click is beyond Spell Casting Recovery Time.  This can help healing spike damage every 15 minutes or so.  Cast Holy Light, immediately click Supernal Remedy, 1.5 seconds later (no SCR) Holy Light.</div></div><hr />

Hmm I added it up to 33%. But anyway, Kinuvan established that shielding is indeed capped at 35% in another thread here.</div></div><hr />

is spellshield/shielding capped at 35 wonder what avoidance is capped at ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I would assume its safe to say all mods cap at 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>callius maximus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I would assume its safe to say all mods cap at 35.<br />
<br />
but avoidance combat effects accuracey are on diff structure than % like shielding spell shield dot shield.<br />
<br />
<br />
can get 25 avoidance on 1 item so its unlikely to be 35, probably 50 or 75 or maybe 100.<br />
Just be nice to know</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for the blade itself, i wouldnt be so fast to judge. everyone agrees that the fleshbiter agro is very close to darkbalde despite the weaker proc and proc rate. i think the raw DPS from this weapon will be enough win out over the darkblades advances proc rate. i think over all, we are better off with the beter ratio weapon since attacking is constantly working, where as procs are still tied to the RNG. i'm not saying procs arent important, but in this case the procs are the same. it'll be very interesting to see how it stacks up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bold statement, proof?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Not a terribly bold statement at all.  First, I stated outright that they were estimated.  The figures I did were assuming certain things:<br />
<br />
1)  Warriors attack an average of 1.71 times per round with their mainhand weapon<br />
2)  Melee hate is Damage Rating + Damage Bonus<br />
3)  Stuns are estimated at 400 aggro<br />
4)  The warrior in question will have Echo of Anger<br />
5)  Raid conditions (100 percent haste, no bard overhaste)<br />
6)  The zone does not have a proc modifier<br />
7)  Weapon Affinity, innate proc mods, and Combat Effects add arithmetically<br />
<br />
Brael believes there is a multiplier for melee dps, but I have yet to read the support for those when I was awake enough for it to settle in, so I have set that aside for this.  I have heard many people in my guild express a belief that certain zones have altered procrates.  I have not seen a parse to support this so I will again ignore it.  A warrior with Combat Effects out the wazzoo and the expected Weapon Affinity 5 should have the same number of extra procs from these effects as procrate enhancements would be illogical to code multiplicitively for the potential of abuse by Combat Effects afficionados resulting in ludicrous procrates, otherwise (Example:  Combat Effects 10 giving 7 percent, WA5 giving 50 percent, and DBoW giving 30 percent resulting in a total of 87 percent increase, not 109 percent increase, etc.)<br />
<br />
Assuming these, we have:<br />
Anger proc = 1225 hate (stun and DD will be augmented by EoA, direct hate will not)<br />
Darkblade at 58.63 attacks per minute and 51 hate per swing<br />
Estimated Darkblade melee aggro ~3439 per minute<br />
BBoB at 66.19 attacks per minute and 56 hate per swing<br />
Estimated BBoB melee aggro ~4263 hate per minute<br />
Estimated difference in raw melee aggro ~824 hate per minute<br />
<br />
The Darkblade has a 30 percent procmod.  At 2ppm normally, the proc mod will average (nice and simply) an extra 0.60 procs every minute.  The value of the missing 0.60 procs would be approximately 735 aggro.  (Note:  Most parses for procrates were indicating a procrate slightly higher than 2.0ppm, usually closer to 2.08ppm, which would mean 0.71ppm difference, for 870 hate instead, almost on the button for the difference.)<br />
<br />
This would indicate an 89 hate per minute difference in the aggro output of the weapons in favor of the BBoB, which also would benefit tremendously in situations where stat debuffs render the warrior's Dex below 305, where procrates suffer but melee dps aggro is unaffected.<br />
<br />
Unforseen factors and my refusal to get off my ass and look up the numbers and record them to the proper decimal places leaves the estimate with a very high potential for variance, but would indicate that they are very close.  Feel free to poke holes in my numbers.  I left plenty of room for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Interesting information, thanks for posting it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I snagged one the other night, and I'll do some proc parsings later.  Just glancing at it though I have not noticed a huge difference in proc rates at all.   Weapon Affinity and Anger III is generally more than enough.  It's a decent upgrade from the Darkblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Isnt it safe to assume most ppl have wa5? Wouldnt the 30% proc mod on darkblade give it 30%*3ppm = aprox 1ppm more than the bbob.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Assuming these, we have:<br />
Anger proc = 1225 hate (stun and DD will be augmented by EoA, direct hate will not)<br />
<br />
Darkblade at 58.63 attacks per minute and 51 hate per swing<br />
Estimated Darkblade melee aggro ~3439 per minute<br />
<br />
BBoB at 66.19 attacks per minute and 56 hate per swing<br />
Estimated BBoB melee aggro ~4263 hate per minute<br />
<br />
Estimated difference in raw melee aggro ~824 hate per minute<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
bbob: 3x1225 + 4263 = 7938<br />
dbotw: 4x1225 + 3439 = 8339<br />
<br />
So dbotw comes out 400 more hate per minute or aprox 5% more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Lucy's been off about a few things lately, I'd like to parse it myself just to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">imo the stats alone on the BBoB make it &gt;&gt;&gt; Darkblade.<br />
<br />
Assuming the drop in aggro will be just slight, the added AC, HP, and shielding should make the loss negligable. (Assuming there's a loss to speak of)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I was assuming that procrate modifiers are compiled additively, and not multiplicitively.  My reasoning behind this is that each piece of Combat Effects would have a greater return for having more of them previously, creating a very interesting and difficult to overcome overusefulness for a single effect.  No other effects in the game have increasing value for highest increments of equal size over lower increments of the same amount.  For this example, let's pretend that there are pieces of gear with Combat Effects 10 for every slot.  With eighteen non-weapon slots to fill, that would mean Combat Effects 180 if you had them all.  Every 10 points of Combat Effects increases procrate by approximately 7 percent, iirc?<br />
<br />
If the modifiers were added together, you would have a procrate bonus of 226 percent of the base (0.07 x 18 +1).<br />
If the modifiers were added multiplicitively, you would have a procrate of 338 percent of the base (1.07^18)<br />
<br />
Adding in WA5 and the Darkblade's innate modifier would then rendered them as follows:<br />
Addititively = 306 percent<br />
Multiplicitively = 659 percent<br />
<br />
Hence, I believe they are compiled addititively to avoid that kind of absolutely silly potential, and the 30 percent mod on the weapon would add 30 percent of the standard procrate to it, no matter what other gear was being worn, or .6 (or ~.71) procs per minute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Daze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Hmm maybe i shouldnt have asked , <br />
<br />
seriously tho , this weapon should be on a par with DBOTW , for one VERY simple reason , it allows SOE to allow players to advance in GOD and thereafter Omens , with the same 'good' abilities and equipment that a well tuned TIME enabled guild has .<br />
<br />
GOD is set for slightly smaller raid numbers then Time , ie 54 as oppesed to 72 ,  could it be that SOE has realised that a huge proportion of its customers will never see Time because of the difficulties in organising 70 odd customers at the right level , at the same time , and....could it be that the zones themselves are not yet stable enuff to accept two full raids turning up in Elementals to contest over the same Fennin Ro ?<br />
<br />
i think you can guess that it's a possibility that a lot of this stuff is similar to TIME gear but easier for non Time guilds to get in terms of numbers , tho not necessarily ability <br />
<br />
as for BBOB Vs DBOTW , well i'll be happy with EITHER thanks , beats the hell out of a bloodfrenzy and BoC , hmm <br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy , WA 5 , anger 3 , 305 dex , 5k hate per minute without DPS agro calculation <br />
JOS , same proc as frostbringer, more DPS  , but a lot harder to get , , does offhand DPS agro count for much , or should i just anger 3 a frosty for cheap offhand agro ?<br />
<br />
all this and more will be revealed ....... by you ,</div></div><hr />

If you assume an Anger is 1000 hate and proc mods are added linearly then you're looking at 600 hate/minute more from procs on BBoB, which is nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The main issue between the two weapons is that it is not a clear upgrade to the aggro output.

..But every other class is getting upgrades to their aggro output.  Healers getting bigger heals, rogues stabbing harder, rangers slashing harder, everyone and their dog nuking harder, etc.<br />

Well, almost every class.  The ones that aren't are the ones that want it.</div></div><hr />

1.39 ratio including the bane vs 1.09.  the dps upgrade is fairly significant and since dps = aggro your point is moot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">My post on the fourth page went into that in great detail, Aspit.  Yes, DPS potential is aggro.  So is the proc.  This sword procs less than DBoW.  It's sitting right there on the Lucy data.  The difference in melee aggro output is about the same as the difference in aggro produced by the number of procs missing.</div></div><hr />

This only applies to the proc rate however.  Every other aspect of the BBoB blows the darkblade out of the water.  I agree that having to downgrade your aggro for the superior dps/stats on BBoB kinda sucks, but for the complete package I don't think anybody with a BBoB will ever be seen using a Darkblade.</div></div><hr />

I didnt think that from Epics to Jaelen's, i didnt think that from Jaelen's to Bloodfrenzy, i didnt think that from Bloodfrenzy to Darkblade, which is why its disheartening that i DO think that from Darkblade to Brutish Blade =/</div></div><hr />

I agree.  I think they're trying to move us away from the paradigm of warriors valuing all weapons without pure hate procs at zero vs anything that does.  IMO that's a GOOD thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Stats and proc rates aside, the silly ass graphic has got to go.  Hundreds of man hours to acquire.....a BoT sword?<br />

And it's not just the Brute Blade either, the Death's Head mace is no different from what orc pawns wield....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Wait until somebody parses the DPS on the Brutish Blade. You will want one.  Agree on the graphic though.  The GBoS is a nice graphic, but BoT tower blade on a Tacvi warrior is sad.  I can't really think of a cool GoD sword graphic though, there are some cool blunt weapons, but no swords really, so maybe that's why they used an old graphic on it.</div></div><hr />

IMO they should make it so only 1 of the loot slots can drop the class specific weapons, so you at least are insured 1 &quot;real&quot; loot. Or add a third loot. Getting necro daggers and SK weapons will get old pretty quickly I think.<br />
<br />
But I guess this is a direct result of all the whining about the class specific weapon drop rates in PoTime.</div></div><hr />

I see you nabbed a Fleshbiter.  I expect it completely crushes Halberd's aggro?</div></div><hr />
