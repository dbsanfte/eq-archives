<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some reason I cannot reformat my computer, so i've looked around and found my original windos xp home edition cd'. Now I think i'm good to go for reformatting my comp since right clicking the C: drive didn't work, but after I had it up and running I forgot that I needed the certificate of authenticity (small piece of paper that was probably thrown out a long time ago not on purpose.) So now i'm left with the dilemma on how I can find my 25 character cd key for my windows xp version.<br />

<br />
I looked around on the microsoft site for troubleshooting but couldn't find anything, read up on something in the registry and it was able to be found through there but that was only for older versions of windows (pre-XP)... Just my luck I guess. <br />

If any of you are computer savy enough to help me out with this problem and find a way for me to reformat my computer send me a tell ingame with suggestions, or post them here.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you want to lay your operating system down again, and not reformat.  If you are reformating, there should be a disk that came with your hard drive that will allow you to reformat the drive.  If you're trying to lay down your operating system on an already formated drive, without that code key, you may be out of luck.</div></div><hr />
