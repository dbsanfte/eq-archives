<br />
It must be the most awesome, because I look at it all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slassh</div><div class="date">10-02-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lathern is basically right.<br />
<br />
Which warrior has the best stuff? The one who has the gear that he wishes. Whats the best? The Highest HPs? AC? Shielding? Reists? Of course all these factors play a part, but at what ratio is up to the individual to decide.<br />
<br />
EQrankings is an interesting tool, just dont be suckered in into thinking that one field signifies the best overall gear. Balance is key.</div></div><hr />

They really should have named it www.EQpenix.com</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They showed you where to find what you're looking for. Go to EQrankings and use the filters. If you want real magelo's you want to set the final filter to authentic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's stuff that hasn't entered the Magelo database yet, and there's stuff that hasn't even been found in the game yet ... so asking what the best warrior is, is a bit moot question.<br />
<br />
That being said, fiddling with magelo profiles can be quite fun.<br />
So, lets have a bit o' fun with it. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I fiddled with my own fake profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=409668) (you won't find him on EQ Rankings btw) today, to see how high AC goes nowadays. <br />
I think Magelo is accurate enough to give you a good idea of the approximate numbers.<br />
<br />
I did it in a way that *should* be possible in EQ.<br />
Ie. no multiple Lore items / augments and such.<br />
I think I got the Intricate Wooden Figurine and it's augment roght too, but if anyone sees a major error, please do point it out.<br />
<br />
So,<br />
Yeah, he doesn't have the most hitpionts.<br />
Yeah, he doesn't have a maxed ATK (I think).<br />
Yeah, he's using a slow ass 1 Hander and shield.<br />
<br />
I have to confess, I'm curious on wether or not he'd actually be a good tank, aggro wise.<br />
Though a double Anger proc weapon and a shield with Furious Bash VII shouldn't be too bad, I dunno if it would hack it in a raid encounter.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts comments on that ?</div></div><hr />

I have not yet figured out how to add Augments to my Dream profile.  I am a premium member of EQrankings so that everyone knows it's not fake, but I am still way behind alot of guys.  Not even in the top 100 on my server, I know there are alot of upgrades that are easy that I can do, but when I make a profile with them the stats don't seem to warrent the change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is a reply directed towards my fake profile, I'd just like to point out that the Range slot is already filled. :)<br />
The ammo slot however, don't give any stats, even if the item in there has a bunch.<br />
So I just put an arrow there and a bow in the inventory to swap out with for pulling.</div></div><hr />
