<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to put together a force to take down Trak for a bard friend, and wondering what I'll need. I can call up about 3 groups of lvl 61 - 63 peeps to help out, pretty well balanced though somewhat light on caster DPS (fair amount of melee DPS). Is this a sufficient raid force to get the job done easily? with difficulty? or no chance?<br />
<br />
Any tactics that work better than others? Any way, for example, to avoid the port to shroom room (CoHer in group with MA/SA/TA, for example)? Any advice appreciated...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your force sounds very sufficent. My advice ( it worked 3 times for us so far ) is to kill Jumpy and Guards if he is up just before the turnin so you have plenty of time before gaurd repops. Everyone setup shop near Undead Bard, have CotHer in MT group and ST in same group. Have ST stand with bard, let bard turn in and run away. Have ST aggro Trak and get banished, while CotHer summons ST, have MT engage and tank for 30 seconds. By then MT gets Banished and ST steps in, Trak will prolly drop in 50 seconds with that that force.<br />
<br />
Make sure all classes that can cure the DoT mem their cures, but cure casters first since melee can take it. Most melee can survive till the end of the fight easy, and be cured then. Make sure bard plays AE resists.<br />
<br />
Goodluck and let us know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your force should smoke Trak, we 1 group him pretty regularly and my 56 war has tanked him easily. He only hits for max 700ish. There is also an easy way to beat Trak touch. Soon as the MT gets banished, have him sit. He will get summoned right back. You should have Trak dead before the banishes anyone else.</div></div><hr />
