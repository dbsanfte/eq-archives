<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragnarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me and my wife got lvl 65 (cleric) not to long ago and we are doing various things to take a break from the mindless grinding now.  What we are looking for is some mobs that we could possibly duo that would be hard.  So far on my list I have:<br />
<br />
Lodi (already done)<br />
Kelorek`Dar(can't find him up)<br />
Gore in DL(dunno if 2 can take him, gonna find out)<br />
Severilous(seen a Shaman solo him so gonna try)<br />
A Shadow Overlord in ME (already Done)<br />
Gantru Raldukan (still looking to find him up)<br />
<br />
If anyone has any mobs they have done or can think of to add to this list please post the mobs name and the zone they are in so I can research em.  Also, I know some of the dragons fear so I may add a bard friend to come with us on them so our resist are high enough to avoid the fear.  Loot isn't playing a primary role in our decision on what mobs we are doing, just looking to have some fun and see if we can actually pull some good kills off:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Raldukan should be cake at that level. I duoed him as a 57 cleric with a 60 BL back pre-PoP.<br />
<br />
Might want to add some of the WW dragons to your list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would of added WW dragons but atm I am on ally CoV faction, that will be changing in a few weeks then I can start on them.  Also, I am honestly not sure how hard some of the mobs I listed actually are, so if some seen easy like the raldukan my bad:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have this very same question.  Lookin fer stuff fer me 65 cleric (wife) and 64 warrior (me ufcourse) to go duo which will provide crapastic alt exp, yet cool loot and a whopper of a great time.  So, bump!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your worried about CoV faction then check for Esporla of the Ring in WW.   She's a 53 wizard dragon that casts silence and the other WW CoV dragons assist her which makes for a fun pull and fight.<br />
<br />
... Oops, sorry, shes on RoS faction, she's a embassador to CoV dragons from RoS dragons.. somethign like that Lore some were  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">various WW dragons<br />
telkorenar<br />
servitor of luclin<br />
praetorian mygal (if he doenst wield the DA hammer :P )<br />
druid epic endmob (fish dragon)<br />
bene quest giant cap<br />
drusilla sathir<br />
ragefire / talendor<br />
vadyn<br />
<br />
mhm thats some of the stuff that comes to my mind, telke has TONS of hps and the luclin stuff has high ac and high HP regen so  u prolly have no chance at all to drop their hp, clicky haste and MoR help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zelnithak in UP is a fun duo</div></div><hr />

Tried to duo this guy at 65, with a 65 shaman. We couldn't get him past 96% hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
He has insane regen, otherwise we could have done it. To pull him, just run to his room, whack him and run to zone and zone out, he will just hang at the zoneline forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragnarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We tried Zelnithiak, got him to 85% but he had to many HP's for us to duo.  We ended up doing big Z with 5 people.  Did Woushi with 4 people that was fun.  Did the Overlord in ME with us 2 only, that wasn't hard.  Gonna be trashing CoV faction soon then will try the dragons in WW.  Thanks for the input all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey Ragnarian,<br />
<br />
I'm wanna duo lodi with my wife.  I'm wondering if you have any pointers for taking down lodi?  I realize you have about 1000 more HP than I do at lvl 65 (looked at your magelo), due to a few aa's you are ahead of me in, and you gotz some betta equipment.  I plan on getting to you're hp &amp; stats before attempting if you found the battle a close one.  If not I may attempt as is.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't mind, does your wife have a magelo?  My wife is interested in seeing what equipment &amp; aas a 65 cleric will need to duo lodi, as well.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any information you provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your wife's cleric needs to be at least level 39.. that's about the only requirement.<br />
<br />
You need to be able to live 10 seconds against a double 300 hitter.<br />
<br />
Anything above is just cushion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lets not make Lodi that that trivial with saying all you need is a 39 cleric.. dont think they'll have enough mana or mana regen to ch you until the battle ends..<br />
<br />
At the same time, I duoed Lodi at 60 with a 56 cleric (kei).  You should have no problems at all but bring a ToD (which im sure you have if you duo a lot) if you are uncertain of the outcome.<br />
<br />
Gore sounds tough due to the slow AE and his regen...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Telkorenar is just not possible to duo. Way too many hp, your cleric would be oom before you got him to 90%. We did him last night with 13 and the fight lasted about 20 minutes. Praetorian Mygal is also not possible to duo due to his insane regen. I cranked out almost 300dps on him with my wizard when we took him down with a 5 man group (65 wiz, 58 war, 65 bard, 65 ranger, 65 cleric) and the fight was tough toward the end, both me and the cleric where close to oom.<br />
<br />
Everything else looks pretty good. You might want to toss in some DPS class and make a trio. Fight times would be a lot shorted, but the fights would still be a ton of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would put Talendor as being easier than Sev. I've duoed Tal a few times with my shaman and the problem is fear (even with around 250 MR). He's never dotted me with 200ish FR. <br />
<br />
Of course with Sev he fears and stuns - this could be a problem for getting heals when you need them. <br />
<br />
I've never duoed Sev (haven't tried yet), but I have walked him quite easily with a 65 druid and another melee helping. The key to these two dragons is having a tank on them (with one its a little tough if the tank gets feared... the odds are two tanks won't get feared at the same time though) and having at least one healer who is not stunned or feared. Again, it's unlikely both will get feared at the same time.</div></div><hr />

 Could you tell me more tactics, AC/hp when you did this, what about the cleric?..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">errr..<br />
<br />
I dont remember... I think i was 1200ac 6khp.. about 6 months ago.  I know I needed kei on cleric tho.<br />
<br />
Smack him around with defensive until ToD procs then switch weapon...  really no strat at all.  I had to make sure ToD proc'ed at least one more time because the fight will last more then 3 min.  (at least it did for me at that level)</div></div><hr />
