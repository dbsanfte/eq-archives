Second, sorry you had such an unpleasant evening.</div></div><hr />

I've had similar experiences in BoT and other places.  Its very frustrating for us.  Its really up to that monk to control his aggro.  Even our MT with HG and BF and max AAs (def and offensive), can get aggroed pulled from him if others want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been noticing this disturbing trend of monks, rangers, hell, even beastlords wielding CHOS lately.  I guess they figure, and rightly so, that since nothing in LDoN can really hit hard enough to kill them that controlling aggro isn't quite so important.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Though he might not have said it,  just holding a CHoS screams he wants to be MT.  Someone should have suggested he put that thing away before he hurts somebody.  Any bad fallout from him holding aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time this happened to me, I sent a /tell to the Cleric saying if he healed the Ranger with the shiny hammer, I was gonna lose both my taunt and /shield buttons, and that I wasn't real sure where my attack key was either. One rez later, the Ranger put the toy away and got on with helping the group win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I have stated before, only a n00b uses aggro proc weapons as a non tank.<br />
I get a sick humor though out of rangers and bards wielding these who get aggro in BoT and wont stop attacking and SPLAT......thats what ya get &lt;evil grin&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monks can easily wield the Copper Hammer of Striking and NOT get aggro.<br />
<br />
If they're smart. If they evade properly.<br />
<br />
It's not the hammer that caused your problems. It was the monk.<br />
<br />
As my warrior I've grouped with a few monks that just don't bother to evade, and it's really frustrating.<br />
<br />
The one class a warrior should NEVER have aggro issues with is the monk.<br />

<br />
If a monk/rogue uses a wpn combination with high agro then it's hard for anyone to keep up.  In my case the monk was using a tstaff till I told him either he had to switch wpns or tank because I wasn't getting into a retarded agro war with him.</div></div><hr />

I've seen several Ranjurs wielding a CHoS. It's not always for damage either, sometimes it's because they are going to Tank in LDoN.<br />
<br />
SoE has managed to create an environment where the vaunted Warrior survivability is meaningless, the Taunt button and aggro weapons an unexceptable method to generate aggro, and utility is king.<br />
<br />
I was in a group the other day with a Paladin. We all agreed I was to MT. The Paladin pulled with a stun. I soldiered on bravely trying to get aggro with a BoC, CHoS, and the Taunt button. At least twice during each fight (usually when I had aggro) the Paladin would stun again. About 10 minutes into the LDoN adventure the Cleric gave me a /tell saying that since I couldn't hold aggro would I mind switching out my BoC so he wouldn't have 2 melees to heal.<br />
<br />
In the past I've had an SK do the same thing. When I raised the issue in /groupsay he replied that he shouldn't have to change the way he plays just because I couldn't hold aggro.<br />
<br />
This is getting less fun every day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically I avoid inviting Monks, Paladins and SK I don't know to pickup LDoN groups just for this resaon; I hate wasting an entire adventure fighting against someone elses ego.  Its sad because these other classes have alot to offer...just not worth the aggravation if I'm makin the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its LDoN who cares who holds agro.  I just use my highest DPS 2h weapon and let whoever has agro tank.  Sometimes I hit taunt sometimes not.  Sometimes I tank, sometimes the monks tank, sometimes the wizards tank while they blast stuff to pieces.  Like a mob meleeing for 300 ever hurt anyone.<br />
<br />
If we ever get a massive pull I just hit aggressive and go to town :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also noticed this trend of classes that should'nt want aggro wielding aggro weapons and then wondering why they get aggro.  The sad truth is that alot of them just don't have any clue about aggro management, and don't realize that the weapon they're swinging has a high aggro proc.  The ones that do and keep using them are just assholes with something to prove.  Like taking aggro from a warrior proves anything other than how retarded they are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sad truth..  I mean its his 13 bucks..  I dunno..<br />
<br />
SoE just needs to give me some g$% damn aggro control ability superior to these f-ups so I don't have to hear this kind of crap anymore.  Damn it.  How about some kind of YELL (i know i know DIABLO) but do something...  They just can't sit there...  C'mon already what are they waiting for?<br />

I can see it now ,the next patch message:<br />
<br />
&quot;After many months of thoughtful work and tediously long hours[all Warriors inhale]...we are proud to announce all new EMOTES!!!!<br />
<br />
Warriors can now laugh away the hours spent LFG while doing crazy emotes , some that are WARRIOR ONLY!!!Provide great entertainment,maybe even make extra cash doing your class specific emotes at weddings and guild events!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
The simultaneous sound of Warriors deleting their accounts deafens the SOE server room employees</div></div><hr />
