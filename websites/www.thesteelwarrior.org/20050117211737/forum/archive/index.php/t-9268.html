<br />
What is the order of &quot;push&quot; that each weapon type has?<br />
<br />
I am guessing, from least to most:<br />
Pierce<br />
1H slash<br />
2H slash<br />
1H blunt<br />
2H blunt<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It may even help to dispell or calm some beliefs about a concept that is terribly mistaken for the most part.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: The title may be decieving, but go down 17 posts and read the novel by Coprolith. That should answer your question.</div></div><hr />

My main is a beastlord. I know about the misconceptions about pet push,  only too well. :)</div></div><hr />

I know certain types of pets push differently than others and that BL and shaman pets in particular (possibly due to how they are commonly equiped) have a lot of push - relative to say, a mage water pet which has basically no push.<br />
<br />
As to the original question...I have no idea if weapon type even affects push...I think that's the first time I've even heard that question. ;)   So...my guess is weapon type doesn't matter...but that's only a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should have read down more. 1handed weapons all push the same way. 2-handed weapons all push double 1handed weapons (so it balances out if dualwielding).<br />
<br />
Pet push is correct in that thread, a water pet pushes the same as an air pet, but the air pet has a stun, and that stun is what adds push.</div></div><hr />

In most cases, the two handers have twice the delay of the dual wield weapons, which means the two handers will have less overall push.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well...if the air pet is always using the stun, effectively the air pet pushes more...that's kinda like saying a rusty axe has the same push as a CHoS.  Sure, the base weapon push is the same, but the CHoS has a proc that pushes, so effectively it has more push.  Maybe it's just a different way of looking at things, but I'm always looking for the net/final affect.  So, for me, the air pet has more push than the water pet.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coprolith</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not all stuns have a push component. According to Lucy, Air Elemental Strike  is one of them, so an air pet does not push more then other mage pets because of its stun. Afaik, the only pet proc that does have a pushback component is the proc imbued with the level 51 spell Spirit of Wind, which no self-respecting beastlord uses when he's in a group for that very reason.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I've never tested the push on piercing, but i see no reason to assume it would be any different from 1hb, 1hs or HtH. And Sassinak is right about 2H'ers giving less push then dw'ing in general because of their higher delay.<br />

It won't matter if it's a crush, slash, pierce since it'll have the same amount of push.  Special attacks like kick / bash have more push than a normal attack but they happen less frequently.<br />
<br />
As far as pet push, it is somewhat dependent upon the type of pet.  If it's a rogue type (ie some necro pets) or some mage pets that do not get a kick or bash, then the push is going to be less than a warrior type pet.  Anyone that has played a BST and solos often knows that pet push can be offset by fighting on the opposite side of your pet.  2 benefits of this 1) limited mob movement 2) pet hit percentage is higher.  Pets get blamed for the push when they will do relatively the same amount of push as a normal player.</div></div><hr />
