<br />
My guild is just starting Uqua and while it's challanging, I don't see mobs hitting for 3000's or anything and flattening Knights upon zoning in.<br />
<br />
How do y'all see the changes?<br />

<br />
700-1400 at start , and goes up to 2400ish max if you stay too long.<br />
(Actually double DPS because they haste up &amp; harder to slow).<br />
<br />
Still 6 mob traps are lame (AE taunt &amp; Fortitude &amp; Pray for rapid lock down).<br />
But seeing like 10-15 guilds have beaten it so far, i guess its like TRC.<br />
<br />
The moment its made doable, everyone that's been long enough in there will just sweep easily.<br />
<br />
With a little tuning (more trash, more multipulls, no traps) and some surprises<br />
(rare AE blind, AE slow, AE manadrain) Uqua could had been the most enjoyable zone in EQ History.<br />
<br />
It ended up beeing the most hated one. Which is sad since the idea 1 death = 1 add is awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most Knights I've talked to have said they can live longer against the named in ikkinz / mountains, sometimes its enough, sometimes it isnt, the chance of living is higher then it was, but generally you still have to deal a decent sized chance (i really cant give out a good number since it hasnt been long enough) of just failing because of the RNG.<br />
<br />
Personally I hate failing for no other reason then bad luck, I suspect most warriors will say something along the lines of well thats what you get for being a hybrid. oh well.<br />
<br />
Better then it was? Probably? Fixxed? IMO... not yet, we also lost a good portion of our advantage against yard trash, them being 65 and below made it so our stuns were a decent advantage, now there are much more 66+'s which really make that advantage not as much as it once was.<br />
<br />
In short, for the trials I think most people will still heavily heavily look for a warrior to tank em, but if none avaiable they might go with a Knight if they are willing to risk a decent chance of failure just because of bad rolls.<br />
<br />
Really need more data nad experience to form a more complete opinion of them either way though imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm more interested in seeing some feedback than provoking an argument. But  :) <br />
<br />
My sense thus far is that max hits are down quite a bit, but I felt damage was pretty choppy. You could get hit for 200 and the next hit for 1400. From a Warrior standpoint, I found mobs in the border region between wanting to cut down damage with Defensive (just to give my single group healer a lot of slack) snd the knowledge that if I use it, I won't have it for the next mob which will be coming before Defensive would have a chance to refresh. So, with a single Cleric not paying full attention to you, I'd call it challanging.<br />
<br />
My feeling is that IF I was a Paladin I might very well want to toss myself a heal should my HP's drop near 1/3rd and there wasn't a spot healer (Shaman or Druid) in my group in addition to a Cleric's more focused attentions. Light of Order (assuming the PoTime BP focus effect) actually looks tailor made for this purpose (to a non-Paladin).<br />
<br />
I think the result may be (from the mobs I saw) riskier with a well equipped Paladin but very doable.<br />
<br />
Stuns that interrupted for a second or two would definately make the mobs more Paladin doable and maybe even give Paladins a substantial advantage, not that the choppyness wouldn't still be disturbing.<br />
<br />
They may have missed some mobs and fine tune a bit more, but I &quot;felt&quot; the mobs were much more Paladin tankable and interestingly enough a bit too tough to be tanked by a Ranger.<br />
<br />
So, thus far, not badly out of balance. I did see on PoN a Paladin who IMO is about 700HP's short of a full deck say he was tanking pretty well except in Ikkinz. Which given that all the one group trials are no longer manditory (if I understand correctly) might have been left as a &quot;preserve&quot; for top tanks - those trials do drop near PoTime loot.<br />
<br />
Obviously the jury's still out but I think it may be looking better than some of us expected.<br />
<br />
BTW, since I generaly don't use Defensive unless its a &quot;serious&quot; mob, I too have a feeling that the dice can come up wrong and the Cleric be a tad late and I'd be dead too. IF you are sufficiently equipped it's always RNG that kills ya (or a late heal, generally because the mob got a luckier round than expected).<br />

So many knights complained until they made a compromise that they shouldn't have, why am I not surprised you can still spin it so it sounds like the short end of the stick? Pffft. Soon Omens of War will release and paladins in Luclin gear will be tanking Ikkinz trials and Kod`Taz rares, while complaining about how they should be able to have an easier time of it.<br />
<br />
Sorry to sound grumpy, but cripes. YES, knights in appropriate level gear could tank fine in GoD. Now knights not in appropriate level gear can tank fine in GoD. An SK with a good chunk hp less than myself, was tanking for my group day before yesterday with Virtue + self buff only. Pre-Time gear and lacking buffs. With a level cap increase and more AA around the corner, I'm disappointed they gave in to the whining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The max/min hits on Ikk/Uqua weren't changed.  I cannot tell if they have lower attack as well but it doesn't really feel like it just by eyeballing.  Even if they're nerfed Ikk/Uqua still dishes out significant punishment unlike KT/mountain areas where you can pretty much pull a red without worrying that it's even slowed.<br />
<br />
Problem with Uqua mob especially is that almost everything has a min of 100 with high maxes so hits go all over the place, and defensive pretty much cuts anything's DPS down by half except the loot droppers.<br />
<br />
The traps are much more manageable now.  They now come staggered instead of having 5 mob in the same area and you hope your warriors pick them up by some miracle.  They even throw in a druid in there most of the time on traps, which is like a freebie since it takes forever before they stop casting engorging roots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The DB/DI of mobs as phantron said are either unchanged or marginal change, the chance of taking a shitload of damage as a knight and dying w/o possability of being saved, is still there its les then it used to be, I'm not sure of how much the chance is and what a good threshold point for AC/HP is for knights to tank em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">05-17-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't that what was wanted, a better chance of surviving these trials?  No one expected them to make it so warriors and knights had almost equal odds of surviving the bosses.  But it sounds like they lowered the bar of where a knight needs to be gear wise to have a shot at it.  Of course they lowered the bar for everyone, which may make some high end people mad.  As someone in a mid tier guild, of course I'm pleased that maybe they made a bit more of GoD accessible to me.  I'm not concerned with Uqua.  If I ever get there, it will be a long time in coming.  But maybe sometime, still a ways off I'm sure, I'll make Kod'Taz.  <br />
<br />
Maybe, for various reasons, the devs have decided that the bar was set a little higher than intended for GoD.  I'd expect that the last few zones of GoD will still be all Time geared+ guilds, but perhaps mid tier guilds will have a few more zones to use.</div></div><hr />

However, gimping an entire expansion's worth of content doesn't solve the problem long term.  What will happen in the next expansion?  Do I really believe in my heart of hearts that when the level cap goes up, and the inevitable higher DPS mobs are added, that EQ's devs will remember the lessons of GoD and not make the same mistake?  No, I don't.  The same issues will be back, in spades.<br />
<br />
/shrug Who knows how much longer I'll be playing EQ though.  Could be another year, or not.</div></div><hr />

Let us, for the sake of discussion, come up with a hypothetical scenario where certain mobs in a new expansion killed Warriors at about a rate of 90%.  It didn't matter what the Warrior did, fired off defensive, fired off evasive, river danced wearing clogs, it just didn't matter, he died 90% of the time.  If the devs came through and said, oops we kind of over did it a bit there, we really didn't intend for the failure rate to be that high, we had better make some adjustments, would that be &quot;gimping an entire expansion&quot;?  And would it be reasonable to assume that in every expansion from now on the devs would do the exact same thing?<br />
<br />
Making the game playable for all tanks without requiring they be Warriors with Warrior abilities just to function at a reasonable level isn't gimping anything.  It's correcting a design error.</div></div><hr />

Um, you missed my point.  <br />
<br />
You can split hairs and call it gimping or not.  I'll even agree with you and call it &quot;content rebalancing.&quot;  However, do you really think the devs will recall past lessons and not repeat that mistake? I don't.  I think the next expansion will call attention again to the same kinds of problems, and further widen the gap with new levels and new higher DPS mobs.  <br />
<br />
Rebalancing? Yeah I guess, but a longer term and scalable solution would have been preferable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a longer term and scalable solution would have been preferable<br />
<br />
With a level-increasing expansion right around the corner, and the fact that knights in appropriate gear already could tank this stuff (even though many whined that it was too hard), leaving this particular aspect of GoD the hell alone would've been preferable. It's not like they didn't have 100 other more pressing issues with GoD to address - the squeaky wheel got the grease. Too bad the other wheels weren't as squeaky, cause this one was fine, while several other wheels are basically falling off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know where people get this idea that requiring defensive/evasive makes things bad.  We only have had defensive for around 5 years now and it's not like suddenly content is messed up because it's in.  I think most of the complainers confused the fact that GoD mob pre nerf can wipe the floor with ANYONE not just Knights.  Of course they kill Knights faster than Warriors like it should be.  The only thing wrong with them is stuff simply hits too hard.  Not only do you have high max, you also suddenly jumped from regular mobs that previously rarely dual wielded, and you also have haste all over the place, and you also have Chaos Claws that adds a nice 1-2k of spike damage.  Even now I can still get floored by a dual wielding hasted Muramite, even on content that is more or less trivial to win.  Yard trash DPS in general is too high.  It is still a bit too high (due to presence of haste, and most group's inability to deal with haste).<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong at all with a game balanced around defensive.  If defensive doesn't exist then warriors would have to have some kind of innate ability to mitigate damage better, and guess what, stuff that can kill Warrior will still kill anyone else faster, and then you'd be saying innate mitigation is causing the game to be screwed up.  Heck you might even say a good solution is to remove innate mitigation and put something like defensive instead!</div></div><hr />

Let's just make everyone the same class with the same abilities, then everything will be fair for everyone because we are all exactly the same.  Yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rebalancing? Yeah I guess, but a longer term and scalable solution would have been preferable.<br />
<br />
Defensive has been around since Kunark, and GoD was the first and only expansion where it was necessary that it be commonly used.  We have something like 4+ years of expansion after expansion where defensive wasn't required against trash mobs and most named mobs.  Yet they mess up one expansion in four years and we're to assume that they'll make the same mistake from now on?  That seems to be assuming a lot.  I know SoE can be slow sometimes, but they have a much longer history of not making defensive a requirement all over the place then they do of making it a requirement.</div></div><hr />
