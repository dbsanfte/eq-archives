<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Probally wont play EQ2 unless WoW sucks , waiting friends trying FFXI too.<br />
<br />
Why not EQ2 :<br />
<br />
1. SoE sucksssssssss, Patches follow with several patches to fix bugs in patches. Their Programmers seems don't what's TESTING.<br />
<br />
2. SoE even know a problem, just the melee problems, their reaction or fix is way tooooooooo long.<br />
<br />
3. SoE sometimes even cheat our $$$$, LoY is almost completly no content to high levels. Add 8 bank slots charge you $.  Look DAoC, they added many cool effects and it's all free.<br />
(LoY expansion made most of my friend , guild-mates wont pre-order any EQ expansion now, if it's suck as LoY, we just won't buy)<br />
<br />
4. Run a script to transfer players from server to server charge u lotso f RL cash, from first NO transfer -&gt; pay for transfer without item -&gt; pay for transfer with item at a higher price. All is cheating player's $$$$.<br />
<br />
5. EQ rarely care what players want, like 3 hours for a LDoN raid is way tooooo long, esp. when cant let late-comers join.<br />
<br />
6. All the trade skills in EQ is super boring, click click click, click till your finger painful and need lots of pp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Self add more.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have to remember that SOE is a company and a sompany's reason to exist is basically to make money. I can understand why they charge $$ for stuff they make, even if it looks trivial, it's good business sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have no faith for Sony and any games they make. I think alot of EQ players feel the same way. Which basicly is that SoE turned death ears to all player requests to fix and/or adjust content to better suit us. That and the fact everyone who had or is playing EQ is sick and tired of paying for what feels alot like betta testing but unable to leave since it doesnt feel right to just walk away from character(s) that one dumped sooo much time into.<br />
<br />
I quit EQ for these reasons, but am still hoping against all hope that SoE will change one day and do the right thing. Its sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been running on this treadmill too long to start over again. After I'm done with EQ1 I won't be playing another on-line game. That's my reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whle I'm still wavering on EQ2 or not, being that Frodlin is from Freeport and I LOVE the Freeport intrigue, story, etc behind Lucan, Dushire, Qetalis, Darkmoore, etc. and would not really want to miss the lore extension, I'm obviously also concerned about EQ2 in terms of customer responsiveness how it relates to in-game issues with the track record of EQ.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I think it's important to be realistic about issues, and some of the things here are simply unrealistic.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. SoE sucksssssssss, Patches follow with several patches to fix bugs in patches. Their Programmers seems don't what's TESTING.<br />
<br />
Testing can and does pick up a lot of what happens, but things can and do get past testers, because testers dont' push things to the extent that production players do.   I'd rather see a downtime and repatch immediately to fix issues than to wait till the next patch to fix what needs fixing, and if you think they're going to catch all of the potential bugs, then you're living in a fantasy world, and I recommend something other than online gaming.<br />
<br />
Also having said that, since SoE took over, Patching has gone from one day a week being pretty much blown over patches to one patch a month, done pretty quickly and at a fairly convenient time followed by 1-2 fix patches over the next couple of days, again fast and at pretty convenient times.    If anything SoE has improved the patching process significantly over what VI used to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. SoE even know a problem, just the melee problems, their reaction or fix is way tooooooooo long.<br />
<br />
Agreed, it seems to take far too long to even acknowledge a problem and then to fix it in cases like this.<br />
<br />
3. SoE sometimes even cheat our $$$$, LoY is almost completly no content to high levels. Add 8 bank slots charge you $. Look DAoC, they added many cool effects and it's all free.<br />
(LoY expansion made most of my friend , guild-mates wont pre-order any EQ expansion now, if it's suck as LoY, we just won't buy)<br />
<br />
Let's not kid ourselves, LoY delivered exactly what it promised, new midrange levels and assorted goodies.   If you bought it for the high end game, you obviously didn't read about it before ordering.<br />
<br />
4. Run a script to transfer players from server to server charge u lotso f RL cash, from first NO transfer -&gt; pay for transfer without item -&gt; pay for transfer with item at a higher price. All is cheating player's $$$$.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how an evolving view of character transfers based on the growth of the game is &quot;cheating&quot; anyone out of anything.   At one time the playerbase was bottom heavy, in that characters below 60 or 65 were the bulk of the playerbase, there were server splits, etc.   It was felt at the time that the levelling process was inherently tied to the &quot;social&quot; aspect of EQ, and that it was inherently bad to put a fully geared or fully levelled toon on a new server which could disrupt existing social relationships and growth patterns.    When the playerbase began to mature, they decided to allow server transfers, but only if a sacrifice were made (ensuring that the &quot;social aspect&quot; of gaining gear was unharmed).   With each character exists a LOT of data, history, etc, and moving that data from one server to another involves the allocation of resources and as you so eloquently put it... $$$.   There's experience, faction tables, key tables, AA tables, and so on and so forth.    Any profession has about a 75 dollar an hour fee to perform any task and a 1 hour minimum in order to make it worth their time.  Now with the real maturation of servers, even the social aspect of gaining gear has no real effect on a whole of a server population and they've *probably* figured out a way to transfer gear information (which is VERY data heavy, each item generally has not only an item number, but a history as well) with less effort, they allow it, for a fee, which is NOT out of line with professional standards.   I fail to see how there's any issue with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. EQ rarely care what players want, like 3 hours for a LDoN raid is way tooooo long, esp. when cant let late-comers join.<br />
<br />
Agreed, although you and I can probably agree that LDoN raids were most likely a hasty addition to the LDoN expansion, which ironically was a result of listening to their playerbase's concerns about no raiding content.    The loot and reward system of LDoN raids sucks too.<br />
<br />
6. All the trade skills in EQ is super boring, click click click, click till your finger painful and need lots of pp.<br />
<br />
Agreed, actually my biggest concerns with tradeskills have more to do with their reliance in many instances on class or race specific skills (i.e. Foraging) which affects those who do not have those skills disproportionately to those who do.   Also, while the idea of cultural tradeskills are great, the notion that skillups in the area in which skillups for cultural items exist, for those who cannot create cultural items, there doesn't seem to exist an alternate path of skillups which requires the same level of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Why play EQ2 and have the same or similar problems we all face now when you can still play EQ ?<br />
<br />
3. I refuse to be forced to play EQ2 to further my current characters as a matter of principle.<br />
<br />
4. I will never play another online game again that is such major time sink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, since transferring your EQ1 character to EQ2 is a no no, how are you forced to further your current characters by playing EQ2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1/ Based on their performance in EQ, SWG, Planetside I have no further confidence in the companies ability to provide a decent gaming experience.<br />

It was discussed at some point to possibly open up the &quot;old world&quot; to EQ players who buy EQ2. I am also stating that in the event Sony realizes EQ2 will fail unless they coerce EQ players to buy and play EQ2 using this method.<br />
<br />
no biggy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I will not play EQ2. Period. They are TRYING to balance melee system after 4years? Can't say it won't happen to EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3. Lineage 2[/B]<br />
I concur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">EQ2 is gonna suck.  They are still fixing issues with the first EQ and it has been out for over 4 years.  Although there has been a change in ownership I still dont believe that excuses them from not fixing things when they were first brought up.  EQ2 is going to fail because they dont realize that EQ players that have spent tons of time playing EQ are gonna just give up everything they have earned and play EQ2.  The only way I would play EQ2 would be if I got the game for free and wasnt required to pay a monthly fee, and even then I might not because I have spent so much time in EQ (I did quit Eq for about 3-4 months but came back).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When EQ sucked me in in 99, I thought it was a very different game from what it  has become.<br />
<br />
The first few months of someones first MMORPG are normally spectacular. So much mystery and wonder. So little care for the current problems with the game and classes today. As I have learned more and more about the game and genre itself a lot of the mystery is gone.<br />
<br />
I will not touch EQ2 or probably any other MMORPG for now as the standard setup is endless hours of grinding. I almost bought FFXI, but I realised I will be grinding away there too.  I guess only a really revolutionary way as to how mmorpgs are played will interest me in the genre again.<br />
<br />
Ironically the graphics of EQ2 are the only thing that interests me about the game so far. But if its the same old gameplay concepts as other current mmorpgs, no thanks.</div></div><hr />

That is so true.  EQ is just too boring now.  Anyone who is level 65 probably feels this way to some extent more or less.  My first character was a dark elf enchanter.  I ran all the way from Neriak to Grobb at level 4 when I first made him.  That was probably the funnest thing I ever did, I had no idea where I was going other than that cloth map they gave us, there were red kos mobs everywhere, and it was a true adventure.  A few days later I tried to run to Qeynos via Kithicor and lost his body after invis dropped and the entire bixie nation attacked him.  That was still funner than the average 5 hour exp grind (3 hours LFG + 2 hours actual exp) that ends up being what I mostly do now if I even bother to log on.  Now if I make a new character, I take the book to PoK and can get anywhere in like 4 zones or less--very boring.  Now, I have been to most of the zones several dozen times or more and the mystery is gone and the game is so dumbed down and broken from when I started that it isn't really even the same game.</div></div><hr />
