<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok we are a new guild (~6 months) and for raids we can get around 25 -  40 people (levels 50-60) online. <br />
<br />
Problem is most of our members never done &quot;big&quot; raids <br />
and as guild we havent done &quot;big&quot; raids until now. <br />
<br />
So what we are looking for  is a place where oure members can learn there part on a raid. Also nice loot would be fine so that we can equip members. Most of us are on ally CoV faction and we are looking to do HoT as soon as we can get there. <br />
Is this a good idea - do our first raids in HoT ? -or should we try a outher place ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">KD arena is a good place.  You can pulling Kalis, and if your feeling frisky try a few vindi pulls.  How many monks does your guild feild?  if less then 2 you can get your SK's and necro's in on the fun of ome fo the splits for singles 8D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Train your guild on Vindi. You will learn some great raid techniques such as dealing with rampage, doing a cheal rot, and your pullers will learn a ton.<br />
<br />
After you get good on Vindi head to HOT and train your guild on dealing with AE's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try POF and POG for learning how to raid together.  Kael arena is another nice place to start out.  Unfortunately, they turned POH into an experiance zone so its not much of a training ground for raiding anymore.  You can also try Griegs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree with the above suggestions.<br />
<br />
However, be prepared for the morale swing shift if your raid gets wiped. Especially after a few times.<br />
<br />
Grieg, for example, is still owed a big b*tch slap from my guild. And I only say 'still' because a number of people got turned off on even trying him again. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i wouldnt really suggest doign fear. if you have a bunch of people learning how to raid fear CRs are by far the worst as there isnt really any *safe* spots in the zone, and trains come very easy in there. <br />
<br />
i would suggest hitting up the mini names in umbral planes, you can learn a few basics and get some decent loots. you might also want to look into spawning the dragon in veksar or some of the ring events in CT.</div></div><hr />
