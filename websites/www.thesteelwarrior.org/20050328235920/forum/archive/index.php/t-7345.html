<br />
We pulled him down on the right side of the arena, East wall. Tried both corners there, with idol and AOW couldn't reverse on any of the 2. Following kill we tried the North West corner of that same area with same problem.<br />
<br />
I had max shrink on first raid, and gnome illusion on second. <br />
<br />
Just wondering if it's just me, or if there's another place to corner him that still works after the recent patches? It's not like I can keep him on a leach and try various places at leisure  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
They simply reverse pinned my guild in the corner, and not the other way around.  :( <br />
<br />
We still kicked their ass though  :p<br />
<br />
Btw, we used the corner in the tunnel, just before the stairs where AoW spawns.</div></div><hr />

Used the left side corner, had bad luck with the right side. Now that sony fucked everything up again, not sure if it is possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fuck, I tanked AoW  - SINGLE tanked him - at level 59 with 3k less hps and a shit load less ac, yet at 65 with over 10k hps, 1800ac, 500aa's the clerics let me die. Unbelievable. God knows how we won. I tanked 1st, 4th and 7th and he died on the 9th tank. I presume our clerics went to sleep.<br />
<br />
Weonly went for a laugh so I presume our guild leader didn't know the clerics were asleep.</div></div><hr />

Only problem during the entire encounter was Idol got stuck in wall briefly until everyone backed off and MA pulled him out. AoW went very smooth without cornering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoarik</div><div class="date">06-02-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AWNN did the same on Firiona Vie last night. First I tanked the Statue as a practice run to see if cornering would work (it didn't) so the raid leader had me reposition him against a wall (which worked better but not enough), so after several resets it was determined that we should &quot;walk&quot; the AoW up and down the hall, balancing push and having the MT (Yethuy) announce a &quot;spin&quot; message as he turned him around at each end of the hall. It worked pretty well and turned what had become a fairly dull encounter for our raid force into something requiring some thought and good, sound tactics. In some ways I prefer it this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your raid is half disciplined at staying behind the mob and you do a slow keyboard circling of the mob (sidestep right, turn left) I find the raid has a tendency to push the mob in a tight circle, usually more or less staying in the same place.  We call it dancing the mob.  <br />
<br />
If you have to tell people to stay behind the mob, this won't work.  So you need folks who aren't total muppets, but this isn't that complicated a thing to do.  The only time we bother cornering a mob anymore is when the mob has some knock back or other AE that makes it necessary.  Or maybe when the geometry of the situation doesn't allow for even the slight movement of the mob that dancing it requires... <br />
<br />
Makes for more fun in the tanking too.  Cornering, you back him into the corner and go for a smoke.  This way you have to actualy pay a bit of attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">didiaquarr I did this the first time my guild killed Vindi. But not becuase we wanted to. It was because i had a new  hotkey set up so i mashed the /def key before the vindi pull thus rendering my tanking ability. So we had our second tank do it. He never made it to corner and died  when Vindi was about 90% or so. My def was up then so i just started turning vindi in a circle. Only I always keep the mob on my far shoulder so that I am always out infront of him.  With a step back or so. Basicly the  same as you. <br />
   When we did AoW last we tanked  Vindi in corner next to the ramp to arena. He was slightly buged so we went diagonal from that in the corner away from ramp. Idol wouldnt corner there. So we had to spin him. We tried elf double shrunk. and Gnome. We moved down the side of the arena in that dead end hall. Where the one giant spawns alone. The corner on the arena side of the hall.  We had to use gnome inorder to corner him. Once all tanks were in gnome form it all worked well. Altho that was a lil while ago. Not shure what works now. We will be doing AoW soon so i will report back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knord</div><div class="date">06-05-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;dance&quot; method is the way we've always done Vindi, Statue, etc (except for the one time we kited the Idol around the arena, but that's a different story), the corners in the arena have always sucked for cornering.  That idea of walking the mob up and down is a good one too, however...we ended up having to do that to cursed a few weeks back when mobs were getting stuck in the walls.  When exiled got stuck in the wall and ended up DTing a bunch more ppl than he had a right to have, we just walked him up and down the area where we usually corner him (the alcove to the left as you face his spawn point).  What was really murder was trying RZtW script with the wall bug....Tallon almost wiped us because we couldn't corner him normally, we recovered to have a beautiful run on Vallon and Fake Rallos (I centered him in the room), but when we tried dancing RZtW near the corner  that we usually use, we lost too many ppl to AE and adds, and wiped at 30%.  Really sick of the wall bugs.....hope they are really fixed now and stay that way.</div></div><hr />

There is a small crook in the wall.  Had no problems at getting him cornered there.  We last killed him 2 nights ago (June 6th).  I did not have any issues with getting stuck in the wall for positioning.  Double shrink is all I used.</div></div><hr />
