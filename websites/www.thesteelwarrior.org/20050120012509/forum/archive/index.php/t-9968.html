<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard some tragic news this morning from a friend when he told Darrell Abbott (&quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrel) was shot and killed doing a gig at a night club last night. At first I thought he was joking, but after a bit of searching I was able to find some arcticles slowly popping up on the internet confirming it (one of the many places you can find the story is here (http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1494653/20041209/damageplan.jhtml?headlines=true) at VH1).<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't know who Darrell is, he was the lead guitar for the metal band Pantera, I'm sure many of you don't know or care who that is, but for many metal fans the man was a legend. I grew up listening to Pantera and they were one of the few old 80's bands that withstood the test of time - never going mainstream, never selling out and still managint to stay hard which is quite a feat these days. <br />
<br />
Even though Pantera had already decided to go their seperate ways before this incident, the band earned and kept my respect over the years and so I just wanted to take a minute to tip my hat to the now deceased.<br />
<br />
(Again, this is for the people who actually care so I suggest you stuff the &quot;good riddence&quot; post you're about type, because if you don't care, then apparently I wasn't talking to you)<br />
<br />
Edit: I guess this wasn't really a rant, but I didn't want to bog up the general section with it, so bleh~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dec. 9: Columbus police continue to search for answers to what prompted<br />
a gunman to jump on stage at a rock concert and start shooting.<br />
<br />
COLUMBUS, Ohio - It looked like something out of a macabre heavy-metal<br />
video: The lights dimmed in the smoke-filled nightclub, the rock band<br />
Damageplan launched into its first thunderous riffs, and then a man in <br />
a<br />
hooded sweatshirt ran the length of the stage and opened fire, shooting<br />
the lead guitarist at least five times in the head.<br />
<br />
In just minutes, the gunman had killed three others before being shot <br />
to<br />
death by a police officer.<br />
The rampage Wednesday night stunned the heavy metal world and left<br />
police searching for answers about what set the gunman off.<br />
<br />
The slain guitarist, ‚ÄúDimebag‚Äù Darrell Abbott, 38, was a<br />
driving force behind the rock band Pantera, and police are looking into<br />
reports from witnesses that the gunman was a fan irate that the hugely<br />
influential group broke up.<br />
<br />
Some of the 500 people packed into the club to see Abbott‚Äôs new<br />
band initially thought that the gunman was an excited fan or that the<br />
shootings were part of the show.<br />
‚ÄúI figured it was another fan wanting to jump off the stage and<br />
crowd surf,‚Äù said Brian Kozicki, the club‚Äôs lighting<br />
designer. ‚ÄúI think he knew he wasn‚Äôt going to get out<br />
and he was going to take down as many people as he could.‚Äù<br />
<br />
‚ÄòWe may never know a motive‚Äô<br />
Police identified the gunman as Nathan Gale, 25, who listened to <br />
Pantera<br />
music to psyche himself up before football games and would often hang<br />
out at a tattoo parlor and make a pest of himself by talking to<br />
customers about music.<br />
‚ÄúWe may never know a motive for this, unless he left a<br />
note,‚Äù Sgt. Brent Mull said.<br />
<br />
Also killed were Erin Halk, 29, a club employee who loaded band<br />
equipment; fan Nathan Bray, 23; and Jeff Thompson, 40.<br />
<br />
Two others were hospitalized after the shooting. The nature of their<br />
injuries was not disclosed.<br />
The guitarist‚Äôs brother, Vinnie Paul Abbott, the drummer for<br />
Damageplan, was rushed to safety offstage and tearfully tried to learn<br />
his brother‚Äôs fate from officers who couldn‚Äôt even tell<br />
him which hospital he was taken to.<br />
With his frenetic, ear-splitting guitar riffs, Dimebag Abbott created <br />
an<br />
aggressive sound for Pantera and attracted a cult following in the <br />
early<br />
1990s. The band was nominated for Grammys in 1995 and 2001. The Abbott<br />
brothers left Pantera last year and released Damageplan‚Äôs debut<br />
album, ‚ÄúNew Found Power,‚Äù in February.<br />
‚ÄúI‚Äôm absolutely beside myself with grief. I<br />
can‚Äôt for the life of me understand why someone would do<br />
this,‚Äù said heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne, who often toured<br />
with Pantera.<br />
<br />
Lines were deep Wednesday night at the Alrosa Villa club ‚Ä&quot; a<br />
popular venue for heavy metal for 30 years ‚Ä&quot; to buy T-shirts for<br />
Damageplan.<br />
Man in a sweatshirt<br />
As the lights dimmed, club security was trying to catch up to a man in <br />
a<br />
Columbus Blue Jackets hockey jersey over his sweatshirt, who was seen<br />
jumping the 8-foot wooden fence to enter the club. The guards could not<br />
reach the tall, heavyset man in the crowd.<br />
<br />
Dec. 9: Columbus, Ohio, police spokesman Sgt. Brent Mull details the<br />
deadly nightclub rampage and the heroism of the police officer who<br />
killed the attacker.<br />
<br />
He climbed onstage, as many Alrosa headbangers do.<br />
‚ÄúAt first we thought it was a hoax, and then when he fired again<br />
we knew it was real,‚Äù said Jeremy Spencer, 16.<br />
<br />
Kozicki, the lighting director, brought up the house lights and ducked<br />
under his control table, where he called 911 on his cell phone. Several<br />
calls followed, with one male caller saying: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs on<br />
stage right now. He‚Äôs got a gun. ... He just shot<br />
again.‚Äù Fans surged toward the doors in fear.<br />
Kozicki peeked from his table to see the gunman holding a man in a<br />
headlock. Police said the gunman appeared ready to shoot the hostage,<br />
who managed to duck just enough for Officer James D. Niggemeyer to take<br />
aim and kill Gale.<br />
<br />
Officer arrives within two minutes<br />
Mull said Niggemeyer, patrolling nearby, arrived within two minutes of<br />
hearing the call. Niggemeyer, 31, saw one person lying dead and the<br />
suspect holding onto another ‚Äúpretty much in a<br />
headlock,‚Äù Mull said.<br />
<br />
He said the hostage, ‚Äúprobably a fan, maybe someone who worked<br />
with the band,‚Äù was able to maneuver out of the way before the<br />
officer fired.<br />
Mull praised Niggemeyer‚Äôs response.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúIf the officer wasn‚Äôt as close as he was, I think this<br />
would have been a lot worse,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was a chaotic<br />
scene, just a horrific scene.‚Äù<br />
<br />
On Thursday morning, fans left flowers and a bottle of Rogue<br />
‚ÄúDead Guy Ale‚Äù outside the taped-off club parking lot.<br />
<br />
Gale had a minor police record in Marysville, near Columbus, including<br />
driving with a suspended license last month, said Police Chief Floyd<br />
Golden. He was pulled over for driving with a suspended license last<br />
month.<br />
<br />
At the Bears Den Tattoo Studio in Marysville, Gale made people feel<br />
uncomfortable by staring at them and forcing them into a conversation,<br />
manager Lucas Bender said.<br />
‚ÄúHe comes in here and likes to hang out when he‚Äôs not<br />
wanted,‚Äù Bender said. ‚ÄúThe most pointless<br />
conversations.‚Äù<br />
<br />
Mull said the gunman‚Äôs exact statement was unclear because of<br />
the loud music. He said some witnesses reported hearing an accusation<br />
about Abbott breaking up his former band, thrash-rock pioneer Pantera,<br />
but it could not be confirmed whether the speaker was the gunman or a<br />
fan.<br />
‚ÄòThe worst day in metal history‚Äô<br />
<br />
Thursday morning, a dozen yellow roses, still in plastic wrap, lay near<br />
the entry to the low-slung beige building that since 1974 has hosted<br />
mostly heavy metal acts. The 641-person-capacity club, just off a<br />
freeway exit on the city‚Äôs north side, sits amid motels, small<br />
businesses and office complexes.<br />
Dozens of messages were posted to the band‚Äôs Web site after the<br />
shootings.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúThis is the worst day in metal history,‚Äù one posting<br />
read.<br />
‚ÄúThe metal world feels your pain,‚Äù another wrote.<br />
<br />
The shootings came on the 24th anniversary of perhaps the most<br />
well-known assassination of a rock star ‚Ä&quot; that of former Beatle<br />
John Lennon outside his New York City apartment in 1980.<br />

Similar to Shik, I remember many days growing up in Louisiana...metal blasting away.  Pantera was the real deal, and Dimebag help make music history.   A damned shame...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After having the weekend to think about this, and bear in mind when I say this that I'm not really a hardcore Pantera fan at all, I only can think of one thing.<br />
<br />
I hope Dimebag is remembered, and goes down in history on a much higher level than all the rest of those fuckstick OD'd or suicide disaster musicians that everyone raves about all the time.  I hear so goddamned much about Kurt Cobain when the fact of the matter is that he was a fucking hack and arguably wouldn't be remembered as that great at all  if he was still alive.<br />
<br />
Dimebag Darrel was fuckin gunned down.  It wasn't his choice to go... either thru his inability to control his addictions or some &quot;burn out or fade away&quot; choice.  Pantera did a lot for changing the metal scene and how it's veiwed in mainstream socieity.  Bands like Slayer and Maiden have existed without radio for a long time, but Pantera managed to build a fan base and essentially FORCE radio to play their game.  That's cool, and I think it's an accomplishment that needs to be remembered a lot differently than some whiny fuck who blew his own brains out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said, Haass, well said. I too wasn't a hardcore Pantera fan. I'm a little too young to have listened to them during their prime. I had heard and enjoyed songs like Walk, Cowboys from Hell, and Cemetery Gates, some of the more well known Pantera songs. Since hearing about Dimebag's death, I have gotten ahold of all of their CDs and have been listening to them alot. I haven't come across a song that I disliked yet. I don't think there is any song by Pantera that wouldn't sound kick ass even without vocals. Pantera had a pure drive to deliver the best METAL music they could, and they refused to change that no matter what the current &quot;Trend&quot; was. It's sad that this had to happen while Dimebag was enjoying his new band, after Pantera had broken up. The dude loved to play music, and he died doing just that.<br />
<br />
You'll be missed man, you'll be missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I could talk about this topic all day, but one of the biggest losses to me is that the man was a great, genuine musician. <br />
<br />
These days I honestly think the quality of rock/metal music as declined so much that people think a song is hard just because they crank the bass and play three notes as fast as humanly possible. I'm not even that old, but I still respect old 80's frontier metal bands that actually made a riff hard because of how they played it, not because of how loud. I probably haven't even bought or even bothered downloading a CD that has been put out in the past five years save the last Korn CD. <br />
<br />
I was reading some news about how many people gathered to remember him and interviews with people who had gotten to know him through touring, it was really touching considering I never even read anything about Darrell before he was killed. <br />
<br />
I really hope the guy get's recognized for his contribution to the music comunity as he deserves to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta agree with Haass as well; I remember reading some article about &quot;100 greatest guitarists of all time&quot; and, somehow Kurt Cobain was mentioned and I nearly puked. He was a hack. <br />
<br />
Rewinding back a bit to the whole grunge era we have Layne Staley and Andrew Wood. Going back into Music History of Modern Rock we have the likes of John Bonham, Jimi Hendrix, Keith Moon, and some others who just were taken due to substance or alcohol addiction. <br />
<br />
Darrell may have been a pothead. He might have drank too much on any given night....but for some third party to come and take his life away while he was still able to do so with as much ferocity and power as he still had....is an atrocity. No one has the right to take life away from another like that.</div></div><hr />

What's really odd for me is that I had found my old Cowboys from Hell CD last week and forgot how much I liked it. Just seemed like a wierd coincidence.<br />
<br />
One thing I remember about him was he used to enter in a guitar contest in Austin? and after winning it 3 years in a row they made him be a judge. :)</div></div><hr />

How many people will still be buying Nirvana shit in 2010? A lot.<br />

If Cobain was a worthless, druggy, piece of shit, suicidal shit head, talentless hack... that doesnt say a lot for you.<br />
<br />
You didnt like his art, good for you dick head, but dont pretend to know his life and the life of anyone that traveled down the road to shotgun to the headville. Just be grateful you dont have a fucking misfiring neuron leading you to it and move on.<br />
<br />
That said, yea it sucks some lunatic popped a great guitar legend. But please for the love of god let us not pretend he got his nickname because he used to carry his change in a ziplock. Him not ODing could have been pure luck or intervention, unless of course you can prove otherwise.<br />

<br />
Yeah, because I'm sure no one except Kurt has ever though about suicide in their lives therefore we can't have a clue what it's like. I guess the reason I haven't had a &quot;misfiring neuron&quot; is because I firmly believe that killing yourself is the pussy way out, no matter how bad your life is. I swear to the good lord that I hate my life, by I strive to make it better every fucking day that I live. Maybe if Kurt had some balls the man would be alive today.<br />
<br />
I sure feel sorry for the guy, and his millions of fans, maybe if used 1/4 of the money he used on digging himself into a drug-induced stupor on improving his life, he might not have been so miserable all the time. I also wouldn't know what it's like to play an instrument either, it's not like I spent multiple hours a day practicing the drums or anything.<br />
<br />
If any of you whacked yourself tomorrow, how many people would give 2 shits in 10 years?<br />
<br />
Yes, because I'm going somewhere with my life or I'll die trying before I ever travel &quot;down the road to shotgun to the headville&quot;. How many people would give a shit in ten years if you died? What's your fucking point?<br />
<br />
Thanks for freaking out over nothing. Good job, you're a Nirvana fan, let me get you a gold star. Too bad the only thing posting your little rant here has done is ruin a thread that's supposed to remember a man for his life and the good times he brought to other through his music. If you want to rant about someone disrespecting a guy who fucking shot himself in the face the least you could've done was not make a scene over it.<br />

<br />
Say what you want about him taking his own life, but the man was a brilliant musician and has inspired many new artists, especially in Seattle.  It is Kurt's music that sells the CDs not his fucking death.  There are plenty of musicians that were on the rise to popularity that died, and haven't been remembered and thats because their music &quot;arguably&quot; sucks.  Look at Jimi Hendrix, he ODed, I wouldn't call him a Fuckstic.  I would say that he would still be popular and still be selling cds if he were still alive.<br />
<br />
On to the subject of the post.  Terrible news to hear about Darrel and he will be missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I find it mystifying that Nirvana continues to be held as the standard of Seattle when Soundgarden was clearly a better band. The only way I can explain it is that Soundgarden didn't tap that vein of 'OMG LIFE SUX I WANT TO DIE' like ol' Kurt did. That seems to be attractive to youth for some odd reason.<br />
<br />
 I think I'll write a song entitled 'Take The Gas Pipe Escape' and become a millionaire.<br />
<br />
 Oh yeah, and suicide is nothing to find ennobling. Even if the alternative is being married to Courtney Love.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, first of all, I wasn't into Pantera when I was young.  However, in the last 2 years I've been utterly digusted with 99.9% of modern 'rock' so I was looking at older bands for good music.  Well, the first one that was suggested to me for something hard was Pantera.  I bought a couple of their CD's and I must say that while the band is great, the guitar is what sets it and most good thrash metal apart from someone else.  So, in that sense, it's a fucking shame that someone that had this type of effect on a medium that means so much to so many is gone.<br />
<br />
Second, the fact that it was a murder that was commited obviously far before Dimebag was finished makes it an even bigger atrocity.<br />
<br />
Now, about Nirvana and Kurt Cobain.  I'm from Seattle, I fucking hate the fact that every time I turn on the radio, it's almost guaranteed that one of the rock stations will be playing Nirvana or will play Nirvana before my 5 minute car ride is over.  It's just irritating that a band that sounds so whiney and pathetic gets ten times as much play as bands that deserve the air time just because Kurt shot himself.  Honestly, Nirvana would be big still, especially around here if he had not shot himself, but they would not be nearly what they are.<br />
<br />
Last point, although I dislike Nirvana's music, I also realize and appreciate what they meant at the time.  If you listen to typical music on the radio before Nirvana (late 80's hair band crap) and music for a short duration after Nirvana (including bands like Soundgarden) it's hard to argue against two facts a.) they signified a significant change in popular music and b.) they were a major factor in the 'mainstream' (I loathe that word) acceptance of that change.</div></div><hr />

Other than that, I think this post is about Darrell. Atleast he wasn't a hopeless heroine addict. He lived much longer, and never let life kick his ass. He had a different loser do it for him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering Dave Grohl's talent and considerable success with his bands, I'd say it's likely neither.<br />

Just because someone sings does not mean that they're the reason a band is &quot;Something.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If any of you whacked yourself tomorrow, how many people would give 2 shits in 10 years?<br />
<br />
Wouldnt happen as I have too much respect for myself.  I, too, wouldnt give a fuck what some jackass on a message board thought of my life present day or 3,650 days from now.<br />
<br />
How many people will still be buying Nirvana shit in 2010? A lot.<br />
<br />
Asinine statement number 2...record sales does not equate to quality.  A retarded thing to say.  That being said, when Nirvana hit mainstream, I was impressed with their sound.  It was new and I liked it...still do.  But...they are not Metal.  <br />
<br />
Someone also mentioned another act from Seattle...Soundgarden.  One of the premier bands from the last 20 years.  Id be willing to wager their music will be around as quality sound long after Nirvana's hype machine takes a dirt nap.<br />
<br />
If Cobain was a worthless, druggy, piece of shit, suicidal shit head, talentless hack... that doesnt say a lot for you.<br />
<br />
Huh?  WTF, does that mean.  In every public interview I saw of Kurt Cobain he was a wasted out druggie who couldnt find a coherent sentance with both hands and a flashlight...errr, inspired, misunderstood , rebel.  Haass easily surpasses him in articulation alone.<br />
<br />
You didnt like his art, good for you dick head, but dont pretend to know his life and the life of anyone that traveled down the road to shotgun to the headville. Just be grateful you dont have a fucking misfiring neuron leading you to it and move on.<br />
<br />
We've discussed this above...if you recall.  Permanant response to a temporary problem.  Reeks of cowardice and stupidity.  In his case at least he was able to provide for his family, even unto death.  Cool points for him, for not leaving his family destitute.<br />
<br />
That said, yea it sucks some lunatic popped a great guitar legend. But please for the love of god let us not pretend he got his nickname because he used to carry his change in a ziplock. Him not ODing could have been pure luck or intervention, unless of course you can prove otherwise.<br />
<br />
I dont see anyone without their eyes open in this thread.  No one saying he was a pillar of virtue.  He was a musician.  He was a human being.  He made quality rock-n-roll that will greatly outlive him.<br />
<br />
Cily, you disrespected yourself typing this drivel.  Not the other way around.<br />

I hear so goddamned much about Kurt Cobain when the fact of the matter is that he was a fucking hack and arguably wouldn't be remembered as that great at all  if he was still alive.<br />

What made Pantera a great band was they made awesome, fun music without pandering to the masses.  They built their fan base originally without hardly any airplay, till that fanbase got large enough to force the radio stations to start palying Pantera.  Seeing Pantera live was an awesome experience, every single time.<br />
<br />
What made Kurt Cobain far less than Pantera is that he always pandered to the masses.  He learned guitar from Buzz Osbourne, and developed an interest in music from hanging out with Buzz's band...and then promptly threw out everything he had learned from them, and played what can only be described as pop music.</div></div><hr />
