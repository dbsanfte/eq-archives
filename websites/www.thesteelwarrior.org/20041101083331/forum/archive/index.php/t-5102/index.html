<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya,<br />
<br />
I know of a few spots and have been trying them out ( tables being one ) but since I am a noob to this zone ( just got access this week ) I was wondering if someone with decient knowledge about this zone and where are good spots to exp ( regular tanking groups and kiting ) I would appreciate it. <br />
<br />
Also was just wonder if normally people kite around tables or if people tank the mobs. I was outside the 2nd castle before tables yesterday and the red soldier looking guys were quite a mana sink. I have all my defensive AA's done and had 8k hp ( was missing focus, sta, and bss ).<br />
<br />
We would have moved to tables but my group had some difficulties getting through the second castle without agro. I seemed to get through ok but someone would be to close to something and then splat.<br />
<br />
Please PM me if you don't feel comfortable talking about this in public.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well i dont know about 2nd castle, but ive taken a group to the first castle, we camped on the ground floor in a corner by the stairs leading out towards the second castle. most of the mobs were white cons. they dont hit particularly hard and with a decent dps group we were doing an aa in under 45 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>slantedvision</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're looking to XP, and you have a full group, Earth might be, pound for pound, a better overall XP spot.<br />
<br />
However, if you're missing classes but have a fear/snare combo, just do that. You'll save mana and prolly overall get more XP over time.  Just be prepared for a very boring warrior experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fire castle one in corners is 2x earth xp, in C2 generally you kite and that’s casters who make even more AA. If you need a haste item for some reason field 2 nameds pop frequently so that’s a good option to camp the 85hp 41% haste cloak and decent XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For conventional tank/healer groups, you are probably better off exping in C1 like others have mentioned. The Field of Gib is probably not to bad either, a bit harder than C1, but not all that bad.<br />
<br />
C2 is not as good for a traditional tank/healer group because most of the mobs are red cons and they hit pretty hard. It become a lot more viable when you get more HP/AC but you are better served in other camps when you are first breaking in to the elems.<br />
<br />
Once you can handle C2 without too much trouble, I think you will find that this is the best exp anywhere. In all caster kiting groups we used to crank out AA in 20-25 minutes, pretty hard to beat that. You can get pretty close to that in a high DPS group once you have the HP/AC to tank without being a mana sponge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or, you can use the sekret ninja warrior mind control skillz and talk yer buddies into camping the jopal villiage.  There you can proceed to get all the pallies you know (and many you don't) the nice 1hb that almost invariably drops instead of the warrior pet sword...<br />
<br />
If you have avid tradeskiller friends working on the grimmel earring, killing spiders in the front or back (but *not* the villiage) isn't bad xp either.  Even if nobody is doing the earring, the saps that (rarely) drop sell for a huge chunk of change in the bazaar (~15-20k per on karana anyway).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Peorth12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The main spots that i know of are either Zone-In, or Table (in the 2nd castle)<br />
<br />
Zone-In is generally crappy xp (elemental planes wise) but ppl are always camping those Obsidian Saps for that Tradeskill earing.<br />
<br />
Table is real good, but the mobs are kinda tough.  Of course table is kinda tough to get because there is usually a bard kiting 20 mobs at a time around that table.  Bard friend of mine went from 40aa to 300aa in about 2-3 weeks doing that &gt;&lt;;;</div></div><hr />
