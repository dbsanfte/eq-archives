<br />
I hate to throw yet another equipment upgrade question at you, but this is the absolute best place I've found to ask this question.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy with my gear overall, but am constantly looking for upgrades.  I am in a guild who does vulak, aow, and such, and we are currently working on Ssra and such.  Most of my gear, however, comes from purchases.<br />
<br />
I don't have a lot of limits on money, so most purchasable gear is an option for me.  Here's my Magelo:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=73679<br />
<br />
My wrists are probably the lowest end of all my gear, and I'm looking for upgrades.  I'd like hit points primarily, with AC and stamina secondary.  I'm currently over 270 stamina with raid buffs, so it's not that big an issue.<br />
<br />
Any purchasable (or 1-2 groupable) wrist upgrades for an innoruuk worshipping warrior (don't ask, it was a long time ago :)) that can be suggested would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chaotic</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.  Good suggestion.  I do ring of slime fairly regularly, so it may even be an option that I get for free.  Not too many people have done RoS on Bristlebane for awhile, and I've never seen the acid bracers for sale, but I'll keep an eye out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for that.  Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Some of those Higher 90hp type crafted rings from the planes. Ya could switch from Windraider + Heiro to CoF + Rubi Girdle, would be more hps, and only 4% less haste, but you would still cap haste anyways. Boots of the Storm, BoC, etc etc<br />
All i can think of for now :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No question about it -  Crystalized acid bracers. You can either do the Ring of Slime (1 groupable) or camp the bazaar for a pair. Expect to spend over 100k each for them, they are pretty rare. They will server you well though, all of the ones I have seen for sale recently where being upgraded to Raex's, so that gives you an idea of how good they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chaotic</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the helpful responses.  I've got my eyes on the Crystallized Acid Bracers now.  After doing about 25 ring of slime events without one dropping, it will be awhile before I upgrade to those.  I'll probably replace the Fortutide bracer with another piece of heraldic in the mean time.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, I appreciate the advice!</div></div><hr />
