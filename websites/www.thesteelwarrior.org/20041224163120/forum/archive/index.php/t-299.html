<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omok Kragmaw</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My current setup is a Shadow Heart (11/17) and a Longsword of Freedom (20/29).  I'm looking to upgrade for higher DPS, and maybe a little bit better taunt value.  I want to make it clear though, I RARELY raid.  I EXP group 99% of the time and I have never had a problem holding agro with two non-proccing weapons.  I'm looking to upgrade my current set-up without losing DPS and have about 100 to 150k to spend.  A couple weapons I was looking at were the Split Blade of Destruction, Wind-worn Handblade, and Blade of Carnage (Too Expensive Methinks).  Anyways, I could use some suggestions on a new primary weapon, either from this list, or something I have not thought of.</div></div><hr />

Depending on BoC and SoD prices on your server, they both give ya what you want for aggro, dps and aggroprocs. <br />

Most of these high end items should be earned... 200k isnt a lot, most people on old servers have over 1000k now these days, makes no sense to not have 400k items..</div></div><hr />

<br />
?<br />
<br />
You make 200k sound trivial to acquire.<br />
<br />
It's not.<br />
<br />
Even on old servers not EVERYONE in high end game has 200k to just go tossing around.<br />
<br />
That being said ...<br />
<br />
To the original poster, for pure DPS, Windblade will serve you well and will be a LOT cheaper than the 1handers you mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your 1h weapons are not easy to upgrade without gettin into very expensive or no drop items.<br />
<br />
Mofu :P</div></div><hr />

I have played on an old server since the beginning and I have a grand total of...20k pp in the bank!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you have a LOT of cash there is a solution :<br />
<br />
Contact your local UBER(S) and ask them if they would<br />
consider selling loot rights (i know mine did).<br />
<br />
Getting a good no drop weapon from SSRA or PoP for 150k<br />
is very possible, specialy if you are not a member of a rival guild.<br />
<br />
And trust me, uber never turn down cash, PP  go down way too fast.<br />
2k per cleric per week, 1k per beastlord, 1k per shaman.<br />
And selling a 1H or 2H that would probably rot is Peridot Fund.<br />
<br />
At same power, no drop weapons value a lot less than dropable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my weapon set ups at the moment are <br />
shadow heart/ sparg spear<br />
Axe of Aggresion<br />
Tantors Tusk<br />
<br />
they all hold great aggo even against another 55 warrior that had a Shortblade of Lightning and Fleshgrinder and curved claws and defiance. also in the group was a ranger i think with a frosty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
uhm, thats a suicidal ranger, get him some help, PM me if you need a list of local area sanitariums.<br />
<br />
as for holding aggro with DPS, from my personal experience, 2hs holds good aggro on sheer DPS, i never had much luck with 1hs aggro w/o procs, but that could just be me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;uhm, thats a suicidal ranger, get him some help,&quot;<br />
<br />
hmmmm ... I have only one thing to say about that ...<br />
<br />
Mob_01's Head Snaps Back!<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i heard about that head snap thingy, but i guess rangers where i group dont have it, or they enjoy chain casting tangling weeds and flamelick til i scream, maybe one day the cleric will forget a heal or two and it will stop =/<br />
<br />
but then again, perhaps this should go to another thread *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have that much to spend get a Split Blade of Destruction, and/or a Wind-worn Handblade... and either keep the LSoF for the stats, or pick up a SBoZek ... they sell for about 35-40k on Povar...<br />
<br />
Just my two cents. They may not have agro procs or proc's at all, but they do hit hard and fast, and plenty of HP on em... <br />
<br />

<br />
ROTFL<br />
<br />
So true.<br />
<br />
So funny.<br />
<br />
Basically rangers who do that, get to MT in groups. There's nothing me nor my lightsabers can do about it sometimes.<br />
