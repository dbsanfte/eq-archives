<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As you all know, City of Mist received a partial revamp as of Tuesday's patch.  The &quot;partial revamp&quot; included:<br />
<br />
1)  New mobs<br />
2)  Revamped loot tables for the named (Nek`Ashir, Rak`Ashir, Rathe of Jaxion or whatever).<br />
3)  More mob placement<br />
4)  Faster respawn (??)<br />
<br />
The new mobs include the worn traveler model.  It's the male figure with the beard who looks like he just washed from shore.  There's also some different golems and different oozes.<br />
<br />
Revamped loot tables from the named.  I remember Rak`Ashir, I think, dropped a 35ac 40hp breastplate, but don't quote me on that one since it was late and I was tired.  It was a hell of a nice bp for the difficulty though.  I don't think the Ornate Rune Shield drops anymore either, but the shields that dropped were 10x better than before.<br />
<br />
More mobs.  Lots more mobs!  When you pass the fountain to the area around the ooze building, there's more mobs out in the courtyard.  More mobs surround the castle now.  I didn't check inside the Temple, but mobs now spawn AT the Temple camp.  Don't go AFK here please.  <br />
<br />
Overall, mobs hit slightly harder too.  I noticed quite a few low triple digits, like 116, off mobs just beyond the entrance.<br />
<br />
Great changes!  Can't wait to PL my cleric here.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ornate Rune Shield does still drop was there yesterday and saw someone get it from a mob don't remember which one.  I also killed &quot;A Might Golem&quot; he dropped a Mace of Shadowded Souls :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A Mighty Golem droped the Mace of Shadowed Soul about every kill(havent seen him drop anything else yet)<br />
<br />
Knotted Belt of Ravenous(10ac, 4str/dex 5stam 15hp/mana melee/all)  off a Ravenous Warbone Skeletonin the &quot;temple&quot;(right from IZ) <br />
<br />
i've been leveling up an Alt of mine there...decent xp for a 35ish toon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got: Mysterious Sleeves off of PlaugeBone Warlord, something like 12 ac 6 wis 6 int 30 mana , int casters<br />
<br />
Also got: (forget name of the mask) , 5ac +10 wis +5 car +35 hp +30 mana , It came off the mighty Golem in right most temple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was wondering what this was going to do to the Iksar Shadow Knight weapon quest, but since old loot is still reportedly dropping there, I guess I don't have anything to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, I was there after the changes getting EXP and doing the shammy and iksar quests, and all the items dropped just fine.  However, there also seems to be a few new quest items there that I found, including a scroll off a chanter mob that had approx. 32khp and was about level 50, rather tough long long fight....then again, my shammies pet got ate, and the only dps was shammy melee and a SK...so hp could be a bit less, but still higher by far than any other mob in the zone, aside from the reavers and thier named pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mymn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Loved CoM back in the Kunark era, lvled from 40-44 there completely unharrassed by others back then. So now that Im 2boxing my 44 BST and 51CLR alts I figured I'd take them there to check it out.<br />
   If I play cleric out of group to PL bst he was getting anywhere from 2-4% a kill on the ZI mobs, I include the undead on walkways to either side of bridgeand a coupla mobs just past gate in that. If cleric grouped he makes 1% a kill and she does &quot;ok&quot; at ZI.<br />
   Grouped today with a 50shm 51clr and 43bst all 3 made nice xp back by ooze house. Mobs do seem to hit a little bit harder and maybe even a little faster, but nothing to bad.<br />
   Mobs spawn all over the place now and the spawn time is reasonably fast. MoSS dropped alot off &quot;Mighty Golem&quot; seemed to be his common, his rare was some mask 5ac 10wis 3cha 30hp 30mana or something very close.<br />
   Overall I like the changes, makes CoM a fun twink zone or main zone if your of that level. BTW didnt notice a single mob trying to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kannan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was 2 boxin my 56 warr 56 cleric and to my surprise was run to zone by the chanter mob spectral beguiler.<br />
Being stubborn as i am was not about to let myself get beatten by a blue mob in the temple of CoM buffed up resists cus i had been getting feared and mezzed alot and went back in.<br />
<br />
set up cleric to triple stun then nuke with judgement magic resist on my warr is only 158 buffed dropped down to about 118 after being tashed was feared again quite a bit but wore off fast started in the stuns and nukes and after about a 5 min battle defeated it with 2 bubs of mana left the warr only needed 1 complete heal the mob was more interested in tryin to mez charm and fear than it was tryin to do any damage but when he did aggro on the cleric was hittin for about 176 each ac on cleric is only 880 buffed stuns seemed to hit pretty well nuke was only resisted a few times all in all the cleric killed the mob the warr just annoyed it<br />
Dropped scroll of the beguiler not sure what its for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Shaman's Crucible is just going insane over the changes to CoM.  I guess with the &quot;revamp&quot; it screwed up Neh and Rak (last 2 kills for shammy epic if you didn't know).  So now no shammys can complete their epic until they fix this little &quot;problem&quot;.  joy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kannan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rak was killed by me and 2 friends yesterday morning<br />
56 warr 56 cleric 56 ranger had help from a 65 chanter just for shits.<br />
 we ooced the shammy book drops but was no shammy in zone he also dropped the sk shield with deadeye took us about 2 min no heals needed but hell the chanter alone coulda soloed him within 4 min.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rak doesnt drop the books, and he also has a 2k + aoe that is very hard to resist.  I highly doubt (unless he is VERY changed) that you killed Rak.  You must mean Neh`Ashiir, and not Rak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Probably killed Ghiosk. He drops books for shaman epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>JagdDoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was here last night with a few guildies.  We have a raid coming up and wanted to check out the changes and the new named mobs and such.  The group was a 53 warrior, 58 cleric, 57 bard, 52 warrior, 52 rogue, and 46/7 ranger.<br />
<br />
It was surprisingly decent exp for me at 53.  Moved within a yellow of 54 having started at about 65% in maybe 2 or 3 hours of non-continuous fighting.  We wiped on the bridge to the reavers after killing Ghiosk to something we really shouldn't have and took a while to reset ourselves.  Even so it was a good time and some decent benefits for it.<br />
<br />
There were a few interesting drops as well; forgive me if I muck up names and such...i was a bit distracted at the time.  We seemed to get a Mace of the Shadowed Soul off every 'A Mighty Golem' we killed.  I was told there was a nice mask that drops off them (Iron Mask of the Wise I think it was?) but I didn't see one drop while I was there.  'A fog golem' at the temple to the right of the ent dropped a bard sword...Saina's Claw or something of that nature.  6/19 +int with a graphic like the Frozen Long Sword or Shissar Knight's Sword.  We got a whole bunch of the pages for the shammy epic (i think) as well as the books off Ghiosk which we ooc'd to a frog in-zone.  The Throneblade of the Ykesha went to the bard...I think...not sure why he rolled in the first place.  Also took down a named skelly (warlord something?) that dropped some int caster sleeves.  Raging War Boned Skeleton fell as well but I can't recall what he dropped.<br />
<br />
It was a nice bit of exploring and a pleasant change from my previous times in this zone.  The changes here are nice but I think my favorite revamp is still Droga.  That's probably the one Kunark zone that I'm eager to fight in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ghiosk is the one that drops the shaman epic books.  Rak'Ashiir was definately doable before the revamp with just a tank and a healer though, as we usually just did him with warrior+druid (and whatever shaman the epic was for).  As long as the healer just stays away from the AE it just takes a while to beat him down.  His AE range is much smaller than CH range.  I've not done him since the revamp though, so he may have been changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kannan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It was Rak , Neh was up the next day we killed Ghiosk right before Rak so maybe it was him that had the books can't remember the AoE never got off with the 65 chanter chain stunning and her dire charm pet eatting him alive as well as my cleric was also stunning and so was the ranger I did not even have to heal once he also dropped the  http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=9408 and ghiosk dropped those no drop leather legs for monk beast and druid wich ended up rotting.<br />
