I'm 2-3 adv away from being able to purchase the augment from everfrost. I was wondering what you all thought. I've enough total points to buy 2, once I earn enough everfrost points, and I plan on augmenting a onehander anyways but I thought a 2 hander might be better.</div></div><hr />

Because if it's crap, then you could go for the 2H now and wait with the 1H until you have 2 good one-handers.</div></div><hr />

If I had the points, I'd put it on a GSoT for a double taunt proc weapon, and save the WBMS for DPS.<br />
<br />
Esp since GSoT's are dirt cheap now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree.. can pick up a GSoT for 500pp or less and augment that with Anger3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd maybe put Anger2 on a GSoT if that was my best weapon, but save the extra 640 points. Anger 3 just seems like it'd be too much of a waste to put on a bazaar weapon worth 500 plat :(. Think about that, that's 13 adventures! Or 8-15hours of your time wasted when you upgrade...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm... didn't think about it that way.. as a good suggesion I've changed my mind.. Gerald is right.. Anger 2 would be just fine.. the GSoT does a pretty good job on its own as it is.. anger 2 would just give you more &quot;insurance&quot; but probably not worth Anger 3.</div></div><hr />

Anger I, II, and III for non PoTime weapons are all at the Everfrost camp. Anger II is 510 points if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />

I respect this opinion but.. there are plenty of examples why you would put it on a bazaar weapon and forget waiting for something better.  The reason would be, you can't get any better in either the communities opinion, your style of play etc.. <br />
<br />
A good example is me.  I will be putting most likely Anger 3 on the GSoT.  Why?  Because I have a casual guild, 12 members.  We play 3 hours on mondays and 3 hours on wednesday.  Thats it we're done.  Now perhaps there is a weapon we can get in 3 hours with a force of 12 that is better than the GSoT for agro but being a casual gamer makes me think... why mess with it when I KNOW FOR A FACT that GSoT works for agro right NOW, it will definitetly work better with Anger 3 hence I might just never upgrade.  These ideas might sound crazy to someone that can possibly play more than 6 hours a week, or has a bigger force than just 12 peeps but if it works why fix it?  I have assumed as a casual gamer that most casual gamers have more critical decisions to make when upgrading due to the fact that they won't get to upgrade often if at all hence I have a hard time accepting that the all be all rule is don't put aug 3 on a bazaar weapon.  Again that is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Because with 12 people you can kill the Tower bosses in Bastion of Thunder and get a Great Blade of Storms or Greatstaff of the Four Winds. Then you'll want to put anger 3 on those and...</div></div><hr />

If that is the case the screw my previous opinion and GSot4W would be better.. ... apologies.. didn't know 12 peeps could take out all the tower bosses in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a competent group of 12 you should be able to take at least Auliffe. With the right strat you could probably do the water and lightning wings too. You would have a hard time with Kunbyr in the Earth wing with only 12 people but with some practice it could be done.<br />
<br />
I have a group of friends I farm the towers with, we have done all 4 with 18, and we have beat 3/4 of them with 12 people, several where 2-boxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">11-09-2003, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that the GSoT is worth 500pp has NOTHING to do with the weapon itself, in fact, its an awesome weapon. You call it a bazaar weapon cause its worth 500pp or less and you can buy it, what if it were NODROP? Its worth 500pp cause the market is flooded, not because its a bad weapon, I dont see why you wouldnt augment it unless you had or could get a better 2h or a better 1h combo (Im augmenting my CHoS with Anger III, and prolly trying to get a GBoS sometime).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well 12 people from a raid guild can take out the air tower boss pretty easily.  Unless you are geared up to ssra / VT levels or have a few mages / enchanters that can charm mobs to add dps on the air boss I wouldn't try him with 12 if I were you.  I don't know what level of gear you have, but I would say that fighting air boss with 12 is like doing vindi with 12, sure lots can do it, but not many that need vindi BPs can do it.<br />
<br />
Oh air boss also has semi annoying grav flux type stun area effect.  It will interrupt your healers if they get to close and don't resist it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have killed the guy in that drops the 16/21 boiling blood dagger with 8 people (1 cleric, 2 warriors, enchanter, druid, shaman, ranger, monk). I was dual boxing the enchanter and charmed an elemental pet for DPS. The Monk was also dual boxed. I'm sure you'd be fine to do the same with Aufliffe (GSot4W) and Endride (GBoS). Granted this is with competent and decently equipped people, I'm sure you could do it with 12 that weren't quite as well off (another couple of clerics and a rogue maybe?).</div></div><hr />

The people I farm with where pre-Ssra when we started farming, I was the only one of the group flagged for Tier 3+. The trick is knowing the strats and each boss has one. We don't use any charmed pets. The MT typically has 8400ish (war) or 7.8kish (pally/SK) and we have no problem keeping them up with 3 clerics, 1 druid, 1 shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, if you're going to charm, BRING TWO weapons to give the elemental pet to make it dual wield for added DPS. I dual boxed an enchanter for Gylkus once and stole the kill and experience on my group which consisted of 2 druids with charmed/hasted pets, me, a cleric, and a bard (kiting). The key was the enchanter's pet was dual wielding/hasted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my BoC is in primary--<br />
secondary = SBoD, augged with anger III...<br />
INSANE aggro. Would recommend it to anyone who happeneds to have this awesome blade :)<br />
<br />
And if you don't quiet have the resources to spoon out 70k+ for a SBoD (or kill the mob that drops it (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10970) )...I hear a Swiftblade of Zek (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5745)  with an anger aug is slick--<br />
<br />
swifty PC on zebuxoruk server atm is around 17k.</div></div><hr />

I have the SBoD in offhand - and if you look at the tread in the tavern about best looking you will see my picture with the SBoD and my main hand. This is a super good looking combo. <br />
<br />
SBoD is not talked about much and is probably less DPS then WMBS (but more then a BoC heh) but I am happy with the looks, and dps.</div></div><hr />
