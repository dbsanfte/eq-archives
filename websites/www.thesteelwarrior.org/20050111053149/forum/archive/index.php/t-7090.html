Anywho im in a guild on Stormhammer, we are tier 8 wich meens we can do VT/emp well everything pre EP. This week we hade VT for one week just us no other guilds trying to gank our mobs. And after 5 days rading we were only able to get up to the 2nd floor. We did all this with a force of no more than 40 players. And tomoro we are looking to finish up VT coz well its our last day we can be in VT (surver rules) Any chance we can finish it up with only 40 peeps or em i just to hopfull? And allso i really dint see anydrops on the 2nd floor that i really thought it was worth droping a bunch of DKP on whats the drop rate for nice neck/ring/waist items?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neck - Talisman of Vah Kerrath (Questable drop off AHR...100% drop rate)<br />
Waist - Belt of Mastery (off a blob before AHR room)<br />
Ring - Ring of the Crimson bull (off DXXT iirc, been ages since I was in VT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-11-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well all the best VT drops are on the 2nd floor, so it is definately worth doing.  If you can clear through the trash you basically get 5 named mobs (DXVT, mini aten, 2 aten blobs and aten) back to back to back with minimal clearing and these mobs drop the best loots in VT.  Also it depends on the gear and aa and levels of your guild, but 40 is plenty for VT.  The bosses are all weak, so it should only take 20 or so to kill them, but the clearing will take forever with that few people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
clearing the rest is easy, should be able to do the 2nd floor in a night no problem.<br />
<br />
there have been several revamps to VT, one last change that would really make the zone way more tolerable is to elimate the all the 2 in 1 mobs so the dont repop.</div></div><hr />

Can you translate this left/right thing to north/south?  L/R kinda depends on which way you are facing.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, TVK is at the west end of the room.  If you face him, left is south, right is north.</div></div><hr />

  Not only does it speed up your clearing, but you can add named mobs to your run with minimal added clearing. Highly recommended.</div></div><hr />
