<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geckopower</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello and thank you for reading this. I have a 59 Iksar Necro and would like to create a Warrior for my second character. I am drawn to make the new toon an Iksar, but everyone tells me to create a Warrior that can worship RZ. Would I really be hurtin' going Iksar with no RZ as my big daddy? I know about the exp penalty, and they can't wear plate, but for some unknown reason I want to go Iksar, so...help me out, please 8). Also, believe it or not, it's not the regen thing that draws me to 'em /shrug. Thanks to all that educate me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sabek</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No RZ cultural kinda stinks, but you can get Tae Ew plate with close to the same or in some cases better stats.<br />
I love my Iksar and wouldnt change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sukrn</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends what you are going to do with the toon really, if you have the cash to heavily twink your warrior to be, Fierce Heraldic (RZ) armour is common and has also come down in price considerably over the last month or two.  If you do not have a huge amount of $$ and want to twink, there is an abundance of leezard friendly gear you can buy, you just need to look around.<br />
<br />
Twinking aside, if you want to play a leezard, do it.  They rock, but I'm bias =\</div></div><hr />

 I'd agree with the earlier posters, just play whatever makes you happy - I wouldnt trade my Lizard for anything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Armor issues because of race are resolved since Velious, so do what you want and like.<br />
My former co-guildleader was an iksar warrior himself and did very well.<br />
Faction is a non issue in velious/luclin for the most part as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Werekin</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, not resolved, us Vah Shir can't wear any cultural, imbued or not, but those dern frogs can!!  Lets make some soup outtas dem!!  Really though, I love the kittycat, but the iskar warr's do look bad as hell.  ALl I know who play em, love em.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cerebros</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love being an Iksar Warrior because I am one of the 5 65 Iksar warriors on my server. Unlike say barbarians or Ogres which make up 75% of the warrior Community.  Our AC bonus is pretty sweet , I usually have 40-60 more ac then a simarly geared warrior.  I wouldnt trade my scales for any soft-skinned race ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the iksar, only be prepared to get &quot;dude go FD pull&quot; forever....I have a willsapper now, and darn if I dont look like a monk.  However.  I picked it for RP, loved RP for 50 levels (then got to the groups where it wained out), love the look (damn verant for taking our absolutly kick ass swim animation), you get over the no plate (coblat, fh, crusty) by just finding alternatives (barbed ringmail, SoV post 50, tae if your buying).  I suggest going sta with the extra points though, I didnt and am paying for it now, had to sacrafice some slots to get sta to par.  Its all about what you love.  My brother made a Bar War, last name is McMarrin, awesome RP, kicks ass at all he tanks.  Iksar have a healthy background, gear at high end is WAR ALL so its no biggy, faction is fixable by spending time in newbie zones like BB, MM, CB, JP, etc, exp penelty never bothers you if you dont do the math on it.  Only thing that gets you is after 4 hours in the dreadlands if you dont hear &quot;d00dz I though you were a monk!....lol hehe&quot;  3 times, your a lucky lizard.</div></div><hr />
