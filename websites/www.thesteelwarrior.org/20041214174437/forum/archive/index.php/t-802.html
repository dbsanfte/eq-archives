<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sadoc</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm so sorry for posting this. I know that this subject has been covered a 1000 times over the past 4 years. Still, I am unable to find this information through searching the net or your boards (at least in a manner I believe to be accurate). So, if you do not mind, please indulge me. <br />
<br />
I am trying to ascertain the experience bonus and penalty of the various EQ races. This is what I believe to be the case:<br />
<br />
 Class Bonus <br />
Rogue, Warrior: 5%<br />
<br />
 Class Penalty <br />
 removed <br />
<br />
 Race Bonus <br />
Halfling: 5%<br />
<br />
 Race Penalty <br />
Iksar: 20%<br />
Troll: 20%<br />
Ogre: 15%   (or is that 10%)<br />
Barbarian: 10% (I'm particularly uncertain about this one)<br />
<br />
<br />
And, I've heard from some vah shir players that there is speculation about the vah shir receiving an exp penalty. Is this accurate? <br />
<br />
Also, do Froglocks receive any penalty? I do not believe they do, but am somewhat uncertain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help and patience. Please excuse my ignorance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I remember with certainty:<br />
<br />
Barbarian racial penalty is 5%<br />
Ogre racial penalty is 15%<br />
<br />
What I am 90 percent certain of remembering correctly:<br />
<br />
Warriors get an 8% xp bonus<br />
Rogues get a 10% xp bonus<br />
<br />
I am a fair bit less certain of this part, but I think the Halfling racial bonus waa/is 10%.  The rest of your assertions are correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is right with rogue warrior at 5% and halfling 5%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Halfling: 5% less<br />
Barbarian: 5% more<br />
Ogre: 15% more<br />
Troll: 20% more<br />
<br />
Warrior: 10% less<br />
Rogue: 9.5% less<br />
<br />
That is from a really old ShowEQ &quot;Everquest Experience - The Definitive Breakdown&quot; that came out before Iksar or Vah Shir and the Class Penalty removal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Race Bonus <br />
Halfling: 5%<br />
<br />
Why? I never understood the reasoning behind this. <br />
<br />
Why not humans?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because humans are what you are comparing against - they are the baseline. Consider, for example:<br />
<br />
Halfling: 5% bonus<br />
Barbarian: 5% penalty<br />
<br />
less than what? more than what? Humans, that's what.<br />
<br />
To put it another way, barby xp for killing mob_01 = 0.95*X, halfling xp = 1.05*X, where X is the xp that a human would get from killing mob_01.<br />
<br />
Change X and you change the value for every other calculation that is a function of it. So the other classes/races with a bonus/penalty all simply shift, and the delta between them all remains the same.<br />
<br />
As to why other races should get more or less xp per mob than humans in the first place, you'd have to ask SOE. ;-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duppolfg</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was said a looong time ago when the game first came out that the 5% bonus halflings got was meant for humans. Some developer said it was a mistake but they couldnt change it for some reason. Perhaps for what jaxxym said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that hard to fix this.  If you want human getting 5% more than you'd just multiply their xp by an extra 1.05 term at the end.  After all they got rid fo hybrid xp penalty by making hybrids gain more XP (i.e. a hybrid who needs 20% more XP to level also gets 20% per kill) so this is clearly doable.  Likewise if Halflings aren't supposed to get the 5% bonus then add an extra 1/1.05 multiplier to bring them back to the norm.  <br />
<br />
My guess is that these aren't deemed game breaking and just ignored.  I remember hearing somewhere that Halflings have an xp bonus because back in the beta no one played them so they got some extra bonuses to make them more attractive.  As for human xp bonus, most races do require more XP than humans so if everyone else needs more XP than you, that's pretty much the same as having an XP bonus.</div></div><hr />
