<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been wanting to return to EQ and play a tank class.  Before I quit, I played a SK and got to lvl 62 before I left.  Now that I am thinking of returning, my heart isn't quite into being a SK anymore.  I don't know why, I guess I just am not an evil person at heart.  I've been thinking of playing a warrior but I wanted thoughts of others on why the choose to play a warrior, why I should or shouldn't play one, and if I should try a different tank class like a paladin or even a SK again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it depends on generally how you're planning to play. If you see yourself ultimately moving into a raiding guild and doing tough content, well, I'd roll a warrior. If you want to tank in groups, and don't mind off tanking on raids, then a knight class is good.<br />
The alt I've put the most time into is my SK. Since I'm quite limited in my play time and in a casual guild, the SK has turned out to be kinda nice. He solos better than my warrior, and that's always handy if you have say, an hour to be online. He also can tank dark blue mobs for any guild group of similar-level characters no problem. It's very very nice to go from a warrior main to a tank class that really has zero problems with aggro and can FD pull. And his pet is amusingly obsequious.<br />
But, when the chips are down, warriors are the better tank. I just wouldn't roll one unless I wanted to group pretty much all the time.<br />
Warriors are expensive to gear up if you are starting all over from scratch. If you have a bankroll, you'll have a much easier time in your mid 40s-mid 50s or so when suddenly you'd like to have haste/droga weapons/cultural-level armor and you can't even solo a hill giant.<br />
I can't speak to the advantages of Paladins, because the only Paladin I have is a mule, lol. They do seem to bring with them some group benefits, and they can be handy in a small guild.<br />
<br />
Concerning not choosing an SK because you're not &quot;evil at heart&quot; -- my other alt is a Shaman. He spends some time each week in PoK or newbie zones ninja buffing people (CHA and SoW at the vendors, for example; regular buffs in newbie zones). I don't have a large enough sample size yet (I'd like to get data on the outcome of thousands of buffed characters), but I can tell you that the three classes most likely to thank me politely for buffs in PoK are, in order: SKs, enchanters, clerics.<br />
Dead last? Warriors. I suspect that warriors aren't the rudest class in the game; perhaps they're simply concentrating on not accidentally selling any of the 5-10 back-up weapons they're carrying in their bags, and hence don't notice the SoW &amp; CHA landing, lol.<br />
When my SK alt was in his newbie zone, and a bit later camping lizards in Feerott, he never asked for help from anyone, but on a number of occasions 60+ SKs went out of their way to help him. I don't have numbers on this, but it was markedly the case that SKs were more likely to help than other classes, and that holds true for all of the baby characters/classes I've fiddled with.<br />
That's SKs' dirty little secret: most of them are pretty nice, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not sure I'd make a Warrior if I was rolling up a new character. I'd probably make a Paladin.<br />
<br />
For your first 56 levels or so you won't be raiding. Excluding raiding, there isn't a mob in the game that can't be tanked by a Knight. The spellbooks ARE a free bonus, especially up to about level 60 - take the book and say thank you. Heck, Warriors get almost nothing at all until pretty late when they finally get Defensive (Dual Wield? Giggle - in the upper 50's Windblade beats DW droga weapons afaic). Take da book.<br />
<br />
SK's have Fear kiting and while it's ok and kinda fun those tools are fundamentally useless after level 60ish. Paladins can solo quite nicely. Early on Pacify is helpful and Root and heals never become useless.<br />
<br />
My feeling is that if you are a casual player, a Paladin can't be beat - heals, Res, Root, and buffing does NOT suck, not at all. If you are a hardcore player and intend to raid, it's still hard to do better than securing aggro without having to use special weapons.<br />
<br />
Even with the Paladin 1.5 Epic repaired and set to what was intended, mid-level Paladins have a hard hitting (Diamond-tipped War Javalin in quality) epic, Narandi's helm, FT on their ornate mold boots, Mana Preservation on their ornate mold arms (I think), Benevolent Girdle, Blade of Disruption, Muramite's Shield, Dragorn Commoner's Ring, etc.<br />
<br />
A raid Paladin at level 60-65 just coming out of Ssra/Seru/VT in combination with OoW drops IMO can not be equalled by either a Warrior or SK in Tanking ability, spells that support that tanking, and equipment that supports both tanking and spells casting. They have soloablity, near group tanking preference, and a solid raid role.<br />
<br />
IMO, there's no contest - make a Paladin.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMO Knights/Hybrids are more straight-up fun than a warrior to play, especially if you get into the lore/role-play of the game.<br />
<br />
For straight up efficiency in the 65-70 realm, there really is no comparison to a warrior.  Knights can get close these days .. and you can get by with them in all non-raid situations, but they are generally outclassed in a rather large way by warriors of comparable gear/aa level.<br />
<br />
If your preferences extend beyond the role of tank i'd suggest exploring a little bit.  Play a few alts up to level 20 or so and see which one you like the best.  It's a big game out there.<br />
<br />
Play what you want.  Methinks you would enjoy any/all of the tanking classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have large play time, can get into a raiding guild or intend to get into a raiding type guild, then warrior would be good i believe, because you would get to do all the things we are meant to do.<br />
<br />
but for everyday tanking and stuff, i think sks and pallys with their utility do have more to bring to the table.<br />
<br />
its not a bad time to be a warrior now though, much better than even a year ago, especially with all the new good gear floating around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Paladins are the up and coming top dog, if you take a look at the paladin class boards... they have very high ambitions, and they are much more persistant (read:bitching) than us on the EQLIVE boards. I could see them getting alot of the stuff they want out of sheer bitching in the near future, and the gap between warriors and paladins tanking is going to be very slim. Can you believe they actually thought their epic click was MEANT to have a 120% heal mod? (thats +120%, as in heals healed 220%). After the Gms nerfed it back to the intended 20% they had a huge bitchfest instantly.<br />
<br />
As far as SK's go, they get flipped the bird when it comes to tanking, taking a not so close third place and gaining DPS. Don't get me wrong, they can have just as nice stats, but they are losing out on defensive abilities for DPS ones these days. It isn't really fair imo since I know alot of great Sk tanks, but yeah they are getting screwed basically.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whoops, I turned this into a pally flame &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Anyway. If I were you, I would roll a Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh one thing i forgot to add, nother nice thing for being a warrior is out dps isnt too bad, so its nice to be able to contribute meaningfully in exp or raids.<br />
<br />
thats the downside to being a pally. (ok ok i know they can do decentish dps but i dont think they come close to warrriors in an equivalent setup.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">being a warrior forces you to talk to people and find groups and be sociable and play well with others .... or just make a priest_bot to group with you.</div></div><hr />

Thye just cant tank well enough when it really counts.<br />

Wanna get through trash mobs fast? sk/pally have great agro.<br />
Wanna get through them trash mobs fast just to whipe at the boss?<br />
<br />
Defensive means a warr is twice as good as a knight.<br />
<br />
My sk has nearly 1k more hit points and 300 more ac and still he cant tank GoD sewer trial 1, the warr im now trucking around did it trivially.<br />
<br />
Oh yeh, he can tank a ldon easy with barely needing a heal, on trivial content, knights rule. But, trivial content is for those who enjoy trivia, most of us like a challenge..<br />
<br />
Dont make a mistake. The spell book looks good, but it is of no use when it comes to pharming the things that help you power up your toons. Pallies can sometimes aproach a warr in stunnable content. But only approach.<br />
<br />
Buy a couple of good agro weapons and be forthright on telling you groups not to unload before mob is at 80% and you will never look back.</div></div><hr />

Very misinformed and incorrect post. Please know what you're talking about before you try to give advice. Warriors twice as good as Paladins because of defensive? Yeah ok buddy.<br />
<br />
My suggestion, dont listen to that guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe im just excited because me and my group are finally starting to progress past some bottlenecks that were holding us up when we were trying to tank events with pallies and sk's but i stand by my assessment that a warr with defensive makes trivial encounters that will destroy a knight.<br />
<br />
We have all started our epic 1.5's and having a blast.<br />
<br />
Who cares what the ratio is. Warrs are the games defining tanks. Im sorry if you dissagree with that. Our group are convinced. My poor sk is sulking in the end billing corner, and my friends pally is rarely playing anymore.<br />
<br />
Dont make the mistake of thinking knights are anywhere near warrs in raw tanking. If you want to progress and do hard events, warrs are best at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Warriors are game defining tanks, but if a knight knows his/her shit they can come quite close.

 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If I were to start over I would roll a berserker or rogue, not a warrior or a tank :eek: . Here's why:<br />
<br />
1) Tanks need to get a lot of hp's, they're totally gear dependant. This requires a lot of time (and planning). My warrior is almost 8k unbuffed now but I still want more. Being a non-tank dps class all you need is a good weapon and decent gear really, rest is not very necessary as with tank classes.<br />
<br />
2) You need to be very attentive ALL the time while playing. If you're exping you're on your toes, you can never slack as MT. [/rant] You will start to hate anyone who slacks in your group or raid. If you suspect a wizard of slacking you will start looking for his spell messages. [/rant]<br />
<br />
3) Exp grinding. My warrior is level 70 and has 255 AAs atm and I want to grind a lot more still because it will make him better and I don't want him to be a second rate warrior. Why doesn't level 70 come with 300 free AA's to spend? =/ I want both defensive and offensive AAs as well as utility AA's like warlord's tenacity etc.<br />
<br />
4) Choices to make. There are tons of weapons out there of many kinds that you can use. You spend DKP on new weapons and augment them but you will always fall back to a BoC+A3 and offhand+A3 (or similar combo). I can't explain this much. Not many weapons out there that can hold aggro, and you will want to use those, not that shiny 2hander you won on last raid because it doesn't have an aggro proc. :mad: <br />
<br />
5) Responsibility. Both during raids (if you're MT/ST) and in exp groups. See point 2.<br />
<br />
Since my warrior has some nice offensive AA's now I won't roll a berserker atleast :) Seeing so many positive posts I just wanted to add some 'cons' of our class I could think of atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Why a Warrior? .. You have one job with many little parts, You get beat on... in doing so you don't let anyone else get beat on. That's what you are there for ... sometimes you die, most times (with a decent healer) you don't ... if what you are looking for is, I can do this solo and this solo, don't roll up a warrior, if you want to be the guy standing out front of the pack getting your butt handed to you on a daily basis ... Welcome to the club!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Okay, one encounter =P. Personally I wouldn't alter my character choice because I would have a really hard time killing Jhiru in an exped some day. Besides, you only need to tank him to like 50, as long as ther is a huge pet charmed with you it can solo his ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SK, pally and a war.<br />
<br />
Actually the SK has about 1k more hit points than the war and 300 odd more AC.<br />
<br />
Defensive trivialises encounters that mash knights.<br />
<br />
I can do a ldon with just lifetaps and regen in the SK, and can finish it in a lot less time than with the war.<br />
<br />
The pally isnt mine, its a friends, and he also makes ldons trivial, but needs the occasional heal.<br />
<br />
The warrior soaks up the mana, i basically have to keep him quiescenced all the time, However...............<br />
<br />
My SK cant tank named at the end of GoD sewer 1. He just gets raped. Goes down faster than i can heal him with two healers.<br />
<br />
My war tanks it trivially. Matter of a fact the cleric we usually group with was complaining he thought it would be more of a challenge.<br />
<br />
Same with other content that was blocking me from going forward. Epic 1.5 fights, I even got to tank Mareq the phrophet the other day on a pick up raid. Some superb healing kept me up till about 1% when i went down and so did half the raid 8).<br />
<br />
Do i want to end billing on a toon that ive spent nearly three years on? not on your life. Ive loved the toon to death, I love being an nasty orge SK. <br />
<br />
Do I know how to play him? yep i think so. Regardless how self serving our own opinions are of our intelligence relative to others, I reckon i play him pretty well.<br />
<br />
However, he cant tank stuff i want to do, and my friends gimp warrior thats still has a lot of slots in velious gear who still gets knocked around on easy ldons, alost identical defensive aa set up, makes my poor SK look like a ranger.<br />
<br />
My friend with his pally comes a lot closer on stunnable content, but the reallity is with the recent changes, and if you want to go through GoD the only viable tank is a war.<br />
<br />
Some people may not agree, but i have the luxury of having three similar tansk (actually the pally has 2k hit points and nearly 500ac on him but still cant match him)<br />
<br />
The problem is, defensive scales, none of the knight abilities do. Except stun, but on nasty mobe your not likely to channel one off very easily.<br />
<br />
I always play healers, so i get to watch the mana bars.<br />
<br />
On trivial content, knights rule, but once it gets hard, wars are the only viable tank.<br />
<br />
Pallies are closer than sk's, but they still cant match it.<br />
<br />
Sure some people may not agree. However i have the luxury of comparing a few tanks at similar defensive levels. Now that wars can cast spelly things in the form of belows and incites etc to get aditional agro, while they cant hold the agro like a knight, they are good enough for it not to matter.<br />
<br />
Anyway im not going to get involved in a shit fight bout it. I dont really care enough. Tooo booring.<br />
<br />
However im retiring my pet SK for a gimp war cause he allows my group to kill things that yeild better loot so support the progression more readily. At the end of the day it doesnt matter wether its a war a pally or a rusty equiped ranger. Progression brings rewards, and the best progressive tank is a war.<br />
<br />
Last post on this i promise.<br />
<br />
Be well all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;Why a warrior ?&quot;<br />
 and why not ?<br />
a warrior is the best of all classes : <br />
 * the one that dies first and get rezed last.<br />
 * the one that can't solo safely but want to.<br />
 * the one that is the most asked in group but that has the hardest time finding one.<br />
 * the one that is the strongest but that can't live alone.<br />
 * the one that is the more gear dependant but that burns the more DKP and pp for them.<br />
 * the one that every other look for assist during battle.<br />
 * the one who gets all the glory for standing toes to toes with gods and survive.<br />
 * the only one that lives for war...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've pondered this a bit and I think it depends on why the original poster stopped playing the SK. If it was because of frustration at having trouble with boss mobs, roll up the warrior.<br />
If you were not thrilled with tanking, a warrior certainly will not be more exciting. If you like a mix of melee, soloing, etc then you'd be better off with a beastlord or even a ranger.<br />
Sometimes I see a comment from someone who has tried a warrior and found them boring and I just blink and think, &quot;The hell, buddy.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The reason I quit my SK was because I was just buying my first house and I decided to sell off my old account for the extra cash to help out with the moving.  Now that I am settled in after about 6 months, I would like to start back into EQ if it isn't a hassle to level to be able to get into raid guilds.  As far as time to play is concerned, I may have roughly at most 2 to 3 hours on weeknights to play but with alot more time on the weekends.  I do like the melee aspect of the game and have considered making a rogue for an alt and also a wizard just to try a pure casting class out.  Maybe this will help you guys with my question on whether a SK, Pally, or Warrior would be the best tank character for my playtime.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you think SK is I will probably go human with him but with warrior I was thinking human or barbarian.  What are the pros and cons of these two races in the warrior area?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As with most classes, eventually your race will mean nothing. The only difference between a human and barb at higher levels for warriors is the Barb is immune to frontal stun. This won't really change anything, but stun is annoying.<br />
<br />
At lower levels however, the Barb benefits from naturally higher STA. He will have more hp.<br />
<br />
If you do go warrior, I HIGHLY recommend worhsipping Rallos Zek, so you can wear Fierce Heraldic cultural armor.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was for all larger races, ie orges and trolls as well?<br />
<br />
And I don't recall saying they weren't immune forever. I also mentioned it wasn't a big deal too. Digging a little ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Only ogres. Barb, trolls, and ogres all get slam, but frontal stun immunity is unique to ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I very good tank I know and respect that raids in a high end guild told me if he was making a twink he would make an ikky and put all the points into cha.<br />
<br />
If you are lookin to get a high end raiding warr cause DA works of cha and ikkies get a bout 50ac bonus at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
However they get a huge xp penalty.<br />
<br />
Ogres are great fun cause of the no forntal stun, but you need a constant source of shrink potions, a cobalt bracer or one of them wands from the deep. Cause they get stuck everywhere. They also get an xp hit but not as bad as trolls and ikkies.<br />
<br />
Halflings level the fastest, but suffer low level stat shortages. One again not really an issue at the upper end.<br />
<br />
Humans are kewl cause they are human.<br />
<br />
Wood elves are kewl cause there arent many woody tanks.<br />
<br />
Trolls regen bonus is good pre pop. but they suffer for it on xp.<br />
<br />
I have no experiance with vah shir but i think they eat a lot 8)<br />
<br />
Ogres are the easiest toons to PL cause the no stun from front means your not spending half your life not attacking that red mob that you shouldnt really be trying cause you are stunned and spinning around in a circle.<br />
<br />
If your really pl'n sometimes it takes half the fight to do the 20pts dmg that you need to assure that you can beat the dot poof on zone or innadvertant dmg the pler does.<br />
<br />
Good luck matey.<br />
<br />
PS dont discount the xp bonus halflings get (I think its 10%), of you take into account trolls get a (think its 15%) penalty thats almost 25% difference. And levels are pretty important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Halflings actually have rather healthy stats.  They aren't huge kegs of stamina and str, but they have a decent starting dexterity and a relatively high charisma.<br />
<br />
Str/Sta are the 2 easiest stats to raise via gear both at the low-end and high-end, whereas Dex and Charimsa can be more difficult (Cha especially).<br />
<br />
If had to choose a different class from the start it would be either Hobbit or Barby.   :D <br />
<br />
&lt;3 Hobbits<br />
<br />
ps- &quot;Wood elves are kewl cause there arent many woody tanks.&quot;  I'd wager your server has 1/20th the number of Kitty warriors compared to WE warriors.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">heres some more tidbits hehe:<br />
<br />
IMO Barbs, Ogres and Trolls are WAY overplayed as wars (because of the stats, and the abilities of trolls and ogres) so im NEVER gonna play one of them.<br />
<br />
Im partial to the small races, and i like dwarves (having watched the lord of the rings and read it more times than is probably good for me) so i play a dwarf warrior.  theyre fun hehe.<br />

you forgot a few i think: gnomes, dark elves and froggies.  my bro plays a froggie and he likes it, and gnomes are always fun to play.  DEs are played a lot too.<br />

Ill say it again: play whatever race you want to cause it doesnt really matter that much.  If you can though i agree choose rallos zek.  And put all yer points into sta (which i did not do cause scary was the 1st char ever for me and i didnt know much hehe).<br />

As far as comparing classes, itemisation rules the day now. In our Time + guild we have a monk who has more hp than half our tanks, and a Paladin within 5% of our top warriors hp and more ac than all of them. <br />
<br />
And imo SK's hit the jackpot with Oow as far as exp goes. Puller, snarer, decent dps for a tank in one spot (and all of those are needed quite a lot) and mobs hits are not bad at all now. Paladins made out well too.<br />
<br />
Would I make a warrior this late in the game? Not personally.  Am I glad I chose warrior overall? Yes, raid tanking is the most fun I ever had in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">there is only one reason to play a warrior that i can think of. because you like getting beat on. you are always powerless to help when things go wrong. you have no spells and that means no aces in the hole. while others including paladins shadowknights and beastlords always have something clever up their sleeves to pull when they need it the warrior just keeps whacking away hoping somebody will do something inspirational.<br />
<br />
some of us think its fun getting beat up. some of like watching the hp go from 100 to 10 in a few seconds wondering if the heal will land on time. but if thats not you then your whole opinion of a warrior will boil down to &quot;they sure dont have a lot of options. they just stand there&quot;.<br />

Raiding guilds are going to have Warriors. Should you need a Warrior for a particularly hard fight, it's not hard to get one to help.<br />
<br />
It's up to you, but you don't need to be a Warrior (or even a melee) to get good items. That being the case, I'd play a Paladin. In groups, you are a Warrior with a spellbook. In raids, you get to watch Warriors get beat senceless, while you tank some, melee, and cast spells. To me, that's a perfect way to play. Warriors may get a little glory, but Paladins get a bucket-load of fun and usefillness.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Warriors &gt; Knights in EQ today.<br />
<br />
Actually that's not the whole story.  &quot;Knight&quot; means &quot;Paladin or Shadowknight&quot; and let's face facts:  shadowknights are no longer worth considering in the same category as paladins or warriors.  Basically, you take a shadowknight if the content isn't too challenging and you can't find one of the two tank classes you actually want.  That's why, for every level 70 SK, there are at least 3 level 70 paladins and at least 3 level 70 warriors.<br />
<br />
(Digression:  Personally I believe that the reason SK's have fallen so far behind is that they don't have a prominent messageboard community and there are few prominent SK &quot;activists&quot; - while both paladins and warriors have more than their share of advocates.  Some would say whiners instead of advocates, but I'm not quite that cynical.)<br />
<br />
So let's get real.  The competition is between warriors and paladins, shadowknights don't really come into it.<br />
<br />
Well, there are three environments to consider:  Raids, xp groups, and solo.<br />
<br />
In raids, there's no contest.  Warrior &gt; paladin, end of story.  Raid guilds need about six decently geared warriors, but by and large they can make do with one paladin twink with MGB.<br />
<br />
In groups, there's a contest.  Paladins can situationally out-tank warriors, depending on the value of stuns in a particular environment, although warriors do undeniably have the edge when the chips are down and the high DPS red-con named gets pulled.<br />
<br />
But there's more to the group choice thing than tanking.  If paladins and warriors can tank roughly equally in many situations - which is, by and large, close enough to the truth - then the question as to who's best in the exp group tank role becomes, which of the classes does more DPS?<br />
<br />
And that's a no-brainer, paladins are one of the lowest DPS classes in the game, while high end warriors are probably somewhat too close to monks.<br />
<br />
Soloing, both classes suck so badly it's scary.  Easily the worst caster class at soloing is cleric, but clerics can still solo a whole lot better than any tank.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:  If you're going to make a tank, make a warrior.<br />
<br />
This will switch back to pally following the next round of tank class rebalancing, though.</div></div><hr />

Also, when we get a named in hard mode ldon, you slap defensive and you win. period.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Its pretty good generally, but the reason sk's are so far behind other tanks is thier lack of dmg mitigation abilities.<br />
<br />
Sure they lifetap, and on my *sniff* now retired SK his lifetaps can allow him to solo trivial content, ive even had him solo a protector of ro once it was slowed and my sham went LD, bit lucky on the procs and crits but he managed it.<br />
<br />
However he still gets seriously raped by challenging content.<br />
<br />
Pallies are closer, if the mobs can be stunned. And on undead they do great dps however...........<br />
<br />
Most progression requires you to kill &quot;uber_bos_01&quot; or kill 8 &quot;uber_boss_01_guardians&quot; to spawn &quot;Uber_bos_01&quot; then kill him.<br />
<br />
On hard content defensive &gt; all.<br />
<br />
I still have the situation where my ex friends, now my warrior that hasnt been played since pop came out, still has velious gear, and only tier 2 pop level drops, is only 8.1k and 1300 ac buffed can tank the GOD sewer trials and my (now retired) 9k and 1680ac buffed SK got seriously violated. My friends 9.8k 1800ac pally can tank the God sewer1 boss but he needed to blow LoH.<br />
<br />
(ps, he had been played, but he never bought the expansions past pop till i took over the account)<br />
<br />
All toons have all thier defensives, except the warr that needs a couple more levels of hit point up aa's.<br />
<br />
On trivial content knights rool. On anything hard warriors are far far better. I know gear makes a big difference but ive had a couple of time geared rangers do some tanking in ldons with me and i reckon they tank better than my poor ex sk.<br />
<br />
Without some form of dmg mitigation abilities SK's are unfortunately seriously gimped in the tanking department. Pallies are a lot closer on stunnable content, but only closer.<br />
<br />
Warr's allow you to progress, and the game is all about progression. You dont get the new &quot;uber_sword_of_bastardness&quot; by killing 27,345 blue mobs.<br />

<br />
I was MT for my guild since POP and our knights with less but reasonable gearing always tanked the same xp stuff I did.On the occaison that some new named was extremely challenging at a given time people have given me and a couple of our heaviest Wars preferance,but, that has always quickly faded.I think the only group mobs I've presently tanked they haven't is DD(they'll do it soon if not yet) and Jirhu without a pet.That sounds right to me.Warrior's have a recognizable advantage tanking undisced and a large advantage when discs are available/needed.Our knights tank everything I do with the exception of some raid targets(many of which they could tankfine  imo).<br />
<br />
SK's need a little upgrading to be brought in line with paladins I think.This doesn't mean getting defensive/riposte discs.Our knights are extremely useful on raids.They made me guildleader/raidleader a few months back when we got to Time and I must say that generally I find Knights more valuable than warriors(beyond the first 2-3)to the raid force.Our knights group at least as successfully as our warriors and I would put that down to social differances between players.<br />
<br />
Our Knights have valuable roles on raids and do well in xp groups.Our warriors have a reasonable tanking advantage overall now  imo.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean that MGBing Brells and then doing 150-200 DPS is a valuable role?<br />
<br />
I mean, I'm not a pally and I'm not exactly sympathetic to pallies - far from it - but I have to say that their raid role blows goats.  Let's face facts... what pallies do on most raids is basically to cast Brells and help stop the knightemization loots from rotting.  Everything else they do would be far better done by an extra warrior or cleric, and in fact you don't need a pally at all, you just need a MGB-capable pallybot.</div></div><hr />

Even on raids where adds are mezzable Pal/Sks can get aggro from a distance with zero damage and allow the enchanters to get things locked down without getting hit.  Paladin group heals are very useful on AE fights as well.  If you ask me, on the raids I do, A paladin is more useful than every warrior except for the main tank.  You may not *need* them, but they are very good to have.</div></div><hr />

Wth are you talking about? you play a differant game or you guys just do stuff totally differantly?I've always valued our knights for add control.Not only are they better add control most of the time than warriors ,but, they heal,cure,root aggro kite...I gotta tell you,days we don't have our  good knights are way harder than when we do.Most of the time they have a far greater impact on our raid success than warriors past MT/ST.I use them a lot and love em.<br />
<br />
Yeah,I agree with Brutul.Except for very specific encounters our knights with 1k less hp and no discs have a much greater effect on raids than warriors past the top 1-3 depending on the fight.Heck, I lead the raids and I hate not having the knights there.<br />
<br />
PS.Damn.Last Rathe we were missing pullers and used a couple necros...it was hell.Our old SK who used to do a great job retired. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Good players are always an asset, be they paladins or druids or beastlords or whatever.  I'm not impugning the abilities of the people who play the classes.<br />

I've always valued our knights for add control.  Not only are they better add control most of the time than warriors ,but, they heal,cure,root aggro kite<br />
<br />
Warriors are perfectly good add control, and when you don't have adds, warriors contribute significantly better DPS.<br />
<br />
As for healing, curing, rooting, aggro kiting, I hear all that.  But wouldn't you rather have the quality player with a cleric (healing, curing, rooting) or a necro (rooting, aggro kiting) which can actually perform those tasks optimally?<br />
<br />
A paladin is more useful than every warrior except for the main tank<br />
<br />
Paladin is among the lowest-DPS classes in the game, and raids are all about DPS.<br />
<br />
I'd rather be in a raid with 8 warriors and a pally, than a raid with 8 pallies and a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">The only real nice thing about Paladin is that they're probably the lowest maintenance class in the game (high HP, can heal self) so if you're throwing a bunch of guys you just recruited to an encounter, a Paladin is most likely to survive the longest given that all the guys you recruited obviously have gear inadequate for the encounter.<br />
<br />
But Warrior survivability is also pretty darn high, with extra DPS to boot.  A high end Paladin might be able to perform certain things better than a high end Warrior, but none of these are vital roles that the Warrior can't do competently.<br />
<br />
That said high end Paladins do stack pretty well on raids filling out the this-and-that roles, but so do Warriors.  But when it comes down to it, I'd rather have a Warrior over a Paladin on a raid due to DPS.  If I need someone to heal, just replace the War/Paladin with a Cleric instead (assuming you can find one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">If the world were perfect and I had enough of every class at every raid It probably wouldn't matter so much.However,our Knights primary duty is offtanking adds.They do this better most of the time on our raids due to the fact they can aggro stronger from a distance on incoming and keep early aggro more reliably than our warriors.Even better, with mezzables known or unknown they are perfectly suited to tank mezzing them.Unlike a warrior who must turn attack off and risk passing aggro to his healer or mob debuffer while waiting for mez.There are times when stuff hits too hard and I prefer warrior offtanks.Generally, I only need 3(so far) of them at most though as the majority of add pulls are handled fine by knights.<br />
<br />
When trash doesn't hit too hard I prefer knights to MA clearing.Mobs are more reliably held and positioned on incoming.Also they work great as MA's/CC on trash POP in p3 &amp; 4.Again their aggro is good right outa the gate and reliable when you don't want to damage something.They can kite/root/tank adds while placing them on adds like VZ and Inny well.They can cure groups in place of healers on quarm to some degree and heal.In Time they are great at placing adds without damaging them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps their utility seems less helpful if you never lack enough of certain other classes/shrug.They come in very handy on our raids and they count more to our successes than lower order warriors.There are some events where we need more heavy tanks,but, normally Knights are more useful on our raids.</div></div><hr />
