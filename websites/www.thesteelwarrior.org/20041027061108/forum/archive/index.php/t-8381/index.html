<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i have a small question about  what to do on mobs that hit for 1500+ and what to do on the initial pull. There is just a small discussion on the way two of us warriors view going into this encounter when getting initial agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Friends thoughts: Mob hits for 1500+ start off with defensive. <br />
<br />
<br />
My thoughts: Start off with Furious, give the clerics time to get CH going good, get awesome agro due to consistant hits on mob + possible procs, and basically lock down agro. And except for Bertox, make sure you last longer than 1 round of combat. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone know who's right and who's wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you can use disc, it's more efficient to start with furious and then chain with def/St.Wall/Eva (from an aggro point of view).<br />
so builting up big aggro fast during furious can help the slower/debuffer/whatever to engage earlier, so helping your survalibilty.<br />
from the CH rotation point of view, if there is a chance that you need a CH very early (few sec after you've engaged) then they must start the CH before you engage the mob, and just /stopcasting if you didn't recived anougth domage yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Neither is right or wrong just do whatever you like. I dont use furious unless its an MT switch or clerics have to run in and position behind us usually, rest of the time I save fortitude for bad / heavy pulls to AE taunt and /disc to give chanters and tank mezzers some time to get targets.<br />
<br />
We start our CH rots well before any boss is pulled if were pulling him though to make sure none are afk etc.. so theres no need to let CH rot get going good, and theres no debuff required &lt;10sec after angagement, after that nobody is going to pull agro with a debuff anymore thanks to anger augs and WA5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends on what you like to do.  Personally, I like furious because it makes the healers job easier.  Also, we have a TON of warriors who can tank stuff, so its pretty easy for us to go boss to boss to boss using our different tanks and kill'em each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pogi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fortitude &gt; Furious.. But yeah starting a high dps mob with either of these two is prolly best.  But I say the best thing to do on these encounters is to sacrafice a ranger with WS so debuffs can get in and most of the time you won't need Fortitude / Furious..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">assuming its a truly high hitting mob i tend to go for fortitude/furious. one reason is because i honestly dont trust my healers to get off to a fast start. your healers may be better. the other reason is if YOU are pulling then its coming in unslowed and that is by far the most dangerous part of the fight.<br />
<br />
on trash mobs where i accidentally pull say three of them i look at furiuos as more of a last ditch escape hatch for a late heal not liking to use it up unless im pressed to it. but on raid boss targets you might as well use it because you are not going to need it again after that fight anyway. the longer you have had the mob engaged the more polished the healer timing gets and the less likely you are to get splatted. so go ahead and use it right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My initial throughts were on mobs like RZtW, and LMM, and bertox. I know these mobs dont hit hard for Time geared warriors, but for Pre-Elem geared warriors I think they still hit realativly hard and fast.<br />
<br />
A few others that come to mind are the Frog and minibosses before LMM. The Named Elemental and Alligator in PoE. <br />
<br />
My thoughts are that an 8k buffed tank would need to use Furious. Just to make sure that the Shammy and chanter have time to Slow/tash and the agro from the constant hits and maybe getting off a few procs in the process would keep the mob of the shammy/chanter. And the cleric/druids would be able to get the heal rotation off. Because when there is a rampaging mob, the last thing you want is to have the cleric who has cheal land as the mob is engaged get rampage. You want the MT to be able to go at least a round with out heals, and the RT to get in there and get good Rampage agro. <br />
<br />
<br />
Again just my thoughts. And i am trying to get this information setup for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We have a SK(our main puller) pull LMM and RZtW, a monk for Bert.  Berts melee range is freakin' huge!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe yeah, but his hitbox is huge too. I can stand halfway across the room and still hit him :P<br />
<br />
and the RT to get in there and get good Rampage agro.<br />
<br />
You don't have to build agro for rampage. It's a set list and the mob goes thru the list in order whenever someone dies or moves out of rampage range. Usually you want the rampage tank to agro first then have the MT pull agro right after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only reason not to use Furious/Fortitude at the beginning of a fight is if you are going to be tanking something harder in the next 45 minutes.  You can stare at your health after defensive wears and hit it when you think you're in danger, but IMO the first few seconds before the debuffs are in and the chain is established are the most dangerous part of the fight, and the time when clerics are most likely to get aggro, so it's a good time to be invuln in my book.  Personally I only use furious on mobs where things are pretty much under control from the get-go.  If I have to move them at all, or attack from max range until it gets pushed to me in the corner I use Fortitude instead.  You will also want to use fort on bad flurry mobs since it can't be riposted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You don't pull Bert... he pulls you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We use furious/fortitude on pretty much every boss, we got lots of warriors who all like to tank so disc being down is rarely a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, i have a small question about what to do on mobs that hit for 1500+ and what to do on the initial pull.

Depends on how often the mob hits in my opinion, if a mob hits for 3k (take blazzax or reparm in fire) Evasive is better.  If the mobs max hit is about 1500, use defensive - Furious on pulls has a chance of messing up a ch chain, and if your healers mana pools aren't up to par they waste mana at the start of the fight, which can blow at the end (if defensive fades before the kill is over).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I say mobs that hit for 2k+ and have high damage procs (krizik the mighty,blaz, reparm, etc..) use evasive on, if a mob is slowable/partially but hits 1500 max or so, use defensive (and switch to sheild around 20% if you need an additional boost in hp/ac)<br />
<br />
Ramp tanking; First person who gets aggro is main tank, second person who gets aggro ends up as rampage tank, ramp tanks only have to hit the mob one time to be put on list (buffing the main tank after he shoots an arrow/bolt/incite/bellow can also put you on ramp list.)<br />
<br />
Furious &gt; Defensive imo at all times, cant proc on a riposte, can proc on a miss - aka the mob wont proc anything on ya if your using furious (i'm not totally sure because I dont/haven't used it enough, but I believe fortitude just makes you immune from melee damage and not spells.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yethuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love pulling mob / setting mob with Furious (cannot Proc on furious swing but you still swing normally while furious so ya can still get procs during that time) and then 99% of the time I click over to evasive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">duel someone with evasive, then duel that person with defensive to see a huge diff between the 2. Never use stonewall when MT'ing because if you lose aggro somehow, your snared and your raid is screwed (plus using it pushes you out of corners thus making raids snag ripostes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Using defensive or evasive has nothing to do with the mob's max damage and everything to do with its DI relative to its DB and whether it has any really high DD procs that could tip the scale to evasive.  <br />
<br />
Dueling someone would not be a good way to compare the two as mob damage (DI/DB) can be very different than player damage.  <br />
<br />
There use to be a big sticky in the library showing DI/DB ratios and whether to use evasive or defensive on said mob.  I don't know if it's still around.<br />
<br />
btw, I just MT'ed an entire LMM fight and did not use evasive.  Actually for a good chunk of the fight I didn't have defensive up either.  It's current content for us.  i have no elemental gear.  We got a bad pull and the raid had to kill some cats while I kept LMM busy, so the fight took a long time and defensive ran out.  But with max MR and a wizard chain shielding me, LMM's proc wasn't very dangerous at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">using stonewall doesn't push you out of walls... i use it almost exclusively and never had anything like that happen... besides if you lose agro on big raid mobs the agro thief will be dead within seconds and mob will come back to you anyways.. and with strafe run i can still shuffle around fast enough with stonewall, even backwards.</div></div><hr />
