<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stupid, stupid question.  Some guy last night (a paladin) told me that he didn't want the aggro even though I was 3 levels below him, because he couldn't mitigate the damage as well as I could.  We compared AC and HP, and even though there were 3 levels difference we were roughly in the same ballpark.<br />
<br />
is there something aside from AC which affects how much damage is taken by the tank?  he was claiming something about a mitigation factor for a warrior being twice the percentage points higher than a paladin.  Was he nuts?  I just blew him off cause I'd had a couple beers.  I thought damage mitigation was based solely on AC and the monsters ATK.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm still a newbie in a lot of ways :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I'm quite happy with being the MT. To be completely honest, I dont like being something other than the MT, period.<br />

Because the pally was 3 levels higher, we had the discussion which confused me and I am trying to resolve my confusion.</div></div><hr />

I think he wanted to do what was best for the group.  It was a positive thing, not a negative.  Still chuckled at your comment tho Apothes.</div></div><hr />

I was always under the impression that level played a part as well.  I could be completely wrong, though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, level does play a part in mitigation... so I was incorrect... the Paladin would've mitigated better than the warrior in the above example.</div></div><hr />

You will notice more of a difference if with those 3 levels also come higher skill caps.<br />

Less so if you are both, say, in your 60's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not really,<br />

I mitigate significantly better at 65 than I did at 60, with no skill increases.</div></div><hr />

Wrong.<br />
Go make some parsing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">maybe it was in the same ballpark cause he could get the mob slowed quicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate to tell you but this is established reality, only in your fantasy world does there exist a &quot;mitigation difference' between two classes with the identical defense skill and AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Warrior sort of *mitigate* better because we have higher skill caps on the special defense skills (parry/riposte/dodge).<br />
<br />
But other than that any perceived mitigation is just that, perceived.  While AC probably isn't worth the same for everyone (clearly for a while a point of AC on monk was worth a lot less than a point of AC on anyone else), there's no real reason to believe why they wouldn't be the same for the primary tanking plate classes.  If there is supposed to be a difference in mitigation, it'd have to be something that can only be noticed via parsing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was wondering.. has it occured to anyone that the &quot;percieved&quot; superior mitigation might be because there are damage taking table possibilities dependant on class?  Not saying I'm right by the way before flames begin simply saying maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i believe the 'percieved' mitigation difference is due to the difference in hps at lower levels. if a War has 3k hp and a pally 2k when that mob hits for 200 it is noticed that the  drop in pally hps is faster than the warrior hps...<br />
<br />
much parsing has shown that there is no discernable difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vergil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If a warrior and a paladin were of the same level, had the same HP and the same AC, the warrior WOULD, theoretically,  have an advantage in damage taking - because they have higher defensive skills (as mentioned, dodge, pioste and parry)...<br />
<br />
BUT the paladin will, in reality, take less damage as the MT: they can use a slow 2H weapon (avoiding POP mob ripostes) and their stuns will allow the slower to slow the mob earlier with no fear of agro.  <br />
<br />
Less ripostes + faster slows = less damage overall.<br />
<br />
With regards to the other question (does level really make a difference?) - I don't believe that I have ever seen parses that prove that there is a difference in mitigation based on levels...but I believe that level does effect this, even when removed from skill gains.<br />
<br />
Vergil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As a clarification, skills like dodge, parry, riposte are avoidance, not mitigation. And Frodlin has showed that the difference in the knight vs. warrior avoidance skill caps makes for a difference of about 1.5% in damage taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Almost right Gimmel,<br />
<br />
What I showed (and is being confirmed incidentally on PoN board in a thread dealing with avoidance mods and their 'benefits') is that warriors avoid 1.5% more hits than knights.   <br />
<br />
This doesn't necessarily mean though that the damage is linear at 1.5%, it could in some instances mean we take more than 1.5% more than them, and in others it could mean we take less than 1.5%, really depending on how much damage the successful hit lands for.   It simply means that 1.5% more often, a hit will land on a knight than will land on a warrior.<br />
<br />
That's 15 hits less that we take out of 1000 swings.   It's not much.   Thanks for bringing it up though Gimmel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bah! Nitpicker! I should have said &quot;melee&quot; damage taken. Over time, avoiding 1.5% more melee hits should be about the same thing as reducing melee damage by 1.5%, assuming the same mitigation rate. But you are right, the percentage increase in misses isn't quite the same as the percentage of decrease in damage taken. Which is why we had the age long debate as to whether the FBSS is 21 or 17% haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Once again, you are wrong.<br />
<br />
So monks , knights , rogue , warriors with same AC have no mitigation difference ???<br />
<br />
What game are you playing ? Daoc ?<br />
<br />
Anyway a long accurate Parse incoming. Give me a couple of days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Pino,<br />
<br />
I eagerly awat your parse, and in the meantime I'd like to prepare for this information.   Please provide incidentally... the data.... and not your interpretation of it.   In preparation, I've been working my skill in baking, so I can confidently say that at 193 skill in baking and rising (which has doomed me to making crappy arrows until I hit 201), I can prepare tasty delicacies.  <br />
<br />
You like your crow braised?  Broiled?  Stuffed?<br />
<br />
You'll note, the 'monk' part of it is your own straw man, and not based off of a claim of mine, but yes, I claim and stand behind the claim 100% that given identical AC, there is *no* mitigation difference between warriors and knights.   Zip, zero, nada, and I for one am glad you're willing to go through the hassle to prove me right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>pino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually you said that same defense skill and same AC = no difference in mitigation.<br />
<br />
This is soooo wrong.<br />
Look at monk mitigation nerf .... did they lower their defense skill ? No.<br />
This proves that THERE IS an 'hidden' value for mitigation that has nothing to do with AC or defense skill.<br />
<br />
Am i wrong ?<br />
<br />
No, i am not doing the parse to prove you something, doing it cause at this point ( and considering new PoP defensive AA ), i am curious myself about the actual mitigation difference beetwen war and knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vergil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Frodlin was comparing plate class Vs plate class - not talking about monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>pino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Plate does not mean anything.<br />
<br />
Bards are plate class too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">And bards in the same AC mitigate identically</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>pino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">That 1.5% extra avoidance is actually good for 3% better effective HPs assuming the chance to get hit is about 50% with all the avoidance AAs.<br />
<br />
Don't pretend those extra % here and there do not matter, because you know if next patch they gave Knights the same special skills caps as warriors do you'd be here crying about how it's so unfair, and yet when you have that advantage you take it for granted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Pino<br />
<br />
And they haven't gotten the mitigation upgrades that Warriors, Knights and Bards got (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=14449)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Phantron,<br />
<br />
I hate to be a hair splitter with you, but well, let's at least be as accurate as we can.<br />
<br />
I haven't found avoidance AA's to affect the &quot;special avoidance skills&quot; (I still show a 5 1/2, 4 1/2, 3 1/2 spread on Dodge/Parry/Riposte as pretty much always), but mobs *miss* a HECK of a lot more.<br />
<br />
I think we're pretty safe to say that CA/LR/PE's area of effectiveness is on the &quot;to hit&quot; roll rather than on the &quot;to avoid&quot; roll.   If this is the case, then it would also be true that any difference in special avoidance skills between warrior and knight wouldn't be affected by defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
I'm not taking anything for granted, but I'm also not going to pretend that it's of greater value than it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Let's say a mob has a plain 50% chance to hit you after you have all your avoidance AA skills.<br />
<br />
And from your logs, warriors avoid 1.5% of total hits more due to special skills than a Knight.<br />
<br />
For the sake of argument, a mob only hits for 1 damage.  He hits a Paladin 50% of the time and a Warrior 48.5% of the time.<br />
<br />
After 100 hits, warrior takes 48.5 damage and Paladin takes 50 damage.<br />
<br />
That's 3% less damage taken there.  Now change that 1 to say, 1024 (like Fennin Ro's min hit), and that 3% suddenly looks a lot more useful.<br />
<br />
It isn't much, and for XP group it might as well be 1 so no one cares, but on the uber stuff, every bit of avoidance or mitigation counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I'd agree with that, except that if the Knight got hit 50 times, the warrior would get hit 49.25 times as opposed to the 48.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I assumed when you said warrior avoided 1.5% more that's 1.5% total hits.  I.e. if a Knight gets hit 50% of the time, then a warrior gets hit 48.5% of the time.  If a Knight gets hit 100% of the time, then a warrior would get hit 98.5%.<br />
<br />
With that ratio the actual advantage is 3% (48.5/50 = 97%).  A small absolute advantage becomes much bigger as the classes avoid better.  Suppose warriors only avoid 1% more total hits than a Knight, but Knights only get hit 1% of the time.  That'd mean a Warrior will never get hit and tank infinitely better than a Knight (of course, we'd all be soloing instead if that was the case...)<br />
<br />
In that respect, blocking could get very powerful if they implement it on shields.  I don't know the numbers for block off hand but if you can even block 10% of total hits, assuming warriors currently get hit 50% of the time, going from 50% to 40% is basically having 25% more HP, so on a 10K warrior, putting on a shield is like suddenly having 2500 more HPs.  Even a 5% extra mitigation is far greater than any amount of gains you can expect from gear.  Actually, this would help the Knights more than the Warriors since they have a lot of good one hand weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Avoidance skills are checked before to hit check. Therefore assuming a to hit ratio of 50%, only half of those blows &quot;avoided&quot; with dodge/parry/riposte would have actually hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Empirical: cleric friend was grouped with a 65 pally in CoD; later, she and I (62 war) grouped for the same mobs there. I asked what his AC/HP had been while fighting, she said it was equivalent to mine (~1400 AC, 6800 HPs); but she swore that she had to heal him a *lot* more than I. <br />
<br />
Does this make sense given what we know about mitigation?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think she was just trying to make me feel bold and bulky - I think that pally should have been significantly less mana intensive to heal thx to the 3 levels he had on me, and equivalent AC/HPs.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />
