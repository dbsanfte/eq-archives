<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Atm im about 2470 ac unbuffed and 10860 hp unbuff, i tend to use 1 raw ac =5 hp. Thus due to the amount of good ac augs, i do not have many hp augs left, and about to change coal in raex boots to a 10 ac aug. Not sure if theres a point where i should change the ratio, atm im in a guild soon breaking to anguish. Any thoughts of this, if i should maybe focus more on hp or does the current ratio i use work ok for Anguish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its all about balance my man, Personally i have four 20 ac augs and one 30 ac augs, and i fill the other slots up with HP augs over 50.  Id use a 20 ac aug over a 50 hp aug though.  I sit at 2512 and 12500 ish.  My goals eventually are to be about 13k and 2800 ish, but we all believe different things so do what you feel is best, i think its about balance, but thats just my opinion.  Im not all hp augs and im not all ac augs hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding and avoidance man ...<br />
Injektilo is close to the cap so it isn't critical, but thundersam your life will be much better with 10% shielding more than with 50 more AC. I don't remember the ratio that Phamtron uses for shielding and avoidance but it was huge. Like 1%Shielding=50HP and 10avoidance=100HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : got it Phantron estimate here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=150130&amp;postcount=13) 1%shieding=40HP and 1 avoidance=20HP. so with your 1AC=5HP ratio we get 1%shielding=8AC and 1avoidance=4AC. moreover, as Injektilo said, you need balance (some shielding, some avoidance, some AC and some HP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed.  Balance is Key.   There was one magelo I saw with a warrior almost at 13k unbuffed hps.  The kicker? His AC was about 2200.  Hell, I am not at 9k unbuffed yet but I sit at 2k ac.  Tanks with a huge amount of hps and low ac will get eaten fast.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My estimates are done with the following assumptions:<br />
<br />
You get hit 50% of the time<br />
having 10 avoidance makes you get hit 1% less (i.e. 49% instead of 50%)<br />
You have 10K HP buffed (easier to calculate).<br />
A mob's DB is 1000 (which is actually common on ubers)<br />
You can take 4 hits before dying (because there would not be any point to tank anything if you can't).<br />
<br />
Now although DB = 1000 obviously doesn't apply to trash, but most ubers don't have any different min/max distribution compare to the average trash so the same estimation still applies.  For example a trash might have 1/5th the DB as an uber but you can probably take 5 times as many hits before dying as well.<br />
<br />
With these numbers you get 1% shielding = 40 HP, 1 avoidance = 20 HP.<br />
<br />
And both effect become more significant as you get more HPs and as you stack them.</div></div><hr />

Even though  they dont apply directly to anguish I think they have some good info. <br />
IMO ac &gt; hp til you reach the Ac cap that we dont know how high it is yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amadeuz</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">factor into this that the minis in Anguish drop 90 90 90 augs with killer effects (shielding, avoidance, stun resist, etc).  You will do these fellows every time you are in Anguish and they can be done with 3 group mini raids every 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanking the Msha with 1 grp or 2 is pretty fun, just be sure ya bring a bard !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naerron</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i was near 2550 AC unbuffed, then i started doing RS aug farming, i botted up a whole group and got all 8 augs, i gained near 540 HP, lost near 120 AC, but i am still over 2400 unbuffed, from what i hear after 2400 AC, its not really any thing to worry about.  i have a lot of AC augs though, and i have form of defence ring, and belt of tunare so that helps a lot, i would gladly give up my AC click for form of endurence though.<br />
<br />
anyway, the way  i see it, u got decent AC, prob make near 2600 buffed, but not sure if 40HP &lt; 10 ac, i surly would not give up 40hp for 10 ac. but to each his own.  besides i still got an earring with 15 ac and a belt with 25, so when upgrade those i can prob gain a pretty decent ammount of AC.</div></div><hr />
