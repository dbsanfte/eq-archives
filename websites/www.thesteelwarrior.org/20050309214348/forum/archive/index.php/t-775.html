I got it at work (air force base) so it looks mainly written for AF people but please read on as this time of the year safety is very important for all.<br />

KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. – If statistics hold true, 21 airmen will die this summer while “having fun.”<br />
<br />
According to officials at the Air Force Safety Center, the period between Memorial Day and Labor Day is a period of increased non duty-related injuries  due to increased activity and risk taking.<br />
<br />
“The ‘101 Critical Days of Summer’ safety campaign is to draw attention to increased safety awareness and risk management during this critical time,” said John Russell, the AFSC’s chief of ground safety.<br />
<br />
Russell said the elevated mishap rate is due to people taking advantage of summer weather to take part in sports and recreational activities and hit the road for vacation trips.<br />
<br />
Over the last five years, the Air Force has lost an average of 21 members during the summer period.  Of those off-duty fatalities, Russell said 70 percent are in the 18 to 25-year-old age group.<br />
<br />
“The most significant loss of life amongst Air Force members involves private motor vehicles,” he said.  “These are tragic and preventable mishaps.”<br />
<br />
Driving while impaired, speeding and fatigue were the leading contributing factors in the fatal motor vehicle mishaps, Russell said.<br />
<br />
Motorcycle mishaps accounted for about one-third of the Air Force’s fatal motor vehicle accidents.  According to Russell, lack of proficiency, speeding and impaired driving were the primary contributors to the fatal two-wheeled incidents.<br />
<br />
“Personal safety is the responsibility of each Air Force member, and risk management is a vital part of all activities,” Russell said.  “We must be constantly vigilant by analyzing risks, making smart decisions and reassessing risks during the activity.”<br />
<br />
Safety officials offer the following factors to consider when planning summer travel:<br />
<br />
·	Wear seatbelts.<br />
·	Remain alert while at the wheel.  Plan rest breaks at frequent intervals.<br />
·	Don’t speed in an effort to arrive early – it’s better to arrive late than not arrive at all.<br />
·	Don’t drink alcohol and drive.<br />
·	Anticipate the unexpected and be ready to react.<br />
<br />
More than anything else, Russell said, airmen and their families should use common sense during the summer months, paying particular attention to their surroundings, so that each and every one returns to their home station ready to support the Air Force mission.<br />
<br />
“People are our most valuable resource,” he said, “and we need all of them back safe and sound when that vacation comes to a close.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun this summer but be carefull friends!!! Your friend Gunrack.</div></div><hr />
