<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, here goes, I'm new to the boards but needing some help.  I started playing EQ when Kunark came out, but I ended up taking an extended EQ maternity leave a few months after Velious came out when I had my daughter.  I just came back last November.  Needless to say, the Treeweave, TBB, various crafted items, Yak, and CoT I had were laughable.  It hurts to think about how much I paid for them in NFP and how much they are all collectively worth now.  My main problem is that I after such a long break, I'm way behind when it comes to my knowledge base of the higher end armour, weps, MoBs, and even zones!<br />
<br />
My guild isn't an uber raiding guild.  However, we're doing a pretty successful job of growing and leveling ourselves to the point where we can try bigger and better MoBs.   However, I'm the 2nd highest warrior in the guild so I'm either the MT or the MA depending.  I've got semi decent gear now, but I am really needing to upgrade now that I'm almost 60.  I know the whole HP/AC mantra, but as a half elf I'm kind of deficient in a lot of other places as well, but I'm sexier than any darn oggie!!  My in game hubby is a cleric and he's pretty much focused in on sta and HP only upgrades for me, but I'm needing some advice from other warriors.  I know I need as much HP as I can get, but how much of the other stats should I sacrafice?<br />
<br />
On a side note, something y'all might find kind of amusing.  One thing that hasn't changed since I got back is the amount of time I spend waiting for a group, when my guild doesn't have something going on (but at least I'm not on the waiting list for SolB anymore).  When I finally got in a group, I couldn't understand why there seemed to be a certain amount of hesitancy when I, the warrior, take over the MT job. You see, warriors hadn't been totally and completely nerfed when I left.  After the group had been going for a while I would always get what I thought where these strange remarks about how good of a tank I was, and that they were suprised how well I held aggro.  Of course, now that I've been back for a while, I know why and come to HATE paladins.  However, I think it also speaks to how many e-bayed, PLed (insert your own adjectives here) warriors are out there that making thing harder on the rest of us.  Heck yes I'm a good tank and can keep aggro!!  I learned in full bronze/then crafted with a LoW/then nathsar greatsword for goodness sakes!!  If that doesn't teach ya, nothing will!!<br />
<br />
Also, feel free to check my magelo out and offer any specific suggestions.  Thank y'all in advance and I'll let y'all ponder my weps another time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some tips:<br />
<br />
You're pretty much in Ranja weapons right now. Grab some Troll made Yaks, or whatever fancy combo you want.<br />
<br />
The clicky stuff you should keep for crap buffs when mobs dispell too. <br />
<br />
Sell the Tempest Earrings and get Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement.....I think they're like +70 hp and some nice stats.<br />
<br />
Get some Skyshrine/Kael MQ's if you can. Nice armor there, or if you want to wait a few weeks, ornate armor should be dirt cheap VERY soon if it keeps dropping like it is now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As long as you remember that half elven warriors are inherently superior to all other races, you haven't forgotten much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the main factor is coin. those 2 bloodmetal earring you'll basically retire with but unless you got 70K to blow on them your tempest ears are fine ( bloodmetal ears sell for 30-35K on terris..'skeeter leg ears are cheaper ) <br />
<br />
but overall the only 2 gaping holes in your gear are the gloves and waist. definately get them thurg/ss gloves..or hell even looting a pair of silversilk gloves from kael will net a pile of hit points.<br />
for haste you can't really argue with the soulscream belt. same haste as the RBB, plus a bit better rounding of stats. nearly the same price if not cheaper since they seem to be dropping like rain.<br />
<br />
weapons...the reliable forstbringer will do nicely. move the Tae Ew sword to offhand, and sell the lightblade...<br />
<br />
from there you should be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You really aren't looking bad.  The only other thing I'd say would be some draconic paulderons if your guild is on dragon faction in velious.  Easy quest to do.  A Bracer of Benevolence wouldn' be bad if you are in WW and the scout is up.<br />
<br />
As far as stats you want, AC is most important or the most part.  It would be ok to sac some other stats for AC.  The balance between hp/ac are tough, but its really on a item to item basis.<br />
<br />
Once you get 60, I'd spend some time picking up AAs until you got ND3.  The increase in hp will do you some real good as you then level to 65.<br />
<br />
Welcome back and good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also barbed dragonscale booties would be better than cobalt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try to get HoT greaves too, you'll like the hp on those as well as the stats.  Your racial greaves won't do you wrong either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Carrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm well i would try and go to HOT and get some armor there pretty nice. for your waist i would try and get a RBG better haste and has some nice stats i would ry and get a new cloak best bet would be to try and nab one of these (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18979) real nice and the server im on not to pricy. over all your better than i was at 59 gl<br />
<br />
<br />
ohh incase you need a guide to HOT theres a nice one here (http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=168) <br />
<br />
once again i wish you good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is time for you to hit HoT and start farming plate, silk, chain &amp; leather drops for you and possibly you're guild.  I would highly recommend that since you are the MA/MT that you and you're other tank hitch a ride with another more experienced guild to get a feel for it before you drag you're guild there.  You will need to work you're Claws of Veshan Faction to Non-Kos before heading there.  Someone posted a nice guide to HoT above.  Going there unprepaired can be a disheartening experience.<br />
<br />
HoT = Myrmidon Armor (Ally CoV faction for SS turn ins)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=myrmidon<br />
<br />
Or level up to 62 and start hitting Bastion of Thunder(PoP) and hope for some Ornate armor drops.  That stuff is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I were you I'd make getting better haste a priority.  Other than that, just look for ac/hp upgrades and keep an eye out for an aggro-proccing weapon or two.<br />
<br />
The hooded black cloak is a classic :)  almost never see those anymore, but even by today's standards it's a decent cloak.  Stands up to today's gear better than almost any old world item short of dragon loot hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh yea there is also a few very nice quests out of HoT for very nice Haste items that you will be hard pressed to upgrade down the road.  If/when you take you're guild there you can make collecting these pieces a collective effort making the quest a cakewalk.</div></div><hr />
