PS. seriously, someone asked me for the poem and another for what song it is. I dont have sound here at work so I dont have the slightest idea what song is being played.</div></div><hr />

Now if you're truthfully wanting to know what song that is, it's &quot;Say it&quot; by the Kumbia Kings.<br />
