<br />
<br />
Anger I<br />
Anger II<br />
Anger III<br />
Strike of ykesha<br />
Force of ykesha<br />
Vampire Kiss<br />
Rujarkian Bile<br />

Thanks guys! I need to pick out two to aim for augging Velium Gemmed weapons.</div></div><hr />

Anger I ~ Vampire Kiss ~ Rujarkian Bile (aka not much aggro)<br />
Anger II ~ SoY ~ FoY<br />
Anger III<br />
EB (not buyable)<br />
Anger (not buyable)<br />
<br />
Theres a lot of debate on this board atm though, see the spirit of rage and 'Anger III blows?&quot; threads. Unless you have points to burn, the cheap ykesha augs are generally considered to be really good aggro for the cost.</div></div><hr />

So Anger II vs SoY I might as well go with SoY because i get 100 damage in the deal as well?<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Plus, the debate is whether ykesha is better than anger III, virtually no-one contests that it's at least as good as Anger II if not better, and you get free casting interrupts on &lt;level 55 mobs and a dd.</div></div><hr />

Hrm I read a thread the other day where people said that if the Ykesha stun and dd were resisted that very little aggro was generated. Is this true?</div></div><hr />

No, even if resisted a stun will give you aggro.  But don't put aug's on velium gemmed weapons, aug the droga pair she was swinging, and you'll have way more aggro.<br />

Anger2 = 400 aggro<br />
Snare proc= 300-400 (semi-unknown)<br />
Slow proc= 300-400 (ie willsapper ... semi-unknown)<br />
Debuff= 300-400 aggro (no one really knows .. depends on debuff)<br />
Taunting blow= 450 aggro<br />
100dd yak ~ 450 aggro (semi-unknown)<br />
125dd yak ~ 460-470 aggro? (semi-unknown)<br />

I group with a lot of pet classes and they hate the Ykesha push.  The push screws up pet positioning and kills dps worse then the agro gained over Anger 2 or (possibly) Anger 3.  (i.e.;  they would rather wait a few seconds before nuking and not have to worry about repositioning the pets due to push - or having the pets lose the back until I reposition the mob due to push)</div></div><hr />

Heh true that ... when i have my double stun-gun loaded i can generally push a mob the way i'm looking with 2-3 melees pushing on it's ass ... it can be annoying as hell but mostly i just find it funny.  <br />
<br />
I cringe to think of the push on double stun/KB weapons + 2 yaks.</div></div><hr />

so CHoS and SotBS with 2 ykesha augs might be a bit much?</div></div><hr />

It'll be a lot of push ... but it will be good aggro and a nice perk to your DPS (especially with I3).</div></div><hr />

Is there some formula to figure out how many AP you get per adventure? Trying to figure out the time expenditure to grab two ykesha augs.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
depends on your level and the difficulty setting of the adventure.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I know that. Thats why I was asking if there was a formula :). IE Avg level * something * difficulty mod</div></div><hr />

Seems like there was a post a while back from someone who bought the wrong anger II aug &amp; had an unfortunate &quot;D'oh!&quot; moment.</div></div><hr />
