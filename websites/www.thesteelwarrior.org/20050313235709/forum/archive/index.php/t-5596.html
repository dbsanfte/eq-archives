<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going into time, Were finally time flagged after 3 sessions of camping Coirnav 24+ hours in advance =D im the highest DKP warrior in my guild. ATM im 9900 hps buffed 2100ish AC. I have enough points for any normal 4-5 items or enough for 3 exceptional like DBoTWL + EP BP and quarm loot. I have a BoW which is ok but I want the HP / AC boost + agro ill get from 1hers.<br />
<br />
My worst items by far are - <br />
ear (ear symbol of the veteran 85hps)<br />
Mask ( Crys’Va Mask 90hps )<br />
Rings ( both 100hps )<br />
<br />
 Everything else is ok for now, being a bidding DKP guild stuff is going to go for tons of first couple clearings but I have enough of a margin to get at least DBoTWL and another item. What did you guys go for in priority in time ? Should I play it safe and hold out for Time BP and DBoTWL ? or should I just say Fug it and go for slots I need most ? I have waited this long and really feel like I should get DBoTWL and BP first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well ur lucky.<br />
phase1 has a nice ring and earring too. they drop very very often (phase1 = 5 x loots, out of a loottable of 5 items,  fast respawn) <br />
A nice and easy to obtain mask is faceguard of frenzy, 60ac 170hp etc of the phase3 boss.<br />
<br />
Depending on ur haste item, you could also go for EArring of corporeal essence off TT: 25ac 180hp and haste + atk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not expert in time since we've only been there for a few weeks giving a serious run, but what i've noticed is holding out for that one kick ass item could lead to you not getting anything. hehe<br />
<br />
Drops are streaky.  our first 3 saryrn kills, we got 4 or 5 girdles of intense durability. then the last couple of kills, nothing and i had finally moved haste to make room for the belt. no DBotW in 2 kills and no BP's<br />
<br />
I don't see your magelo, but if you are just breaking into time, you will be learning the trials and you can get a couple of quick upgrades for ear and finger and by the time you get to the good stuff, you should have your DKP back since most that loot will start to rot.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, i wouldn't save all your DKP just for a darkblade and BP because it could be a while before one drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well im making all p1 loot open lotto at a low set point amount , the rest auctions. I wont end up bidding on anything other than RZ items until we clear time once because too many will go nuts bidding high first clearings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Waiting for Rz before goin in for stuff is a horrible idea. It could take weeks (depending on how much learning time per spawn you get) to get tier 4 down before you break into tier 5, and even then you have to deal with one stingy ass Rz and his drops.<br />
<br />
There are loads and loads of great items and upgrades that will be dropping as you learn tier 1-4 and get the strats down. Passing on all that loot for the hopes of a great item &quot;one day&quot; is a huge mistake.</div></div><hr />

I waited until phase 5 to loot my first thing from time because it wasn't a big deal if I did.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you don't want to wait too long, these earlier tier items will cover your slots pretty well:<br />
<br />
This is off terris:<br />
earring of corporeal essence<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 3:<br />
faceguard of frenzy<br />
<br />
tallon zek:<br />
band of prismatic focus</div></div><hr />

<br />
also a worthwhile earring upgrade in addition to the items mentioned above depending on how you want to go about replacing current haste items.  phase 3 drop off avatar of elements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your guild progresses slowly through Time, holding out for gear isn't going to do you any good. Most guilds get stuck on VZ/TZ for a while.  You should have a good 4 or 5 Tier 1-3.5 clearings before you beat the twins, maybe more if they give you a hard time. Without seeing your magelo it is tough to say what Tier 1-3+Saryrn/Terris items are worthwhile for you to get. Since you are lottoing tier 1 loot, that should take care of 1 ring and earring for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bohkah</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a p3 Ear, or TT ear.  Do you have an orb or sky, or aten gloves?  If you don't then I would pick up a Symbol of the Planesmaster (75dd 0.0stun/65) off Saryrn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kakgumu</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i were in your position, and i was about 3 months ago, i wouldn't &quot;hold out&quot; for THE best loot in Time.  Identify your weakest areas (you have) and come up with a plan to address those needs.  If you don't have any direct competition (i.e. same day Euro guilds etc.) you'll be able to pull phase 1 loot easily after a couple weeks.  Additionally, there are some very respectable P2 and P3 loot before you even see a PoTime god.  So my advice, plan at least 1 intermediate equipment step before you get your &quot;end-game&quot; item from the late phases of Time.<br />
<br />
Kak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From phase 3 and 4, I'd recommend get Faceguard of Frenzy, Girdle of Intense Durability, Edge of Eternity, Earring of Corporeal Essence, and Armguard of the Brute.  Could skip belt if it's not your weak slot.  You'll lose a lot of attack with this combo though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the gauntlets that drop in phase 2 are also not bad . they are a lateral upgrade to ele, but if your short on CHA worth looking into.<br />
better resists too IIRC.<br />
<br />
the other good phase 3 loot worth considering is the 30 ac cloak of wishes - i took it for CHA boost.<br />
<br />
or if you want AC go for the 50 ac fiery cystal guard.<br />
<br />
dont hold your breath for RZ loot especially stuff like dbotw, we're 0/6 so far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fiery Crystal Guard is better for warrior than Cloak of Wishes.  Cha isn't really a problem once you start getting into Time, and there's always the +6 cha augments to help you out from LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">look for end game items..dont waste loot on fiery crystal guards and shit like that.  What you wanna look at are things such as the following.<br />
<br />
tier 1 and 2..nothing other than maybe tier 1 neck and ring if they are cheap..easy to upgrade a shitty item and gives you a solid slot...tier 1 loot doesnt count for our guild so.  Tier 2 sucks for warrior loot dont waste your time.<br />
<br />
Tier 3<br />
Faceguard of frenzy...70 ac with ldon aug on it..very much worth it and very comparable to rz mask<br />
<br />
Terris<br />
Earing of corpreal essense..only 2 haste items in time for plate classes and this is one.<br />
<br />
Saryrn<br />
Girdle of intense durability...53 ac with ldon aug and 15 pt self ds click that lasts for an hour..thats a fuckload of dps when tanking regardless of what others say.  I parse just over 400 dps with mage ds, warsong of zek, and veeshan on for rallos.  With belt i hit about 425.<br />
<br />
Tallon<br />
Nothing dont waste your time on the ring unless you arnt a main tank and wont get rz or quarm ring.  However the effect is nice if you struggle with aggro..id say a moderate ring at best.<br />
<br />
Vallon<br />
Helmet of flowing time...the other haste time loot for plate, unless you wasted a loot on elem helm get this.<br />
<br />
Globe or mystical protection<br />
The best warrior item by far up to this point.  The stats dont seem lik emuch but avoidance 10 is god.  Thisis the primary item you want.</div></div><hr />

avatar of elements drops a haste helm warrior usable but it's only 27ac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are thinking of cap of flowing time? that drops off of saryrn and not worth the ac hit imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Globe of Mythical Protection is good but if you're a warrior without a right click stun proc item then you have to get Symbol of Planemasters since the aggro boost it gives is signficant, and then it wouldn't make sense to get a 2nd range item just for the 10 avoidance unless you're just overflowing with DKP (or whatever system your guild does for items).<br />
<br />
There are Coif and Cap of Flowing Time but you're really shortchanging yourself to get one of those instead of the Helm of Flowing Time, unless you don't plan on tanking.  Even then Earring of Corporeal Essence is a solid choice for earring and covers the haste slot as well.  If you can have any loot in the world you want I'd probably do Quarm earring + Corporeal Essence (the earring with resists don't stack with Quarm ring I think).</div></div><hr />
