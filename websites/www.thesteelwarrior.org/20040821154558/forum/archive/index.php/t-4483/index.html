<br />
It's on char create but grayed out on the Test Server. Its also in several of the files. <br />
<br />
It looks like we are going to have a new EQ class <br />
<br />
look under beastlords section on the screen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wtf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>binke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">God ... I have this horrable feeling if it is a new class... its going to replace us...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe I'm nuts, but I like tanking. I like being the focus of a mobs attention and keeping the mob on me (hah!) somehow while my groups dishes out as much punishment as they can. Doing damage is all well and fine, but I'd much rather be in a mobs face than any where else. Guess that's why I'm a warrior and not a rogue, etc. I don't know what this new &quot;berserker&quot; class is about but I'm sure we have nothing to worry about being replaced by them, or &quot;changed into&quot; them. If I'm not mistaken they won't even be a plate class...<br />
<br />
It's probably just a new class coming out with the next expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">New melee class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It might be another pure melee DPS class.  Doubt it will be another plate tank class.  But the way Itemization is in EQ, this class might be able to tank while possesing monk-like DPS.  Maybe a specialist with swords(2handers) and chances are they will be able to use all Warrior swords , just like  Beastlords can use monk weapons. <br />
<br />
Its too early to tell. But doubt its another hybrid. Last class to be introduced was a hybrid. Seems logical to introduce a pure melee one now.<br />
<br />
Oh and since they are berserkers. They might be in permanent  berserk frenzy like warriors. In other words, doing Crippling blows instead of critical hits from the start.  And  most likely every other class will be able to buy Crippling blows with AA. The Berserker of course having a higher frequency at doing them(Same thing that happened to warriors when everyone got Critical hits AA).  <br />
<br />
Pure speculation. In MUDs melee had critical, crippling, obliterating hits and so on as they reached higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still do not understand what 'new' niche in a group they expect this class to fill?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Berserker is a chain/leather class melee, so don't jump to conclusions and automatically assume its a class to replace us. It basically will be coming out march/april with the new expansion 'The Gates of Discord'. As far as I can see it will be a dps class, and won't be considered a tank class as such, seeing as your typical berserker takes a large hit damage wise from mythology.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">According to mythology they are immune to pain, and channel the spirits of animals ( some say shape shift ) to empower their combat prowess to fight until they are slain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yesod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Looks like this class is pure DPS... Burts and Sudden DPS and his aa/disc would make him a mean slicing killing machine. I'd say par with rogues dps, escept they can deal as much dps as a rogue while facing a mob or behind it.. etc..etc.. But yes, by mythodolgy of this class, most prolly he be very fragile. Hell, another DPS melee like a rogue would be neat, not limited to fighting in the back or backstabbing, I hope this class will have some kick ass moves and discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What mythology are you guys referring too where they can't take a hit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What's funny is that they can't even balance the classes they have right now.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Redcloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not lile all angle dps wasn't supposed to be the role of monks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Berserkers in mythology built themselves into such a frenzy that they didn't need armour, they shrugged off blows that'd fell an ordinary man. Course they'd also tend to keel over and die after the Beserk wore off but that hardly seems like a profitable path to follow with a persistant character. Still, maybe it'd add extra incentive to have a cleric in group for the rezzes after each mob :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shilandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Id welcome another pure Melee DPS class , more choice when forming Melee based XP groups :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My guess is the class is just another melee... but heavy on the new Melee change ideas coming out... <br />
<br />
I wouldnt be surprised one bit.. if they actually thought up of a new class, thought up of a new fighting system for that class...<br />
and then copy/pasted it onto the current melees to fix them.<br />
Instead of addressing melees directly.<br />
<br />
I'm still excited though :D<br />
I won't pla yit or anything... but I'm damn curious about what it is and how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Do we really need another melee class with how out of whack the current ones are?  Dunno.  Sounds cool though.  I like the thought of a Berserker.  Pure, melee, death machine!  I might just play one P.  I can see it as a chain wearing (kind of like DAoC), class that can go heavy on damage, and take heavy damage, in spurts, but needs mega healing at times to stay alive.  <br />
<br />
Berserkers were a class of Norse warriors (Viking I believe), who wore no/little armor, and worked themselves into such a frenzy as to become killing machines.  They didn't care about being hit, just about killing as many of the enemy as possible.  Today we don't know how they got into their frenzy, most likely alchohol, or some type of drug, was invovled.  Doesn't seem like a profession that lends itself to long life though heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Berserker. Pure, melee, death machine! <br />
umm and Rogue is?? oh yes a corpse drager as thats what we end up doing mosta the time, when we can get people to pay attention and bloody consent. hell &quot;add consent&quot; key to raid function (like looter option) would of been a easy adition. but i digress pfft.<br />
<br />
we dont need another pure melee class, and if its anything like the introduction of Beastlords, the new Berserker will have the Hp of a warrior, the mitigation/ avoidance of a pre nerfed monk and the damage output of a rogue but given burst damage, oh and throw in some bard like war chants to make them more group friendly. jeez wtg guys.<br />
<br />
sort out what you have, we dont need or want another pure melee. even if its just another melee dps class ffs isnt there enough classes trying to get those spots in groups after you have healer/slower/tank ?:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jynn Tlespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Also, berserkers were outlawed by their own king after he used them to attain his goals.  They were often depicted without armor and in the skins of animals, giving them an even more feral quality.  One of the problems was in a berserker state they might kill anything close to them.  Several were punished after going into a berserker state and killing their families before coming to their senses again.<br />
<br />
Regardless, coorelation to history and the fantasy games is vague at the best.  Once again, I would look at DAoC to get a guess at what they might be.  Something else to think about.</div></div><hr />

Lose aggro while doing the same? I don't know how this class is going to be designed, but I know I get killed on raids if I don't turn off attack... alot. Picture a rogue not evading while pumping out their DPS at melee range. Picture them going splat. This is all pure speculation based off of the class title, naturally. Berserker doesn't sound like a class type that would have any aggro removal skills.<br />
<br />
  Personally, I'm curious about their melee skills and armor type. What kind of weapons will we see them wielding? Will they dual wield? How well will they function without weapons? Is their damage be mostly based off of a long reset disc? Will they have taunt? Will they have something to lower their aggro? How well will they solo? What races can be Berserkers? How will their defensive skills be?</div></div><hr />

And beastlords didn't sound like a class type that would have mana regeneration spells either.<br />
<br />
:-(<br />
<br />
Enough Beserkers die on enough raids, and I'm sure they'll get something, ala JOLT, to deal with aggro issues. Even Rangers don't die like the used to.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong ... The class sounds interesting. But it also sounds like over-crowding an already tightly packed, narrowly focused niche that pure melees currently fill.</div></div><hr />

I'll wait until it's out to laugh at it, but I dopn't see why another melee class is being put into the game. We've always taken more from the table then we bring to it, why add another taker, when you could make another giver? Rogue/Wizard hybrid plz~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think it would be neat if they took their health and applied it to dmg given.  Kinda like a shaman takes hitpoints to mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Only 2 classes can be monks, and humans are one of them. Size doesn't matter for a DPS role, only the amount and style it's done matters. If they're a DPS class without backstab, then most likely this will be competitive with monks. If they're a tanking class, then they'll most likely be in competition with us. If they're both, and competitive with both, then fuck Sony right in the ear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">&quot;Cept the human cant remember what they are ..&quot;<br />
<br />
Only one of TWO races that can even be a monk. Only the FIRST race to even be able to choose monk, back in the days before iksars existed.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
I don't see what race has to do with the worries though. I mean, high elves can't be WARRIORS, but the paladin class certainly does have issues with the warrior class.<br />

They should be extremely useful against boss mobs to do damage, but not capable of sustaining the kind of damage over longer periods.<br />

Warriors and other melee have reportedly been on the minds of Sony for a while now, and for a long while Warriors have been screaming to be updated. It's actually a bit of a slap in Warriors' faces to introduce a class, now, that will eat up Sony's time and attention on melee issues, degrade the usefulness of Warriors by introducing another competitor in the tank market, and possibly end up overpowered enough to usurp Warrior tanking altogether. Sony's last class creation, the Beastlord, has not managed to step on many toes (barely skirting Monk (DPS), Shaman (Slow), Mage (Pet), and Rogue (DPS) retribution while being a combination of too much of each class, all in one), but is inherently a far more powerful and versatile class than others. If the Beserker is created similarly overpowered, being so closely related to Warriors while Warriors beg for an upgrade, there will no doubt be rioting, probably justifiably. <br />
<br />
notice how when VanCouvering put you off the stand down he didn't mention a new melee class in the works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">All we can do is wait and see what the class is really about. <br />
<br />
But it will definetively be a new pure melee DPS class.  The only thing I dont like is that Warriors always been the ones going through Berserker Frenzy. Thats how we get our crippling blows. The last uniqe thing no other class had. Criticals used to be Warrior only until they were passed to all melee though AA's <br />
<br />
Berserker might not be a tank class. But it will be DPS class on par with Monks or Rogues. I am thinking it will be more akin to monks than rogues though.  <br />
<br />
They could have used another name for the class and called it a Samurai. A monk specialized in blades. Thats pretty much what I believe the berserker will be.  But more primal and savage. Light armor, Cripling blows, headbutts, Flurries, enrage(like the NPC ones) etc. <br />
<br />
The good news though is that it seems monk will be getting very cool AAs for next expansion. Lot of Kung Fu stuff. The 100 fists AA sounds like one monks been requesting for a while. Their version of Flurry and improved FD(hopefully will work like bard fading memories)<br />
<br />
So SoE's plan is to have 3 pure melee DPS classes. Just like there are 3 tank classes(though 2 are hybrid).  <br />
<br />
Where does this leave rangers?  If they make it as strong as rogue class, they will get on rogue toes and screw monks. <br />
<br />
And what about Rangers then?<br />
<br />
Berserkers is a class I would play though. Its the pissed off warrior I always wanted to play(that or a samurai:P)<br />
<br />
With the way SoE does itemization, Berserkers will be able to tank  just like a monk can. I am assuming Berserkers will have crappy avoidance though, since they pretty much just loose control and hack away with abandon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">What 100 fists AA? Monks already have a 100 fists disc. They just moved a lot of the discs into the spell data file to make them work with the upcoming endurance bar. You sure that isn't what you are seeing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought it could have been their versioin of flurry. I recall back then before PoP would come out the sugested AA's monk wanted and 100 fists(or 1000 fists) was among theirs to represent Flurry. :P</div></div><hr />

This class  has the potential to infringe on both of the weakest classes right now. If not the warrior class, then definately the monk class.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this class was available at creation I would have definately chosen it though, I have always been a Beserker at heart over a warrior, and found it a pity it was never included in this game.<br />

Time will tell I guess...</div></div><hr />

Agree.<br />
<br />
I play my warrior BECAUSE my monk isn't enough like a warrior. I play my monk BECAUSE my warrior isn't enough like a monk.<br />
<br />
But really, at this stage in the game ... it's just playing with fire to infringe on the two classes that already have the narrowest, most marginalized roles in the game.</div></div><hr />

I'da picked a Berserker too ... and I may yet.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to see a class tied to it's Endurance pool, who can &quot;Freak out&quot;, do massive melee DPS, and then needs to rest (movement slow, mebbe ... it wouldn't be hideously hard to balance the class).  Do middlin' melee damage when not in &quot;Berskerk&quot; mode.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it eats spots filled by monks, rogues, and warriors like me who fill a DPS niche when no &quot;DPS class&quot; is available.<br />
<br />
Waiting to see ... it's also hard to judge what impact the upcoming melee changes will bring, and I have no doubt at all that this class will be welded and formed for these changes more tightly than any existing melee class, when the changes and class are both rolled out.  ATM - - I'm more concerned about Endurance regen for melees ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Is that a dwarven beserker with really really bright red hair ... OR a dwarven beserker with orange hair that also happens to be on fire?<br />
<br />
Like a particle effect?<br />

:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Calas Dragynson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">yeah , barbarians in DnD have MORE hp han warriors but almost no ac , they can take huge hits via tons of HP , they are less skilled than warriors. Depending on brute strength and rage to deal out huge ammounts of damage, generally considered very hard to stop but easy to hit and almost useless after the battle, due to extreme exhaustion. As for the channeling of animal spirits to enhance them , that was ussually the motif of the shaman. But it sounds interesting, I will likely check it out.</div></div><hr />

Cats, lizards, ogres and trolls are large races. Lizards aka Iksar are medium-sized, not large.</div></div><hr />

I just wanna play a Dwarven Beserker with Flaming Orange Hair! I wish they had put in Dwarven Berserkers!  There's even precedent for such a thing, if you are familiar with R. A. Salvatore's Drizzt books and know who Thibbledorf Pwent is.  He's a dwarven battlerager who shrugs off pain and does damage by grappling his foes and poking them with his spiked armor.</div></div><hr />

Guild started a rumour thread ... this got posted t'other day:<br />
<br />
New class Scout: <br />
Scout will be a mix between rogue, warrior and ranger, he will have a special attack like a rogue called &quot;ambush&quot; where for one round of melee he has the ability to assasinate green con mobs this is tied with an innate sneak ability, they wont have hide sneak like a rogue but they have an innate ability to sneak almost anywhere w/o giving away thier position. I didn't get a feeling how this differs from hide sneak, i expect that the can not be heard but seen? maybe a rogue can understand the difference better then I do. This ability will increase with level and like rogue hide sneak until level 60 it will force them to move at a slower rate. <br />
<br />
He will be a master of bows and weapons but not to the degree of either parent class, he can also self port to any druid portal no evac ability. He will have the ability to use low ranger spells and cast the lower ranger atk buffs. Sow at level 30. Single attack with ability to kick, will be a chain class(this is still undecided, possibly leather class). Will have HPs slightly higher then a ranger(why higher hps, seems it should be lower), about 2000 (2000 naked hps!) non equipped at level 75 w/ no aa. they will have ability to taunt but cap will be 200 or lower. <br />
<br />
Scouts can be all current ranger classes plus vah shir.<br />
<br />
Only other references I can find to a Scout class in EQ are EQII rumours tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">that is bullshit, lets replace warriors rangers and rogues with fucking hybrids all togeather! <br />
<br />
fucktards that come up with new classes are pissing me off(i mean the real ones)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">&quot;Sow at level 30.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isn't that the same level Rangers get the spell?<br />
<br />
And beastlords?<br />
<br />
The whole description seems odd.</div></div><hr />

Guttbuster brigade! Hoooo!<br />
<br />
<br />
The average dwarf in fantasy settings is usually a warrior-type that loves to drink ale. They were a perfect choice for the berserker class.  <br />
<br />
Dunno why they were left out. They can still include them though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Love those guys, their leader once told one of the members of the brigade to tie a rope around his leg and to swing him like a Gigantic morningstar to hit the enemies =) HAHA</div></div><hr />
