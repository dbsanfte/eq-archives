Many logs have shown that at 65 with max skill taunting blue cons, it succeeds about 60% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Cha will become very important to you once you start using DI often =p<br />
<br />
(for those who don't know, DI = Divine Intervention.  It's a short lasting buff that costs 2 emeralds, but has a chance of healing you when you get below 15%.  Whether the heal happens, and if it's partial or full depends on the cha of the person who has the buff on them.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magumas</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I thought the same thing as when you were knocked out....<br />
<br />
Btw checked my log and it appears that my taunt success is about 60%.   I normally never pay to close attention to my taunt messages,  it becomes such an automatic hot key that I hit 50 thousand times a night, but for some reason it caught my eye one day and was noticing alot of failures.. So I thought maybe I missed a recent patch message concerning taunting relative to a particular stat.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the reply's</div></div><hr />
