Description is one thing, experience another...but unfortunately, I didn't get an invite to test.  Anyone out there actually play on test?</div></div><hr />

50% chance that the server is up.</div></div><hr />

 I will add more info as I get it, the test pvp server keeps crashing. This is all of course subject to change at any time since its on test.<br />
<br />
(Note: this is Enderwere posting, it won't let me load that character because Tichondrius is down apparently.)<br />
<br />
1) Thunderclap is pretty nice now at level 60. Its 30 second duration so lasts the entire fight. Its base damage is I believe 108 but its modified by AC so it does less than that, it was hitting the mobs I fought for low 60's but since I was fighting groups of 3 the 30 second duration made it worth it. The real test is going to be whether or not it works on raid mobs.<br />
<br />
2) Heroic Strike rank 8 was listed at 138 damage, still sounds anemic.<br />
<br />
3) Battle Shout reduced to 10 rage, thank you blizzard.<br />
<br />
4) I didn't get to test long before servers crashed but I was not missing much at all against the lvl 56/57 mobs I was fighting. The fights ended with about the same health as they used to though, the changes didn't seem to make a large difference. This is from a small sample size of testing though.<br />
<br />
5) The first thorium mine i hit had an arcane crystal, not sure what that says about mining but it pissed me off~.<br />
<br />
6) Blood rage did around 330 dmg to me when I had just under 4700 hps unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike improvement wasn't really impressive  :( (will take a while before I use that skill ever again)<br />
No words on the rage issue yet, but overall nothing that will balance warriors imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be curious if Execute is in fact fixed.  I've died more than once when I got an add and Sweeping striked my way till the target mob was below 20%, only to have execute miss, I'm OOR, and end up dieing where as I'd likely lived had execute chopped the first mob down.  This seems to be worse when mobs Dot me to prevent me from Intimidating shout/bandage on teh second mob (if I need to).<br />
<br />
Overall though, so far, the posts I've seen mirror the one above.  Noone is really impressed with the chagnes.  I said it on Blizzards boards ... nothing in this is game changing for us, though the bug fixes are welcome help.  <br />
<br />
Atleast now we can maybe actually start balancing.  Before we had enough bugs that blizzard &quot;said&quot; were the root of our problem, that anything we did to test claims such as the High miss rate problem were immediately met with &quot;no your seeing dodges/block's/parry's&quot; from blizzard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthax</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thunderclap with a 30 second duration.  If they give it good aggro generation then I wouldn't care if it didnt do any damage at all.<br />
<br />
Reduced cost on Battle shout sounds great also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am happy for reduced Battle Shout alone. this is gonna make a noticeable difference for me in all areas of the game and will hopefully motivate more warriors to use it all the time. being able to hit the grp with Battle Shout at the start = more dps for group = more aggro for me, plus I'll have 10 rage that I didn't have before to spend on a Shield Block, a Shield Bash, a Revenge, a Demo Shout, etc. good times.</div></div><hr />
