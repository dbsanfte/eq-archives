I'm a level 26 NE MS/Arms 2h warrior, my mount is coming in 14 lvls and I'm sitting at only about 1gold constantly.  I buy from the auction house as much as I can every level (once professions and class skills are purchased), and I thought, maybe I'm buying too often from the AH.  So I was wondering how often everyone else bought armor, a new weapon, and rings from the auction house?  Also does anyone remember any quests that gave great weapon/mail/ring rewards?  When did you start saving for your mount??  My personal favorites are the Chaussus of Westfall from VC, they've lasted me almost 9 lvls.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodmane</div><div class="date">03-18-2005, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alot of great gear for your lvl can be picked up in gnomeregan either from quest rewards or boss drops graba couple lvl 30ish friends if your lucky a lvl 40+ will be generous and run you thru. There is a good 2h Mace from a mini boss http://thottbot.com/?i=3958 Manual Crowd Pummeler Drops very often. <br />
The electrocutioner leg is a common dropped 1 hand sword that should last u thru til SM. The leggings off thermaplugg quest are great AC. Also Thermaplugg drops a decent shield for that lvl of play. If you don't already I suggest Blacksmithing, the items you can craft at medium skill &quot;Green Iron&quot; will hold up great until lvl 40 plate. Mining as your alternate profession will support your blacksmithing needs entirely as well as supply a solid source of funds if you sell bars in AH. 1-65 skill easy in Loch Modan 65-125+ in Wetlands just south of Loch Modan. There is a lvl 20ish Spider Cave that has tons of deposits Tin/Incendicite &lt;--- quest ore that spawns very fast to get skill ups on. Raptor Cave in North Wetlands has 5 or so deposits that respawn every couple minutes not to mention decent grinding exp and a few chest spots &lt;--- lvl 28-31. Alterac Mountain Crushridge Ogres at lvl 33-38 great exp grind spot and tons of Ore locations in a close radius. <br />
<br />
Use the AH for Ring/Neck/Cloak if you can't seem to find one. Otherwise the gear I listed above will hold you thru til lvl 40 easy. With the exceptiong of Green Iron Hauberk you can gather the rest easy or very cheap. Always put a buyout on stuff you sell.  Break up stacks of Bars into 5 most people dont need a full stack and will pay a little bit more then 1/4 the normal price of a stack to save the extra cash. I usually sell 5 Iron 55-65s 5 Mithril 1.3-1.6g remember to up your min bid so you don't waste the sale if you only get one bid when the time is short. Don't put the sale up for 24 hours unless it's a Rare item 8 Hours is usually enough and doesn't cost as much. Never put items up on Tuesday morning or Very late at night since very few people will browse at those times or are unable to log in due to maintenance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togr</div><div class="date">03-21-2005, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly at that level my strategy was the upgrade as rarely as possible.  I would wait until I was certain that the lack of recent gear was holding me back.<br />
<br />
Once I asserted that fact, I would then upgrade a few items, those being the ones with the largest gain for the smallest coinage.<br />
<br />
As a rogue my weapons were typically the most common item I upgraded, but since I solo I still had a serious need for armor since I typically fight mobs 3 lvls higher.<br />
<br />
By upgrading following those rules, I had 75 gold by the time I hit 40 (at lvl 33 I had 2 gold left after upgrading one weapon that I am still using).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the rogue, better to fight things 1-2 levels below you then grind on +3's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">03-23-2005, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you upgraded chausses of westfall at 26, you've spent WAY too much money/time at the AH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-01-2005, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, if you do the quests, and choose your rewards carefully, you won't need to buy much in the AH. As per Togr, I didn't spend much time there until I was 45+, already had my mount, and my leveling pace slowed a bit, thus I wasn't outgrowing my gear as fast.</div></div><hr />
