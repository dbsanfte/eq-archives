<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vergil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read (with great interest!) the posts about parses of AC changes versus damage taken, but it seems that they are all high-end AC (1600+) and high-end (elemental) mobs.<br />
<br />
Has anybody parsed the effects of varying levels of more moderate AC on the midlevel tiers of POP mobs?  I am very curious to see if there is evidence that increasing your AC shows a reasonable (noticable?) improvement in defensive ability for those of us that aren't in the high-end game.<br />
<br />
I am currently sitting around 1420 AC (buffed) at level 64, and wondering if I should continue to work on AC, or if I have reached the point of diminishng returns?  Maybe I should be focusing more on HP?  I am not the main tank for my guild, but I do tank in most of my experience groups.<br />
<br />
My apologies if I missed any posts in my attempts to search - 'AC' (and AC*) are tough to focus a search on when you have a 4 character minimum search criteria.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fvighlander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1420 buffed is a nice place to be for exp mobs and pre-PoP tanking. However, I wouldn't say you're a &quot;point of diminishing returns&quot; by any means. Gaining more AC is always a good thing at this point, just go with a balance you're happy with of ac vs hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vergil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, Fvigh, but I'm not looking for opinions - I'm lookin for data.<br />
:)<br />

Maybe I should just get off my arse and do some parsing - I can only go as high as ~1420ish, but I could bring it DOWN a bit form there and get some data points.</div></div><hr />
