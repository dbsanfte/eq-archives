<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cuz' we're doing HoT, and I tell my guild to push the stupid wurms into the firepot. Now the rangers and mages are complaining because they can't land their arrows or bolts.<br />
<br />
Why's that and what can I do so that they can use their bows and bolts?<br />
<br />
Use the wall instead of the corner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Something about the geometry of something something something colliding or something.<br />
<br />
Using a wall or floating them in the middle of the pathway would alleviate those problems, but I hope your melees know how to control there push and don't need to be told RIGHT RIGHT NO NOW LEFT WAIT BACK TO RIGHT NOW BEHIND NOW TO RIGHT NO NO LEFT I MEAN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're fighting in the entry room to HoT and pulling the 2 wurms there up onto the platform, there's really nothing you can do about it..  The mob is going to end up pinned against the wall regardless of how you push it because the zone geometry up on that platform sucks.  <br />
<br />
If you jump down into the center and corner pin the mobs in the NE corner you can keep the mob's back available and still let your priests/casters hide from the AE's behind the pillars near the drop off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">tell them to shut up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ChrisDaTank</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah...what Gallerus said.  I to am having this battle with rangers and mages in my guild.  I just tell the rangers to swing that damn epic we spent a month on and the mages to just shuddup and use a different spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can keep the mobs in the middle and to one side.  Usually the casters are sitting on one side of that room.  You have enough room to keep the mob in the center.  When you get close to a wall, just shout for Melee's to SWITCH SIDES.  <br />
<br />
It takes a lil practice, but should be cake in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is the first time my guild had to really practice keeping a mob in one place.  If your guild can work to make it so they can keep the mob in the middle of the room, not touching walls, you are moving a long way toward success on future encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If the mob is touching a wall/firepot then range attacks wont land. This includes arrows, bolt spells, and thrown items. You better learn how to keep mobs out of walls if you want to take advantage of ranger and mage DPS later on when it matters. Go look at the 'AoW style' thread to get some ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are farming hot its not gonna matter for a long time.  God made walls for a reason - to push mobs into!  If you are in hot at zone in, youre prolly gonna be pulling mobs for like 3-4 hours at a time, the last thing you wanna do is make everyone focus on balancing push out all night long, just stick all that crap in a corner, kill it, loot it &amp; go get the next one, dont think about it, watch tv if you can even!<br />
<br />
Rangers are really bad with whining about walls - about 100% of the time they choose to ignore the benefits of walling a mob &amp; focus totally on complaining about their stupid arrows (the ones that break mez when you really dont want it broken like during xegony/bert/etc).<br />
<br />
The only mobs i can think of off the top of my head you dont wanna push into walls are like stuff in elementals (cause stupid stuff happens when they go into walls most of the time), mobs in pos, terris thule....kunark &amp; velious dragons....and uhm thats about it!<br />
<br />
When in doubt, tell the whiners to shut up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the wurms are just too big for the area and you cant move them around without them bouncing halfway across camp spot, thats the bottom line. they are trivial mobs as well, the only thing anyone should be conerned about is sieving/tormenting the gaters and nuking hard the last 10 percent, esp the yellow ones who cant be tormented.<br />
<br />
sure u might kill a little faster by not walling, but the biggest help to downtime is having a bot bard sitting at the casters with ae mana. bst crack helps too of course.<br />
<br />
you should be able to keep all the little ones in the center of the room easily, no excuse for walling them but i doubt you are. if you have a necro there, u could maybe skeleton the wurms hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to play a Mage and firing off Firebolt of Tallon is a not a big deal here.  Sure, it's nice and it looks good, but it's not neccessary.  Firebolt of Tallon also happens to be Evocation spec.  Just to inform everyone, most Mages are Conjuration spec, so they lose the set 10% mana efficiency by using a nuke that doesn't coincide with their specialization.  Using the bolt won't be any more efficient than using their Shock of Steel of Shock of Fiery Blades.  Not to mention, chaining Firebolt of Tallon is asking for a Mage to be squashed in a heartbeat by the amount of agro it generates.<br />
<br />
What's neccessary for Mages is not firing off their bolts, but getting Pet Hold so they can actually use their pets here.  <br />
<br />
Pets &gt; Bolts<br />
Pets &gt; Bolts<br />
Pets &gt; Bolts<br />
Pets &gt; Bolts in Halls of Testing, but don't let pet classes use pets without Pet Hold<br />
<br />
Grind that into their heads cause even the 61 air pet will do 70dps here as long as he's attacking the rear.  The 62 water pet will do roughly 90dps as long as he's able to backstab.  Given the chance, tell them to use the air pet though.  It's innate super high resistance to cold makes it so they don't even take damage when fighting the ice wurm AEs.  The fire/magic wurms are a different story, but the water pet doesn't even have that advantage as its resistance specialization is poison.</div></div><hr />

I dont normally post much but really feel compelled to let out a loud LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">rangers are whiny b*tches, they think their bow dps is god, and if they cant have it that the mob dies 2x's as slow, they dont take into factor<br />
<br />
increased melee dps from corning mob due to no parry/riposte/dodge<br />
less healing required do to less riposte,<br />
broken arrow mez's<br />
etc etc<br />
increased dps from corning mob due to less OOR trying to balance it</div></div><hr />

make them shut up.<br />
for added whining, reverse-corner them (i.e. mob facing out of corner, dagarn-style) so you get to hear rogues whine too! :D</div></div><hr />
