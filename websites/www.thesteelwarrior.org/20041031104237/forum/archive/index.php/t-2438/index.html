<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dunno if I might just be the first person to get this weapon but it is the result of a quest in Sol-C.<br />
<br />
If you zone in from Sol-B and fight through the few kobolds until the brick-built area there is a named Kobold and a &quot;shadowed man&quot; in a small room to the left. The named kobold is not attackable and not aggro depsite what /con tells you. The shadowed man type npc is what you want, he'll tell you that he has infiltrated the kobolds to destroy them and that if you bring him four items that &quot;still retain heat after death&quot; from mobs deeper in the caverns he can make a temper for such a weapon.<br />
<br />
Forgive me if I don't recall the precise names of the drops but you'll see them as obvious if you crawl thru the dungeon. Anyway you need a smoldering tentacle from the tentacled mobs, A soul of fire (or something like that) from the fire elemental mobs, a brain type thing from the slimes and I'm buggered if I can remember what the fourth item was, though I think it came from the winged mobs that hang around the fire elementals. <br />
<br />
All of them ID as &quot;blah blah blah emanates heat&quot; or some such.<br />
<br />
Take those 4 items back to the npc (Ghaib something his name is) and he gives you a temper and a little exp. Then he says that to make a weapon from it you need to find the parts of a weapon that were scattered among the kobolds. I just happened to have all 3 parts - they are 1) shattered blade - id's top half, 2) shattered blade - id's bottom half, 3) melted hilt.<br />
<br />
Give those 3 items and the temper to the npc and you get some exp plus:<br />
<br />
Ghaib's Flame-Forged Longsword<br />
Str+10 Sta+10 Wis+5 Int+5 HP+50 Mana+50<br />
Effect: Servant's Bolt (Combat)<br />
<br />
Effect is a 150 fire DD with -100 resist adjust.<br />
<br />
Took me less than 6 hours from meeting the npc to getting the weapon (including accidentally porting out once hehe).<br />
<br />
<br />
There's another quest from a named kobold not far away for which I have collected 3 of the 4 required items. I know where the last one drops and I hope to finish it tomorrow. Will post if it would be of interest to warriors.<br />
<br />
Also, we got 4 nice items while inside. Again I didn't note precise stats on these things but roughly...<br />
<br />
<br />
Shield (name?): ac30 15sta 5wis/int 50hp/mana. Clr/Sk/Pal. <br />
Dropped from A Servant of Flame.<br />
<br />
Ring (name?): basically a slightly inferior version of circled toe bones. <br />
Dropped from named imp.<br />
<br />
1hb. Useable by all casters, priests, ranger, beastlord, paladin, sk.<br />
15/25 int+10 str/sta+? hp/mana+? saves?<br />
Dropped from A Smoldering Tentacle Terror.<br />
<br />
Shoulder item (have this on my druid so precise stats later). Ac10 wis/sta/str/hp/mana/saves. Was an upgrade to death watcher's shroud for me.<br />
Dropped from named kobold. Hang a left afer zoning in from SolB.<br />
<br />
All names seem rare but there would appear to be a lot of named mobs scattered around the place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah that was me that posted the info to Alla's. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hey,  how do i get to sol-c....and what kind of group do you think it will take to get that sword?<br />
<br />
<br />
how long do you think it would take also?<br />
<br />
last question(promise)<br />
<br />
does that sword work with ingeniuty(spelling)...or cause of the fire debuff will it not?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sol-C : look at eqatlas map for Sol-b   Go to #14 and there is a lava river.  Need a levie to cross to the lava then swim down into the lava straight then right.  Its not far to Sol-c zone.   After zone swim straight then up out of lava, again its not far.<br />
<br />
Mobs are hi-blue to 61, group of 60's is no problem with the exception of the cartoonish guardian imps surrounding the boss mob.  They hit for 500+ and perhaps quad, don't remember.  We got 4 at once and had to evac.<br />
<br />
Dont know about the quest blade since it doesn't stun I'm not interested in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's no debuff component, its a resist modifier to the save against the DD. Yes Ingenuity works with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nokmgud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">one thing on Sol C - as pointed out, when you use the old zone from Sol B to Sol A swimming in the lava you get into Sol C.  But - if you zone into A, thne dive into lava and zone back you also end up in Sol C - just at a different spot of the zone.  So make sure your group knows this and zones into one spot only.</div></div><hr />
