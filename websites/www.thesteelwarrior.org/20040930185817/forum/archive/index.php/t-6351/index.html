<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sure I would have no problem shelling out $50 to upgrade my sytem in exchange for improved graphics or gameplay, but I'm not willing to pay $50 to have an &quot;upgrade&quot; that is pure crap and has ruined gameplay and requires numerous patches to fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kxorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm interested in the WoW Beta, regardless of EQ's performance. <br />
<br />
I can understand why people are upset that they need to upgrade.  However, the amount of bitching from some posters is ridiculous.  Upgrading to a decent video card can be done for under $100, and that new card will last you into the future of EQ or any other game you choose.  It's a PC- not a gaming console- requirements are always increasing.   And please stop all the bullshit about &quot;Well the game ran fine when I got it blah blah blah&quot;; it's an MMORPG, the reason you and I are still playing is because of how dynamic it is.  This includes  the game and graphics engine as well as the content.  <br />
<br />
If those reasons aren't enough for you, look at how much enjoyment you get out of EQ for your $13.00 a month.  Is an inexpensive upgrade for your computer (that will improve performance across the board) really that  unreasonable?<br />

Better gameplay &gt; graphics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There not going to do because there getting us to pay to beta test the EQ2 engine, what a sweet deal for them. So when does WoW come out?....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ahnaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a supported video card (with upgraded drivers) and DX9.  I've had these previous to the patch.  I still have issues with graphics.   About at my wits end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, all caster robes are old world graphics unless I turn new models on.  I have a great distaste for the new models, so everyone is running around in SMRs, Oracles, Crimsons and Cryosilk. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is a perfect example of what some of us are talking about when we say that the old graphics were fine and they do not need to be screwing up our performance over bs like. the luclin models are sooo ugly. and theyve ruined my own lag performance without providing any tangible benefits. i have a 64MB ATI card and its slow as molasses now. and one day ill break down and do a sideways-grade (not an upgrade) to another similar performance card and when ive done so if im lucky my performance will be merely as bad as it was before the changes.<br />
<br />
and people come all over these boards defending the performance downgrade as &quot;the winds of progress&quot;. i dont buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dizastor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My biggest issue is since the updrade it takes me like 60-90 seconds to zone... was much faster before... like 20-30 seconds<br />
<br />
128 meg video card, a gig of ram, and a 3000k Cable connection... what more do i need...<br />
<br />
Shouldn't game updates make the game run better? not worse.</div></div><hr />
