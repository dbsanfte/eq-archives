<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.. so after playing my zerker now for a while, I have come to the conclussion that warriors are actually zerkers that can wear plate.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows that the Berserkers aren't a finished class.<br />
<br />
I have a few questions and suggestions for warriors.<br />
<br />
1.  How many of you warriors actually take advantage of your berserker state? (&lt; 30% health) and hit Mighty Strike?  I know if I get to the point that I am berserk... it usually doesn't last long since i'm getting spam healed or CH'd.<br />
<br />
2.  I personally think that the innate Berserk state should either be taken away from warriors and given to Berserkers or AT A MINIMUM, just given to berserkers.  In addition to this, just give the mighty strike to berserkers as an innate ability that doesn't have to be activated by a button or that is on a reuse timer.<br />
<br />
What is everyones thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree dude, on top of that, defensive disc should also be taken away from warriors and given to zerkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">har har har... lets be serious here.<br />
<br />
Class defining abilities.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Give this as an innate ability?  So you want beserkers to constantly crit, on every hit, with no re-use timer and not activated by a button.<br />
<br />
Are you serious?  I'm hoping I read what you typed wrong, or that you didn't clearly type out what you meant.<br />
<br />
As for taking it away from warriors... Why?<br />
<br />
It's eye candy.  That burst of damage is hardly imbalancing.  If I use it while in berserk status, I usually only get a few hits in because I'll get a heal very soon.  If I can stand there berserk the entire duration of that disc, then I'm not fighting a mob that will give me much experience anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Straythe, Give it as an innate ability ONLY WHEN they actually go berserk (&lt;30% health).<br />
<br />
As far as taking it away... wouldn't you think that is kind of an class defining skill for a Berserker?  Do some Lore research on what a berserker really is.<br />
<br />
      Definitions of berserker on the Web:<br />
<br />
one of the ancient Norse warriors legendary for working themselves into a frenzy before a battle and fighting with reckless savagery and insane fury<br />
<br />
<br />
And Brutul... no, its a dwarf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh. Seeing as berserkers were a poorly thought out and implemented class to begin with, basically taking skills of warriors and combining them with rangers, I don't really care much what they do. They already whored out warrior crits (initially, we were the ONLY ones that could crit), so why not all the other offensive stuff that made us unique? It's pretty much what the berserker class was intended for anyhow.<br />
<br />
  I still want a flaming axe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">[Fitemore]They already whored out warrior crits (initially, we were the ONLY ones that could crit),]<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey hey hey... they said warriors will still crit [more] then other classes...<br />
and knowing Sony thats probably what, 2% ?  0% ?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
So this would equate to:<br />
<br />
Run into battle 70% dead, and fight somehow with insane fury and savagery?<br />
<br />
Doesn't match up to well with your definition.  This should be a state you work yourself up to, then expell your energy in a huge amount of damage.<br />
<br />
You'd have to expect a downtime from this, you can't sustain that energy level very long.<br />
<br />
This really belongs on a Zerker forum for ideas on that class though.  Taking away from one class to fix another has never worked well in EQ.<br />
<br />
Change what it says when a warrior goes berserk if it'll make you feel better so it doesn't infringe on the Berserker name/title.<br />
<br />
I'd hope a class defining skill for a Berserker wouldn't be burst damage only when they are low health and potentially susceptible to low health aggro.<br />
<br />
Please reach for something better than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Straythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did a bit of research and found this site as the best source of information in a quick search, better than a standard dictionary definition.<br />
<br />
http://www.wordiq.com/definition/Berserker_(viking)<br />
<br />
From that article/resource:<br />
<br />
Berserk rage ? called berserkerganga ? could also happen in a middle of daily work. It began with shivering, chattering of the teeth, and a chill in the body. The face swelled and changed its color. Next came great rage, howling, and indiscriminate brawling. When the rage quelled, the berserker was exhausted and dull of mind for up to several days. According to sagas, many enemies of berserkers exploited this stage to get rid of them. <br />
<br />
Exhausted and dull of mind for up to several days...<br />
<br />
I think your fix doesn't hold true to the idea of a Berserker.</div></div><hr />

There you go.  The EQ warrior class fulfills this archetype: the fearsome fighter who has no equal on the battlefield.<br />
<br />
This new berserker class is just light infantry: limited combat training, inferior discipline, there to support for the warriors.<br />
<br />
I have always thought that warriors should have some kind of innate mightystrike effect whenever we go berserk.  Perhaps just an 3x increased rate of crippling blows or something.  The &quot;berserk frenzy&quot; message should mean more than just &quot;heal the warrior!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
not very often. even if i beg the cleric not to heal me someone else will sneak in a heal so fellstrike is more common for me. if the mobs are easy ill likely use defensive to save healing manna and the manna saved by the cleric is used up on nukes. if the mobs are hard id rather use incite when it pops than squander my endurance on offensive disciplines. if im not mt ill use fellstrike but dont often go berserk. and if i go berserk on purpose (ganking agro) then someone squeezes in a heal and i look like a jerk for stealing agro and stealing a heal as well.<br />
<br />
its nice eye candy but again i use it only on rare occasions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">and why not just give to us  warriors all the throwing axe skills (after all we already have throwing stone lol :) ), and the cool stuff like stun and cripple so that you could have a berzerker wearing plates...<br />
or why not give them a skill or disc that would activate the frenzy mode when activate and that turns into the opposite (chane to crit=0 and decrese some stats) during the cooldown, with a time periode like 15minutes for 45minutes cooldown.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Berzerkers should naturally be in their jacked up state, as described by any sort of historyical  descritptions.  As for giving them our frenzy, bunk that.  We've had people wanting our abilities everytime we get a good one.  Sorry, but Berzerkers should be happy for what they get.  At least their epic is somewhat good.  The class is new too, so there's still a lot of work for them to do to the class.<br />
<br />
Or do whats in the good ole tradition of Everquest, bitch and moan as a community.  If enough  people make enough noise, Sony will do something.</div></div><hr />

LOL that's too much I will break my chair. this should be send to the zerker board to see how bad and frenzy they can get :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I made about 20k in plat selling LDoN tradeskilled chainmail the first weekend that Berserkers went live. I knew that people would be twinking them, so I wanted to make money off the trend. <br />
<br />
Once I cleared my inventory, I didn't make any more of it. I figured that people wouldn't want to play such a one-dimensional character for more than a week or two.  I've only ever grouped with one, and I thought he was pretty useless. Judging from the state of the bazaar on Stromm and from their almost total absence from groups and raids, I think I called that one correctly.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for the folks who invested a lot of time in the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">heh don't think many invested time, we had several 65 with epic in the first week. 2nd week they were in time, and that was just because of mob races.</div></div><hr />
