<br />
The 7 items with ZERO hps would be a good start...</div></div><hr />

I dont see many upgrades for between 10 and 20 k which give HP yet dont decrease my ac.  Specific suggestions are great tho, thanks for trying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Replace Mushroom Veil with Crystal Spider Eyes, or any other cheap mask that has hit points.  There are tons in the bazaar that are 1000pp or less.<br />
<br />
Replace Torque with something like a Clattering Bone Necklace.<br />
<br />
Replace BD Earring with BS Electrum Earring (or anything better).<br />
<br />
Replace those boots with just about anything else you can find.<br />
<br />
Replace the two pieces of cobalt and the chitin bracers ASAP.  Get champions, cultural, hurricane, or similar such armor if you can.  Champions should sell for only 1-2k per piece multiquested.  For cheaper solutions, look up quests for Ice Forged Shackles, Bracer of Hammerfall, Giant Scalemail Sleeves, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An earring of solstice would be good for you.  You can get all of the items for the risk free combine for under 4k probably.  I know I saw a full set of items being auction on SolRo for under 4k last night.<br />
<br />
Helm of raldukan go for 2-3k or less now and would be a nice helm upgrade.<br />
<br />
Clattering bone necklace or something similar for the neck slot.<br />
<br />
Crystal spider eyes for the face slot.<br />
<br />
If you have dragon faction the draconic pauldrons quest would give you a nice shoulder upgrade.<br />
<br />
For the other slots the Thurg or SS quest armors are probably reasonable upgrades as well if you can get a group/raid going for them or buy the MQ, just make sure you have the needed faction.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, don't focus so heavily on the AC and focus more on the hit points.  I am not saying ignore AC as that is also part of the equation.  Also keep in mind that more stamina means more hit points, and it doesn't look like buffs will cap your stamina, so also keep that in mind as well.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I would also use that defenders lightblade in teh offhand over the snowchipper as well.  The proc on the snowchipper generates hardly any aggro other than from the damage, so you might as well use the weapon with the much better ratio in that hand....and hit points on it to boot.</div></div><hr />

boots=Barbed Dragonscale for the moment<br />
Arm=Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves<br />
Back=Cloak of Greater Pernicity<br />
<br />
That should net you about another 175 hp easily</div></div><hr />
