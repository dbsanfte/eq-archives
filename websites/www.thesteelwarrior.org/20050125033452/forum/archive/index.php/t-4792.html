<br />
You created a nice front page with news and highlights how about throwing up the downtimes that you know are coming a little bit ahead of time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hard drive was removed and we should be in the clear now, hopefully.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example I was browseing the forums the other day and got a mssg that it was going dowin for maitence when trying to read a post.</div></div><hr />

My boss likes to say SHDWI.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sHORTY</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to reset it to a backup from Wednesday morning around midnight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It must be hard for you. I saw we were missing some posts and realized you must have been forced to step back to a backup. You have my sympathy for the troubles.<br />
<br />
One thing the system is tearing me up over is this avatar I added for the left margin. I loaded it from my hard drive and it shows in options and also every time I log in but when I make a post I get a pic error. It's really confusing me. I must be doing something stupid.<br />

<br />
I never said, to predict the crashes but when there is a down time comeing like moving to a new server...<br />
