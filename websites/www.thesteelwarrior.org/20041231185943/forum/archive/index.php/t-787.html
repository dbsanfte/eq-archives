<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok first off the size. make it the size of Of Nro or Oasis with 5-10 levels.<br />
<br />
make one or two levels completley Invisible. Walls, roof, floor, steps everything about the geomitry is invisible. <br />
<br />
Make some of the walls randomly move, so the dungeon itself is ever changing. this makes mapping and running from the zone in to your favorite camp harder. you know like the stone trap wall thingy in solB that goes up and down? yeah like that but with hundreds of them that go up and down randomly.<br />
<br />
when you kill any mob there is a 1 in100 chance that when he dies he will spawn a dozen little worms with 1HP that quad for 1k each. easy to take care of (repost or aoe) if your paying attention. if not then oh well. also this will keep you on the edge of your seat when killing mobs, even if you have been in the  dungeon for 2 years. verytime you kill a mob you will still have that terror of knowing that you just might get killed right there.<br />
<br />
wooden planks like a food wide. (like in upper guk) we need more of these. they made training fun.<br />
<br />
Make is so when you run from a mob, the farther you go the wider his call for help gets. I know agro is based on other mobs not the one chasing you but im sure they can work on this. why you ask? because trains in dungeons are what makes dungeons fun. 82man CT zone crash ruled. sure it sucks trying to rebreak it, butthere is nothing like a true zoneclearing train in a crowded dungeon.<br />
<br />
oh well just an idea for a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But would it have a random spawn mob that is 20+ levels higher than the rest like oasis and Nro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay let me know when this happens because I do not want to go anywhere near this zone. <br />
<br />
I like the idea but changing invisible walls and 100 thing that hit for 1k each? that means if 1/10th of them get a shot on you before you can have a groupie cast an AOE or get off Riposte then you have been hit for 10,000 HP <br />
<br />
LOADING PLEASE WAIT<br />
<br />
Cool Idea though I like reading dungeon ideas and the like it is kind of nice to see what other people might like to add to the game in terms of dungeons.</div></div><hr />

/em wakes up from castle mistmoore nightmare in a cold sweat<br />
<br />
OK I can live with seeing the entire ballroom at the MM zone in but I can live without a level 60-65 welcome wagon hell bent on raping ya as soon as you zone in :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hahaha mistmoore. I remember My first guild and another guild went to 'raid' mistmoore.<br />
<br />
We clear up to the castle entrance (note we are all around level 20-30).. we are pulling things going good. We kill the gate mobs and head into the actual castle... 5 minutes later we have nearly every mob in the god damned castle on our raid party, that was the funnest whipe evah.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahhh those where they days ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The boss mob of a dungeon that powerful could only be Mayong Mistmoore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be neat if they put a dungeon -- of any sort -- around the NRo/FP area, seems so desolate around there these days.  Doesn't necessarily have to be a 60+ dungeon, could be a nice 50+ (seb without the run).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem with trains in Mistmoore and Unrest is that alot of the people there are low level and are just learning about undead agro and live agro and game geometry and agroing through walls etc etc. so there are bound to be alot of trains. same with befallen back in the early days of EQ. but thankfully there where 3 locked doords hehe.<br />
<br />
Karnors is the same. you have alot of people from LoIO that go to DL and then to Karnor's. so Karnors is thier first time in a dungeon so they end up training all the time.<br />
<br />
once you get to high lvl dungeons people pretty much know what they are doing and you dont see alot of trains. but when you do see one, its a doozy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they tried to make moving objects such as walls in the game when they planned on making the zone in stone to the Plane of Mischief move around at random in North ToV but they could never make it work properly. But making a wall like a randomly triggerable door might work. Either way it would be nice to have something out near Freeport. I haven't been through there in ages, perhaps when Lost Dungeons comes out there will be something there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about use spherical, cylindrical or even toroidal coordinates instead of the rectangular XYZ type square zones we have now.  Imagine a zone in the shape of the inside of a torus or a sphere where gravity was always pointing towards the floor so that you could run around in a straight line and eventually come back to where you started.  You could also see people and mobs standing above you on what looks like your ceiling and the zone would have no edges, just entry and exit portals.  That would be cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it.  I like it a lot.  One thing I'd like to see in a dungeon like that - just to make it a _real_ PITA - is to have the zone out randomly change location every so often :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could make the zone out a moving object that followed some repeating path that slowly moves across the zone.<br />
<br />
You could also have areas of zero gravity, low gravity, or high gravity, etc. where you would float or take huge falling damage or have your ability to jump drastically modified.<br />
<br />
I also don't see why you couldn't have rivers or airstreams where if you enter them there is a force that pulls you along in a certain direction or spins you in a circle.  Perhaps only people with SOW or run3 could move slowly against the flow and the rest would see these areas as effectively one way.<br />
<br />
There could be portals or doorways where you are shrunk or grown as you pass through them or give you some kind of movement boost.  There could be zones or areas where all colors are negative or black and white or everything has a red tint to it.<br />
<br />
There are lots of things that could be done, a little imagination could really improve a lot of zones.  The current game engine might not be able to handle these things as it is but perhaps some future expansions could extend the physics of EQ to be a little more interesting.</div></div><hr />
