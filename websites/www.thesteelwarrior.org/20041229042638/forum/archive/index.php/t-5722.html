After that you can add whatever else you need depending on what you are going to be doing and what mobs you are gonna be fighting.  For main tanking I usually like Divine intervention, Ferocity, Guard of Druzzil, Call of Fire, Bulwark of Vie and damage shield.</div></div><hr />

On fights where resists aren't needed do you guys still want Ferocity?  Our MT always asks for it but i'd rather keep it up on our 3 rogues instead (and since it stacks with FA, and we typically only have 1 shm on a raid its nice to have all our rogues w/ both)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When tanking:<br />
Bo9<br />
Kazad<br />
Word of Gallantry<br />
Focus<br />
Brells<br />
Haste<br />
Call of the Rathe (lots forget that it gives AC.  I'm not 2k AC, so every bit helps)<br />
DI<br />
Cha<br />
Lev (if applicable) -- you'd be surprised how much easier it is to position mobs/raid in general when you're floating<br />
Bulwark of Vie<br />
<br />
Depending on the situation, I then add Mage DS, Predator, Ferocity/Ferine, Resists, and clickies as I see fit.<br />
<br />
Most people leave out Ferocity/Ferine because they don't help hold aggro or tank (unless your stamina isn't maxed).  There have been tests (although arguably inconclusive) that show that regardless of your damage, you achieve the aggro based on procs and number of swings (hit or miss both same).  All having a higher atk does is let you hit harder, effectively adding to your DPS, but not increasing your aggro or tank efficiency.</div></div><hr />

DPS obviously isn't the onlyimpact on aggro, but it certainly seems to have impact.  A 2 hander like the blade of war can put out so much dps that it reportedly holds aggro just as well as many 1 hand combos.  Since FA amounts to a very considerable boost in ATK, I would assume that it's going to increase your aggro nicely too.</div></div><hr />

The blade of war holds aggro because of its outstanding damage-bonus-to-delay ratio.  This happens to give it good DPS as well.  It also holds normal aggro against immune mobs like Seru, even though it does 0 DPS.  This should tell you that aggro is not dependent on DPS, but is only dependent on the properties of the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parses and just general experience have shown that you generate *just* as much agro whether your weapon hits or not. I tanked Emperor without ever getting a Bane weapon, for instance.<br />
<br />
So no, if I'm tanking and tight on buff space, I don't take ferocity or ferine avatar. I used to take ferocity for sta and resists, but I'm sta maxed now and with a bard doing enhanced Veeshan I easily hit 500 in all resists. I might still ask for Ferocity if I were tanking a mob that hits you with a resist debuff, like TZ (if warriors tanked TZ).<br />
<br />
To summarize the question about ATK tho, DPS is irrelevant to agro. The agro equation looks like: <br />
<br />
1) # of swings, modified by damage rating<br />
2) # of procs, modified by agro from the proc of course<br />
3) agro modifiers like Thule and Raex BP<br />
4) Taunt, incite, etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
Potential damage is all that's needed. That's why you can skill up and still hold aggro. Your DPS is suffering, but if it's a decent weapon your all set.</div></div><hr />

No, it's not.<br />
Higher ATK equals more potentional dmg, but apparently that doesn't enter the equation?<br />
Correct.  Higher ATK only makes your hits trend closer to maximum, which is thought to have no bearing on aggro.<br />
<br />
How much aggro per swing is based on your weapon's damage bonus.<br />
How many swings per combat round is based on your skills and AA's.<br />
How many combat rounds per minute is based on your weapon delay and haste.<br />
How many times you miss is based on your level vs. the mob's level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like Snowz, I'm very obsessive about having insta-clickies in my first buff slots (nothing like the ranting I give my clerics when they virtue me right after a res before I can click anything up; at least in raids when it mattered(s).)  For me:<br />
<br />
1. Grim Aura (instant)<br />
2. Coldain Ring (instant)<br />
3. Amulet of Necro (instant, and quick shrink for my ogreness when I don't want to bother using my bracer)<br />
4. J Boots (if outdoors) / See Invis (instant, if indoors)<br />
5. Vallon's<br />
6. Resists<br />
7. BSS<br />
8. Focus<br />
9. Virtue / Kazad<br />
10. SoP / Nine<br />
11. Rathe / Gallantry<br />
12. CHA<br />
13. DI<br />
14. Empty<br />
15. Empty<br />
<br />
That's generally about right; obviously the clickies vary based on the situation, but dispell mobs were the bane of my existence for so long, it's become habit (for better or worse).<br />

<br />
Actually it hurts you in aggro control.  When you do that, it lessens the chance you will get hit, but it also lessens the chance you will hit the mob.  Hence if logic serves here, your dmg output will go down.  I try to only use it when I am accuiring aggro.  A great way to use this is for a 2 tank aggro team.  You hit def and start to get aggro, shortly aftwards a second tank attacks getting himself second on the hate list.  When the first tank goes down, mob goes after the second tank who still has his full disc to use.<br />
<br />
Works pretty good when you do it right, in otherwords getting the damn rangers and rogues to leave the mob a lone long enough for you to pull it off. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many raids prefer to use Kazad's Mark and Blessing of the Nine when Mass Group Buffing everyone, because it's higher HP Total than Virtue offers, and gives an additional 8 mana/tick for pure casters/shm/dru (Clerics get no real benefit, save more HP, because Armor of Zealot provides the same mana regeneration.)<br />
<br />
Here's the breakdown of benefits from Virtue versus the other three most tanks will have in raids:<br />
<br />
Virtue: 1405 HP, 72 AC<br />
<br />
vs. <br />
<br />
Kazad/Nine/Ward of Gallantry: 1528, 86 AC, (8 mana/tick)<br />
<br />
So, it's a bit of an upgrade, but many times I personally go with Virtue if buff slots are necessary.  And depending what the raid has available.<br />

I would bet because alot of people never get it cast on them because alot of clerics never bother to get it and/or are too lazy to cast it if they do.<br />
<br />
Clerics got spoiled with temperance (1 buff does all) then got more spoiled with virtue.<br />

<br />
Standard must haves = Haste,BSS,Focus,Then either V or The triple buff combo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't use k 9 wog because A) it takes up too much buff space and B) there are a few mobs with AE's that overwrtie 9 making it useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
BSS,FoS,V,VQ,CotR,form of endurance,Pestilence Shock,DI.That covers all AC and HP availble to me with buffs,Then of course haste to increase swings potential damage and Innate aggro proc.<br />
<br />
That is 8 buffs.<br />
<br />
Then I have the secondary buffs.<br />
<br />
Sotp,and Damage shields,Resists Tot,GoD,Seasons.I usually always have Sopt up and a couple DS I have my belt and then mage druid whatever.<br />
<br />
If I only have sotp and say GoD and ToT I now have 11 buffs slots taken up.<br />
<br />
I don't use cha cause I have 180 cha as is,Daiku wrulan etc are uselss as all melee stats are 305.<br />
<br />
Then another slot for Heal over Time.<br />
<br />
That leaves me with 3 slots.If I have sews equipped I lsoe one to rune3.<br />
<br />
Assumeing  am using Dbotw/EoE.<br />
<br />
I have 3 slots,anyhting in god is going to leave me with one slot taken for chaos claws that leaves me with two buffs.<br />
<br />
Now if I want FA/Fero I lose another one to two slots.<br />
If paragran hits I lsoe a slot,If spirit of the wood hits I lose a slot.<br />
<br />
If the mob has more than one debuff I lose yet another slot.<br />

<br />
<br />
I have no clue how warriors manage to use K/9/WoG.Especially now in GoD.<br />

Taking two buff slots for 123 more HP and 10 ac isn't worth losing out on 2 buff slots.There is no way anyone can convince me off that.</div></div><hr />

Playing a 65 cleric I whole hartedly agree!  It is so frustrating to cast  Heal over Time spells and not having it stick to the tank or getting the MT to have CHA and DI.  I never go the 9/kaz/ac route for my tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, it's all in what you're fighting.  Some places you just can't give up shit like Druzzil/Seasons/Tribunal, but other areas you can click that crap off.  When I don't need the buff space, hell ya I'll take 123hp and 10ac, otherwise Virtue is good enough.<br />
<br />
Plus not having the myriad of clickes that some of you guys do helps my case a lot too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hand of Virtue<br />
4000ish mana for entire raid<br />
one cast and done<br />
1405 HP, 72 AC<br />
lasts 2.5 hours<br />
1 spell slot<br />
<br />
vs.<br />
<br />
Bot9 and Kazad's Mark and Ward of Gallantry<br />
3400ish (for mgb Bot9), 3600ish mana (for mgb KM), and 425 mana EACH for WoG<br />
one cast of Bot9, one cast of KM and then 10 seconds per WoG<br />
1528 hp and 82 ac<br />
Potg9 lasts 1 hour 40 min, KM lasts 1.5 hours, WoG lasts 1 hour 21 min<br />
3 spell slots<br />
<br />
The only thing is people mgb the entire raid with 9/symbols and then AC the tanks that ask for it.</div></div><hr />

Voice of Thule (shadow knight)<br />
Ferine Avatar (believe shaman or Beastlord)<br />
Rune of Zebuxurstuff (wiz or enchanter)<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
Don't use damage shields unless you have at least a couple spare buff slots they are the least important of all your possible buffs when in doubt don't get one.<br />
<br />
Kazad's / Ward of Gallalntry / Protetion of the Nine, are nice for extra hps but 99% of the time you can't risk using them going into a zone as they take too many buff slots. Especially pointless in PoP zones where ac is almost as necessary as hps.<br />
<br />
I personally have a few clickies, always make note where you will be raiding to keep those 1 second or less cast time clickies in first slots for crap buffs if your up against dispelling mobs. I like to use my Icy cloak of shadows  (Vex Thal loot) for its extra charisma and its fast click.<br />
<br />
<br />
And lastly if your weapon procs a buff like say stone etched War Sword (rune III ) keep that in mind it likes to take a slot as well.<br />

Do they also go into fights without symbol/virtue 'cuz a real tank wouldn't need it? :)</div></div><hr />

A good DS will do some serious damage, particularly on a mob that is immune to slow. Usually, you can count on your DPS to do as much or more damage than the top damage dealer on a raid mob. I would ditch regen and ATK before ditching DS.</div></div><hr />

In those cases you want to stack your buffs so that either a) your tanking buffs are protected or b) the buff being overwritten is in a good place to be dispelled if that is the prefered cure. Otherwise, get buffs in what ever order you want.</div></div><hr />

Hokay, anudder Q for them that know better:  I was told, about ... hrm ... 8 months ago I s'pose, that dispell now takes from a random buff slot, and not from the first slot on down.  Lies?  Rumours?  Situational?</div></div><hr />

I've seen mobs that appears to take random buffs off me, but most still seem to be the top slots first.</div></div><hr />

No not realy.....just that they belive that BoV is overpowered and guilds have killed time content before LDON without it so we're gonna get by without it as well....soo yeah...call it what you want  ;)<br />

Most times when we are buffing I watch so I can click off the ones I dont feel I need IE Wurlan/CoS etc.<br />
<br />
As I dont do alot of OTing I will sac BSS for SoT/CoTR for the atk boost.  So far I am getting 1799 and for dmg it's helping a ton.  every 2-3 hit comes out for max dmg, even if I do end up FDing more then normal 8D</div></div><hr />

Use your judgement, personally I would rather rely on good old attack booster than whether or not a mob will hit me, this especially applies when you aren't the ma and are next up in like when there are 10 tanks at a raid and only 1 tanking i doubt the dps from the ds on other 9 will make a world of difference .  When I head to a raid I just buff up and if im up im up .. ds are also yet another annoying buff to constantly be keeping up while sop lasts what 2 hours? Neither of which either of these buffs are all that crucial. the point being its an easy way to keep an attack edge until you are tanking .. then you can put all the ds's on that you feel privy .. of course personally I tend to run outtah room .. 8)~<br />
