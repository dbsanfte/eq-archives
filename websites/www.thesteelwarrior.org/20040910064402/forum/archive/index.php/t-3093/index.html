After all of these changes, hybrids will not be able to deal out the damage of a pure melee class, with the possible exception of rangers, who might be able to get close. The warrior, monk and rogue will still out damage hybrids, and by a noticeable margin. That difference is in part what hybrids lose for the power of their spells.<br />
<br />
Also, warriors will always have the broadest selection of weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Warriors will still have a significantly larger amount of hit points.<br />
<br />
Their role as primary tank will not be endangered. - Absor 10/01<br />
 <br />
If hybrids could cast spells as well as their parent class, then nobody would really want to play that parent class. - Absor<br />
If hybrids could effectively match a Warrior's ability to survive battles, exceed a Warriors' ability to make themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, and cast spells, then nobody would really want to play a Warrior. Oh wait, they can!- Battleblade<br />
Although it's been posted repeatedly in one form or another, I put together what I believe is a clear statement of the Warrior/Knight class balance issue and why many players believe changes are justified and required. I'm not trying to get Knights nerfed or to spend their days /lfg. Rather, I'm suggesting Warriors need some improvement in order to restore parity.<br />
<br />
While the player community may have opinions about class balance issues and roles, SoE produces and maintains EverQuest. They are the ultimate authority.<br />
<br />
SoE's website contains Class Descriptions (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp). It is reasonable to expect that this information is accurate and identifies important class characteristics.<br />
<br />
--&quot;their heavy armor&quot;<br />
<br />
The Warrior Class Description states in part, &quot;When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors should be able to wear &quot;their heavy armor&quot; as distinquished from the other plate wearing melees which one is led to believe must wear something lighter.<br />
<br />
While this might be true for class specific armor, pre-planar melees (the majority on most servers) tend to wear the best armor and accesories available to them. These are almost always WAR, PAL, SHD, BRD/All for example, Great Shadow Platemail is one of the better breastplates in the game and wearable by all. This not only provides Knights the same AC and HP gains enjoyed by Warriors, but adds Mana to their mana pool. In other words, Knights get more benefit from this armor than Warriors.<br />
<br />
PoP Warrior class armor should have more AC and HP's than SoL WAR, PAL, SHD, BRD/All armor.<br />
<br />
--&quot;excellent defensive skills&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors have substantially the same defensive skills as Knights with some minor (10%) advantages in Dodge, Parry, and Reposte and they have the Defensive discipline.<br />
<br />
--&quot;unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles&quot;<br />
<br />
A Warrior may have a raw 800 HP advantange over a simularly equipped Knight. But since Paladins always have at a minimum their self-buffs, the actual Warrior HP advantage over a simularly equipped Paladin is 450 HP [800 HP - Aura of the Crusader (350 HP Paladin self buff)] at best.<br />
<br />
In order to have even a very modest HP advantage, Warriors must purchase Virtue and Brells before grouping (and not die) or only join groups containing a Cleric and a Paladin. However, groups often assume that any buffs they can't give a Warrior, he won't have. Since a Paladin can buff himself and the group they are without question prefered in any group lacking a Cleric over a Warrior.<br />
<br />
In almost all experiance groups a Warrior HP advantage does not exit. A more detailed post discussing this issue may be found at <br />
What Warrior HP Advantage? (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3485) <br />
<br />
Because of the widespread use of WAR, PAL, SHD, BRD/All armor and accesories, marginally inferior but still excellent defensive skill, and a mana rich environment that does not confer any great advantage on a Warrior's 400-800 additional HP's, Knights are nearly matching Warrior survivability in the raid environment and for all practical purposes match it in the experiance group environment.<br />
<br />
--&quot;the focus of all their enemies' attacks&quot;<br />
<br />
The Warrior Class Description continues, &quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although the role of MT appears only in the Warrior Class Description it is performed by the other tank classes as well. Since it is explicitly cited as a Warrior role, Warriors expect to be better at it than other classes that have additional abilities.<br />
<br />
There are several charcteristics needed to MT: survivability and  the ability to obtain, hold, and if necessary re-gain aggro.<br />
<br />
There is no evidence whatsoever in the Class Descriptions that Knights &quot;should&quot; out aggro or out Taunt Warriors. The only mention of Taunt and the ability to make oneself the &quot;....focus of all their enemies' attacks....&quot; is in the Warrior Class Description.<br />
<br />
Skill caps and AA abilities seem to reflect the view that Warriors were in fact to have an advantage in this area:<br />
<br />
Taunt Skill Cap.......Warrior 200, Knight 180<br />
Archery Skill Cap.....Warrior 240, Knight 75<br />
AE Taunt...............Warrior yes, Knight no<br />
<br />
Warriors do slightly more melee DPS than the other tank classes which helps them to hold aggro. All of these classes can weild weapons which &quot;proc&quot; aggro increasing effects.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the effect of spells for a moment; itemization, skills, and abilities are intended to give Warriors greater survivability and taunt.<br />
<br />
In actual play, however, we discover Warriors often weild a BoC and another aggro weapon which not only reduces DPS, but causes them to take more reposte damage which completely negates any mitigation and HP advantage.<br />
<br />
We discover that despite the Warrior Class Description, Warriors generally do not enjoy greater survivability, DPS, or as we shall learn - competative ability to make themselves the &quot;....focus of all their enemies' attacks....&quot;<br />
<br />
--The Problem<br />
<br />
Knights can use easily obtained/low level spells to augment or even totally replace the mechanisms provided in the game to obtain and hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Not having to obtain and use aggro weapons allows Knights to use a wide variety of weapons. Since 2H weapons produce more DPS than a 1H past level 53, and the DLY is usually greater thus minimizing reposte damage, they are generally used. However, since Knights do have higher quality 1Hdrs available they can elect to use a shield in order to increase their survivability.<br />
<br />
Because 2H aggro weapons are scarce, Warriors often Dual Wield. The most common aggro setup for Warriors is a BoC and another weapon. The Warrior mitigation and HP advantage does not exist if they must Dual Weild when MTing and they face mobs that reposte (a not uncommon situation).<br />
<br />
Since Knights use spells to obtain aggro the only random factor is their fizzle rate (typically quite low). While Knights may use the Taunt Button in order to insure they stay at or near the top of the Hate list, casting a spell or two usually gives them aggro and allows them to build Hate. Spells also provide Knights with what players call &quot;snap aggro on demand&quot; and &quot;ranged aggro&quot;; capabilities not possesed by Warriors which allow groups to fight much more effectively and safely.<br />
<br />
Warriors on the other hand rely on damage output (low), random weapon procs and the Taunt Button (whose success is also governed by the Random Number Generator). They take longer to acquire aggro, have greater difficulty retaining it, and find re-gaining it if the mob aggros on a group member at any distance from them quite challenging.<br />
<br />
-- Conclusion<br />
<br />
Knights essentially match Warriors &quot;....in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knights are better able than Warriors to make &quot;....themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since Knights also have numerous spells useful in the group setting, they have become the prefered MT's in experiance groups.<br />
<br />
There is little reason for Warriors to exist as a distinct class if they are only needed to MT difficult raid mobs while in the majority of the content Knight's are equipped to fill the Warrior Class Description better than Warriors themselves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree wholeheartedly.  Next thing you know there will be a 25% defensive  Disc or aa ability for Knights (with 75% of their DPS intact).  <br />
<br />
Yes, I am being sarcastic ... but it really wouldnt' surprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It would be much more honest of SoE to simply describe a Warrior as a &quot;Knight lacking spell casting abilities but possessing the Defensive discipline and the ability to Dual Weild which allows them to reduce their DPS and take more reposte damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
If I overlooked anything significant or made a fudamental misrepresentation post a reply. I'll edit if I agree. I think it's important for us to make our case and show not only failure to maintain the Warrior class but the consequences of that failure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">from the descriptions from http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp <br />
one is lead to beleive that pallies are the defensive tank, shadow knights are the offensive tank, and warriors are in the middle.<br />
<br />
do warriors need some improvements? yes they do, should get ablilities to mange agro on par with a knight's ability without useing the RNG. <br />
say for example... something like a ability that has hate like the shadow kinghts terrror spell line, be lvl based, and have a instant cast time, but have a reuse time of say 1 min. that would take care of the snap agro problem.<br />
and for the ranged agro, have another ability that was the same as the above but have it work up to 100.<br />
and to make it a bit more balance they could both use the same refresh time.<br />
<br />
this i feel would put all tanking classes on par for agro management<br />
<br />
for those with no knowledge of the shadow knight line it is like EB but the lvl 65 spell is for 600 and eb is for 700, if the things i read are true.<br />
disclaimer all numbers are just for the example and would need work to be balanced out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was just thinking.. wouldnt it be neat if warriors and monks got a spell bar, much the same as casters and knights have, but instead of spells got special attacks that would execute spell like effects when done successfully (not miss). like for example, warriors could get ..<br />
<br />
* Surgical Strike - 50% chance of crippling the target, effectively snaring (30% reduced movement), slowing the target (30% reduced attack speed), or Weakening the target when performed. &quot;reuse time&quot; of 2 minutes, duration of effect 30 seconds. Should have a fair amount of taunt value, even if not successful.<br />
<br />
* Crushing Blow - 50% chance of stunning the target for 6 seconds when performed. Reuse time of 2 minutes, and again, there should be a fair amount of hate involved in trying to execute this move ..<br />
<br />
* Raging Fury - Lets the warrior enter Berserker Frenzy at will, for 1 minute, with 5 minutes reuse time.<br />
<br />
etc etc etc.. the possibilities for tweaking and adjusting such a system is endless, and that is what the warriors lack now. A viable way to get tweaked, without becoming completely overpowered.<br />
<br />
Pretty much DAoC's style system, adjusted for melee in EQ. This would be an easy way to tweak and upgrade warriors and monks without overpowering or breaking the classes completely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Graderr,<br />
<br />
What part of the first sentence from the Warrior Class Desription was confusing?<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense...&quot;<br />
<br />
The Warrior Class Description basically says Warrior=Main Tank.<br />
<br />
The Paladin Class Description states that they are melee, have special abilities against undead, and can heal.<br />
<br />
It might be more convenient for some classes if this wasn't so, but it is.<br />
<br />
You can quibble and say Warriors should only be especially able to tank the biggest mob and /defensive gives them that. But when that mob is dead, I'm ready to tank what has become the biggest mob and my /defensive is down.<br />
<br />
You can nitpick and suggest we are only guaranteed the Taunt skill. Fine, then SoE needs to fix the Taunt skill so Warriors can dependably make &quot;themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Class Descriptions are at the link Graderr provided. See what you think.<br />
<br />
I'm not editing the initial post on this thread to reflect Graderr's conclusions.<br />

<br />
Give  warriors a 10dps boost and add in a new skill that will reduce the amount of riposte's when dual wielding.  Put warriors on their own mitigation table that gives them 10% more mitigation then knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">would probly be the rest of the sentance....<br />
<br />
taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath-warrior description<br />
<br />
and the same statment in the pally description-but in a group a paladin really shines, going head to head with his enemies and occasionally falling back to heal. <br />
<br />
to me they both say the same thing. am pretty sure that this section is for class balances, am only tring to help come up with a reasonable way to fix the problems.<br />
<br />
one of which is the problem with agro, and seems to be the only reason kinghts are preffered over warriors in exp groups.<br />
<br />
aanya's idea sounds nice to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agro without damage has to remain the domain of the knight.  Warriors could get added ways to agro, but it must come at the cost of doing damage to mobs.  <br />
<br />
The reason for this is because warriors are designed around the idea of main tank.  Knights are designed aroudn being offtanks.  When changes do occur warriors will be made so they are wanted for MT.  When that happens knights must be able to be the premier offtank or they will have no job at all.<br />
<br />
That is why I believe any changes need to be made to something other then agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ok then how about a revamp of the offensive disc's..<br />
something along the lines of adding to the dps, and a small amount of extra hate when those disc's are used, and with lower reuse times wiht short durations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chavr,<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure Warriors aren't expecting SoE to deliver on it's marketing hype when it says &quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat....&quot; All melee need upward adjustment.<br />
<br />
Providing Warrior only help with repostes and increasing Warrior mitigation would restore the combat survivability advantage we are entitled to - but... Is it a true advantage when in 90% of the content Knights have more than adequate survivability?<br />
<br />
If it only takes 7000HP's to tank effectively in PoP then how is having 10000HP's an offsetting benefit equalling the value of snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro? It isn't. Warriors are not the first to die in experiance groups - Enchanters and Clerics are. It all boils down to snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro.<br />
<br />
The statement the &quot;Agro without damage has to remain the domain of the knight.&quot; is demonstrably incorrect. The method explicitly identified in the Class Descriptions, Taunt, does not cause damage. Swollen Fungusbeast Glands and Crystalline Silk Nets don't cause damage either. Objecting to Warriors producing aggro without causing damage and at a distance because it would leave no role for Knights is spurious. We can already do these things, just not conveniently.<br />
<br />
Knights do not have to out MT Warriors in order to offtank. Their ability to tank effectively and their wealth of other abilities guarantee them preference in that role as well as continued opprotunity to MT.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>OlavSkulcrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Battleblade is one of those who gets it and speaks very articulately, Chavr. I truly do not mean to belittle you, but you don't quite get it. If warriors are not better at tanking than any of the other tank classes, then warriors have only /defensive as a reason to exist. When I say tanking, I don't just mean hps/ac, either. Survivability (HP/AC), melee damage output and skills, and aggro control all factor into what it means to tank.<br />
<br />
Whether it's the long-dead 'Vision'(TM) or current class descriptions, the only thing that makes sense for EQ classes is this:<br />
<br />
Knights = good tanks + special skills and abilities<br />
Warriors = best tanks<br />
<br />
SK's special abilities and skills tend to be offensive oriented, with both group and self-benefits.<br />
<br />
Paladins abilities are defensive oriented, except for their undead slaying.<br />
<br />
Balance between knights and warriors would have warriors be enough better at tanking to make a difference and knights special abilities making up that difference in terms of desirability to a potential group. How get warriors back to where they should be without tipping the scale too far is the reason for this section of the forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Warriors *right now* have better mitigation than Paladins and SKs.  The trick is that is all they have.<br />
<br />
Tanking flatly and plainly does not stack.  There is no amount of tanking that will ever make up for the flexibility gained by simply having other skills available.  Honestly, how much better should Warriors tank than anyone else?  The amount doesn't matter.  You will still end up with a class that is till very much group unfriendly continuing to contribute little to the group.<br />
<br />
For those who believe mitigation is the way to balance Knights, then what happens when you have Warriors tanking far away better than any other class in the game and you have two Warriors available?  Congrats!  You've created dead weight.  One Warrior with all of their super dooper mitigation is only going to be useful when the other dies.  What a great group role!  More mitigation doesn't balance against SKs and Paladins let alone other Warriors.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is not the answer.  In fact, mitigation seems fine.  The solution seems to be giving Warriors more skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I started this thread to get people to read SoE's Class Discriptions and think about the roles SoE has layed out for the various classes. If SoE made the necessary game changes so that the Warrior Class Description was more fact and less hype then things WOULD get dramatically better for Warriors.<br />
<br />
Main Tanks need survivability and competitive aggro abilities to prosper.<br />
<br />
Knights had difficulty finding groups during the Kunark era because they did not have sufficient survivability. The current environment has removed the survivability issue and they are thriving.<br />
<br />
Warriors have good survivability but lack adequate (compared with Knights) aggro abilities. Remove this issue and they will thrive.<br />
<br />
I believe there is widespread agreement that Warriors need improved aggro abilities.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
I disagree with Aeka that tanks don't stack. They stack more now than ever because of LDoN. A second tank is DPS, an offtank, a safety net if the MT dies, etc. If there's already a melee in a group, another is wonderful!!<br />
<br />
Aeka then suggests the real problem is that Warriors are too focused, they lack flexability.<br />
<br />
Paladins have suggested that if Warriors were given snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro then it would be Kunark all over again. In other words, they are claiming that all of the utility that a Knight possesses is not enough to get them into a group.<br />
<br />
Enlarging the role of Warriors isn't a bad idea, but we need to have competative aggro abilities - otherwise we will become a poor imitation Knight, no longer a Warrior, and not an experiance group Main Tank.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Enlarging the role of Warriors isn't a bad idea, but we need to have competative aggro abilities - otherwise we will become a poor imitation Knight, no longer a Warrior, and not an experiance group Main Tank.<br />
<br />
Dead on the money. Give all tanks 'relative' equivalence in 'tanking' (survivability and aggro) and only then can you expect balance via additional abilities. I wouldn't mind a few more skills but would be willing to wait and see wether they plus my slight tanking advantage were required to make me viable. Course I think the balance point of aggro should be 'lower' than knights, 'higher' than current warriors :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">here is a idea, fix the agro something like this...<br />
give 2 abilities to the tank at a fairly young age, say lvl 9 (since that is when knights get spells) up till then it is pretty balanced in my view.<br />
<br />
one is a ranged push button EB, say have it start with increasing warriors hate on the hate list by 10(or a balanced low number) then have it increase every lvl or ever other lvl till it is 600-650 hate on hatelist at 65.  have it also have a casting time of .5 sec ( to balance with a knights casting of spells, and allow for interrupts). and a reuse time of say 30 sec to a min( or a balanced number to similate a knights mana and casting). have this frist ability be short ranged of like 10-15.<br />
<br />
the second is the same as the frist one, only diff is it would have a longer range, say 100-150.<br />
<br />
these 2 abilities would let warriors gain the snap agro and the ranged agro equal or near equal to a knight, as close as you can get the numbers twiked.<br />
<br />
but at the same time you give the warriors these 2 abilities, let knights have almost, i say again almost, the same amount of hp and ac. but having warriors have a slight edge on the knights in ac and hp, but let the knights have a slight edge on the ranged and snap agro.<br />
<br />
this way both the knights and the warriors make the pretty much the same kinda tank for exp groups, but would also let raids keep the same structure they have now.<br />
<br />
want i am sure no one wants to see happen is either the knights or the warriors back in the spot of not getting exp groups.<br />
<br />
warriors could stack a bit better in groups, like knights do, with these 2 abilities letting either one get agro off the weak casters and healers. while one warrior is mt the other could go with the dps weapon setup. without worring about making sure they have agro procing weapons incase agro is lost.<br />
<br />
should not be always take the warrior, and should not always be take the knight, in exp groups. granted some people will still have thier prefreance, but that is something that will never change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I believe that ultimately there should not be a great deal of difference between a Warrior or a Knight tanking.<br />
<br />
I think the balance point should be that while Knights require more attention to keep alive, this is offset by the spells they are able to use to the group's benefit. While Warriors are easier to keep alive, they bring little added value to the group beyond their slightly higher DPS. (I do concure with Aeka's observation that some utility does need to be found for Warriors so they are not deadweight when not MTing).<br />
<br />
Knights ought to be able to MT difficult mobs. The cost of having them do it instead of a Warrior would be the need to chain cast Vie and or Rune at the start of the fight and over the cource of the fight require slightly higher mana expendature for healing.<br />
<br />
Warriors (and perhaps Knights) could use an offensive and defensive mode with DPS and mitigation adjusted accordingly. Disciplines should be clustered into defensive and offensive groups with their own independant timers. Shields ought to have an inate chance to block repostes and adjustments from the ability to generate Hate with a shield to increasing the DPS of Warrior weilded 1Hdrs when a shield is used need to be done. Aggro abilities need to be adjusted so that they are roughly equal even if accomplished by different means.<br />
<br />
I will admit that I'm a little uncomfortable we  go beyond suggestions and act as hypothetical designers. It's the designers job to design, I just wish they'd get on with it and the outcome of their efforts address major customers concerns like this.<br />
<br />
The problem I foresee is that SoE needs to do all of these things at the same time - a general overhaul and test the result thoroughly or adroitly bring in the changes so as to avoid meaningful imbalances. Neither Warriors or Knights should have an overwhelming advantage at the expence of the other class(es) that lasts for months. We've been down that road and I would hope our memories of how it feels to be on the short end would cause us all to want to see imbalance avoided.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How though?  How do you give warriors a tanking edge at the cost of utility while at the same time allowing knights to be able to tank with more utility?<br />
<br />
<br />
I think everyone pretty much agrees with what you said, the crux of the matter is how to make it happen effectively.<br />
<br />
Do warriors need increased taunt and mitigation?<br />
<br />
Do warriors need added skills that help them mitigate better and more items with hate procs?<br />
<br />
Should any changes be strictly thru disciplines?<br />
<br />
Should warriors get snap agro or should they get better agro, just not as fast as knights?<br />
<br />
<br />
These are the questions that are being argued.  I think everyone on both sides of the situation agree warriors should be the best tank while knights are good tanks with spells.  The problem lies in trying to find the degree of seperation and the means by which that seperation occurs.<br />
<br />
Everyone also pretty much agrees disciplines need to have seperate timers and that they need looked at and adjusted.  Disciplines should be something that add fun to being a melee, not something you have to horde and worry about, or neglect completely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think I can handle the easiest question you pose.<br />
<br />
Do warriors need increased taunt and mitigation? <br />
<br />
Warriors have enough mitigation to get the job done while still maintaining some risk. As much as we detest the /defensive discipline there has to be some method that works dependably to allow Warriors to absorb the shock of initial contact with an unslowed hard hitting mob. Repostes are another story however. I would prefer that SoE lightens up with them. Under heavy repostes Dual Weilding is a disadvantage that pretty much eliminates the Warrior HP advantage. The scarcity of 2H aggro weapons forces many warriors to weild BoC and another weapon.<br />
<br />
I'm able to hold aggro moderately well with Taunt and 2 aggro weapons. I'm not overly concerned with the Taunt button. But with what feels like low proc rates combined with the fickleness of the random number generator it can be touch and go.<br />
<br />
The real aggro issue IMO is that the RNG can turn on you and it can be quite difficult to establish initial aggro or get it back should you lose it. Frankly the RNG makes losing aggro appear to be an arbitrary event. Some method of obtaining snap aggro is needed.<br />
<br />
In addition losing aggro often means chasing the mob, often with raid or group members dying while you find it, run it down, and wait for Lady Luck to smile at you (the almighty RNG to give you a break). Some method to obtain ranged aggro is needed.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, having both snap aggro and ranged aggro, Knights are quite reluctant to give up what everyone aggrees is a huge advantage. I assume that the ability to MT all but the largest mobs in raids (and those too with a bit of effort) would be adequate &quot;balance&quot; weighed against a little equality in aggro ability.<br />
<br />
The problem is that many Knights are having their cake and eating it too - good survivability and excellent aggro abilities. Despite a general concencious that Warriors need their aggro abilities improved, some Knights are strongly opposed.<br />

 I guess my point is that there is so little difference in tanking ability between knights and nondefensive warriors that its not even worth mentioning. So in my mind  its our 3 min defensive balanaced against all the utility and percs of being a hybrid which there are too many of to get into.<br />

As Furor once said &quot;I won't play second fiddle to Knights. I don't give a fuck.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tanks really don't stack.  You need one tank per monster engaged.  Throwing 5 tanks at one monster does nothing to improve tanking.  Other skills like &quot;CC&quot; stack poorly but at least you can benifit a little by having multiples around.  Damage at range for instance stacks extremely well.  You can keep adding DPS at range without interferring with each other.<br />
<br />
The other reason why I suggest an expandsion of skills is that it will also solve the agro problem.  If you have more skills, some of which can be detrimental actions against monsters, then agro will naturally follow by form and function.  It tackles two problems at once.  Contrary to what Thaak belives, it isn't the agro from stuns that is the winner.  Its the fact I have 4 actions I can take to gain agro instead of the 1 Warriors have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Here's how I see it supposed to be working.  Mob is coming in.  Warrior jumps on it.  He should be able to get enough agro that slow can land without mob jumping targets.  I agree that the RNG is a poor way of doing this.  I'd say that taunt should do a fixed amount of hate, but it also has a max cap per mob.  Generate hate but slower then knights and with a cap on it.<br />
<br />
At the same time the knights are there ready for adds to come in.  Knights use fast agro to grab adds attention while mez/slow/root happens.  <br />
<br />
The warrior is on the most critical mobs using his superior tanking while the knights use lesser tanking on the lesser adds.<br />
<br />
That is why I don't give a rats ass what furor wants or says about agro.  If warriors have the best agro and the best tanking knights have no job.  PERIOD.  Furor can lick it for all I care.<br />
<br />
The problems with the way I see it is that pop pretty much removed adds from exp groups.  LDoN brought them back, but not enough time has passed for peoples perceptions to change.  Raids always have the worry of adds or pops so there is always a need there.<br />
<br />
Disciplines are the counter to hybrid spells.  The problem is the way the current timer setup works.  Disciplines need the offensive/defensive/utility split made and each category on it's own timer.  No discipline for any class should be longer then a 30 min refresh.<br />
<br />
I agree about the riposte issue also.  It needs to be looked at.  Perhaps having rip's do half damage when hitting a dual wielder or something.  Maybe have it so that rip's are only coded for offhand swings or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit-  I forgot to mention that war dps needs to go up some.  It's just a bit too low atm.  War/monk/rogue all three need some boost to that area aside from changes to disc's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Knights are fine the way they are now.  I agree with much of what Battleblade is saying at the moment, except I don't think Knights HP/AC or mitigation need to be improved to compensate for any help that Warriors get.  Also, I don't think Paladins want any part of an Aggessive/Defensive mode.  Warriors need the help to be more balanced, and improving Knights at the same time would mean that Warriors need even more help.<br />
<br />
I would say the majority of Paladins at PoN agree that Warriors need some help, and that an aggro boost is probably the best way to help.  There are a few with other ideas as to what can help Warriors and another few who think Warriors are fine as they are, but they are in the minority.<br />
<br />
My fairly consistent view has been that an ability to help Warriors get initial aggro was the best way to help them.  An ability that generated just about as much hate as a Slow, that was on a 30 second or so timer.  How exactly you package the ability and what you call it are immaterial, it's the effect that matters.<br />
<br />
Recently, the demands seem to have expanded to include ranged aggro as well.  Battleblade has been the point-man for that argument over at PoN, and to some extent here.  When he first started posting about it on PoN, he made a couple specific suggestions, which I though were overpowered and I said so.  This does not mean that I feel the idea of ranged aggro is completely out, simply that it is a different issue and needs to be looked at a bit more carefully.<br />
<br />
Graderr mentions the idea of 2 aggro abilities on a 30 second timer.  I think the amount of aggro he uses is a bit high (600 – 650 hate), especially on the ranged version.  But I like the idea in general.  I would like to see the melee-range ability have higher aggro, enough to counter one cast of slow.  The ranged version should have enough to get aggro from the puller, but not enough to counter slow.  Maybe half the aggro of the first ability.  These abilities should be WAR only.<br />
<br />
This would give the Warrior a way to get aggro focused on him/her on incoming, and then immediately cement it once the mob gets to camp.  It would give Warriors the initial aggro of a Paladin casting Cease on incoming, then Force of Akilae once the mob gets to camp.  Knights would still retain an aggro advantage because our stuns recycle faster, but the advantage would be much closer to the Warriors advantage in HP/AC/Mitigation than is the case now.<br />
<br />
For example, I 2-box an Enchanter on occasion.  If I have the Paladin pull with Cease, and then have the Enchanter Tash the mob, the mob will hit whichever is closest.  Cease, by itself, does not counter Tash or Slow.  But when I pull with Cease and then follow with Force of Akilae, the Chanter can Tash freely, and Slow when her gems reset.  The Cease + Force of Akilae + DPS aggro keeps her from getting hit most of the time.  The abilities discussed above should allow the Warrior to do about the same.<br />
<br />
The only issue I see with this is raid tanking.  My solution to that would be to scale the effect down, or eliminate it altogether, on mobs that are higher level than the Warrior.  Raid encounters are tuned for Warriors tanking and Warrior aggro generation.  These abilities need to address group issues without changing raid issues.   <br />
<br />
Thaak, nefring Stuns will not keep Paladins from generating aggro.  We would have to work harder for it, and use other spells, but we could still do it.  Also, Shadow Knights can hold aggro every bit as well as Paladins.  The reason you are not losing as many groups to Shadow Knights is because there just aren't as many of them.  If there were as many Shadow Knights as Paladins my guess is you would be wanting them nerfed too.<br />
<br />
I understand that many people think nerfing Knight aggro generation is a valid way to address the Warrior groupability problem.  Firstly it would be harder to implement than you think, with unintended consequences.  Secondly, it will just increase the number of groups with NO plate tank at all, leaving more of all three classes /LFG.  Finally, the idea that Paladins need an aggro nerf but Shadow Knights are fine is untenable.<br />

Is the warrior supposed to be precluded from this expansion because he is undesirable due to his ability to aquire and hold aggro?  And should a Paladin with his ability to heal, buff, RESURRECT, LoH etc. etc. be alowed to take over a warriors only real ability (to tank)?  Paladins say yes.  Warriors say WTF!

Who's ideal parameters? <br />
<br />
Paladin and Shadowknight aggro has been well balanced (against each other) since release.  The Shadowknight Hate spells are recent additions.  They were added to compensate for removing aggro from some spells that were effected when a change to disease counters was made.  That change cripples some of their bread and butter aggro abilities, so new spells were given them.  I am unaware of some design scheme that says SK aggro &gt; Warrior aggro &gt; Paladin aggro.   <br />
<br />
In any event, Paladins being able to generate aggro does not step into an SKs skillset.  The pure hate spells were an invented way to try to keep their aggro abilities vis-à-vis Paladins where they had been, not an attempt to redefine the class.<br />
<br />
Also, reducing stun aggro would be bad for many reasons.<br />
<br />
Stuns actually stop the mob's actions for a period of time.  This should be very disturbing to a mob, and it is not surprising that a lot of hate is associated with this.  I can understand the argument that a stun that is unable to affect the target should not cause aggro, but something that completely shuts a mob down for four seconds should have some hate associated with it.  I know I would be pissed if something immobilized me for four seconds.<br />
<br />
If there was very little aggro associated with stuns, then any class who had them could unload them on will.  Stun locking mobs would be very easy in a lot of group and raid situations.  You would see Paladins, Clerics, Enchanters, Wizards, (did I forget anyone) stunning any time that lowering a mobs DPS a bit would be helpful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thaak, and how is making Paladins &quot;work harder&quot; going to help Warriors? ^_^<br />
<br />
SKs and Paladins are balanced against each other because their performance and mechanisms are different.  SK spells are costed and timed differently than Paladin spells.  Unless there is a glaring problem (which no one has pointed out yet) then this seems to be balanced.<br />
<br />
So how come SKs are okay but Paladins aren't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">ok then if agro isn't a SK's role, but is both pallies and SK's then tell me how it is that a pally strips himself from the hate list like a SK's FD?<br />
<br />
since the hate line of spells for a SK they have dam near perfected the getting and losing of agro. hell even before then they was able to control agro. only thing was pre pop it wasn't needed as much as it has been since pop.<br />
<br />
this is how i have always been told the tanks were...<br />
<br />
SK's was the offensive tank, doing more dps then warriors but not being able to take hits as well, with spells to help compensate for it... LT-damage and self heal, LT procs- damage and self heal...etc. but they take a lil bit more damage then warriors do<br />
<br />
pallies was the defensive tank, they did less damage then warriors but made up with it in heals and buffs, and stuns to midagate damage taken<br />
<br />
warriors was the middle ground tank, good offense and good defense, offense not as good as a SK's but better defense then them. offense better then pallies but took more damage do to not stun spells(but added /deff for boss mobs to make then the idea mt on raids)<br />
<br />
this set up gives people choices for who they want to tank in their group. want a tank with great ofense pick the SK, but have to heal them a bit more then the others. want a tank you don't want to heal as much pick the pally, but you spend a lil  bit more time killing the mobs. want a tank that can do good damage and not heal as much pick the warrior.<br />
<br />
that gives every group flexability. druid as the healer in the group=pally tank. shammy as the healer in the group= sk. cleric in the group as the healer= warrior. (granted these are for the ideal set up pairs for the tank classes. any healer would work with any tank just would be a bit more work)<br />
<br />
reasons why i said the pairs as i did-<br />
druid has DS's to help increase the pallies damage output.<br />
shammies have slow to help lesson the damage the SK takes.<br />
clerics and better use the warriors large amount of HP.<br />
(but like i said any healer works with any tank... is all about choices)<br />
that is why agro needs to be fixed with warriors. that is also why i sujested the 2 abilities i did. <br />
<br />
warriors should get better agro then pallies but not better agro then SK's. (based on the damage done scale)<br />
<br />
all should have the chance to fill the role of mt, just better classes for the diff needs... thus being balanced to each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I say reduce ranged aggro from spells to similar levels I can get tagging with an arrow - control of a mob shouldn't be garanteed prior to contact, early slows should create some risk /shrug. <br />
<br />
Aeka - making Paladins work for aggro like a warrior, helps warriors because then that paladin no longer has such a clear advantage in controlling the mob - fairly straight forward reasoning if slightly inconvenient for you. <br />
<br />
Once aggro is 'equal' then you can balance by what else the tank brings to the group. <br />
<br />
One point about SK spells - if they are using the spells expressley designed to generate hate it costs them mana wise - much more so than paladin stuns which are not designed expressly to generate aggro. <br />
<br />
As it is both knight classes can take advantage of sloppy design work which allows them to gain aggro at distance with out much in the way of 'cost'.</div></div><hr />

In my view it either trivializes the game in which case the amount of aggro generated by many spells should be dramatically reduced or eliminated and a number of spells would need to have an effective limit where mobs over level 60 or so were totally unaffected. <br />
<br />
Or it is an essential part of being a tank in which case Warriors should have the same kind and level of ability.<br />
<br />
tank = meaningful survivability + aggro abilities + DPS + other spells, abilities, and effects<br />

Taken as a package, Knights are pretty well constructed and Warriors trail somewhat. Aeka has suggested adding some Warrior utility. That's fine, but a Warrior's aggro abilities are glaringly deficient, they need upgrading.<br />

 Back in the days you're talking about, stuns generated no aggro. Remember, they've also fiddled with aggro generation from whole blocks of spells, some not even Knight related. The changes they made have put you in SK aggro-generation territory.<br />

<br />
Because they're incredibly cheap aggro of course.  What are they, like 10 and 15 mana a cast?  Let's see, if we figure 15 mana a cast and a Paladin has a mana pool of 3200 (figuring a level 65 Paladin with 200 wisdom and  around 400 mana from items) then that would be 213 casts before going OOM with no mana regen figured in at all.<br />
<br />
Now, if we figure in KEI, which does 14 mana per tick, you can see that the Paladin can cast Cease and Desist for almost free.  However, even if a Paladin uses FoA instead of cease and desist, they're still doing pretty well.  If you take that orginal 3200 mana pool, add in the 250 mana KEI gives, plus the 25 wisdom it grants, the Paladin's mana poll jumps to around 3550.  In an hour's time KEI will regen, without any additional flowing thought items or medding, 1400 mana (figured as a tick being 6 seconds).  Which takes the mana poll up to 4950 (that is, the amount of available mana in an hour's time).<br />
<br />
So, a Paladin could cast 76 casts of FoA at a cost of 65 mana each in an hour before going OOM.  This is 1.2 casts a minute.  So as long as the Paladin is using their mana only for FoA (not always possible I grant, but Paladins routinely claim their other spells are meaningless in a group...), they have KEI, and they cast less than 1 FoA a minute, it will be a long long time before they run OOM.</div></div><hr />

Keep spreading the propaganda that you completely suck though and more and more people will begin to believe it.  Then you'll be even worse off then you are now. My point is that if you wanna tank, YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT. I don't think I suck, I think I'm rather good at being a tank. But when Paladin Holyknight comes up casting his lvl 9 spell and out aggroing all my melee, and procs, and taunts off of other members who might have had aggro, I have a problem with that. Having snap-aggro makes this game too easy, and this probably assists in all the dumbshit lvl 65's who can't control aggro for their life. As to my opnion on Shadowknights, I don't think what they have is anything too out of whack... maybe their hate line of spells could be decreased a little. but as a whole I don't see shadowknights as being as big of a problem currently as paladins.</div></div><hr />

The reason for this is because warriors are designed around the idea of main tank. Knights are designed aroudn being offtanks. When changes do occur warriors will be made so they are wanted for MT. When that happens knights must be able to be the premier offtank or they will have no job at all.<br />

<br />
Bzzt. You are wrong for 200. &quot;Knights will have no job at all&quot; is a horribly out-dated cliche. Let me educate you:<br />
<br />
1) Raid roles. Knights, especially paladins, have plenty of shit to do on a raid outside of tanking. Ever been to an AoE fight? How about one where rotation heals don't always cut it? You know, paladins exceed both shamans and druids by a long ways in both categories. They still have the only instant CH (via AA yes, but so is AoE taunt), still have group heal (shamans, druids don't), and they can still do it all while parsing far more DPS than a cleric would be on a raid. <br />
<br />
2) XP tank. Mitigation: give me a break. HP, the gap is too narrow to matter in XP groups. At best, 8khp vs 9khp means dick when you're getting healed for 5. So, it's warrior DPS, which is very negligebly higher than knights vs. agro. Just for arguments sake, mitigation, HP/Ac and disc is easily out-done by knights' spell-book (if you refuse to acknowledge your spell-book as anything other than an agro source, I question your class knowledge). Minor DPS difference vs. major Agro generation superiority, guess what, agro wins every time.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is why I don't give a rats ass what furor wants or says about agro. If warriors have the best agro and the best tanking knights have no job. PERIOD&quot;<br />
<br />
Straw man #1. See raid roles outside of tanking for response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Edit- I forgot to mention that war dps needs to go up some. It's just a bit too low atm. War/monk/rogue all three need some boost to that area aside from changes to disc's.&quot;<br />
<br />
DPS isn't the issue. Furor's idea of 350hate/tick, 150damage/tick innate skill (at 65, scaled down in hate, damage with lower levels), thats the only way I can see adding damage as a valid balancing issue. That + maybe innate enraging blow on 40 second reuse and a 5% innate hp boost, not for XP groups as much as for countering the god-awful itemization plaguing high-end EQ since SoL. <br />
<br />
&quot;Giving warriors knight aggro would trivialize raid content as much as giving knights defensive would.&quot;<br />
<br />
Straw man#2. in 99.9% of raid-encounters, warrior agro ability is the least important concern. It's just harder to lose agro on raids unless people are utterly stupid. If a wizard stands there and chains SoS without bothering to stop or whip out conc, then neither warrior, nor paladin (maybe MAYBE sk) agro can save him from death. Precisely what raids will be trivialized by giving warriors bette agro? <br />
<br />
As the second part of your statement. No way in fucking HELL can you compare giving warriors better agro with giving defensive to either a class that can supplement themselves with fast heals and maintain agro, or FD off in case heal is coming a second late. <br />
<br />
&quot;durck, read the whole post... take note about the part where agro ability for warriors is increased. kk thanx<br />
<br />
Thaak- Warriors are best tank, subpar agro. Paladins are less tank, best agro. <br />
<br />
Warriors are not cast down to the depths of never getting a group. Warriors are not laughed at when they go lfg. Warriors don't have it that durn bad. Yeah, they need work, but they still have plenty of use. <br />
<br />
Keep spreading the propaganda that you completely suck though and more and more people will begin to believe it. Then you'll be even worse off then you are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Straw man #3. Warrior's aren't so bad is the number one rally cry for paladins who don't believe in even their own bullshit excuses for preventing warrior agro upgrades. And that's just what they are, bullshit excuses, not valid reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Some Paladins claim that its cheap agro but I dont' buy it.  Its like claiming using rollerblades is a cheap form of transportation.  Although true it won't work for going hundreds of miles. ^_^<br />

As much FT I have on myself (and I could have more) I can be sustainable if I don't do anything but tank.  With Clarity it gets easier.<br />

In short, using Cease is cheap agro but why be cheap?  Spend a little more and get agro + plus effect.  A Paladin that think they need to chain stun weak spells is clearly being wasteful.  Paladin DPS is poor enough as is without constantly throwing away more.<br />

I'm for giving warriors a bit of a boost in the agro dept.  Somethign they can use in exp groups to help counter the need for fast slows in pop.<br />
<br />
I'm for warriors getting a dps boost so that there is no doubt that warriors with equivalent weapons to knights will always outdamage them.<br />
<br />
No where in this thread did I say that warriors don't suck that much, therefore they should not get work done.  You made that one up from somewhere.<br />
<br />
Heck, I'd even support a small mitigation boost for warriors.  Warriors are the best tanks in equivalent gear, but they can still use a tad bit more of a push ahead.  A tad, not alot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The biggest thing I see with alot of warriors post is how they percieve the current situation.  They went from being head and shoulders above the other two tanks, to being just about even to now being behind when having to counter fast slows.  Now they are wanting to get back to where they were head and shoulders above the other two tanks.  They want large changes that will make them hands down, no questions asked, don't even bother with anyone else, the only sane choice for a tank.  Knights, paladins especially, don't want that to happen.  We want to see warriors more viable for exp groups, but at the same time not to a point where paladins are regulated to utility slot only.  Cause quite frankly, we all know there is no such thing as a utility slot at this time.  Maybe after ldon is out for awhile people will start accepting a utility character in a group, but the current situation doesn't allow it.  Also, the only place for utility is ldon really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, cease is a complete waste of mana.  I have akilea and akirea memmed and don't bother with any other stuns.  Saying that cease is good agro is like saying the rng is a perfectly viable way of letting warriors build agro.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you guys, but I always enjoy having a knight in my group because of what they offer the group. Atk buffs from SK, brells and heals from Pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">It's about time SoE addressed this issue in some way, knights in their more honest moments will admit that they were 'supposed' to be support tanks, providing more to the group as additional tanking but also free to cast spells etc. Sony's paladin description say's they can fight but also 'step back from a fight to heal'. It's the competition for that one tank spot that is our curse, because there will ALWAYS be a favoured class (I'm sure there is now when choosing between a paladin and an SK, there isn't 'balance' between the two classes simply there's enough groups to go around for them whilst the majority of warriors LFG so that a preference doesn't notice).<br />
<br />
If everyone has a shot at the tank slot then people will still choose a favourite and someone in the name of god tell me why that favourite should be a Knight (Tank plus spells) over a warrior (TANK)? The design of the game is flawed, it needs fixing, but I don't see why the warrior class is the 'acceptable' choice of fall guy. We chose to do without the fancy spellbook because we thought we'd be needed, knights choose to be a 'lesser tank' to gain the advantage of spells. Despite what many charity case  knights say, even back in Kunark those spells (whilst not getting them groups well enough) helped their play experience just travelling about and yes, soloing, duoing. I spent a large percentage of my 40's - 50's duoing with a Paladin friend - which  of us two made that possible eh? My dps and durability helped but my friends heals, rooting of runners, stuns to mitigate damage etc made it possible. This being back in the kunark dark ages.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the grief lack of spells caused me over the course of my career to the 'rewards' of where I am now it all seems a pretty sick joke, heh. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">In my honest moments, I expect a Paladin to be as good of a tank in an experience group as a Warrior.  A group looking for a tank for a normal exp grind situation should be able to flip a coin as to which to take.  I expect a Warrior to be a bit better than a Paladin against experience mobs that hit harder, and a Paladin should be a bit better in situations where mobs don't hit so hard and their spells are most useful.  <br />
<br />
This is beyond the idea of 'support tank', at least in experience groups.  If Knights were 'support tanks' then every group fighting in viable experience zones would be better off with a Warrior tanking than a Knight.  Asking for one class to be nearly required for normal groups is not workable when there are 15 classes in the game. <br />
<br />
Right now, a Paladin makes a better tank in most experience groups than a Warrior.  This is a problem.  There are some decent ideas for changes in this thread (and a million others), some made by Paladins.  The goal of these changes should be to make the WAR/PAL/SHD viable and equal choices for an experience group tank, while preserving the raid roles of each.<br />

I disagree Kiztent.  Agro for Warrior MTs is one of the surest things in the entire encounter.  You have an entire guild working together to make sure the Warrior never looses agro.  It is my experience, and I would hazard to guess its true for everyone else as well, that wipeouts happen more because something interferring with casters than MT loosing agro. <br />
<br />
Fair enough, but imagine if the guild worked toward maximizing DPS instead of keeping aggro on the warrior.  That means faster deaths, which makes for less time for AEs to chew through melees, making encounters... easier.  I don't think it would mean that guild clearing HoT will get time flagged in a week or anything like that, but it will make it easier to learn encounters. Although some PoP encounters minimize this, so maybe it's not a huge deal.<br />
<br />
And Valeris...<br />
<br />
Totally agree with your comments about 1 tank slot and a favorite for it.  But... If warriors knew what PoP would be before PoP happened, would they be any less vocal about stopping it from happening than knights are about not wanting to go back to second class grouping citizens?<br />
<br />
Tanking is a zero sum game.  Each group has one and only one (pre-LDoN).  If warriors are preferred tanks, knights aren't. If knights are, warriors aren't.<br />
<br />
I know it's fun for others to wave the utility flag around, but either that utility gets knights groups over warriors (snap aggro in PoP), or it doesn't. And if it doesn't, it doesn't make a bit of difference what it actually does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">...Except it does make a difference kiz because it provides you with bonuses (greater freedom of movement, less dependancy on others etc) OUTSIDE the experience grind and you do gain benefit from them when you get a group when not tanking. <br />
<br />
I didn't make the game as it is and indeed I concede as do most others that whilst it's messed up I have to expect knights to be able to compete with me, doesn't change the fact that (theoretically speaking) just making you equal tanks is actually already accepting a 'nerf' of warriors  - better if they fix the goddamn game (if they can).<br />

This is total crap. That utility matters. This word game knights love to play with &quot;utility&quot; is really annoying.

I am always amused at this ironic situation.  The Warrior MT is the player who contributes the least to their agro generation.

<br />
Yes, it does include the entire ability set.  The problem is that warriors want to remove all the utility relating to getting groups and suddenly hold up the utility that doesn't matter to getting groups as if it's important to getting groups.<br />
<br />
Without going through each spell in my spell books, I will tell you what my spells get me that benefits my usual role in a group (tank):<br />
1 - aggro (lots of spells)<br />
2 - healing/mitigation (lifetaps and lifetap procs in this case, I don't load group AC taps)<br />
3 - DPS (spears and lifetaps)<br />
<br />
Is the amount of healing I can do with my lifetaps going to get me a group over a warrior? No.<br />
Is my DPS going to get me a group over a warrior? No. Tank DPS is a joke next to DPS classes, and I don't have a noticable DPS advantage over a warrior (except every 72 minutes when I can drop a harm touch).<br />
Is my aggro going to get me groups over a warrior? Yes.<br />
<br />
But the warrior agenda is to take the knight's edge in aggro away, so I will have nothing to offer with my spell book that gives me an edge over a warrior for a group.<br />
<br />
Is this reality? That is, does my spell book provide no real benefit? No.  It's provides a lot of utility and benefit.  I know about the benefits a spell book provides.  That's not the point. The point is, what do groups want? Aside from possibly a few psychopathic rogues, no one is going to take a SKs over a warrior for group ATK buffs.<br />
<br />
I've heard all the arguements.  I can FD pull - thanks, welcome to last year. Yea, FD is nice for avoiding a wipe and dragging, if anyone cared with graveyeards and rez sticks being as common as they are.  I can Invis (self only) AND invis to undead.  Somehow, as much as I like it, I don't see it getting me group invites (wait, wait, drop the enchanter, the SK will ITU us OMG INVITE HIM NOW).<br />
<br />
Maybe Tugurok in searching through my spell book, you've found something that isn't mitigation or health related, not a DPS boost and not an aggro spell that would get a group invite over a warrior with more HP, better AC and the same aggro (the last of which is currently not true but what warriors want and the first two, true or not are perceived to be true so don't bother comparing elemental sets or whatever).  If you have, feel free to share it with me.<br />
<br />
You can even post numbers if you want. Conclusively prove that warriors have no HP advantage. Won't matter one bit - everyone THINKS you have a HP advantage, and what people think is what determines group invites.<br />
<br />
I know I've seen the lists of utility before, so don't bother rattling off how I can FD (useless for group invites since lull revamp), have a pet (DPS), lifetaps (HP/AC), group buffs (the day I get invited for my group buffs, we'll talk - they're mostly DPS and HP/AC anyway).  I'll make an exception for Zevfeers (which I don't have but have seen in operation).  That's a damn fine spell.<br />
<br />
Or, heck, come up with a situation where my spells will benefit a group with a warrior tank more than some other class.  Prove the utility slot that I say doesn't exist exists. Don't bother with FD - monks have it and way more DPS (which is all you need once you have a tank and a cleric).  Same with rangers (and wizards) and snare. Necros get all the same tap buffs as well as way more DPS.<br />
<br />
Once again, it's nice to wave the utility flag around, but it's a red herring - at least as far as grouping goes. My spell book either enhances my tanking ability - which is moot if the warrior has every perceived advantage as they are asking for - or doesn't matter to getting a group because I have no role besides tank as a result of my spells.<br />
<br />
Or let me put it another way...<br />
<br />
Warriors can have defensive and tank all the boss mobs, and the knights will settle for the exp group tanks.  Fair enough right? You have something that brings no perceived benefit to a group, so you should be passed over for groups as a result. Doesn't sound as good when it's the other way, does it.  Warriors handwaving and commenting about how defensive doesn't matter for exp groups is different than the handwaving you complain knights are doing how?<br />
<br />
And Valeris, I don't think anyone who isn't a warrior will agree with that assertion.  You shouldn't be as desirable for groups because you can invis yourself? Right.</div></div><hr />

If people have to expend less effort to do something, it is generally considered easier.  Now, everyone has to work to make sure the warrior keeps aggro. If warriors had better aggro, they would have to work less to let them keep it.  Sounds easier to me.<br />

If that was true, there wouldn't be a difference between warriors.  Any yahoo with a BoC could hold aggro as well as the most skilled warrior.

I'm one of those who want parity.<br />
<br />
Once a class has enough HP's and mitigation and competative aggro abilities they get to MT. DPS and Utility is icing, not the cake.<br />
<br />
When Knights had inadaquate HP's and mitigation they were often /lfg (Kunark era). Even when they did MT, it was a struggle for them compared to a Warrior at the same level.<br />
<br />
Now that this is no longer an issue for them in exp groups, they have set a new standard for obtaining and holding aggro.<br />
<br />
All Warriors are asking for is adequate snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro.<br />
<br />
Frankly the attitude of some Knights astounds me. They are not looking for parity in a game where SoE describes Warriors as:<br />
<br />
&quot;....umatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; and able to make &quot;....themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some Knights want to maintain a overwhelming advantage in a central MT characteristic in experiance groups while having ever increasing ability to MT raid mobs.<br />
<br />
Well, survivability and focusing the mob on us is our thing - not yours. We are expected to be content with Knights MTing and for the most part we are. But to suggest we shouldn't have at least parity is pretty arrogant. Read the Class Descriptions.<br />
<br />
And any yahoo with a spellbook can out aggro any Warrior. Kinda trivializes what you claim ought to be skill doncha think?<br />

Yes, I am. It is the product manufacturer's description.There is nothing more authoritative. Even the assertions made by their representatives are less dependable - they report what they believe to be true and what they've heard at the time. But it's not necessarily settled policy.<br />
<br />
Consumers have a reasonable expectation that making allowences for marketing hype (New! Exciting! Cleaner! Brighter!) a company's representations are accurate.<br />
<br />
In some cases a product needs to be modifed in ways that no longer allow it to comply with product information. In such cases the information is altered to fit the facts.<br />

Please let us all know what source of information you rely on that is more authoritative than the Class Descriptions. If it's the actual game, then either the game or the Class Descriptions need to change - an excersize SoE conducted 6 weeks ago.<br />

Under equal circumstances, SK's can parse higher than a monk, not mentioning the group atk buffs yet. Hmm, monk, or equal damage-dealing plate class with more HP/AC/better agro/group atk buffs. Good question. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard all the arguements. I can FD pull - thanks, welcome to last year. Yea, FD is nice for avoiding a wipe and dragging, if anyone cared with graveyeards and rez sticks being as common as they are. I can Invis (self only) AND invis to undead. Somehow, as much as I like it, I don't see it getting me group invites (wait, wait, drop the enchanter, the SK will ITU us OMG INVITE HIM NOW).<br />
<br />
Maybe Tugurok in searching through my spell book, you've found something that isn't mitigation or health related, not a DPS boost and not an aggro spell that would get a group invite over a warrior with more HP, better AC and the same aggro (the last of which is currently not true but what warriors want and the first two, true or not are perceived to be true so don't bother comparing elemental sets or whatever). If you have, feel free to share it with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pretend to sound disappointed and you down-grade your spell book. But, I'll bet that if SK's lost their non-agro spells, your mouth would be running about how SoE took away all your useful spells. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors can have defensive and tank all the boss mobs, and the knights will settle for the exp group tanks. Fair enough right? You have something that brings no perceived benefit to a group, so you should be passed over for groups as a result. Doesn't sound as good when it's the other way, does it. Warriors handwaving and commenting about how defensive doesn't matter for exp groups is different than the handwaving you complain knights are doing how?<br />
<br />
And Valeris, I don't think anyone who isn't a warrior will agree with that assertion. You shouldn't be as desirable for groups because you can invis yourself? Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hail, read my post about knight raid-roles about tanking.<br />
<br />
&quot;If people have to expend less effort to do something, it is generally considered easier. Now, everyone has to work to make sure the warrior keeps aggro. If warriors had better aggro, they would have to work less to let them keep it. Sounds easier to me.<br />
<br />
My original statement is that giving warriors aggro like a knight would trivialize the game as much as giving knights defensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can re-build your straw-man all you want, it won't make a goddamn difference, because it still can't stand the winds of truth. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, on 99.9% of raid encounters, keeping agro on the warrior ISN'T what makes the encounter hard. In situations where it is, usually it's clerics agro on Cheal, and I can bet knights would be pressed for agro here too. On other encounters, warriors can keep agro fine. Raids can afford 3-5 seconds to let the warrior establish. And your original statement, that I've already utterly rebutted is idiotic at best.<br />

<br />
this might just get us more groups because clerics could heal us less often, and perhaps use some of their nukes sparingly, or have more mana to buff others in the group for once, this would also mean a shaman and a druid can heal a warrior just fine, but if you go with a paladin or SK you have to also get a cleric, which i think is fair.<br />
<br />
thing about 2 warriors getting a group, that wouldnt happen, they would also invite a pally, to res at 90% is a damn good reason to have one, since they almost always survive the worst fights with LoH and stuns to stop mob dmg output for short times, and if the cleric dies, NP the knight can res him, or the SK can give out dmg buffs if we didnt have room for a chanter but still need more tanking power<br />
<br />
finally, as for skills, this is a excellent idea but sony couldnt ever implyment it correctly as they are retards with special abilitys, seems the only melee they care about is the one in EQ2 and EQ:AO in which the warrior/monk/rogue STA bar means something: special attacks</div></div><hr />

Nice idea, but past adequate AC and HP's more doesn't do much.<br />
<br />
A Shaman can already heal a Paladin just fine. Their buff lines compliment each other nicely and of course the Shaman can Slow.<br />
<br />
A Druid is not as good a fit because the buffs won't provide as many HP's and Druids can't Slow. It can be done, primarily because Druids are better healers, but not as effectively. I've always aggro kitted with Druids. I freely admit I didn't level my Paladin past 52, so I'm not sure partnering with a Druid works beyond that.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I haven't played an SK past 61. When partnering, I generally try not to get hit. Mostly I've either fear kited, aggro kited, or root dotted.<br />
<br />
Interestingly the spell book that Knights dismiss out of hand not only makes them strong in groups, but able to partner much more effectively than Warriors and even solo at a reduced experiance rate.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid the Knights' Advantage permiates every part of the game short of the hardest hitting mobs. I've no doubt that by chain Runeing to get past the shock of initial contact even some of the Planar avatars can be MT'd by them.<br />

If you wanted to be as good at tanking why didn't you create a warrior then? Choices were made, you got a raft load of useful additional abilities where warriors accepted a limited skill set based squarely around TANKING. Why is it either a surprise or  'unfair' to suggest that a warrior by nature of his choices should have the edge in tanking? <br />
<br />
Answer, it isn't.<br />
<br />
When people look for a healer in a group they almost always pick a cleric over a druid, when people look for a slower they almost always pick a shaman over an enchanter, why therefore is it so terribly unfair in comparison that when looking for a tank people  almost always pick a warrior over a knight? The fact that you don't get enough groups otherwise is rather immaterial to the basic logic.<br />
<br />
 It's a damn shame that SoE screwed up and gave you no clear  niche in a group, but that isn't MY fault now is it?  However i and the rest of my class are berated for our selfishness when we ask  even for PARITY in an exp group 'cause all those poor knights who've conveniently forgotten the fringe benefits they reaped from their spell book throughout their career's want  to keep a totally unbalanced advantage. <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
I imagine this is the viewpoint that leads many warriors to believe knights to be whiney primadonna's. Certainly the sympathy I felt towards knights in Kunark is long gone now. :p<br />

Except that the Warrior position is supported by the Class Descriptions. Inconvenient isn't it.<br />
<br />
Things would work out just fine if Knights didn't for all practical purposes match Warriors match or exceed central Warior chrateristics like matching them &quot;....in their ability to survive....&quot; while simutainiously having a greater ability to make &quot;....themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trying to make the case that Wariors should be redefined as something other than Main Tanks isn't even subtle.<br />

Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hhahahaha, way to pull stuff out of context and use it to say whatever you want it to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles&quot; is the quote you like to use, but you leave out the important part.  &quot;When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills,&quot;.  <br />
<br />
When you look at the ENTIRE sentence you see that warriors are unmatched when it comes to armor and defensive skills.  SOE has given you every part of that description.<br />
<br />
Prove me wrong though.  Show me a warrior at any level of the game in ,equivalant gear to a paladin at the same level, that has less hp/ac then the paladin.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at your other misquote.  &quot;making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;  You left out &quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents&quot;, which is a true statement.  Warriors use taunt and AE taunt to focus the mobs attacks on them.  How is that not a true statement?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />

SoE doesn't deliver on &quot;making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks,&quot; if Wariors lack competative abilities to accomplish this. This is a Warrior Class characteristic. I'm not sure y'all should even be able to hold taunt at all - it's not in your class description.<br />
<br />
Ya see bud, this is the Warrrior Class Description. It's what makes Warriors different from Knights. Except the child is now saying they should be better than the parent.<br />
<br />
You show me in your class description that your class should effectively match Warrior suvivability and out taunt them. Come on, quote your whole class description here, we'd love to see the foundation for your case that you should be a more effective MT than a Warrior of the same level.<br />

You can't because that is not what is being said.  Paladins just dont' want to see warriors get adjustments to an extent that we are no longer even a choice for tank, be it off tank or MT.  Been there, done that, thank you anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
No where does it say in the class description warriors should be the best at taunt.  NOT ONE SINGLE TIME.  It says &quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;  Show me where that says you will have the best taunt in the game.  Show me where it says no one else can have better taunt.<br />

Warriors need an effective taunt, yes.  The best taunt should never, ever go to warriors though.  That would remove the primary job of knights.<br />

Your wanting to be flat out the only choice for tank, but there are three tank classes.  Your just gonna have to learn to share is all.  Warriors had it good for so long it's very hard for them to realize they can't be king of the hill anymore.</div></div><hr />

Paladins get what, 5.5 hp per sta at 60? That's 1/2 an HP difference per sta.<br />

Now we got a warrior with 255 sta, with saay... 1500 raw hp in items.<br />

1530 - 1420.5 = 127.5 hp difference.<br />

And the 100-150 AC difference is marginal, and doesn't make a big difference.<br />

And then about the taunt thing, YOU DON'T FIX CLASSES WITH AAS AND GEAR.<br />
<br />
AE Taunt is a crutch. It's like a kid has a broken leg, with his bone sticking out, and you put peroxide on it (which doesn't get rid of the germs, just poofs then up and gives you a chemical burn, but enough of that) so it doesn't get infected. The core of the problem is the bone, not the cut.<br />
<br />
Yes, we have taunt. So do you. We have AE taunt  with a very small range, you have spells that have ranges from far away. You can cast a stun every 3.5 seconds, at the least. We AE taunt every 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Like I've said before, Paladins get their first stun in their first set of spells at level 9; Warriors have to wait until they are at least level 59 and spend 23 aa points.

Give me a break.<br />
<br />
Your attempt at math was wrong too.  You tried to say that if they have the exact same hp from gear, but the fact is, every piece of warrior only designed gear has better stats then the equivalent piece of paladin only gear.  Trying to overlook this is just foolish.  Warriors will always have more hp and more ac then equivalently geared paladins.  <br />
<br />
Warriors get taunt at level 1.  Trying to say it takes them 59 levels is absurd.  No, they don't have ae taunt till atleast 59, but paladins never get an ae taunt.  We have to target each and every mob if we want to be sure of agroing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm done with this argument here though.  The last set of answers confirmed what I was thinking anyway.  You talk of trying to be balanced, of wanting to just be an option for a group, but the fact is warriors are an option, and a good option still.  Your attempts at belittling warriors just shows that you want such dramatic changes that knights won't be considered for groups.  You want a return to the &quot;iron triangle&quot; days where every group had a warrior, or there was no group.  <br />
<br />
Have fun with your continuing posts about how bad you have it and how much your class sucks.  Keep ignoring the fact your the best tanks in the game even if you don't have the best agro.  <br />
<br />
To the few warriors here that don't feel this way, I hope you can persuade your brethren to realize warriors don't have it as bad as they are trying to portray.  If you could only persuade them to agree upon a reasonable set of changes and present a unified front, you might get the small amount of upgrades your class needs.  Until then I fear the &quot;warriors suck and we need the world on a platter before groups take us&quot; types are going to hold your entire class down.</div></div><hr />

It was a nice try, but you forget pally self buffs and the mana and focus effects that are on the &quot;equivalent&quot; pally gear. Besides the fact that the proliferation of All/All and Plate-only gear has completely blurred any already suffering advantage warriors had. A breastplate with 62ac, 100hp and 100mana is going to do a hell of a lot more for a Knight than a warrior.<br />

<br />
And I can't believe Knights whinge and moan that they won't be considered as a choice for tank if we gain parity in aggro control.<br />

But you tried.<br />
<br />
Btw, the best pre-planar armor is not generally class specific as you well know. Other than a few notable exceptions like Helmet of Rallos Zek, from Great Shadow Platemail to Umbracite Plate Leggings, tanks can wear the same armor with Knights usually geeting benefit from WIS, INT, and mana that Warriors don't receive. I'm sure a Knight can squeeze out a buff, heal or lifetap to equalize any small AC or HP advantage a Warrior might have.<br />
<br />
I can understand wanting to preserve a huge advantage over a competing class. I just can't undertand trying to pretend it doesn't exist, isn't significant, and finally when everything else fails - deserved.<br />

<br />
Also toss in SOE got a little more creative with the game.  Tanking has now been marginalized.  Any auxilary skills are a much bigger plus than they used to be because skills actually work!<br />
<br />
Kruegen was sort of right.  Some Warriors have this complex about their shortcomings.  Welcome to the game.  No class should have groups handed to them. ^_^ I have no problems looking at a monster and thinking &quot;I really don't want to tank this.&quot;  How many Warriors out there consider that?  Its been so drilled into your head that you must always tank you can't even cooperate with other Warriors.<br />
<br />
So at this point there appears to be two choices.<br />
<br />
1. Continue the way things are as Warriors as &quot;the tank&quot; and wallow in your choices when tanking isn't needed.<br />
<br />
2. Look for a redefinition of Warriors where tanking isn't your only skill.<br />
<br />
I see one having far more milage than the others.  <br />

So you guys decide if its a half full or half empty thing.  There aren't many players who don't think Warriors need some addressing.  The question is how to make Warriors better not what classes to obliterate to make everyone miserable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">I have no problem with Warriors having lesser but effective snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro. Just the kind of utility we need.<br />
<br />
When we have snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro I'm sure we'll be interested in all of your ideas to transform us. Or will it be moot then. So far I haven't heard one suggestion except that one thing excludes the other and that frankly is just not true.<br />
<br />
Put down the knife Oedepus and stop looking at your mom like that 8)<br />
<br />
Why do some children try to kill their parents? I can't believe the nerve of Clerics trying to melee. Maybe they need a little utility, like slow. Ya that's the ticket - slow!! Good job helping out those misguided Clerics.<br />
<br />
I know you'll hammer (I can't believe I said hammer!!) on the utility thing forever - stupid Warriors wanting to be tanks. pffft.<br />

<br />
For a 'warrior' class with spells (i.e. knight) to equal a 'warrior' class without spells in the day to day 'warrior' role smacks of inequity. End of arguement.<br />
<br />
Aeka, you continue to harp on about our need for additional utility but you seem to suggest that utility will solve the problems that the aggro gap provides for a warrior seeking to compete with a knight and thus there's no need to 'ruin' your class by making the key parts of the tank job performable with roughly equal ability by all classes competing for that spot. How on earth can you believe that utility which has supposedly never helped knights get groups will suddenly 'fix' anything? <br />
<br />
I detest double standards.<br />
<br />
How the hell did any knights make it to PoP anyway given how they apparently had no merit prior and nobody would group with 'em? <br />
<br />
The arguement has never been that warriors cannot tank in a group, it's that we are totally eclipsed in our singular function at this time and there is no rational justification for that to be the case.<br />

<br />
I'm surprised you come to this board and expect anything like a warm welcome with some of the claims that you have made here.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you a story of something that has happenned a couple nights ago, perhaps you'll be able to understand a little better, because as it stands, you're regurgitating Kunark era arguments (i.e. Superior armor) which are so outdated and irrelevant that I'm surprised that you didnt' get a Gross Factual Error popup box when you tried to post.<br />
<br />
Rewind to two nights ago:<br />
<br />
I'm in a group in level 65 Takish-Hiz Dungeon:  Hard Difficulty.    Mobs there hit in the 900's, not light hearted stuff.<br />
<br />
Now I'm a pretty heavy duty tank, who wields one of the top two weapons in Everquest for gaining aggro, the vaunted Blade of War.   I dont have nearly the problems with aggro that many many of my bretheren here on these boards do.    <br />
<br />
My group consisted of Myself (65 War with 161AA's), a 65 paladin, a 65 Cleric, a 65 Shaman, a 65 Wizard, and a 65 Mage.     Cleric was paxing, and we were split tanking.    Regularly on this journey, the 65 Paladin stood there... stunned the shit out of his mob until it was locked on him.    Then!   He would turn to MY mob and stun the crap out of it and would end up tanking BOTH fucking mobs, me standing there WORTHLESS.   These mobs aren't walks in the park, they're quite frankly pretty badass.   He wasn't taking any more damage than me, as a matter of fact, he was taking LESS damage because... he was fucking stunning the mobs, stopping their melee damage output completely.   Not all the time, but enough to make him take LESS damage than me.<br />
<br />
Ok fuck this Chavr... this is dead fucking wrong.   There is NO, and I mean NO justification for someone to be able to have such command over a mob's attention that they can take it from a warrior wielding the ultimate god damned bandaid in Everquest, the Blade of War, and THEN to make matters worse, to be able to take the beating BETTER than me because they could STOP melee damage completely.<br />
<br />
I've been nice, I've been willing to listen, but now that you come here 3 god damned months after we talked about this very shit on your own boards, and to listen to you tell me that you don't think our issue is that bad????   <br />
<br />
Fuck that, the problem is WORSE than I thought initially.   Don't fucking presume to come here and simply say &quot;oh you're fine&quot;, because warriors are NOT fine in terms of class balance.   We are NOT the &quot;best at damage mitigation&quot; no matter what the pretty green fucking numbers say on our stats screen.    Paladins over time BECAUSE of the ability to stop melee damage completely, and because of the TERRIBLY overpowered Paladin equippable gear have walked right up past warriors in the &quot;who's the best tank for mobs that are stunnable&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Now, as you were saying.... &quot;The best tanks should NEVER have the best aggro&quot; so I'm patiently waiting for your aggro nerf AND my aggro upgrade, because I am now, finally a WORSE tank than you, and DESERVE to have BETTER aggro than you.   <br />
<br />
Yes, since PoP, not only has the MEASURABLE difference between knight and warrior evaporated into nothingness, but with the reintroduction of a series of stun spells, you've moved to the TOP spot on the prevention/mitigation of damage.    <br />
<br />
You have no fucking business having the ability to control a mob's aggro whatsoever.    You ARE the best tank since PoP from a mana spent perspective because you STOP melee damage from occuring, melee damage that had you NOT stopped, I might have mitigated well enough to notice a tiny difference over an hour and a half's worth of parsing.<br />
<br />
This whole fucking debate is make believe, it's irrelevant because while we can &quot;take hits&quot; better than you, we can NOT completely prevent them from occuring AT WILL.    Because of this, the ever so slight differences assuming that the mobs are actually making contact are comletely done away with.<br />
<br />
No, this isn't something new Chavr, except that your pathetic class has NEVER been so extremely close to warriors in melee defense while retaining ALL of the advantages you do.   <br />
<br />
I cant' fucking believe that you've managed to hide this as long as you have, contratulations.   <br />
<br />
Before some dimwit comes along and says that &quot;Well we can't keep mobs permastunned and have mana&quot;.... I don't want to hear WORD ONE about it.   The difference in hitpoints between warriors and knights is a SINGLE HIT's worth of hitpoints.    The difference in avoidance skills is one and a half hits out of 100.    So, if you cast a single stun which stops 2 hits from occuring, you have COMPLETELY made up for the difference in melee tankability and surpassed warriors in tankability.    Pious Might stops 3 whole seconds of melee combat up to level 65 mobs for 100 mana AND,  QWoS stops TEN SECONDS OF MELEE for 200 mana, which is HALF the cost of Complete heal.   You CAN cast each spell once per fight and be FINE on mana, you have with the casting of two spells OBLITERATED any tanking difference between you and warriors.    Oh?  There's a chance of a resist?   BIG FUCKING DEAL.... here take my fucking Kleenex to wipe away the tears, you still get insane aggro even on resists, and because of it you would STILL be a superior tank even if it were ALWAYS resisted, fact is, it's NOT, I see it working all the damn time.  Oh but wait, there's more... Force of Akilae.... 4 more seconds of NO MELEE DAMAGE for 65 mana on mobs up to level 65.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I think I've heard about enough about the pretty geen stat numbers as though they have ANY meaning when comparing me against you in terms of tankability.    It's enough to make me sick to my stomach listening to Paladins pull out the ENTIRELY IRRELEVANT melee stats arguments, because thy can hide their tanking abilities so fucking well in their little blue bars.    <br />
<br />
Is it that hard for warriors?   Why yes Chavr, it is, but worse than &quot;hard for warriors to find groups&quot;, it's IMBALANCED, and the game has become UNFAIR for warriors.    We have become relatively weak, surpassed even in our PRIME role... not the role which gets us groups.... OUR #1 ROLE by a hybrid of us, by someone who can not only do what we do BETTER than us, but then says they have some god given right to an advantage over us AND THEN.... who can go off and fucking solo dragons if they get bored with taking my fucking group spots.<br />
<br />
This balance thing has gone quite far enough, and the fact that you're trying to come here and justify it, then walk away wringing your hands about how we won't listen to your reasonableness?    <br />
<br />
<br />
Chavr, go back to Paladins of Norrath and act perplexed as to why Paladins are seen by warriors in a negative light... we've fucking figured it out here.</div></div><hr />

There are three stuns that work on mobs 60+.  Force of akeila, force of akeria and qwot.  Akeila has the same reset as regular old stun.  You can't chain cast it and hold mobs to 0 incoming damage.  Akeira is new and is nice, but it has higher resist rate and stops at 61, so there are alot of stuff it won't land on.  It's the same recast as akela.  Even if you time these two just right you can't stop all incoming damage.  Lastly qwot, it's a huge freaking mana cost spell, has insane recast time and it bounces mobs around.  It does not hold mobs for 10 seconds from what I've seen.  It stops incoming damage about the same length of time as akeila.<br />
<br />
There is no way that paladin could have used melee stopping stuns to agro two mobs and keep both of them from doing damage.  You can't cast stuns fast enough because of the recast time.  I've had to use that trick in some groups when bad pulls come in.  There is more then enough time for you to hit that taunt button and take all that stun agro and put yourself on the top of the list.  You two should have worked together instead of fighting each other for agro.<br />
<br />
I was in a ldon group myself yesterday morning.  I was puller and a 65 war was tank.  I'd bring stuff in, stun it and let him take agro.  If there were two mobs I'd root one or tank it.  I took noticeably more damage then the warrior.  Even using my stuns timed to stop dps I took more damage then the warrior.  He wasn't using BoW either and had no problems keeping agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you want though really?  Obviously you dont' suck enough that you can't get a group.  <br />
<br />
You realize that if warriors could hold agro as good as paladins groups wouldn't want paladins as offtanks.  Why take the second best tank when you could double up on the best tank?<br />
<br />
Ya'll talk and talk about utility, but please show me the screenshots of all the groups that have ooc'ed &quot;group looking for utility class&quot;.  It doesn't exist.  No matter how bad ya'll want to believe our spellbook gets us groups outside of a tank spot, it doesn't.  Hell, I tried to get a guild group as a non tank and it wasn't there.  The only time I'm wanted is to fill a tank slot.  I tell them people I don't want to tank and they just act like I'm crazy.   Make warriors have as good of agro as paladins and paladins will no longer be wanted for groups.  Read that sentence 85 times if you need to, but realize the truth of it.  Our heals, and stuns and roots and all that good stuff don't amount to a hill of beans when it comes time for groups.  The only thign that matters is whether or not we can be the tank.  We have to use our spellbooks to be tank, but without the tank part all our spells get us nothing.<br />
<br />
Oh, and before you say &quot;you got the ldon group and you weren't tank&quot; reread the part about doubling up on warriors if agro was the same.  The only reason I got that group is because if you want snap agro you take the paladin, which is the weaker tank.  If you want the best tank you get a warrior with the weaker agro.  If warriors had the best agro then there would be no need for the weaker tank.<br />
<br />
Warriors need four things.  <br />
<br />
1.  Taunt to have a hate component.  The amount of hate taunt can add is capped and the amount per taunt isn't extremely high.  You would have more agro then currently, but less then knights.  <br />
<br />
2.  Slightly higher Hp/AC/mitigation tables.  Something that is geared more towards the 60+ end of the game where the problem occurs.  Perhaps have the bonus for those levels be higher then current.<br />
<br />
3.  All melee need discilines redone so they are on seperate timers and timers looked at.<br />
<br />
4.  Boost average dps by 10-15.<br />
<br />
<br />
  That is all warriors need to put them where they should be.  There is no need for instant, snap agro at range.  That is the realm of the knight and should stay the realm of the knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Something that is geared more towards the 60+ end of the game where the problem occurs.Actually, the problem starts way the hell before endgame. You know, the warriors that aren't mega-twinks or in uber guilds. The same warriors that have zero access to EB weapons and are either not high enough or can't get groups enough to get the other much-vaunted crutch, AE Taunt.<br />
It does not hold mobs for 10 seconds from what I've seen. It stops incoming damage about the same length of time as akeila.So, still long enough to more than make up for any hp difference between knights and warriors. Thanks for proving that point for us.<br />
<br />

That is the realm of the knight and should stay the realm of the knight.Stop being so goddamn territorial about this, all of you paladins! The only thing a warrior has with ANY distance is Archery. That's right, ARCHERY. A single, ranged taunt skill would not put knights out of a job (especially since the fucking developers would almost certainly give it to you, too.)!</div></div><hr />

You know, there's a HUGE gulf between making a mob do -0- damage during a fight and preventing more than 2 hits per fight (which obliterates the 'tanking advantage').   It's disingenuous to say that not being able to NOT take damage period... and overcoming and exceeding the warrior melee advantage are even remotely close to the same thing.   They're not.   We are talking about TWO HITS in one fight.     That is the ENTIRETY of the &quot;gulf&quot; in tanking.    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no way that paladin could have used melee stopping stuns to agro two mobs and keep both of them from doing damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
You'll notice that I didnt' say that he used melee stopping stuns exclusively to grab aggro from me.     He used them, and he grabbed aggro from me.   Those are two statements of fact.   I'm not linking them together, hell he could've used cease/desist to grab aggro from me and melee stopping stuns upon refresh, I simply don't know.   What I DO know is that he stopped attacking his mob and grabbed aggro from mine.   Then he took the beating from both of them after having knocked one back about 4 feet.   This isn't rocket science here Chavr, I don't know why you're even implying that it's not possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't cast stuns fast enough because of the recast time.<br />
<br />
You're not getting it AT ALL.   There isn't a NEED to stunlock mobs, just to stun them ONCE to obliterate any melee defensive advantage I had over you.   ONE TIME.     Recast time on spells is 2.5 seconds.   Cast QWoS, then Akilae after it &quot;wakes&quot;.     You've prevented FAR more than the difference between us.<br />
<br />

<br />
CHAVR!   TAUNT WORKS ONLY 60ish percent of the time ON GREEN MOBS, these were level 64 and 65 mobs.    Guess what... it fails 2-3 times in a row sometimes.   That is 12-18 seconds that I have NO control.   You act as though this is some great revalation, it's not.   I know how to press my fucking taunt button.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's all fine and dandy, the thing is, you give no indication of gear differences, what zone, what encounter, etc.    Not only that you're talking about mobs that my necro can tank with no problem, cause I KNOW that you weren't in a &quot;hard&quot; adventure.   Your gear simply won't support one.<br />
<br />
What do you want though really? Obviously you dont' suck enough that you can't get a group. <br />
<br />
Statements like this are the answer to your question over on PoN boards.   Arrogance to an extreme.    You were able to get groups in Kunark too, so I say we go back to those days.  <br />
<br />
<br />
You realize that if warriors could hold agro as good as paladins groups wouldn't want paladins as offtanks. Why take the second best tank when you could double up on the best tank?<br />
<br />
I don't know, why do groups take warriors nowdays even for offtanking?  I mean why take the 2nd best tank when you can double up on Paladins?  You take LESS melee damage than warriors and have aggro lock and can even heal yourselves in a pinch... why the fuck would a warrior EVER be needed in a group?<br />
<br />
Ya'll talk and talk about utility, but please show me the screenshots of all the groups that have ooc'ed &quot;group looking for utility class&quot;. It doesn't exist.

There IS no truth to it, it's doomsday speculation based on inaccurate judgement.   <br />
There is NO truth to that statement<br />
<br />
There is NO justification for handicapping warriors any more<br />
<br />
You have succeeded in becoming Supertanks, congratulations, I'm happy for you.... please, just bask in the limelight a little bit rather than making doomsday predictions.     <br />
<br />
Let me repeat myself since clearly you didn't get me the first time:<br />
<br />
Since you are the BEST tank against stunnable mobs you don't DESERVE the best aggro by your OWN standards.   <br />
<br />
I want BETTER aggro than you, not &quot;a little less&quot;, I DESERVE better aggro than you, because I'm no longer &quot;the best tank&quot; against unstunnable mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our heals, and stuns and roots and all that good stuff don't amount to a hill of beans when it comes time for groups. The only thign that matters is whether or not we can be the tank. We have to use our spellbooks to be tank, but without the tank part all our spells get us nothing.<br />
<br />
And in LDoN dungeons, since a ranger can tank, even a necro can tank, the arguments evaporate into the vapor that they always were.   <br />
<br />
Oh, and before you say &quot;you got the ldon group and you weren't tank&quot; reread the part about doubling up on warriors if agro was the same. The only reason I got that group is because if you want snap agro you take the paladin, which is the weaker tank. If you want the best tank you get a warrior with the weaker agro. If warriors had the best agro then there would be no need for the weaker tank.<br />
<br />
LET IT SINK IN.... IN EQUAL GEAR, PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE END GAME.... THE WARRIOR IS THE WEAKER TANK, NOT THE PALADIN AGAINST MOBS THAT ARE STUNNABLE.<br />
<br />
Warriors need four things. <br />
<br />
1. Taunt to have a hate component. The amount of hate taunt can add is capped and the amount per taunt isn't extremely high. You would have more agro then currently, but less then knights. <br />

<br />
First, I agree with this for the most part, although I feel that we need a STRONG melee defense advantage, not a &quot;slight&quot; one, or the pittance that we have today.   Now, saying that instant/snap aggro at a range is knight territory is disingenuous.    Thats' everyone BUT warrior's territory, it's not exclusive to knights, which will make RANGERS and BEASTLORDS better LDoN tanks than warriors (dont' scoff, I've seen it already).</div></div><hr />

It should be the realm of all three classes.<br />
<br />
Since taunting mobs doesn't even appear in the Paladin Class Description I don't believe you have much of an arguement from the standpoint of what SoE has said.<br />
<br />
If your argument is that denying Warriors adequate aggro abilities is good for the game, many other players would disagree.<br />
<br />
If you're arguing that it would be good for yourself and your class, I believe even that is no longer the case.<br />
<br />
The best possible outcome for everyone would be differences but parity between our classes when we melee, offtank, group MT, and raid MT.<br />
<br />
To have parity, your class needs to have functionally equivalent AC, HP's, and mitigation.<br />
<br />
To have parity Warriors need to have functional equivalents to snap aggro on command and ranged aggro.<br />
<br />
These two characteristics define the most basic attributes of a tank - to be able to survive getting hit and cause the mob to focus on you so others don't get hit.<br />
<br />
You argue for advantage, not parity. Since Knights have functionally equivalent ability to survive getting hit, your vastly superior aggro abilities are an unjustifiable unbalanced advantage in the other fundamental tank ability.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you just like to see Warriors  lose it.<br />

The truth is knights are the clear choice for exp groups and have a clear raid role also. Alowing the warrior a better chance to gain agro has nothing to do with a hybrid class getting defensive.<br />
<br />
The very fact that you dismiss taunt problems just because you are not willing to believe a problem is there but have not needed to use the button to attain your agro lock should be an indicator for you.<br />
<br />
Most experienced players of all classes agree there is something needed for warriors and I understand that your worried it may affect your complete dominance of exp groups if changes happen but really, be honest and try to look at it impartially.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Jesus Chavr, taunt's been tested a million times. Didn't you see Frodlin's results posted? Or Brutul's? or the others in the library? The success rates of taunt are WELL KNOWN.<br />
<br />
The range of success for taunt is 40% (on reds) to 60% (on greens), on average, based on parses with talking mobs. It's been shown over and over and over. <br />
<br />
Actually, that's 40-60% to get the talking message, but Brutul's parse shows that taunt can &quot;succeed&quot; WITHOUT the warrior getting aggro. Yes, that's right. Check it out for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">posted this on my sever board as they wanted to know how taunt worked<br />
<br />
well, im a 62 warrior, and taunt works as follows<br />
<br />
taunt has almost a 60% success rate, and it doesnt EVER add hate to the list, its temporaly puts the warrior on the top no mater what.<br />
<br />
*proof/experament<br />
<br />
have a 65 warrior and a 65 cleric go into a zone with level 40 mobs, have the cleric stun it, heal the warrior and then nuke it.<br />
<br />
now have the warrior taunt it, if it works it will switch to the warrior(warrior shouldnt be attacking thru this whole thing) it will stick to the warrior for about 2 min, then switch back to the cleric, even if the cleric has done nothing else.<br />
<br />
***<br />
so the conclustion is that any good warrior is one that doesnt mash taunt.<br />
<br />
now as for agro, the whole reason it is a issue is because it is a large part of weather the shaman or cleric lives thru the fight or not, what warriors are upset with is the fact that paladins and shadows knights(CORRECTION, it was a late night hour when i posted this, rofl, i ment DoT and DD stacking for SKs) have an unfair advantage in stuns because of the following<br />
<br />
1. they do not have to use crappy weapons with effects to grant them more agro, so they can use their windblade/wind riders lance with out having a adverse effect in their tanking power, as such the knight have a much higher DPS possiblilty while still mantaining agro<br />
<br />
2. ranged agro, they get ahead of the mob with run 3 and then can stun it while its running for agro, and they can pull it with stun, 2 stuns is more than enough to &quot;lock&quot; agro<br />
<br />
3. community perception, in such that most warriors mash taunt(most do) and suck at keeping groups safe, there a rarly any warriors that take time to research their class(also true), to compound that problem is that knights dont really have to know their class to get agro, just have to cast a stun or a group heal when they need a agro boost<br />
<br />
thanks for hearing me out folks, and the solution is not a knight nerf, its giving purblood melee's something that doesnt require a mana bar, such as they have in EQ2 and EQ:OA</div></div><hr />

Except we're asking for SoE to deliver on our Class Description:<br />
&quot;Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since we aren't recieving this in full measure if Classes whose roles are not (according to the Class Descriptions) to make &quot;.... themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks....&quot; have superior abilities to Warriors.<br />
<br />
So it's between Warriors and SoE. We aren't asking for a Paladin ability, we're asking for a Warrior ability to be made competative.<br />
<br />
We don't expect Knights to come here saying &quot;Oh yes, give our unfair advantage to Warriors because we want to compete fairly for experaince group MT positions.&quot; But if someone comes to the Warrior Class board only to be inflamitory with no foundation at all for their opinion it is trolling.

It doesn't mention bards being able to fd with songs, or mem blur... but they can.  It doesn't say anything about them dual wielding, but they can.<br />
<br />
Beastlords can add in the shaman hp buff line, but the description doesn't say anything about that.<br />

Cleric description doesn't mention their ability to summon magical weapons, or use yaulp for mana regen.<br />
<br />
Druids have no mention of snare spells, and they are the best snarers in the game.<br />
<br />
There is no mention of ae stuns for chanters, nor is there talk of them having the best MR buff.  No mention of tash either.<br />
<br />
Where is the CoH description of mages?  <br />
<br />
There is no mention of monks having mend.<br />
<br />
Necro's don't have mana feeds mentioned.<br />
<br />
Paladins don't have the ability to taunt being mentioned.<br />
<br />
No mention of using disciplines to enhance bow attacks for rangers.<br />
<br />

<br />
Shadowknights don't have taunt nor summon corpse listed.<br />

Where are familar's listed for wizards?  How about their ae snares?<br />

  What I have listed is just a small part of classes that are missing out of the description.  Do you honestly think they can put every aspect of a class in the descriptions?  They used broad terms to describe classes in a favorable light.  Warriors taunt, and so do paladins, sk's and heck I think rangers even have a taunt button.  <br />

  Trying to base improvements from the class description is just silly.  The description is merely a way to tell about a class in broad terms.  It doesn't sum up all that a class is, nor does it state all that a class will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tanking and taunting are Warrior central abilities. While Knights do them, they do other things as well.<br />
<br />
As the most group dependent tank class, Warriors need to be at least competative experiance group tanks. Since survivability is not an issue for experiance group tanks, aggro abilities have become magnified in importance.<br />
<br />
Warriors need improved aggro abilities to perform in the role defined for them. I believe improvements should include snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro. These are crucial tank abilities possessed by 2 of 3 tank classes.<br />

I don't see any problem with Warriors geting skills that messes with monsters at range.  Fleshing out what that is entirely up to SOE (hopefully you guys get some input on it).  If they are really clever, they can make it grow with the class from L1 to L65.<br />
<br />
The key point is that skills are used where you want and when you want.  I really believe new skills are the way out.  New skills means new ways to generate hate which leads to more control on how you want to be on the agro list.  If you want to be high, spend a lot and trigger the skill.  If you want to be low, back off and trigger judiciously. Its got to be the a better idea than the &quot;proc and pray&quot; thing many rely on now.<br />

Unassailable Aggro at range for a TANK without significant costs just doesn't work well. (Or rather works too well). As to apportioning blame I blame SoE for the reckless abandon with which all spellcasters (including knights)  have recieved upgrades.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">I believe Aeka once said something I found to be extraordinarily perceptive. One of the things that hurts the game is the mobs have such limited combat AI.<br />
<br />
Imagine how different everything would be if neither the zerg rush or single MT approach worked.<br />
<br />
Every tank would use their aggro abilities, DPS, and survivability. In such an environment either Aeka's approach - Warriors with additional skills or substantially increased AC/HP and mitigation would work.<br />
<br />
Aeka then follows with the observation that casters &quot;ruined&quot; the game before aggro lock did. It is true IMO that a focus on casters has put an emphasis on the single MT approach that has hurt the game.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the game is the way it is. I would like to see Knights treated more like Warriors on Raids. I would like to see all tanks be equally desired in exp groups with more groups saying let's fill that last slot with a second tank. This is the only way I can think of to make the game fun for all tanks and leave no Class out.<br />
<br />
The first step I think took place when Knight survivability, the size of their mana pool and the rate at which it could be refilled increased. It's past time to take a second step and give Warriors reasonable aggro abilities and all melees increased DPS.<br />

&quot;Pious Might stops 3 whole seconds of melee combat up to level 65 mobs for 100 mana. &quot;  This spell is not a stun... pious might is a 150dd proc vs all mobs.<br />
Quellious Words of Tranquility has never stunned for 10seconds, I would say 4-5sec... but I dont use it as it is a waste of mana/loss of dps/knockbacks mobs (and 15,000pp), not to mention long cast and longer recast times (bye mana, and all the melee scream to stop knockbacks).<br />
<br />
I do agree something has to be done to the warriors, what it is, i have no idea.  I dont think knights need a thing, we went through our trials and tribulations several expansions ago for a while and toughed it out,  then PoP came out.  Point is it sucks, no one needs to be the laughing stock of all classes in EQ for that long again (at least the jokes to rangers were exactly that, jokes), well warriors arent being laughed at today, but you get my point.  I DO hope something comes to the warriors as you guys are long overdue on something<br />
<br />
I do strongly believe paladin are a support class; we lose our &quot;utility&quot; being a tank, ie a wiz/druid/ranger snaring/kiting/rooting instead of nuking/attacking means the raid/group loses a lot of dps compared to if a paladin doing the kiting/parking the add since our dps is next to a right above a clerics anyway</div></div><hr />

Many people who play this game played old Pen and Paper D&amp;D or some other P&amp;P RPG , and the Class Descriptions coincide with the classes in D&amp;D and other Fantaasy RPGS fairly well.  Given that, I don't want to hear shit about Knights having to rely on tanking ability to get groups....YOU ARE A HYBRID, BY THE VERY FUCKING DEFINITION OF A HYBRID YOU SHOUD HAVE HALF THE TANKING ABILITY A TRUE BLOODED TANK HAS.  You knew your tanking abilities would be much lower going in at character creation, yet you made a SK or a Paly anyway cause you wanted the spells.  It should have been no surprose to you during teh Kunark era that you were a second class tank.  THe fix that SHOULD have been brougth into the game is that game content SHOULD have been introduced to make your utility spells needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
WE chose to give up spells to be the class that has NO EQUAL IN TANKING ...... and now SOE is taking that away from us by giving Hybrids all of our abilities AND allowing them to keep thier spellcasting abilities...... In addition to this, Knights have aggro on demand, while our aggro abiliteis are pathetic in comparison.......THAT is what has us all pissed off.  I really don't think its hard to understand...... If it ever does go back to the days of Kunark, I won't feel the least bit bad for any knight....like I said the fix even back then was to introduce game content that made your utility spells needed...NOT to make you as good of a tank as warriors.<br />
<br />
Simply put, Knights have their cake and are eating it too.  Cept for Duel Weild(which makes us take even more damage in High end content BTW), They are are simply Warriors with spells.....warriors that can hold aggro.<br />

Actually, in AD&amp;D, paladins were pretty much the equal of fighters in tanking, if not better because of their innate abilities. They even had the same number of hps. The xp penalty and alignment restriction was the balancing point. Same thing in 3rd edition, except the xp penalty is gone and fighters get more feats to even the score.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Not exactly true Gimmel.....IF YOU GO BY THE RULES AS PRINTED(not house rules....adn we all had house rules)only warriors in 2nd edition got the bonus HP from High Constitution, only warriors could get anything above Weapon Proficieny(spelling?) Warriors Thac0's were better than Pally's ..... so I'd say warriors were much better all out fighters and damage absorbers than Paly's in 2nd edition.  But this was ok as the Paly's spells were needed and useful other than as a gimp healer in a pinch which is how it was in the Kunark era.<br />
<br />
But we are splitting hairs....my point stands that THEY KNEW they wre not going to be as good of a tank as a warrior going in....they decided on a paly or sk cause they wanted spells.....we said teh Hell with spells cause we wanted to be the Best tank'n class in teh game......and now SoE is taking that away from us with their poorly thought out balancing schemes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Well, that sounds about like where paladins and warriors are in EQ. Take away the spellbook and they are extremely gimped warriors. Slightly less hps, 10% worse mitigation, worse DPS. The problem is that the spell book WAY over compensates.<br />
<br />
I still can't believe that SOE was so blind as to not see the effect that continually adding new spells and focus effects, while adding nothing for pure melees would have. I mean, at least last time they added levels with Kunark, discs were added. There is no excuse for what happened to melees with PoP.</div></div><hr />

Gimmel is completely correct.  Its been noted in many places by many others that melee has gotten left behind.<br />
<br />
As for myself, I've let my melee wither opting for the caster AA first and I haven't been sorry about it.  I can cast stronger heals more efficiently than I ever could before.  It takes a lot of investment but I can measure and feel the difference especially in raids.  Or I could get minor upgrades to the same melee I've been doing for years now which as far as I can tell is somewhat of a wash (except for Slay Undead which is a Luclin skill).<br />
<br />
I got a mana free group heal.  Other classes got other new AA skills.  New skills like Divine Arbitration can redefine strategies in a meaningful way.  Where is the Warrior skill that is compariable?</div></div><hr />

If you are using the half thing then paladins would have had a 5000hp CH (before the CH nerf, when CH was 10,000hp?) (and rangers could CH for 2500hp...) and SKs could rez for ~50% (1/2 of necro rez 93%).  The knights in EQ are not halfed in classes, more like 70% warrior and the rest or so a cleric or necro, and some on their own.  Pretty much, were agro warriors (that have our own way of tanking via spells) with no disciplines that have lesser skills, that can cast watered down versions of spells from our other parent class (cleric/necro).  <br />
<br />
Yes im aware that in the end game of which ~5%+ of the players ever see, the itemization thing happens and knights are no longer 70% or so warriors, but more like 80%+; you will always have the edge.  Im all that for warriors getting something, and that the items need to be fixed, but your definition needs a little work.</div></div><hr />

On the Shaman, Necro, and Cleric boards are numerous posts stating that Paladins are better tanks in LDoN right now.<br />
<br />
If you focus entirely on raid content, you might have a point.<br />
<br />
No one can get good experiance form raids. LDoN loot is a benefit to us all. To get experiance and loot you need a group. Not a very difficult concept.<br />
<br />
You can say Warriors are the best tanks till the cows come home and it will not change the fact Shamans and Clerics are almost universal in declaring that Paladin aggro lock has just about eliminated any concideration by them to include Warriors in groups.<br />
<br />
The rate of level 65 Warrior retirees is going to help some, but I don't think that's a very fair way of handling the problem.<br />
<br />
It couldn't be any clearer. Warriors need improved aggro abilities.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">There are two things that warriors need:<br />
<br />
1) Better taunt skills or similar abilities so we can hold aggro.<br />
<br />
2) Give warriors a 20% perma incoming damage mitigation ability, like a miniature perma defensive disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>OlavSkulcrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">20% is probably a bit too high. /defensive is 30%, yes? So, any permanent mitigation boost should give about the same bonus over time. So instead of 30% for 3 out of 10 min, 9% permanent. Also note that even this may be considered high by some, as the permanent ability wouldn't have the dps drawback /defensive does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">10-12% mitigation boost  is a bit more reasonable.  It shoudl be innate though and not dependant on aa's.  Because itemization at high end is where the majority of problems occur have the added mitigation tied into levels 60-65.<br />
<br />
The key to better taunt is figuring out the degree.  Add hate to the taunt button, but have it capped for usage per mob in a set time frame.  In other words if you hit taunt 8 times you would cap the hate part at 5 taunts per mob.  Switch mobs and you can add 5 taunts worth of hate to them.  The amount of hate should be less then stun, but nearly the same as slow.  The key factor here being how much hate does slow have and how is this hate affected by the distance of the caster of slow to the mob.  <br />
<br />
As for ranged agro, maybe something that doubles your taunt range at 60.  I'm really leary of giving warriors ranged agro.  it just seems too much like giving the best tank the best agro.  I'd try the first two suggestions first and see how that works out before I added in added range to taunt.  When warriors get a boost to tanking and a boost to agro they will once again be the most favored tank.  If they were to get ranged agro then I don't see knights getting a tank slot again.  Warriors have had the reputation of being the best tank choice for a very long time.  It's only recently the knights have even been considered and I don't believe it will take much of a change to put warriors back to the favorite again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">It's taken forever, but I nearly agree with you Chavr.<br />
<br />
Boosting Warrior mitigation does not affect Warrior desirability in experiance groups at all.<br />
<br />
I concider the ability to get the mob to focus on you in less than 10 seconds a requirement to tank now given the standard for aggro abilities set by Knights.<br />
<br />
Paladins have more than enough survivability, aggro abilities, and important group utility to continue to get groups even if Warriors had snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro:<br />
<br />
1. Heals, including LoH can turn probable failure ito success.<br />
2. Root is good CC, especially given Warriors have none.<br />
3. Res can salvage an LDoN adventure should the Cleric die.<br />
4. SU3, etc. (wether it's reputaion for doing uber damage is deserved or not) guarantees Knight prefences in 2 LDoN zones.<br />
<br />
I believe that the fact a player happens to be a Paladin, SK, or Warrior should be the thing of least importance when looking to fill an experiance group MT slot.<br />

The best defensve tank against exp mobs already HAS the best aggro.    Warriors are NOT the &quot;best tank&quot; any more against mobs that can be stunned, we take MORE damage than Paladins.<br />
<br />
That notion that &quot;the best tank shouldn't have the best aggro&quot; is no longer valid, unless it's in relaton to a Paladin nerf.<br />
<br />
Because the difference in tankability is less than 2 hits, and one stun stops more than 2 hits, the PALADIN is the one who takes the least damage, and is therefore &quot;the best tank&quot;, purely from a defensive perspective.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">I play a shadowknight.  After reading this thread, there are a few points I would like to make:<br />
<br />
1.  Many of these posts reach the conclusion that Warriors need adjustments when compared to  knights.  This may be a valid conclusion, but almost universally, the argument that is meant to support this conclusion uses paladin spells and abilities for its examples.  Some people seem to make the distinction between paladin's and shadowknights, but more often than not, the two classes are lumped together as knights in the conclusion.  There are some things that the knight classes hold in common, but there are many significant differences.  In this discussion, the differences are often ignored.  For clarity, I suggest that when the argument is directed at knights, it should include examples of how it holds for both classes.  Otherwise, arguments should refer to each knight class specifically.<br />
<br />
2.  There comes a time when the experience group is irrelevant.  At some point, if you play the game enough, you will have all the levels and aa that matter.  When that point is reached, viability/desireability of a given class in the exp group is a moot point.  Pre-LDoN, raiding and perhaps fun groups are all that remain for what we might call post-exp players, for lack of a better term.  I will admit that LDoN changes things a great deal, however.  Certainly, group viability is very important in this expansion, and we will have to see how that affects things.<br />
<br />
3.  In my guild, and to the best of my ability to observe it, on my server, warriors do not go wanting for groups any more than anyone else.  Using the LFG tool turns up a wide variety of classes, not just warriors.  My guild's warriors get both guild and pick-up groups on a regular basis.  Despite the rants of people on the various message boards, most people I know just want to play.  There are certainly times that my group will bypass a warrior in favor of someone else, but just as often I find myself in a group with a warrior or another tank.  More than anything else, the player behind the character is what makes me give people invites.  Sure, my groups need some of the requisite archtypes of healer and slower, but after that, we always take the best of the available players with less regard for the class of their character.  Admittedly, this is just my experience.<br />
<br />
4.   It is blatently obvious that warriors have to have some distinct value all their own.  I can't tell you what this value is, but I know it's there.  How do I know?  Simple.  People keep making warrior characters.<br />
     In my guild we've had high level wizards, clerics, and necros all change over to warriors, either as a main, or as a favored alt.  This is in spite of the fact that we already have a healthy number of warriors.  These are not stupid people.  They were not duped into changing their class to warrior.  They were not sold by the official description on the eqlive website.  They knew the game well, with all of it's shortcommings, and somehow chose to make a warrior.  Perhaps one or two of them are simply masochists, but I doubt it.  They saw something in the class, with all it's shortcommings and flaws, that appealed to them.  It appealed to them enough that they would in two cases set aside level 65 characters of needed classes, that took a great deal of time to develop.  This suggests to me that the warrior class has unique value.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, and the interesting discussion in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Players, particularly casters, keep making Warrior alts.<br />
<br />
The truth is that it is extremely theraputic to stand toe to toe with a mob and mindlessly beat the heck out of it.<br />
<br />
Warrior's are easier to play (even to play well) than Shadow Knights and yes, Paladins.<br />
<br />
Equipping a Warrior is a lot easier than some classes. There's no FT or spells to acquire. Give him that haste item ya won on a /random roll, decent droppable class armor (all the way up to Ornate molds), a Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn and yer gtg till almost level 60.<br />
<br />
I aggree that Warriors are fun to play and until recently had a unique role.<br />
<br />
However, as with any class there is a wall. For Warriors it's obtaining a BoC and another really really good aggro weapon and discovering after all your effort your group wants another class to MT.<br />
<br />
I agree that there are darned few SK alts. It is not a class for the casual player.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>mahalito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">You are partialy correct nazak, warriors DID have certain advantages all their own.<br />
<br />
1 Crit hits(now every class has them)<br />
<br />
2. Higher HP/AC and duribility than hybrids(itemization in every expansion since veloius has made this difference insignificant).<br />
<br />
3. Defensive disc (while nice for boss lvl raid mobs,  has been teh bane of warriors, gives the developers an excuse not to give warriors their own midigation table.<br />
<br />
But in the POP+ world agro is what it all about.   The initial vision of the game always seemed to be that agro management/mana rationing was a team sport....but people have gotten lazy, they want the MA to  have push button guaranteed agro lock so they can sit and hit their hotkey nukes to their hearts content w/o agro concern. Anything else just slows down the XP .  With mounts and KEI on every corner, mana conservation isnt really much of an issue anymore.  In todays EQ a warrior  has been reduced to the 2nd choice tank cause of this. <br />
<br />
 Imagine if pally's got CH(mind you its the only cleric heal they dont get).   A Main Healer who had tons of hp/AC and could take a beating as well as do signifiant melee  offense, nobody would chose clerics in a group unless all the pally's where busy....that's what's happening to warriors now.  <br />
<br />
I dont think i'm stupid for playing a warior and i know several who have chosen this class over others as well...its the type of toon we want to play, if it wasnt we would'nt be here trying to get things fixed, we'd just say screw it and make knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine. I'll just stick to what SK's can do on a raid, since we know paladins already kick ass on raids. See if these look familiar:<br />
<br />
1) Outdamage warriors (non-tanking). Undisputable. Read the FoH monk vs. warrior vs. paladin parse thread<br />
2) Pull shit better than necros and monks in certain cases (when mobs have large melee output, SK can survive a round where monks can't. No desputing this, better mitigation tables, more HP/AC).<br />
3) Group atk buffs via taps<br />
4) HP taps. they can sustain their HP on an AoE fight far better than a warrior<br />
5) Agro buffs<br />
<br />
All of the above are true. They are undisputable. Next<br />
<br />
&quot;2. There comes a time when the experience group is irrelevant. At some point, if you play the game enough, you will have all the levels and aa that matter.

<br />
How many people do you know with 350+ AA's? Thats approx the amount when they become irrelevant for warriors, and probably later than that. Wanna know how many warriors I know with 350+ AAs ... 1 on my entire server. <br />
<br />
&quot;3. In my guild, and to the best of my ability to observe it, on my server, warriors do not go wanting for groups any more than anyone else.

<br />
Bullshit. And I'll call you on that every time. LDoN's slightly different because of the re-surgent necessity for tanks. But, prior to LDoN, if you do a / lfg 65 all, I can bet you that more warriors show up on that list than any other class except maybe monks. I can ALSO bet you that most of those warriors are not from high-end guilds, because warriors at the high-end stage don't experience the same issues pre-EB warriors do. <br />
<br />
&quot;4. It is blatently obvious that warriors have to have some distinct value all their own. I can't tell you what this value is, but I know it's there. How do I know? Simple. People keep making warrior characters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Name them then.. HOw about that for a challenge. Bring on the shrinking HP/AC gap example. Bring the over-exagerated DPS argument. Bring on the 3-minute clown-shoes /disc defensive argument. Bring the &quot;Warrior taunt is fine because this one time, I was grouped with this warrior with a BoW and a Symbol of the Planemasters and 2katk and he held agro just fine.&quot; Bring them all, these boards have collectively destroyed each one 1000 times over, but I'd love to personally do it again.<br />
<br />
Do you know why people start warriors still. Here's a hint, not everyone that just started EQ has heard of these boards, and they sure as hell don't read them before starting one up. Many peopel still start warriors based on the character description that comes in the fucking instruction manual. Why don't you give that a read-over and tell me if the warrior, or paladin, or shadowknight description actually reflects reality of class balance in EQ. I can already tell you the answer is no in all 3 cases, but feel free to see for yourself. <br />
<br />
&quot;In my guild we've had high level wizards, clerics, and necros all change over to warriors, either as a main, or as a favored alt.

It appealed to them enough that they would in two cases set aside level 65 characters of needed classes, that took a great deal of time to develop. This suggests to me that the warrior class has unique value.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Warriors are an easy class to play. <br />
2) Balance issues don't really surface before 50 because XP flies in Kunark/SoL outdoor zones regardless of class balance.<br />
3) Twinks have access to better gear at the pre-55 stage. Pretty important considering warriors are the most gear-dependant class in EQ. I'll call your bluff on most of your other classes starting warriors as a main and actually playing them through 65 and AA's.<br />
<br />
Twinks suggest NOTHING. Because in actuality, the number 1 twink class is still an iksar monk, because shove a fucking Fungi on them and a summon bandaid press and you can solo your way through to 60. You wanna come tell me that monks don't have class balance issues..... Yea. thought so<br />
<br />
<br />
COnclusion: Your argument is chock-full of half-truths and misconceptions, based entirely on opinion and &quot;personal experiences&quot; that contradict hundreds of experiences shared on these boards through the years. Come back with some facts or credible points, otherwise your &quot;warriors are balanced d00d&quot; argument holds no weight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I made no such &quot;warriors are balanced d00d&quot; argument.  I made a few points, and made no conclusions, other than that warriors do have distinct value.  An argument requires premises leading to a conclusion.  I made points intended for discussion.<br />
<br />
I do have a few comments based on your post:<br />
<br />
1) Outdamage warriors (non-tanking). Undisputable. Read the FoH monk vs. warrior vs. paladin parse thread <br />
<br />
While I might agree that SK's can outdamage warriors when spells are included, I just reread the thread in question and there is no data to that effect.  The thread is about a parse of paladins, monks and warriors.  When SK's are included in the discussion, it is supposition about what they would do if parsed.   Actually, this kind of makes my point about paladin examples being used to condemn knights in general.  As for the rest of your points in that section, they are all true to a degree or another.  I certainly believe that sk's provide cetain utility in raids and even exp groups that warriors do not.  We control aggro as well or better than any class.  In my experience, we don't actually tank mobs as well as warriors or paladins.   Our various liftaps do provide some mitigation, when they work, but my best tap is 350hp for a significant mana cost...I can't chain cast it or I will be out of mana very rapidly.  Our procs are subject to chance, but do provide some mitigation as well.  A test to accurately rank tanking ability might be in order, though appropriate criteria might be hard to determine.<br />
   In any case, you do not undermine the point that most of the arguments here are made using paladin examples to reach conclusions about knights.  All you do is point out that sk's have some utility.  Make the full argument.  Make the three way comparison.  I would be interested.  I might find it convincing, not that my opinion matters much.<br />
<br />
How many people do you know with 350+ AA's? Thats approx the amount when they become irrelevant for warriors, and probably later than that. Wanna know how many warriors I know with 350+ AAs ... 1 on my entire server.  <br />
<br />
I know many people that are struggling to decide where to spend their aa points next.  This struggle is not due to a dilemma between two or more awesome abilities.  On my server, there are plenty of warriors that are not terribly concerned with aa's anymore, and that number rises everyday.  It's rising even faster with LDoN.  I don't know about you, but I get half an aa every normal mission.  If I were going for a full suit of the much ballyhooed LDoN plate, I'd have 120 aa points to spend, by the time I finished....without augments.  Decking em out at three augments apiece would finish all my aa, and then some.  I'm not saying everyone is done with aa, but everyone that keeps playing will be eventually.  You do not undermine this point.  You simply say that it is rare for someone to be done at the present time.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. And I'll call you on that every time. LDoN's slightly different because of the re-surgent necessity for tanks. But, prior to LDoN, if you do a / lfg 65 all, I can bet you that more warriors show up on that list than any other class except maybe monks. I can ALSO bet you that most of those warriors are not from high-end guilds, because warriors at the high-end stage don't experience the same issues pre-EB warriors do.  <br />
<br />
Show me the screenshots.  That does not accord with my recolection.  I know every time I looked for a replacement tank prior to LDoN, they were as hard to find as most other classes, and that's  considering all tank classes.  On the other hand, at the present time, I just logged on to find one warrior lfg, along with 3 bards, 2 clerics, 1 sk, 2 paladins, 4 monks, etc......  Show me some data that's not based on opinion and personal experience.  I might  be convinced.  In this case, you answer my opninions/experience with some of your own, and claim superiority.<br />
<br />
Name them then.. HOw about that for a challenge. Bring on the shrinking HP/AC gap example. Bring the over-exagerated DPS argument. Bring on the 3-minute clown-shoes /disc defensive argument. Bring the &quot;Warrior taunt is fine because this one time, I was grouped with this warrior with a BoW and a Symbol of the Planemasters and 2katk and he held agro just fine.&quot; Bring them all, these boards have collectively destroyed each one 1000 times over, but I'd love to personally do it again. <br />
<br />
I make no such argument on purpose.  I don't know why people start warriors for the most part.  My baby warrior....well twinked of course...has dreams of tanking the really big mobs someday, the stuff that would make me splat on the sidewalk.  This may not be a realistic dream, but that's my dream for my warrior.  In my guild at least, warriors tank most if not all the boss mobs.  We may be dummies, but so far that's worked for us.  Sometimes, I want to tank those mobs, and at those times, I go work on my warrior.  I may be a dummy too.  Enlighten me.<br />
<br />
Do you know why people start warriors still. Here's a hint, not everyone that just started EQ has heard of these boards, and they sure as hell don't read them before starting one up.

I can already tell you the answer is no in all 3 cases, but feel free to see for yourself. <br />
<br />
I've been reading these boards, and I have a mid level warrior.  Of the three warriors in my guild that changed from an earlier main, at least one of them reads and posts on this board.  Don't speak for all or most warriors unless you are all or most warriors.  Show me the data that says most warriors of high level were convinced by the class descriptions to be warriors, and I'll concede the point.  A high level cleric knows the aggro issues of the tank classes full well.  A high level wizard knows the aggro issues of the tank classes full well.  I'd go so far as to say that a high level player of any grouping class knows these issues pretty well.  Still, people choose warriors for alts, and new mains.  Not every time, but enough of the time. <br />
<br />
3) Twinks have access to better gear at the pre-55 stage. Pretty important considering warriors are the most gear-dependant class in EQ. I'll call your bluff on most of your other classes starting warriors as a main and actually playing them through 65 and AA's. <br />
<br />
No bluff...all three that I have in mind are level 65 with aa's.  You just lost this pot.<br />
<br />
Twinks suggest NOTHING. Because in actuality, the number 1 twink class is still an iksar monk, because shove a fucking Fungi on them and a summon bandaid press and you can solo your way through to 60. You wanna come tell me that monks don't have class balance issues..... Yea. thought so <br />
<br />
I'm not talking about monks, and I didn't say there weren't balance issues.  I just made some points, which you have failed to undermine.<br />
<br />
COnclusion: Your argument is chock-full of half-truths and misconceptions, based entirely on opinion and &quot;personal experiences&quot; that contradict hundreds of experiences shared on these boards through the years. Come back with some facts or credible points, otherwise your &quot;warriors are balanced d00d&quot; argument holds no weight. <br />
<br />
Show me the half truths, based on evidence.  Show me the missconceptions, based on evidence.  Give me one argument not based on your own or other's &quot;personal experiences&quot;.  Come with some facts.  Read, the post you criticize and recognize when an argument is made, and what it's about.<br />
<br />
I never said there were not balance issues.  I just made a few points.  I would like to see warriors fixed, but I would like to see it done in a way that is fair and good for all.  You seem to see anything that doesn't go along with the warriors suck party-line as the enemy.  I'm not an enemy of warriors.  I love to play with wariors and have them in my groups regularly.<br />
<br />
I recognize that at the very minimum, there is plenty of smoke about tank class balance, so there is definitely at least some fire.  My points were intended to help find the fire, and perhaps clear away some smoke.  If I just added to the smoke, I apologize, but actually, two of the four responses to my post were interesting.  Even yours had some interesting points...if you cut away the rhetoric.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">It's pretty obvious to most that if you break down the classes into their basest components, this is what you SHOULD get.<br />
<br />
 Warrior AC/HP &gt; Paladin/SK AC/HP.<br />
 <br />
 Paladin Mitigation &gt; Warrior Mitigation &gt; SK Mitigation.<br />
<br />
 SK Aggro Generation &gt; Warrior Aggro Generation &gt; Paladin Aggro Generation.<br />
<br />
 (Note: Some Paladins, forgetting that originally stuns did not generate aggro, dispute this. Of course, they still don't have any aggro generation tools above and beyond a Warrior other than FOL in that case, but I digress.)<br />
<br />
 If you look at what goes on in the 'real world' of EQ, this is the breakdown you get:<br />
<br />
 Warrior AC/HP &gt; Paladin AC/HP &gt; SK AC/HP.<br />
 Paladin Mitigation &gt; Warrior Mitigation &gt; SK Mitigation.<br />
 SK Aggro Generation &gt; Paladin Aggro Generation &gt; Warrior Aggro Generation.<br />
<br />
 That's why, frankly, when I look at these posts, most people don't say bad things about SK's. If you must yell at them for using the term 'Knight', it's merely some form of political-type generalization striving for inoffensiveness rather than an attack on both Paladins and SK's.<br />
<br />
 Warriors, with one or two small exceptions, are balanced.<br />
 SK's appear to my eye to be balanced - and note that they make perfectly acceptable XP group tanks AS THEY ARE.<br />
 Paladins are the ones who are unbalanced. That's why I'd prefer a reduction in their aggro generation capabilities, after which they will STILL make perfectly acceptable XP group tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">I find the arguement that people are maxing out their desired AAs, and therefore not continuing to group which opens up more room for Warriors to be a rather convoluted one.<br />
<br />
So basically you seem to think it's okay that Warriors are the last choice as a tank because eventually the Knights will have all the AAs they want and will move on making room for the Warriors.  I guess we should have used that same arguement back during Kunark then.  Eventually Warriors would get to level 50 and have nothing more to group for, which would open up more room for Knight tanks....<br />
<br />
Somehow I don't think your arguement flys for a number reasons.  First you can't determine with certainty that once a person is done collecting the AAs they want that they won't be replaced by another member of their class.  So a level 65 Paladin with max AAs might just be replaced with a level 65 Paladin with fewer AAs.  And secondly you can't be certain that once all the AAs desired are collected that they'll move on at all. They may just like playing the game and collecting more gear, which LDoN certainly makes viable for most people for a long time.<br />
<br />
I imagine if I thought long enough about it I could come up with a few more.  So in reality it's a baseless arguement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>nazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">Bertrand Russel famously said, &quot;Nothing stokes the fires of logic more than burning a few straw men.&quot;<br />
<br />
You miss the point.  The point is that eventually, for every single person that plays long enough, exp groups for exp's sake will lose their importance.  When you don't really need exp, you start grouping for fun, with people you know and like, or you just raid, or whatever.  I'm not saying that more spots for warriors will open up, rather that there's a light at the end of the tunnel for everyone.  This won't necessarily get you or any warrior more groups, but it points out that there will come an end to your need to get them.<br />
<br />
I'm about finished with my defensive aa, and already have my harm touch aa complete.  Given that, I personally will very soon be less worried about getting pure exp groups.  Sure there's aa that I wan't beyond this, but it's less important to me.  As a result, I'll be less worried about getting a pure exp group.<br />
<br />
More often than not, the argument is that warriors are the last choice.   For me that rarely applies, because I mostly group with friends and fill in needed spots with guildies.  Warriors are far from my last choice for such spots.  In fact, due to the fact that I know and like alot of our warriors, they are often among the first choices.<br />
<br />
My point is that the primary fight should be over issues that effect a class throughout its life cycle.  There is an end to the importance of getting pick up exp groups.  It will come for all that play long enough.  That is a simple mathematical fact.  If finding pick-up exp groups is the most important issue, then fine, go for it.  I'm just saying there are factors that mitigate the importance of the warrior's role in the exp group.<br />

Historically SoE has always added more reasons sooner or later.<br />
<br />
My point is that the primary fight should be over issues that effect a class throughout its life cycle. There is an end to the importance of getting pick up exp groups. It will come for all that play long enough. <br />
<br />
And it's logically obvious that those that play a preferred class will reach that point before those that don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">This is getting fun. Guess round 1 knock-out wasn't enough. Let's go round 2.<br />
<br />
1) Look at that post and desipher what i mean yourself. Balance AA's vs. teh lack or raw atk on the part of the paladin and he can parse about 80-90% of a warrior's DPS. SK's can supplement that easy. <br />
2) Taps aren't used to keep yourself healed while tanking, but during an AoE fight.<br />
3) This just makes no sense:<br />
<br />
&quot;In any case, you do not undermine the point that most of the arguments here are made using paladin examples to reach conclusions about knights. All you do is point out that sk's have some utility. Make the full argument. Make the three way comparison. I would be interested. I might find it convincing, not that my opinion matters much.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm showing you SK utility on a raid, none of which you have disproven to be true so far. So what the fuck is that statement still about? You want the bottom line here, fine. Forget paladins, they're raid role is WELL secured via heals. MTing warriors 1-3 are more important than an SK's role, but they are more important than almost everyone on the raid anyways. A non-tanking SK has the utilities I mentioned, and is far more useful to the raid than an additional warrior. I'm showing you that you have raid utility no less than that of a monk. We're gonna leave XP groups aside, because you have no valid claims there, knights own warrior up the ass here, and your fellow knights will admit this,<br />
<br />
&quot;I know many people that are struggling to decide where to spend their aa points next. This struggle is not due to a dilemma between two or more awesome abilities. On my server, there are plenty of warriors that are not terribly concerned with aa's anymore, and that number rises everyday. It's rising even faster with LDoN.

Decking em out at three augments apiece would finish all my aa, and then some. I'm not saying everyone is done with aa, but everyone that keeps playing will be eventually. You do not undermine this point. You simply say that it is rare for someone to be done at the present time.&quot;<br />
<br />
See, you say I don't undermine your point, but I actually do. your SPECIFIC argument was there comes a time when AA's become irrelevant. I'm telling you that even with 300+ aa, they are still relevant. Therefore, your claim of desireability (don't try shoving the word viability in my face, with my gear I am a viable DPS spot in a group, but I don't get groups as DPS class). I'm telling you as a fact that very few warriors actually have all of their necessary AA's. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of your argument that you claim I failed to undermine, there is nothing left to &quot;undermine there.&quot; Prior to LDoN, the fact is that most warriors, and other classes besides ideal soloers were well short of fulfilling their usefull AA's, which you have yet to counter.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me the screenshots. That does not accord with my recolection. I know every time I looked for a replacement tank prior to LDoN, they were as hard to find as most other classes, and that's considering all tank classes. On the other hand, at the present time, I just logged on to find one warrior lfg, along with 3 bards, 2 clerics, 1 sk, 2 paladins, 4 monks, etc...... Show me some data that's not based on opinion and personal experience. I might be convinced. In this case, you answer my opninions/experience with some of your own, and claim superiority.&quot;<br />
<br />
You seem to have your US litigation system backwards. You are making the initial claim. Burden of proof is on you. Consdering I stated my argument was based on PRE-LDoN figures because of the increased necessity for tanks, I'd be hard-pressed to prove my point. But of course you somehow missed that point. In any case, I bet I can still prove your point wrong, even now. <br />
<br />
&quot;I make no such argument on purpose. I don't know why people start warriors for the most part. My baby warrior....well twinked of course...has dreams of tanking the really big mobs someday, the stuff that would make me splat on the sidewalk. This may not be a realistic dream, but that's my dream for my warrior. In my guild at least, warriors tank most if not all the boss mobs. We may be dummies, but so far that's worked for us. Sometimes, I want to tank those mobs, and at those times, I go work on my warrior. I may be a dummy too. Enlighten me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Can you explain what this paragraph is trying to prove? Are you trying to illustrate why you started your warrior twink? If you don't fit my reasons, fine. But you haven't addressed the argument that # of people that start warriors twinks don't reflect the class balance. See my monk analogy for illustration, which again you failed to address.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been reading these boards, and I have a mid level warrior. Of the three warriors in my guild that changed from an earlier main, at least one of them reads and posts on this board. Don't speak for all or most warriors unless you are all or most warriors. Show me the data that says most warriors of high level were convinced by the class descriptions to be warriors, and I'll concede the point. A high level cleric knows the aggro issues of the tank classes full well. A high level wizard knows the aggro issues of the tank classes full well. I'd go so far as to say that a high level player of any grouping class knows these issues pretty well. Still, people choose warriors for alts, and new mains. Not every time, but enough of the time. &quot;<br />
<br />
WOW. I mean Wowwie wow. THis is just too easy. Let's see if you actually catch on this time. When most warriors GET INTO EQ FOR THE FIRST TIME (you still with me there buddy boy), they usually haven't heard of TSW. The ONLY basis of character creation they have is the fucking manual description that comes with each copy of EQ. Hell, there's tons of warriors that STILL haven't heard of TSW. And I will make a VERY large wager that when most warriors here just got into EQ, they didn't learn about the warrior class from fucking TSW because they hadn't heard of the site. Your inability to even addressmy other points, while dealing with this one in absolute redundancy is just sinking your credibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not talking about monks, and I didn't say there weren't balance issues. I just made some points, which you have failed to undermine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait wait. You're not talking about monks, even though there are more monk twinks than any other class, and you refuse to go into monk class balance. But, you use the same twink argument for why people make warriors, and you somehow link THAT to class balance. Tell me, do people walk upside down with their heads implanted up their asses where you live?<br />
<br />
Show me the half truths, based on evidence. Show me the missconceptions, based on evidence. Give me one argument not based on your own or other's &quot;personal experiences&quot;. Come with some facts. Read, the post you criticize and recognize when an argument is made, and what it's about.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've already SHOWN them to you. I've already SHOWN you the fucking utility that SK's have that you claim no one ever brings up. This isn't personal opinion, this is fucking FACT. You want your half-truths and mis-information, just read your fucking post again. You keep talking about warrior attributes without mentioning a single one of them. You talk about how warriors don't sit LFG like other people do, but that's opinion as well. You even bring up people start warrior ALTS/TWINKS as an example of how warriors are balanced (how, how does this even make sense to is beyond me). You wanted to know where your fucking half-truths and misconceptions were, read this or your post again.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last 2 paragraphs have little content but some swinging back and forth on the balance pendulum on your part. Just one sentence to address, don't educate me on posting style. WHat you call rhetoric is elaborated facts, rather than baseless opinions. Bring some of those over and we'll talk. Until then, you're done. No claims left. You can come back and keep saying that &quot;I didn't undermine your arguments&quot; but truth remains that your post had no factual backing, and your &quot;arguments&quot; have been thoroughly destroyed. So, either come back with facts or credible data, or wear some protective gear because 3 straight ownings hurt.</div></div><hr />

It's interesting that your first point mentions dps, but look at this section of parsing and tell me what you see.<br />
<br />
Not sure, but stuff like this seems to indicate that warriors are doing just fine in the dps dept.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, look at the sheer number of warriors vs. the number of knights.  Has anyone stopped to consider that if there is a 2-1 ratio of warriors to paladins or warriors to sk's then there will be a larger portion of warriors lfg.<br />
<br />
Now, one way to answer that statement is to say that because knights are prefered warriors will have an even harder time finding groups.  While I do agree that knights have an advantage atm, I don't agree that it's to the degree alot of warriors are trying to say.  Warriors are still getting groups.  They just aren't getting them at the rate they once were.  Because of this it can aggravate the warriors feeling that he is worse off then he truly is.</div></div><hr />

Knight missing 100 raw atk + crit AA's, warrior missing raging fury 3, TM-3 and all ripo AA's. Now, I'm assuming by this he means has raging fury 2, TM-2. All things considered, 100 raw atk would net like 140 total, and that + crit aa's would net about the same DPS increase as getting TM-3, raging fury 3 and all double ripo aa's for warriors, maybe more favored to knights side but this is debatable. 111.9/136.5 = 82%. So, paladins deal approx 82% as much damage as a warrior. There's no way you can argue an SK cannot suplement the 18% difference via spells.</div></div><hr />

What world you live in?<br />
<br />
I know sooo many warriuors that were 65 with 150+ AA that have quit in disgust and started other characters because they cant get groups except to MT boss mobs.<br />
<br />
On our raids, if we have more than 4 warriors its a miracle... haveing less than 8 paladins is a shock...<br />
<br />
Also, if you havent failed to notice.. Paladin elemntal weapons drop like poop in a babies diapers, finally clean one up and theres a nother lieing there on the ground... Not to mention the ratio of war/melee only gear vs Knight only gear. Warriors are stuck using BoC/BF.. while knights get an array of elemental weapons.<br />
<br />
There are on average from my experience 2x as many knights in any elemental zone as you will find warriors, on any given day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chavr, I rememberl having a very similar discussion with you (as I recall it was you) prior to PoP where I said something very similar, that Paladins weren't as bad off as some were making them out to be and that Paladins were still getting groups.  And I was told I was talking out of my hat because I wasn't a Paladin and therefore had no idea what I was talking about.  Why wouldn't that hold true in this case as well?  Or will you argue that you're better informed and more knowledgeable about Warriors now than I was about Paladins then?  If so, you'd better be prepared to back that up with something.</div></div><hr />

MTing warriors 1-3 are more important than an SK's role, but they are more important than almost everyone on the raid anyways. A non-tanking SK has the utilities I mentioned, and is far more useful to the raid than an additional warrior. <br />
<br />
So, the first three warriors are more usefull than almost anyone, but it's time to whine when number 4 isn't more usefull than the first sk?<br />
<br />
Make the three way comparison...Partha seems to be able to do it.  You might agree with his or her conclusions, but at least it's a more sophisticated discussion that the warrior v. knight one you're trying to push.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm telling you as a fact that very few warriors actually have all of their necessary AA's.  <br />
<br />
You say this is a fact, but provide no evidence, so it's really a supposition.  I would agree that it is likely true, but it is not a fact known by you unless you have proof.  The use of the non-specific &quot;very few&quot; is interesting as well.  There is some fact of the matter as to how many warriors are done with all aa, and no longer need exp.  There is also the mathematical fact that every bit of experience you get brings you closer to this limit.<br />
<br />
If exp groups are the warrior's main concern, that's fine, as I said before.  It is possible that focusing on another area of class balance is better, that's all I'm trying to point out.<br />
<br />
Prior to LDoN, the fact is that most warriors, and other classes besides ideal soloers were well short of fulfilling their usefull AA's, which you have yet to counter. <br />
<br />
This is conjecture on your part.  It may be right, and it may be wrong.  It does not undermine the fact that every single point of exp brings one closer to the last they will ever need.<br />
<br />
You seem to have your US litigation system backwards. You are making the initial claim. Burden of proof is on you.<br />
<br />
Are we in court?  I don't think so.  I thought this was a discussion forum.  In any case, the burden of proof ought to be on the class that seeks the change in the status quo.  Am I mistaken, or is it not changes to benefit the warrior class what we're discussing here?<br />
<br />
Consdering I stated my argument was based on PRE-LDoN figures because of the increased necessity for tanks, I'd be hard-pressed to prove my point. But of course you somehow missed that point. In any case, I bet I can still prove your point wrong, even now. <br />
<br />
I don't recall a pre-LDoN problem, and if it's gone post LDoN, what the hell are you complaining about?  If you can prove it is not gone, go for it.  I'd love to see the proof.<br />
<br />
If you don't fit my reasons, fine. But you haven't addressed the argument that # of people that start warriors twinks don't reflect the class balance. <br />
<br />
I think the fact that people start warriors after playing other classes is interesting.  Is it a knock down argument...no.  I never claimed it was.  I do know people that have level 65 characters that they set aside to level up warriors to level 65.  That does say to me that warriors have value as a class to play.  If you are playing a warrior, that also says to me that warriors have value as a class to play.  This assumes rationality and a desire to have fun on the part of the decision maker, of course.<br />
<br />
An interesting question would be to ask why people make and play warriors up to level 65.  Making a warrior and playing it to the mid levels makes sense if a person just followed the class descriptions.  Sure, most brand new players know very little about the game.  Once you have played a while, though, you start to learn things, I hope.  If there's no good reason to play a warrior, then I honestly don't know why anyone would continue to play one.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying that there must be something good about wariors if people play them to level 65 and beyond.  Personally, I'm not sure what that something is, but then again, I don't play a level 65 warrior.  I think the best fit for me was Sk.  If, however, the discussion took what was good about the warrior as a class for a starting point, I think that would be a solid foundation for further discourse.  Figure out what's good about the class, why people want to play it, and why they continue to play it.  Upon this foundation, consensus could be built around improvements.    <br />
<br />
Lastly, I don't feel owned.  I don't need a cup or any other protective gear, because there's not really anything that can be said that will bother me.  Try to own me.  Bring on your opinions, because underneath it, you have made some interesting points.  I think people that talk about being owned in these type of threads do more harm than good.  This is not a competition.  My impression of the original purpose for the thread was an attempt to reach concensus over balancing issues.  Consensus comes through rational discussion, not &quot;ownings&quot;. <br />
<br />
I hope the general discussion continues, because there are good ideas and honest differences of opinion here.  Eq, and the eq community benifits from discourse such as much of what has gone on in this thread.  To my mind, this is in spite of the more rhetorical posts, but sure, if you feel that I need to be &quot;owned&quot; again, go for  it, it won't bother me any.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Many people started Warriors because they seemed less complicated, were in the thick of battle, and it appealed to them for other random reasons.<br />
<br />
They generally were not confronted with issues of class superiority or inferiority. A Warrior tanked, simple enough. Unless someone was a higher level than you or had better gear you MT'd in groups.<br />
<br />
So, becoming a better MT was a clear path. Get more levels and get better gear.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Knights this left them out in the cold. They either got a group when a decent Warrior wasn't available or they offtanked.<br />
<br />
Throughout this period many SK's consoled themselves by offering to duel anyone and everyone. After losing enough, Warriors understood they wouldn't usually win, laughed off futher challanges, and fired back &quot;Ah, but can ya MT?&quot;<br />
<br />
In these glory days many many players made Warrior alts and some even changed classes. The belief that Warrors are uber survived mana burning Wizards (&quot;What do you expect? They're casters!) and the rehabilitation of Knights.<br />

Now many of us have quite a bit invested in becoming the best Warrior possible. Unfortunately Knights are better at meeting our Class Description than we are. Whoops! 8)<br />

<br />
Paladin 450 Mana / casttime 5sec / healing 1125 hps<br />
Druid 600 Mana / casttime 10sec / Healing up to 4680hps / (75%)<br />
Shaman 400 Mana / casttime 10sec / healing up to 1950hps / (75%)<br />
Cleric 400 Mana / casttime 10sec / healing 7500hps<br />
<br />
So in other words to heal a warrior for 9000 hps <br />
<br />
A paladin will need 3600 mana<br />
A Shaman will need ~2000 mana<br />
A Druid will need 1200 mana<br />
A cleric will need ~800 mana<br />
<br />
You will now see that we are less then 25% effectiv as single target healer then the cleric. Arround 33% as effectiv as a druid. Arround 55.55 as effecitv as a shaman. The shaman has the big advantage that he can regen mana back a lot faster then knights.<br />
<br />
Now if you next time groupe with a cleric ask him when he is at 75% mana. That is the moment the knight will be oom. When you have a druid ask him when he has 66,6% mana. That is the moment the knight is oom. When you group with a shaman ask him when he has 44% mana left without cana it back and that is the moment the knight will be oom.<br />
<br />
You then will have an idea HOW effectiv we are as single target healer. You then will sit arround half the time to get the knight his mana back because the 3 priest class usually have it way easier to max out there flowing thought then knights and so they regen mana back at a faster rate which make them even more effectiv. Yes we can support heal when needed but to have a knight as mainhealer will make your goupe very, very ineffectiv.<br />

Druid: none (maybe Nature's Infusion, but 3.75 sec casting time for only 1750 hps at 500 mana)<br />
Shaman: none (maybe Tnarg's Mending, but 3.75 sec casting time for only 1300 hps at 450 mana)<br />

<br />
Shaman get Quiescence and Druids get Karana's Renewal, but otherwise, Paladins heal better and buff better than either. Paladin group heals and emergency heals blow shaman and druids away, and are about as good as those of clerics, and better in some key respects, and their rez is only 6% less -- I'll take a 90% rez in PoP all day long (and have). Could a paladin be a main healer in a group? Depends on the group, but it's possible. They can certainly help out in a pretty big way, and do things other classes, even priest classes, just can't do.<br />

Just guessing, but I think we'd find Paladins are better healers and buffers than Rangers, but produce lower DPS.<br />
<br />
But wait! Paladins are Utility Tanks - not Main Healers or DPS. They should be compared to Warriors and Shadow Knights. So in the interest of completeness -<br />
<br />
Warrior Best Heal - Bandage Wound 80 HP's 10 Seconds<br />
Warrior Best Buff - Health 31 STA Inc (equipment right click)<br />
<br />
I contend Paladins are quite competative for the MT slot. They are also supah very good in one of the three non MT, MH, CC/Slow slots - they can single target heal, group heal, buff, pacify, root, stun, GRC, res, and tank.<br />
<br />
The only time I can think of that I would definately prefer adding a Warrior to an experiance group instead of a Paladin is when it already contains one or if for some reason we're camping especially hard hitting mobs.<br />

See, this is the kind of stuff that just pisses me off.  Why?  Because Paladins insist on comparing their weakness to the strength of others when it makes no sense at all.  Paladins aren't as good a healer as Clerics?  Well, duh.  Of course they aren't, because if they were there'd be no reason for there to be a Cleric class in the game.  Now, let's make a valid comparison, how much better as healers are Paladins compared to Warriors?  Would you say that the Warrior advantage in tanking was as great as the Paladin advantage in healing?  No?  I thought not.   How about the Warrior advantage in DPS, is it as great as the Paladin advantage in healing?  No?  Hmm, could be there's a pattern here.  But then again, we all know that all Paladin healing is useless, right?<br />
<br />
Even without snap aggro Paladins clearly heal head and shoulders better than a Warrior, while not clearly tanking or dishing DPS anywhere near as worse.  So Paladins need to stop saying that they aren't as good a healer as Clerics and aren't as good a tank as Warriors, because the point is that the combination of their abilities is far superior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">Once again, Arbosch rolls by with a completely bogus set of numbers. Way to go! <br />
<br />
Arbosch's post is the most informative on this page at least.  You need to focus on what spells are being used to heal a tank in an xp group, and its not group heals or heal over times, heck im not a cleric and nor am I &quot;damn near&quot; one and i know that high mana cost heals are used sparingly which you, being a warrior who gets healed more than anyone in EQ should already know...<br />
<br />
Bottom line is we are not &quot;damn near&quot; as clerics at healing as someone posted, it was my ONLY point / argument.  Until someone can show me how our 1150hp heals (our most efficient, largest hp heal) out performs a shaman, druid, or clerics CHs, then I can agree.  We are backup and emergency healers, never meant to be main healers and I cant think of an XP group where we can be.<br />
<br />
Paladins aren't as good a healer as Clerics? Well, duh. Of course they aren't <br />
So happy that someone understands :P.  My only point was that we are not &quot;damn near&quot; as clerics.  Where you started comparing warriors and paladins tanking, i mean healing (?!) i have no idea.  I think you just need the last couple of posts, which was about  paladins being &quot;damn near&quot; clerics in heals.  (nothing about tanking).<br />
<br />
we all know that all Paladin healing is useless, right? <br />
<br />
darn, i cant join your group?  But i got BRELLS!<br />
<br />
A paladins highest HP heal is at level 61 for 1150hp for the cost of 450mana and a clerics best heal is at level 39 for 400 mana.  Paladins &quot;damn near&quot; clerics ?</div></div><hr />

Lets explain it in another way.<br />
<br />
Is there ANY need for another healer then a cleric/shaman/druid in a groupe. You need more healing power then one of this 3 classes? 90% of the time this is more then enough. In LDoN it is 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
I think we both agree knights can not fit this role. Now that we cant fit the healing role and there isnt any need for support healing most of the time in exp groups. How much worth are our heals really? <br />
<br />
It is the same with defensiv. It is a superior discipline. But to bad it is usless 99% of the time in exp groups. But it is still in fact a very, very strong discipline. The same with our heals. They are very, very effectiv in the right situation. But this situation dont happen 99% of the time when ther is a mainhealer class in groupe. You dont want us to have defensiv as a balance factor. Why in hell you want then take heals as balance factor when both dont help us to fit in our mainrole ?<br />

Every caster has root.  There is also snare, mez, charm for overpulls.  We are probably the last class you want to be rooting  or crowd controlling as our roots suck royally<br />
<br />

... you should already know.  You are the MT - the guy that takes all the beating.  If not then your either a dps slot, or the off tank who gets on adds to keep off casters... could also be puller since you can take the initial damage, long enough for heals to land anyway.  <br />
<br />
Ran into a trap and everyone has a 'lil poison DoT? Not to worry, we've got a Paladin!  <br />
Every priest class has some type of cure poison spell.  Now that I think of it, dont all LDoN groups or any XP groups have a priest class in them? ie cleric, shaman, druid, paladin (all have Counteract Poison or better)<br />
<br />
<br />
Gee, there sure are a lot of undead in here, it's a good thing we invited a Paladin!! <br />
I can agree with you here since undead has been our specialty since pre kunark.  While we do average ~20% increased dps vs undead... compared to some of you warriors dps, the 30AA it cost for the ability puts our dps with yours if not slightly ahead if not tanking, that is IF we get a slay off.  Remember LDoN mobs have like 10-15khp.  Since 2% of our swings are slays and Im positive i dont swing 100 times per mob to see that lucky 2%.  And a lot of the times you'll see a 3k+ slay when a mob is already at 1% health or near yey eyecandy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">My point is that Paladins are a very powerful class especially in an environment like LDoN. An extra heal is always welcome as is another person root parking mobs.<br />
<br />
What I'm seeing thus far is truely overpowering groups. When a Warrior is MT slowing and crowd conrol just seem to happen. He's responsible for the mob he's tanking and when the pull is under control the carnage begins.<br />
<br />
I know that a Paladin has to mesh better in such groups, but frankly the ones I've been in adjust to a Warrior without a hitch.<br />
<br />
One thing is clear - the composition and tactics used by experiance groups has changed dramatically in the last 2 months.<br />
<br />
I believe a level 65 Warrior is proving to be a reasonable fit because he can take a huge amount of punishment until a chaotic situation is sorted out. However I'm begining to think that lower level Warriors are going to have a much harder time especially when compared to simularly equipped Paladins at their level.<br />

The point isn't that you can do 1/2 of your job less efficiently than the parent classes. The point is the combo the fast heals and tanking. That superior combo is what get you guys groups. Not only can you own the fuck out of undead (even without SU3), you can heal if need be.<br />

read above.  I am well aware of our small fast heals, its what puts us ahead of all the priest classes, specifically for the casters since they have hellla less HPs than yous where cleric heals will probably not be casted in time to save them.  I am well aware of our hybrid abilities combined... vs LDoN mobs and most xp groups anyway; not something many of us would do in, lets say a Plane of Tactics raid where we could be literally one rounded.  I am aware of your abilities in an XP groups... and hope that something is incoming from V to you to appeal to xp groups and not just named mobs / raids.</div></div><hr />

A little background about me. I play on Vallon in Ancient Dawn. We are in the elemental planes. Against you i know other classes very well. I know them because i fight against this classes since 4 years. I know where they are strong and where they are weak in a groupe, raid or solo situation. I allso know the difference between a good and a bad player. I know the difference  gear can make. You only know what other classes can do from view at them from your limited view. I have a way larger base of knowledge then you because i feel what they can do.<br />
<br />
***<br />
The point is NOT that you can't fill the role of primary healer. The point is that you CAN tank almost as well a Warrior<br />
***<br />
<br />
With 'The point is NOT that you can't fill...' you say this part is usless. You dont care about it. A full turn arround what come then in the next part where you then say BUT this usless part is that overpowered. Yes we tank almost as well as a Warriors which is NOT in defensive because this is our primary role.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
and back up heal better than any other class in the game. Shaman and Druids don't have your AE heals. Clerics just work better when grouped with you. <br />
***<br />
<br />
So clerics/Druids/Shamans  work better when they are grouped with a knight why?  Because we can help healing. This make them work better? That we take over part of there job? Sorry this dont make them better. It make that they need to work less which make them less less usefull. You see what you call is making other class better is effectiv nothing else then make other classes less usefull. Ergo the groupe is less usefull because we have wasted power which can get invest in usefull stuff. Tell me why it make clerics stronger when they are grouped with a knight when we all agree that 1 cleric/shaman/druid is more then enough to keep the groupe alive. If more effectiv = others have to do less. Damm nerf afk groups. They are overpowered because they can waste all there time. <br />
<br />
***<br />
Paladins are without a doubt the best secondary healer bar none! And they tank pretty damn well on top of it! So to claim your spells aren't needed just means you're not going where they are. If you're not willing to challenge yourself, is that my problem? Hell no. Don't try and argue that my class needs to be kept down because you're unwilling to go where your full talents are required. Not my problem.<br />
***<br />
So your say i should make hard missions in LDoN. I agree i will like to make them because normal missions are to easy. But wait. In hard missions i die very fast and the only class which can tank hard mini nameds are warriors because i need 2 healers to keep me alive. So ether you have 1 Knight, 2 Healer classes or 1 Warrior and 1 Healer. So in hard missions warriors are way more powerfull because they are that much more effecitv. So i can turn your owne words against you and can say this. Don't try to fuck up us knights because you're unwilling to go where your full talents are required. Not my problem.<br />
<br />

The game revolves around Risk VS. Reward. If Normal LDoN missions are easily beaten then they are what players will generally select. If SoE kept statistics of how many players choose Normal vs Hard missions I believe it overwhelmingly favors Normal at the present time. This choice is not something Warriors exercise any control over.<br />
<br />
If a Knight can do the job of tanking (as you say, your primary role) in the overwhelming majority of missions selected by groups PLUS toss in an ocassional heal, root, Res if something goes wrong, AND have vastly superior Aggro Abilities then there is no good reason to select a Warrior to tank if a Paladin is available.<br />
<br />
Warriors should not be inferior in performing their only function in Normal LDoN groups.<br />

The Cleric, Shaman, and even the Paladin boards agree Warriors currently have some problems. Rather than fence with words and post &quot;traps&quot; why don't you just make your point and be done with it?<br />

This is right, but what you dont unterstand. If all this root, heals, ress etc. are not needed. How much worth is it then? Most paladin know from the past that it is not enough to get in a groupe. I was arround from the start and we allways was able to root mobs. We was allways able to heal. We was allways able to tag aggro fast. Why we had that a hard time in kunark then? Because we was not able to be a real replace for warrior in the tankslot. <br />
<br />
Or lets explain it in anotherway and dont get angry that i explain it in this way. Warriors are way better tanks then knights IF they are in defensiv. The problem is it is not needed and so it has no real worth for exp groups. If defensiv is needed and it is needed in hard missions it make warriors that supperior against knights that the balance is total out of whack in your favore. What you warriors now want is to balance the situation in normal missions but dont look at hard missions where everything is in your favore. You think it is a fair balance to take the balance only from the hard missions where you need defensiv and so make the warrior better then they are? No, why in hell you do it then with us knights and our tools. Why you think it is fair to say balance is when warrior is as good as a knight which tank and heal and root. A warrior has tools to and so if you take the knight and balance him with all his tools. Take the warrior allso with all his tools. This include defensiv. This include offensiv disiplines etc. All this tools are worth something to. <br />

Those are only needed in raids.  LDoN even on hard, never really requires them, they are a bonus thats there for a fubar, but not NEEDED.<br />
<br />
The whole argument against giving warriors some form of snap aggro because it would put knights back in Kunark is total BS.  Yes you could grab aggro back then, but your spells were all gimped for the level cleric hand me downs.  Your hp sucked, you defense skill wasn't up to par, you had an xp penalty, you had a mana penalty.<br />
<br />
All these things are gone now.  You have nearly as much hp as a warrior, nearly as much mitigation, you have class specific spells, that no matter how much you try to downplay are a FAR cry better than anything you had in Kunark.<br />
<br />
How does making warriors competative suddenly take all this away? HOW?  Nobody has explained this yet.  You may not have gotten groups back then because of secondary ability, but mabey thats because they were gimp, not needed.  Combined with the fact that you couldn't tank, yeah, you may not have gotten groups then.<br />
<br />
This is not Kunark.  It never will be Kunark again unless the Dev team does something beyond stupid.  If warriors get snap aggro, we may be the most efficient tank over 6 hours of parsing, but we will NEVER, and I mean NEVER be able to do all the things knights can do to make up for their 'tanking inferiority'  You'd still be a very viable tank with tons of other things you can do to boot.  /rant off</div></div><hr />

It was not because Root, heal, group heal, buffs, res, remove curse, etc. were without value. It was because I needed a LOT more healing to let me MT and that made it hard for me to get a group. I know for a fact that if I had enough AC, HPs, and mitigation to MT, getting groups would have been no problem.<br />
<br />
Paladins do not have survivability problems that prevent them from getting experiance groups. In fact, their vast aggro control superiority has made them prefered MT's.<br />
<br />
Warriors have aggro control problems make them a comparative burden in experiance groups.<br />
<br />
Even if Warriors had competative aggro control things wouldn't be perfectly balanced.<br />
<br />
In most experiance groups root, heals, group heal, buffs, res, remove curse, etc. will still make Paladins the preferred MT. In 40% of the LDoN content which contains a substantial amount of undead there is no question as to their superiority.<br />
<br />
Only in the content where mobs hit exceptionally hard do Warriors have any advantage what so ever.<br />
<br />
Yep, taking into account all abilities, even if Warriors had snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro, Paladins would still enjoy substantial advantages.<br />

You have the second best group heal in the game, if not the very best, and the second best fast heal in the game, if not the very best -- and you even get to choose what *kind* of excellent fast heal you want to cast. You buff better than any class in the game. You have an excellent root, a completely serviceable rez, you cure, you have various other utility abilities, you have LoH, you can tank, and you can manage aggro better than any class around. Oh yeah, and you can cast stun spells that actually, you know, stun -- as in completely block on all incoming damage from a stunnable mob for the length of the stun.

Ergo the groupe is less usefull because we have wasted power which can get invest in usefull stuff. Tell me why it make clerics stronger when they are grouped with a knight when we all agree that 1 cleric/shaman/druid is more then enough to keep the groupe alive. If more effectiv = others have to do less. Damm nerf afk groups. They are overpowered because they can waste all there time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aborsch, you arrogant ass.... I am about to teach you a few fucking things about Everquest, so go grab a cup of coffee, perhaps a smoke, and get ready to absorb a little dose of reality.<br />
<br />
Druids:<br />
<br />
The reason Paladins make druids &quot;better&quot; in experience groups is god damned simple.    You can buff an entire party with &quot;the missing&quot; buffs when a druid is a primary healer.   What this means is that the druid, a naturally weaker healer than a cleric has a little more &quot;wiggle room&quot; with the entire party than they do with ANY other class while they are playing primary healer.  <br />
<br />
Secondarily, since druid heals tend to be a little more costly per hitpoint, it's especially crucial that they don't waste that mana spreading heals out to everyone in a group, and are FAR better off focusing their heals on a single individual.    You enable that on two different fronts, first your dominance in aggro ensures that no one else gets hit.    Second, you can provide those heals to ancillary party members even if they ARE hit without being a major burden on the druid's mana.<br />
<br />
Finally, since you have stuns, you have the ability to completely prevent melee damage from occuring for a period of time when using such spells as QWoS and the FoA twins.  Because of this, a druid as primary healer spends even less mana healing you because you ARE the better defensive tank against stunnable mobs.   This gives a druid the potential opportunity to use his mana for causing damage, increasing the kill rate.<br />
<br />
Shamans:<br />
<br />
You make a Shaman a better group member when he is primary healer for many of the same reasons as you do a Druid, except... you bring EVEN MORE hitpoints to a group with a shaman as primary healer.   As a matter of fact, when a shaman is primary healer in a group... NOT ONLY do you have the ability to buff an entire group with a complete buffset, and NOT ONLY are you a superior defensive tank because the mobs are stunnable.... you ALSO have the benefit of being the superior tank because against a warrior wearing the *exact same gear in every slot* you have MORE hitpoints and armor class than the warrior does because of your ability to buff FAR beyond the defensive spread between warriors and knights.   <br />
<br />
Cleric:<br />
<br />
The reason you &quot;improve&quot; clerics in experience groups is because of this neat little skill that they have called &quot;Divine Arbitration&quot; which equalizes hitpoints among members of a group.    When used in conjunction with you group heals it ensures that...<br />
<br />
1. You gain MASSSIVE amounts of aggro through group heal<br />
<br />
2. The cleric gains *no* aggro<br />
<br />
3. The cleric spends *no* mana for what is in essence a complete heal.<br />
<br />
Add to this the advantage that you STILL have over warriors against mobs that can be stunned, and you have the triumvirate of exp superiority.  There is not a SINGLE circumstance where a warrior is a better choice in an experience group than a Paladin for the job of tanking.<br />
<br />
That, my unjustifiably arrogant freind, is why the game is imbalanced, and it ALL revolves around... your FUCKING UTILITY, never even fucking MIND about your overwhelming and undeserved aggro advantage, or the itemization insanity in Everquest at this point.    <br />
<br />
To recap:<br />
<br />
1. Aborsch thinks far higher of himself than is justified<br />
<br />
2. Paladins with ANY of the priest classes as primary healer is superior to a warrior in experience groups.<br />
<br />
3. Paladins are the best healing melee class in EQ. <br />
<br />
4. Paladins are the *single* best buffing class in EQ for hitpoints and armor class.  They also use those buffs FAR more often than they like to admit to.<br />
<br />
5. Idiots who come to the Steel Warrior board and make bold and unsubstantiated comments will be owned.</div></div><hr />

It was not because Root, heal, group heal, buffs, res, remove curse, etc. were without value. It was because I needed a LOT more healing to let me MT and that made it hard for me to get a group. I know for a fact that if I had enough AC, HPs, and mitigation to MT, getting groups would have been no problem.<br />
***<br />
<br />
So this is exactly the situation in Hard missions in LDoN. We dont are good enough tanks to survive and will need more healing. What you warriors now do with us knight is to look at balance for this situation. This situation you look godlike and think the balance have to ge created arround this situation. Where the warrior has his full potential. That this situation is very, very rare and not happen a lot you dont care. He is godlike at this moment.<br />
I play a knight. I know how often the tools i have are needed. The fault all your warriors here do is that you look at us when we us all our tools. This situation is as rarly as you need defensiv in an exp groupe. I not dieed more then 3 times the last 1/2 year in an exp groupe. I not gone oom the last 1/2 year more then 10 times in an exp groupe. Why ? You can not heal more then keep someone at 100% hps. You can not ress someone who not die. You have no need for root when you only get one mob or when the mobs are that weak that you want them hit you that they get wounded from dmg shields. You can not keep them on you more then that they hit you. Tell me please why you think it is fair that you look at us when we us all our tools and look at you when you are in a 'normal' situation. Sound stupid to build up balance arround this. It is and you do it.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Warriors have aggro control problems make them a comparative burden in experiance groups.<br />
<br />
Even if Warriors had competative aggro control things wouldn't be perfectly balanced.<br />
***<br />
<br />
It will never be perfect balanced but i think it will be a good balance then. Special with LDoN now with hard missions which are build up in the mind with a defensiv tank. The moment the reward for hard missions get in and it is worth doing this warrior will get a big boost against knigts. You only need a tool to get aggro. Your job is to tank and that you have problems to aggro there is your problem. Not a reason to nerf knights and so you should ask for tools to fix this.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Thanks for pointing that out Arbosch. However in reviewing the FoH thread regarding this topic, many of your points had been refuted there. I doubt if they are going to carry any more weight here. Not a personal attack, just pointing out a weak argument is weak wherever its repeated.<br />
***<br />
<br />
What you call weak arguments is nothing else then ignorring the facts you dont like. You know you cant arguement against them so you ignorre them. If you dont want to look at it from a different view you are allways right. No one can argument against you then, because you are allways right because you look at it from your view. It is a very limited view but for you it is the right view. If this is okay for you well... <br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
You're right Arbosch your spells are meaningless. Therefore I think they should all be removed, except for the stuns. After all, why allow something meaningless to continue to complicate the balance picture? People who don't play Paladins obviously erroneously see Paladin spells other than stuns as having value. If they are removed except for stuns then we can discuss balance without them cluttering up the picture.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Yes, lets make it easy. Lets take away our spells and your disciplines what then. Will we have balance ? No you have higher dps and more hps and so you are better then. So if we both give up our tools. We give up our spells and you give up your disciplines and you end then as a better class then us and that is no question you will be better then. Isnt it fair then that our tools re more usefull then yours. Because if we take away both we end weaker. So to balance this our tools need to be better then yours. How much better is the question but that they have to be better is no question or ? How much your tools are worth and how much our tools are worth is only a question from which view you look at it. That you have to learn.<br />
<br />
***<br />
If Arbosch thinks so little of his utility abilities, he must totally suck as a paladin. The paladins I see who can actually play the class are using all that worthless &quot;utility&quot; crap CONSTANTLY. Seriously Arbosch, if you think all that stuff is worthless, you must really suck as a paladin.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Oh well, berhaps i dont us them because this game is to easy or only because i play with people which know what they do and so they dont have a need for me spells. So because your friends which play with you need to us this spells allways and i dont need it. I think that make me friends to good players and you to a bad player because the knight which play with you need to us them :). Sorry but i really think your groupe usually need ressurection or ? But i agree as more the groupe suck we are in as more we can help the groupe. As more the groups suck as more powerfull we are. But i dont think the target should be to build up balance arround groups which suck or ?<br />
<br />

The reason Paladins make druids &quot;better&quot; in experience groups is god damned simple. You can buff an entire party with &quot;the missing&quot; buffs when a druid is a primary healer. What this means is that the druid, a naturally weaker healer than a cleric has a little more &quot;wiggle room&quot; with the entire party than they do with ANY other class while they are playing primary healer.<br />
***<br />
<br />
I allways have Virtue on me. As a player in the time you have access to it allways to. I am sure you have enough players which have a cleric 2boxed which they have camped. So this arguement sound great. But in fact when everyone has virute all the time all this usefull buffs are worthless. Thanks next try.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Secondarily, since druid heals tend to be a little more costly per hitpoint, it's especially crucial that they don't waste that mana spreading heals out to everyone in a group, and are FAR better off focusing their heals on a single individual. You enable that on two different fronts, first your dominance in aggro ensures that no one else gets hit. Second, you can provide those heals to ancillary party members even if they ARE hit without being a major burden on the druid's mana.<br />
***<br />
<br />
So we make sure that noone else get hit. So noone get wounded and then you count as add that we can heal this not getting hitted people. Yes your brain really have to work to find this logical :). If you say we can make that the druid can throw in more nukes. Yes but i first have to see a druid going oom in our missions. Allso the biggest problem here is not if he have mana. It is if he have time to do both. Usually they dont lack to have mana. They lack the time to nuke and heal the same time. We dont have breaks in our missions and so they are in stress to keep people healed and cant really focus on nukes to. Not because they run oom. Because they dont have the time to nuke and heal.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Finally, since you have stuns, you have the ability to completely prevent melee damage from occuring for a period of time when using such spells as QWoS and the FoA twins. Because of this, a druid as primary healer spends even less mana healing you because you ARE the better defensive tank against stunnable mobs. This gives a druid the potential opportunity to use his mana for causing damage, increasing the kill rate.<br />
***<br />
<br />
Well for LDoN missions you want the mobs hit you. They get hurt more from the dmg shield then they do damage. Like i said bevor from me experience with druids they dont lack the mana to make both. They lack the time to do both. You can not heal and nuke the same time.<br />
<br />
***<br />
You make a Shaman a better group member when he is primary healer for many of the same reasons as you do a Druid, except... you bring EVEN MORE hitpoints to a group with a shaman as primary healer. As a matter of fact, when a shaman is primary healer in a group... NOT ONLY do you have the ability to buff an entire group with a complete buffset, and NOT ONLY are you a superior defensive tank because the mobs are stunnable.... you ALSO have the benefit of being the superior tank because against a warrior wearing the *exact same gear in every slot* you have MORE hitpoints and armor class than the warrior does because of your ability to buff FAR beyond the defensive spread between warriors and knights<br />
***<br />
<br />
Dont be an idiot. You say we should balance buffed knights with unbuffed warriors. If we balance this. What is when the warrior get the same buffs. You then ether say the buffs are usless and remove them or have to make sure that warroir NEVER get access to this buffs because. Again usless arguement because i allways have virtue.<br />
<br />

***<br />
<br />
Yes this is a combo which work. But look way more powerful then it is really. He can add dps then. But again he still have the time problem. You can not heal and nuke the same time. So they have to make sure that in the time they nuke noone die etc. This in most case only let them melee and most clerics i know will not do that because it is stressfull to retarget etc for the low dps they add. It will make him stronger but the power you get free cant really get invest in something usefull then. Because we only do that he cleric have it little easier and can relaxe more. <br />

<br />
2.) Nah, look at me answers.<br />
<br />
3.) Sure is there another real melee healer class? No if noone else is arround it is not hard to be best in it. Or you say rangers are a melee healer class?<br />
<br />
4.) Yes, but because all have access to buffs it is not a real factor for balance only if you want say a buffed paladin has to be as good as a unbuffed warrior. <br />
<br />
5.) Yes, i like to get owned that way. Give me more :). But please dont get angry. Remember 1.) Control the game and dont get controlled from the game.<br />

<br />
One is saying that PALs are superb in normal LDoN groups, while the other says that PALs (and probably any other non warrior classes) are ground beef during hard LDoN groups.  Well, after a couple non progressive attempts in a hard mission, I can most certainly agree on the latter so I dont bother goin unless a warrior is in group... but since most of the EQpopulation is doing normal, its not too big of a thing I guess, unless youre bored of killing mobs that offer small challenge like in normal LDoN groups or looking for something different</div></div><hr />

Tell me how, please... I'd LOVE to hear it... that there are places where druids cannot nuke because they are *constantly* casting heals and mana isn't a problem, where &quot;they cannot nuke because you cannot nuke and heal at the same time&quot;.    I got a little news for you, if there is a point where they are prevented from nuking because they are spending ALL of their time healing that mana will be a HUGE problem inside of 5 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u208"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p208">&quot;I allways have Virtue on me. As a player in the time you have access to it allways to. I am sure you have enough players which have a cleric 2boxed which they have camped. So this arguement sound great. But in fact when everyone has virute all the time all this usefull buffs are worthless.&quot;<br />
<br />
What the heck are you talking about?<br />
<br />
In a group with a druid main healer, IF you happen to have a CLERIC BOX available for buffs, you don't get VIRTUE, you get KAZAD and Po9. Or did you not want the added benefits of druid hp and mana regen?<br />
<br />
&quot;We dont have breaks in our missions and so they are in stress to keep people healed and cant really focus on nukes to. Not because they run oom. Because they dont have the time to nuke and heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
As stated above, in LDoN missions, druids can usually find time to toss a nuke or DoT into the mix. Especially if their mana isn't being taxed like you say your druids' mana isn't being taxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They get hurt more from the dmg shield then they do damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh lord. /boggle<br />
<br />
Question: Do you SLOW the mobs in your missions? If so, then you're really reducing the effectiveness of the damage shield.<br />
<br />
Seriously ... stop. The damage shield is not NEARLY as important a factor in your group than your group's ACTUAL damage dealers (be it the wizard/ranger/monk/rogue/whatever you got standing behind the mob going buck wild on it).<br />
<br />
So stunning the mob is usually a GOOD idea since it saves your healer (you know that druid) mana. <br />
<br />
If you tear through your adventures against UNSLOWED mobs then by all means don't bother to stun as it's that DS that's making ALL the difference in your success rate, I'm sure. :p<br />
<br />
&quot;You can not heal and nuke the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know clerics who can toss nukes into raids, where they're involved in the CH-chain. They never miss a beat. They never miss a heal.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you need to get better gear if you're getting beat down so fast that you don't allow your healers time to do anything but chain heal you.<br />
<br />
&quot;This in most case only let them melee and most clerics i know will not do that because it is stressfull to retarget etc for the low dps they add.&quot;<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
No, really, what?<br />
<br />
Clerics I know use hotbuttons to target their heals. And an assist hotkey is easy enough to make. Re-targeting is not stressful. It requires the pressing of two buttons.<br />
<br />
&quot; Sure is there another real melee healer class?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure is. There's a druid/warrior hybrid called Ranger. Their heals are nowhere near the percentage of druid heals that paladin heals are for cleric heals.<br />
<br />
There's also a shaman/monk hybrid called beastlord. Their heals again don't approach the effectiveness of their parent. HOWEVER, in the case of Beastlords, it's not such a big deal since their SLOW spell is really really useful, and their buffs are quite good and effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u209"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p209">Frod. Keep in mind, absorch is the same paladin who (claiming he was in an elemental guild) stated on these very boards that paladins have no role on raids, and that their healing ability is nearly useless. Considering the fact that anyone who has ever raided a mob with high melee damage output or an AoE effect knows just how useful paladin heals are, is there really any reason to even discuss the validity or credibility he has in posts?<br />
<br />
I'm really bad at following my own advice. But there is one thing I just can't resist addressing:<br />
<br />
&quot;Paladin 450 Mana / casttime 5sec / healing 1125 hps<br />
Druid 600 Mana / casttime 10sec / Healing up to 4680hps / (75%)<br />
Shaman 400 Mana / casttime 10sec / healing up to 1950hps / (75%)<br />
Cleric 400 Mana / casttime 10sec / healing 7500hps<br />
<br />
So in other words to heal a warrior for 9000 hps <br />
<br />
A paladin will need 3600 mana<br />
A Shaman will need ~2000 mana<br />
A Druid will need 1200 mana<br />
A cleric will need ~800 mana<br />
<br />
You will now see that we are less then 25% effectiv as single target healer then the cleric. Arround 33% as effectiv as a druid. Arround 55.55 as effecitv as a shaman. The shaman has the big advantage that he can regen mana back a lot faster then knights.<br />
<br />
Now if you next time groupe with a cleric ask him when he is at 75% mana. That is the moment the knight will be oom. When you have a druid ask him when he has 66,6% mana. That is the moment the knight is oom. When you group with a shaman ask him when he has 44% mana left without cana it back and that is the moment the knight will be oom.<br />
<br />
You then will have an idea HOW effectiv we are as single target healer. You then will sit arround half the time to get the knight his mana back because the 3 priest class usually have it way easier to max out there flowing thought then knights and so they regen mana back at a faster rate which make them even more effectiv. Yes we can support heal when needed but to have a knight as mainhealer will make your goupe very, very ineffectiv.&quot;<br />
<br />
This inability to look at the big picture of healing is really astounding. Let me rebut really quick:<br />
<br />
1) No one here is discussing the effectiveness of paladins as MA healers in an XP group. They are less effective than cleric/druid/shaman, fine. The fact that you are even addressing this issue shows what kind of state paladins are in right now.<br />
<br />
2) No point bringing clerics into the mix. They are the unquestionable best healers in the game, no need to compare them to pal/dru/sham because they come out ahead in healing department.<br />
<br />
NOw, the meat of the argument<br />
<br />
3) Light of Nife: 400 mana/ 850 heal/ &quot;Cast time: 1 second&quot; The fastest instant shaman or druid heal at the 55+ stage is 3.8 seconds. Unless you actually want to count chloroblast, which heals for 428 with 3 second cast time. Raids: only clerics have comparable instant heals to paladins. XP groups, how many times have you seen a cheal land 1-2 seconds late in an XP group? If you answer never, I call you a liar. If you have, then it's simple. Paladins can cast a quick heal on the tank, maybe even themselves to allow CHeal to land on time. Can shamans or druids do it, no way.<br />
<br />
4) Wave of Marr: 850 mana/ 900 heal (group)/ 3 sec cast. Can you even argue the utility here in comparison to druids/shamans. Neither has any form of group healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">For those that believe Paladins need to be nerfed -<br />
<br />
Much of the new content in the last few months is explicitly designed to give Paladins a leading role. Independent of my view that each class &quot;should&quot; have a chance to be a hero, SoE has created content (especially high level content) where Paladins not only are the preferred MT's it is inconcievable that any other class could do the job without major revisions.<br />
<br />
Since SoE actually designed content around the Paladin, it is not only unfair to suggest they shouldn't have a chance to be the heroes, it is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.<br />
<br />
My issue is and has been that Paladins carry their powerful tools into the experiance group arena and the key Warrior advantages (Defensive and better survivability) don't really apply there. This is particularly evident in LDoN.<br />
<br />
I haven't suggested giving Warriors snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro idly. This would restore some measure of parity in experiance groups. The problem is, that giving them to Warriors  would deprive Paladins of the opprotunity to be heroes in some high level content, not that Warriors would be more competative in experiance groups.<br />
<br />
I still claim that allowing Warriors these capabilities while disabling them under Defensive and Evasive would work. It should be interesting to see how SoE deals with this issue.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">Making Warriors unable to use the ability under Defensive/Evasive would only solve part of the problem.  Even if you prevented it's use during defensive and evasive, Warriors could use it before and then go into defensive, which is where it'd get unbalancing.<br />
<br />
So lets put it on a discipline timer.  If you give warriors an on-demand ability of 300 hate, make it where you cannot use a discipline within 1-2 minutes of using it, or use it while under a discipline.  Have the ability itself on a 2-3 minute reuse.  That would definitely prevent it from being used in raid positions where it'd be potentially unbalancing combined with defensive, yet in groups it'd be a nice kick up, actually giving warriors a TOOL they can use for agro instead of praying for RNG.  Give knights the easy-to-use agro...but give warriors something, even if it's restrictive.<br />
<br />
And for those people who would say they'd do it anyways using it and AEtaunt to get a boost...I would think you'd get a much better (as well as stronger) result doing a ranger weaponshield boost instead of the small initial agro boost I'm thinking off.<br />
<br />
I still think Warcry would have been a great name for a small initial boost of like 300 hate...too bad it's used for group Fear immunity.  Maybe Battlecry...hmmm</div></div><hr />

Is it that you believe Warriors should not be able to do this and still potentially have greater survivability than Knights?<br />

Liftaps, LoH, and heals allow the mana bar to be converted into HP's. Surely you are aware that a Paladin's HP's are at least potentially 3 times those displayed in his UI.<br />

<br />
Any warrior who wants a huge spike of aggro in the beginning of a named mob fight, can have a SK cast a pure hate spell, or, even better, disc up a HT, or have a wizard land a big damn nuke on it and quickly pop AETaunt for a quick guaranteed trip to the top of the aggro list, and boom, he's got a truly sick amount of initial aggro to play with.<br />

I can think of at least 2 classes that dont prefer 9+symbol+ACbuff combo.  Paladins (the person you're asking) being one of them as they lose 200hps+ with that combo.  Virtue doubles the length of the buff of symbols and 9 + symbol + ACbuff is 3 slots wasted for buffs that last 1.5hrs(?), when you can have 1 slot for virtue.  less people to ask for buffs.  longer durations.  more slots free for other buffs.  Not that I use it.  SInce im usually not tanking in xp groups / raids id rather have the combo for mana regen.

I dont expect for you to buy it glatius, rather im enlightening you that our stuns alone cant pull agro off a mob already being tanked, and im sure a lot here already know this.  Do the stuns generate agro, YES, a lot, though not more than a person tanking a mob.  I did it using a windblade (no procs) while other paladin was casting stuns and I kept agro most of the time (~90%+).  Log on your paladin and using JUST stuns alone, see if you can get the mob off your tank.<br />
<br />
Have a paladin cast stuns for a while and watch mob stay on person tanking mob.  Ive already done this test with other warriors, and even other paladins and was surprised myself of how taunt was doin.   Ive said something like this on these boards several times, nothing new about this.  Now, if you mem the useless stuns that dont even stun I wouldnt know about since I dont put up useless spells, would you? At 65, fighting PoP xp group mobs, you have FoA, QWoT, and Divine Stun.  QWoT has a long recast, and so does DS, even if the recast times were shortened, i dont think the stuns alone can pull a mob off a tank... and imagine all the knockbacks :(.   I had a warrior tanking in LDoN hard mission just yesterday and was casting stuns till a slow landed or until a heal would land and he never lost agro, not once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Complete and utter rubish.  I've seen Clerics get waxed on more than one occassion just for casting a stun or two.  I've played with my Warrior/Cleric double box set up and tried stunning on occassion.  Unless the mob is about 3/4 dead, doing more than a stun or at max two will get you aggro.  Romidar also talks about how when someone else is tanking he can't cast his stuns.  And you want us to believe that stuns won't pull aggro off a mob already being tanked?<br />
<br />
If what you say is true, then the ideal group combination would be one Warrior tanking a mob and three Paladins chain stunning while a Rogue BSs the crap out of it.  You'd hardly need a Cleric.  But no one does those kind of groups, gee I wonder why.  Could it be because they don't work that way and the aggro would be all over the Paladins?  Yes, I think it would be.<br />
<br />
Right, next you'll be telling us about the tooth fairy and Santa Clause.<br />
<br />
Frankly at this point Lamini,  I'm at a loss to understand what you're trying to prove, because what you're saying is so clearly false no one with an ounce of sense would expect anyone who has played the game more than a week or two to believe it.  But there you are, spouting it off as though it's the gospel.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to argue that a Warrior's taunt works a fair amount of the time, that's a different story.  It does work a fair amount of the time.  But it's unreliable as hell.  But that's a completely different arguement altogether.  Don't try feeding me this BS about stuns causing no aggro or not being able to pull aggro off someone already tanking.  I'm not buying.  And I seriously doubt anyone else is either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit.  I don't care what weapons that warrior was using, unless he solo'd it down to 95% or so before anyone else in the group did ANYTHING, he DID lose aggro at least some of the time at the beginning of fights.  It's not possible for a warrior to establish solid aggro early in a fight.  We have no method of doing so.  If you mean he never lost aggro after he got an aggro proc or 2 I could buy that but if you want me to believe that every single fight he got a proc or 2 within the first 2 or 3 seconds of the fight you're flat out lying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">I certainly think that Lamini is overstating the case, but there is a kernel of truth in there.<br />
<br />
If a Warrior has been tanking the mob a while, I can toss the occasional stun without pulling the mob to me.  If the Warrior has good aggro weapon(s) (Great Staff of the Four Winds is becoming popular in my guild) I can cast Force of Akilae almost as often as it refreshes without taking aggro most of the time.  <br />
<br />
I group with Warriors from my guild a lot.  Common practice is for me to cast Cease as mob is incoming, and then Force of Akilae as mob gets to camp.  The Warrior waits for that second stun to land before taunting.  Between taunt and procs the Warriors can usually get aggro before I take a hit about 80% of the time.  After that, if I wait for the mob to get to 50% health or so before stunning again, I can cast enough to interrupt spell casting without getting aggro too often.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that 80% of the time the Warriors get aggro over my stunning is probably about the same rate they would have gotten aggro over slow or tash, or whatever.  Which means that someone other than the Warrior is going to take damage on incoming on a regular basis.  So even though Warriors can get aggro more often than not, help is still in order for the situation.<br />

I agree that with a cooperative Knight a Warrior's aggro problems decrease. But I'm not always - strike that - I'm seldom grouped with a knight in an experiance group.

<br />
The second tank (in this case a Paladin) sees the first tank working with him, and resultantly keeping aggro most of the time, and keeping the squishies almost entirely safe.  It's easy to feel useless when you are the second tank, you can feel like you aren't contributing anything.  But you are, and the first tank's job is easier because you are there.  However, you can see how you might leave that experience thinking that Warriors aren't doing so badly.<br />

P.S.  I just posted on another thread about being one of those 'backwater Paladins that uses Cease', lol.  Honestly, lots of them don't.  I don't keep DA memmed; I think it is cowardly.

<br />
Lamini, you're reading something into Boleslav's post that he did not say.  He said, very clearly, that when working together with a Warrior there is a reasonable chance that once he stuns the mob the Warrior can either taunt the mob off him or get lucky enough on procs to pull the mob off him before he takes a large amount of damage, if any.  But there is a certain amount of time where this does not work.<br />
<br />
This is not his saying that stuns don't give him aggro lock.  This is his saying that fairly often taunt works and/or the Warrior can get lucky with procs.  If the Warrior wasn't in the scenario Boleslav would have plenty enough aggro using his technique to hold aggro against most other actions of his group.  He has aggro lock early and with assurance.  There is little or no randomness or unreliableness to it.  With a Warrior there is, a significant amount of it.<br />
<br />
So he really isn't supporting your position, that there is no Paladin aggro lock.  All he's doing is explaining that sometimes a Warrior can &quot;piggyback&quot; aggro off him pretty successfully.  Everyone knows this already.  It's not news.  It's not a surprise.  And it means nothing if the Warrior isn't grouped with a Paladin or a Shadow Knight to make it happen.</div></div><hr />

I call them as I see them.  And when i threw a couple of stuns on it while the warrior tanked it on INCOMING and always kept agro, to me it showed that his agro was greater than stuns.  I learned that technique from another caster actually, a mage i think, and i applied it when a warrior is in my group :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aggro control, Aggro control, Aggro control...<br />
<br />
All the rest, HP/AC, Mitigation, Utility, Disciplines, Itemization, skills/stats, no new melee content in 3 years, more spells than ever before, insane new focus effects, FT, mana regen... <br />
<br />
All of these affect class balance, and need to be looked at comprehensively, but ONE ISSUE just sits and festers on warriors. It is the one thing that 95% of warriors can do everything right, play their role/character at superb levels of competency, and still Fail 50% of the time, through NO FAULT of their own. No other class would accept the faiures warriors are dealt with every day. <br />
<br />
The situation is completely UNACCEPTABLE. Ask a caster if they want to fizzle 50% of the time, or be interupted 50% of the time, or a mob resist 50% of the time. Or a tradeskiller fail TRIVIAL combines 50% of the time. The issue is here, it has been here for years, we all have known about it, yet it wasnt as clearly defined. In the old days it was a common belief that players controlled their own aggro, they didnt out-aggro the Tank, they played their classes with restraint and that was the way it was. Now there is no restraint, players go all out, and aggro control is no longer a player skill, it is a TANK REQUIREMENT.<br />
<br />
Knight have far superior control. Because of the sheer number of ways that they can use to draw aggro, they will ALWAYS have superior aggro. Heal, Stuns, procs, taunts, taps, snares,etc. paladins and Shadowknights have many many more ways to get aggro, and at an EXTENDED range. Warriors get taunt, procs and AOE TAUNT, thats it, thats all we get.<br />
<br />
Stuns are a focus right now of warriors, for a few reasons. the lower level ones especially. Why? because mobs being immune to them, yet HUGE aggro being created by them. This coupled with the RANGED effect and also the virtually limitless casting of them with STANDARD exp buffs/gear, mean that a paladin can effectively generate ON DEMAND and RELIABLE aggro at any time in any enviorment.<br />
<br />
The problem where this is HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS is the POP Enviorment, with its High DPS, Low HP mobs. Slow as soon as possible, on incomming is desired and even demanded by many. This is an enviorment in which NO WARRIOR can compete with a knight. Why? We have ZERO RANGED aggro tools. Well we can try to hit with an arrow, and hope we get a proc, but thats about as likely as the Cubs winning the world series.<br />
<br />
After the mob is in camp, a warrior uses his dps, procs (best weapons parse at 2-3 PPM, and they can get very streaky), and Taunt skill to try to hold aggro. The DPS from the front is greatly reduced, most good 'taunt weapons' are not good dps, so this effect is minimized. The procs are very Unreliable, streaky, and cannot be guaranteed at engage. This has been helped some by augment procs, still you are enslaved to the RNG for the procs though. And lastly Taunt can only piggyback aggro from someone else, Usually the slower/healer hopefully they are still alive when it works. Taunt also has a very LONG refresh rate, 6 sec, and a very high FAIL rate ~40% to 60%~ depensing who you believe on parses and if the mob is green-blue-yellow-red. AoE taunt is no better than normal taunt, except it can affect more than one, and it is SUPPOSED to be a guaranteed effect. I say supposed to be, because I have seen instances of it failing, usually z-axis related. AOE Taunt also has a slight disadvantage of being a CLASS ONLY AA ability, so only warriors above level 59 with a minimum of 23 AA's can have this ability.<br />
<br />
Contrast that with a knight. they get the exact same tools as a warrior, minus AOE TAUNT, PLUS they get spells. Spells which can be cast ON DEMAND and at RANGE. DPS is almost a non issue, ~20% less than a warrior, but only classes I see pull aggro from pure DPS are monks, rangers, rogues, wizards, and  the war/knights DPS  much much less than any of those. Procs, Knights use the same RNG as us, except that they have INNATE self buffed procs, so they have an ADDED chance of procing. Knights have same Taunt skill as warriros but their Cap is 210 vs 230 &lt; 10% difference. And effectively, I dont think anyone has parsed a knight Taunt, since I dont know any that have the skill maxxed, perhaps we should have a knight do a parse like frodlin to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, fair enough.  How hate works 101, as best we understand it.  When a spell is cast against a mob, we'll use a stun as an example, a set amount of &quot;hate&quot; is generated.  For our purposes we'll say 300 &quot;hate&quot;.  This is soley for the purposes of example, we're really not sure how much &quot;hate&quot; a stun generates.  Now, Shaman slow, for the sake of discussion we'll say generates 250 &quot;hate&quot;.<br />
<br />
If a Paladin stuns a mob on incoming, he's generated 300 hate from the get go.  If a Shaman slows right afterward, because his spell only generates 250 hate, the mob disregards the Shaman for the time being and beats on the Paladin.  As the Paladin melees his damage adds additional hate as does any additional stuns he casts.  And since the Paladin's spells have a set amount of hate associated with them, he can fairly well predict how many he needs to stay at the top of the &quot;hate&quot; list.  Typically this is 3 or so stuns, give or take, depending on how aggressive the casters you're grouped with are or how well equipped the melee are.<br />
<br />
Now, lets consider a Warrior in a similar situation.  The mob is brought back to camp, the Warrior has nothing he can do that will establish a significant amount of hate from the get go.  So he starts at 0 hate, or very close to it.  He taunts the mob, now if the taunt is successful (which it is about 60% of the time from our best tests) the mob will turn and beat on him.  If it fails, it will continue to beat on the puller.  If at this point the Shaman casts slow on the mob, he generates that 250 hate we discussed earlier.  If the Warrior's taunt succeeded, he is just a little bit higher on the hate list than the puller.  If it failed, he's below the puller on the hate list.  Either way, the likelihood is good that the Shaman is going to get aggro from his spell.  The only times this would not be true would be if a) The Warrior has been beating on the mob for a pretty significant amount of time, or b) if the Warrior had a procing weapon that happened to proc prior to the Shaman casting slow.  If neither of these are true, and very often they aren't, then the Shaman gets aggro and the Warrior attempts to taunt the mob off the Shaman.  Again we're back to that 60% success figure.  And keep in mind that for some reason when taunt fails, it seems to fail in strings, so you'll get 3, 4, or even more taunts failed in a row.  And when this happens you're waiting another 6 seconds between taunt attempts to try again.  I think you can see how this would mean the Shaman is spending a fair amount of time tanking if that happens.  And while it doesn't happen all the time, it's not really that uncommon.  You might have it occur 2 or 3 times in an evening, more or less.<br />

Once the Warrior has successfully taunted off the Shaman, he is now pretty high on the hate list, since a successful taunt moves you to the top of the hate list plus just a little, we usually consider it +1.   So for our example the Warrior would be at 250+1 hate, plus whatever additional hate his melee was producing and adding in procs, if any.  So at this point he has a fairly good lead on the hate list, unless his group really decides to let loose.  The thing is, if his group does decide to let loose, there isn't much the Warrior can do about it.  He can't generate more hate at will other than the amount randomly generated by his melee damage and his procs.  So one fight the Warrior could have very rock solid aggro, because he got a good run of procs.  While on the next fight his aggro could be much weaker because he got no procs at all.<br />
<br />
This can be frustrating to the casters, because one fight they can let loose with almost as much as they want.  The next, they have to hold back considerably or they get a beat down.  It makes them kind of pissy.<br />
<br />
Yet with a Paladin, this isn't the case.  If his group decides to unload more, he just casts another stun or two and viola, he's climbed up the hate list faster and keeps aggro.<br />
<br />
So when you are grouped with a Warrior and cast a stun early in the battle, the Warrior taunts off you.  This gives him effectively your 300 hate +1, which is a nice lead on the hate list.  And unless you're chain casting stuns or taunting yourself, he's liable to stay ahead of you and everyone else in the group from that point on, barring the group really dumping damage on the mob.  This works well enough, if the group is willing to take both a Warrior and a Paladin.  Many times they're not willing.  They'll take the Paladin because his survivability is not a &quot;lot&quot; worse than the Warrior's and the predictability of his aggro generation is &quot;much&quot; higher.  And they'll fill the second tank spot with a high DPS producer, to increase the damage dealt and therefore, theoretically, the amount of experience gained in a set amount of time.<br />

And there is the core of the issue.</div></div><hr />

Given his admission that he doesn't understand aggro all that well, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was sincere.  But thanks none the less Uhrlik. :)</div></div><hr />
