<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">our guild has tried everything, but nothing works since they changed the way collisions work.   we tried to corner tank vindi/statue/idol/AoW .... as well as some other random stuff recently without avail.<br />
<br />
the mob always ends up facing outwards.<br />
<br />
tried:  gnome illusion ... WE illusion + max shrink ... halfling + shrink ... nothing works!<br />
<br />
anyone else having these problems?<br />
<br />
ps- we did down AoW without cornering the conventional way .. it just took longer cause our rogues couldnt stick him in the rear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the collision detection thing, it screwed cornering up in a lot of places.<br />
<br />
Just wall him (rogues in back, you in front, and everyone else on the side pushing torwards the wall).<br />
<br />
Yay 900 posts! Only 5k more to catch up to shik.</div></div><hr />

Then mobs go into the wall. That still hasn't been fixed yet.</div></div><hr />

Worse case scenario you can walk the mob along the wall back and forth.  This still allows rogues to backstab.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormbear</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best bet is to walk mobs in the open. Walls are still warping mobs and people are still falling through the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye greig fell through the world like 3 times on us.<br />
<br />
circling works ok till enrage and people are slow movers or afk or not paying attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we had grieg fall thru the walls both on the stairs(where my druid also Walked thru a wall) and once in the portal room<br />
<br />
also had tour tank during the Veksar dragon fall thru the floor</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was helping someone camp their comm1 and I was just running around the first floor agroing mobs. Well one mob made me riposited and it summoned me through the wall only to 20k into the basement  :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
<br />
It was pretty lame, yet extremly exciting at the same time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulic</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the patch, I have tanked Statue/Idol/AoW walled at the icewall. Seems to still work ok there...mob doesn't go into the wall or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-11-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did AoW on the ice wall as well and it worked. However Agnarr went into the wall on us, warped down into the lava on the fire level and summoned me and 2nd Tank to get pummeled OOR of heals... and corpse summons...</div></div><hr />

Had the same thing happen; after we recovered I decided to tank him by the stairs, box style.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xexe xexe</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were having a lot of problems with mobs warping in ssra, so we didn't even bother trying to corner emp on our last attempt.  We just walked him back and forth to prevent warping.<br />
<br />
Also, has SOE said the collision system is working as intended?  Just curious if they were planning to fix the cornering issues or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No he is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would VERY much like to hear from the Dev's concerning this as it has really made alot of encounters harder than they used to be.  MANY encoutners were really sorta designed around corner tanking with Directional AE's and Enrage, and normal reposte and such.  To take it away now is making some encounters harder then they need to be, and were supposed to be.<br />
<br />
With most encounters, it is fairly simple to overcome, but with some it is down right aggrevating.<br />
<br />
Is there a fix in the work Dev's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ratsan</div><div class="date">04-12-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some TSR on the main sight said there was fix scedueled to go in whenever they next patch.</div></div><hr />

April 13th, but still tentative by the look of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This better be fixed.  My guild just completed the Agnarr script for the 1st time this weekend, and except for collosion issues, it went fine.  At one point while I was tanking Agnarr, he went into the wall.  I tried to move him out, but he ended up summoning me, and we fell down a bit to a area below the Agnarr section of the script.  I was in range of heals, and buffs, so I kept tanking for a bit while we decided what to do.  There was no way back up to the rest of the raid, and it was just me and Agnarr.  I decided to run to see where I would end up since I was screwed with the flag/loot anyways.  I die, he goes back up to the rest of the raid where the next tank gets Agnarrs attention and my guild finishes him off.  I basically tanked the bosses of each or the sections for the whole raid, and I get screwed from the actual flag and loot, due to the inability for Sony to properly test thier shit out, and let the walls inside a zone mean permanent seperation from the rest of the raid.  My druid before we engaged Agnarr also fell through the FLOOR, and 20ked, also seperated from the rest of the raid.  Im happy the rest of my Crewmates where able to finish it, but the whole collision engine gave me a bitter feeling towards Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leiany</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried cornering Emp days after the graphics changes.  Our MA warped thru the wall and ended up back at the zoneline.  It ended up being quite a fight with many battle rez's and Emp shouting, &quot;Ding!&quot; at 23% when he finally wiped us.<br />
<br />
We did have our revenge a few nights ago though...  just kept him surrounded.   :)</div></div><hr />
