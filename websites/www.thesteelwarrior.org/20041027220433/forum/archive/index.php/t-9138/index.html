<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i brought a clr druid,SK,monk,chanter and me here today. Entrance break in was slow and rather hard. Had to invis group pull wait and tag when safe. broke in went in a ways. Found some ok spots to pull to but roamers will eat you in time. Cleared a room including some rat that was not KoS i think. Waiting for repops so we could see about camping a named. Then we got over run with roamers.<br />
 Does anybody have any info on this place? I cant seem to find anything yet. Anybody els done this place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had roughly the same experience in the Dranik Catacombs. The breakin totally sucked, everything had huge aggro range and there were several mobs too close by to single. We had no cc, and then somebody's invis dropped before we were all there and we wiped. Thats where we left it and went on to greener pastures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got the impression from the little time I was in these 2 zones that they are intended for 70's with all their spells/discs.  Need ungodly high DPS, higher paci, and fewer resists than what we had to do much.  Godlike exp tho, was nice seeing big, visible movement in exp bar every kill...but so much downitme medding, rezzing and recovering that it was not worth it.  Individually, the mobs are cake, but so many, so closely packed, with such a fast respawn, was just too much for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the aggro radius is a mistake in the Catacombs because I don't notice any special XP bonus there, and the mobs are actually lower level than Sewers.<br />
<br />
In Catacombs it's almost not worth it to evac because you'll just die at the entrance instead of wherever you were before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cortez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">did dranikC, undead squid, all day.  <br />
<br />
get IVU and move towards the area with dragorn / hideous rat / tattered bat / small water (pools?).  that room spawns 2 named.  fight in the hallway straight ahead, just past the pools.  dont bother fighting the dragorns.<br />
<br />
once finished, clear room on the opposite end of hallway and move to the next tunnel on the left.  clear the room ahead.  by then the first room should have respawned.<br />
<br />
i think there are 3 or 4 named that can spawn.  no names spawn in the 2nd room if i remember correctly.  mobs are social and have a large aggro radius, always fight in the middle of hallways.  <br />
<br />
snare is a must.  mobs hit for 150-400 most of the time.  named hit up to 775.  did area without a slower for 1/3 of the day.  dragorns spawn like crazy after rats are killed.  once 40 or so dragorns have spawned, make a new expidition or risk losing your puller to lag.<br />
<br />
sorry if this doesnt make sense, im falling asleep atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cortez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">doh!  forget my post.  i was thinking instanced off dranik's scar not SoD off RCoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I cannot figure the catacombs out.  My friends and I have spent some serious time in them and have yet to find any named nor find a purpose of the zone.<br />
<br />
Every time we have ever gotten the expedition we have gotten the one that is tough to break (1st room fully occupied and half the time one of them is an undead squid so insta room aggro on zone in.  Rough to break if you arent ready for it), except once when we got a completely different map that was totally easy compared to the previously mentioned map.<br />
<br />
And what's with the Insidious Dragorn?  By the time we get to the room that has this guy, there are about a million of them all stacked on top of each other.  What's the purpose of that?  Surely it's a bug?  If so then the expeditions in dranink's scar suffer from the exact same bug.  The blighted rat / Insidious Dragorn spawn does the exact same thing in that dungeon.  We've managed to peel off a half dozen or so Insidious Dragorn in that instance but cant seem to find a reason for trying to keep up with the spawn.  Drops some no drop do-dad every time that we are clueless what to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">will be going back to sewers tonight. Will post more when i get it. So far I agree no idea what  the sewers is for. So far i can only think its made for XP. Like LDON's only no points just an XP zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I made a very brief foray in the sewers and decided to go back with a stronger group sometime.  The first room was kind of a pain and then we found the cave in trap just beyond it.  Don't bother trying to invis past the first room unless you can get rid of that trap.  It drops on you and cancels your invis.  The mobs like that when they're hungry.  :P<br />
<br />
I don't know where the catacombs expedition starts yet, but it sounds worse than the sewers.<br />
<br />
Ruined City of Dranik itself seems very dead compared to Wall of Slaughter.  Are there some good camps in the ruined city?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya i herd there is some good drops. Becuase we are on a pvp server tho I have not even tried to camp the named in Ruined city of dranik. We have goten rather lucky in that the 2 top guilds dont seem to be enterested in instanced zones so we have been able to sit at the entrance unharmed. <br />
  When we finaly broke from the entrance we went left then up... left and back up where there was a set of stairs going into a room filled with those stone dudes only they are slowable and dont hit in the 1K's.  Then got over taken with adds so didnt get to see if a named could spawn.  So far I think there is A, B, C and posible D sewers..... In the Dranik hollows expiditions is there a point like in GoD? OR is it just instanced XP zones with randoms nameds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Could all of the Instanced Areas be like the 4 sewers in GoD, where there are exp versions, and flagging versions ?   Only to get the versions with some sort of goal you first need to raise the right faction ?<br />
<br />
    Or they were supposed to have versions to get flagged for the higher level zones but they decided to drop the flagging after the summit, and just left the exp zones in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Could all of the Instanced Areas be like the 4 sewers in GoD, where there are exp versions, and flagging versions ? Only to get the versions with some sort of goal you first need to raise the right faction ? <br />
I have done 1 and 2 and never had to raise any faction. All we did was go get the adventure and start it. <br />
 Never herd of the non flaging instanced zones and flaging zones. Now I have gone into GoD sewers and only used it for XP instead of flaging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You dont need faction for GoD sewers, but there is a different NPC to hail to start the actual flag instances then the one that starts the exp versions. Just figure OOW may be the same way but require the correct faction, Dranik loyalists probably, to get the version that has an actual goal but I am just speculating and havent heard anything mentioned anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">oh ok i got ya now. thanks. Ya it probably is something like that. Raiding&gt;XP at the moment for us tho. So not able to get back here yet. Somebody go check it out !! come on some time lvl guild has to be curious !! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tudana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am trying to figure out the instaces and which zone they are out of<br />
dranik scar has 4 known instances hollowa,b,c not sure what the 4th one is called<br />
but mapfiends shows it south of the zi to bloodfields on the dranik scar map<br />
<br />
where are the &quot;catacombs&quot; &amp; &quot;sewers&quot; located? I see a instance listed in Ruined city of Dranik, but only 1 instance not 2<br />
<br />
I will add any info I can from the a,b,c instances from dranik scar soon, we have been leveling more then exploring in my guild but that soon will be changing :)<br />
<br />
great thread so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Catacombs entrance is up at the north center of the map, inside a buildding with Jurrok in it. <br />
<br />
I believe sewers entrance is in the SW corner, somewhere behind the grand historian, but I haven't actually been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tudana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">your talking about in Dranik Scar...not Ruined City or Dranik..correct?<br />
<br />
if so..what is the name, label, nic-name, ref name of the instance in Ruined City of Dranik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm talking about ruined city of dranik. The zones their are called Catacombs of Dranik and Sewers of Dranik. I didn't notice the zone names, probably draniksewer(a,b,c) or something like that. Probably easy enough to find by looking in your eq folder.<br />
<br />
The dranik scar zones are called dranikhollows(a,b,c) etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tudana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ok thanks..that is what i wasnt clear on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">probably draniksewer(a,b,c) <br />
<br />
Yes they are, Sewers of Dranika,b,c same with catacombs.</div></div><hr />
