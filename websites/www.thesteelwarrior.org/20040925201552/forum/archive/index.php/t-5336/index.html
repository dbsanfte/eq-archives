<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rufnuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heard a rumor the other day that Taunt is now Charisma based.  So the better charisma the higher the taunt success rate.  Wondering if anyone else knew or heard anything along these lines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well that would definatly explain my endless amount of failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denkou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">likewise - thats kind of troubling :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm betting this is just a rumor.<br />
<br />
If it isn't, it's at least easy to test .... Hello Katta Banker. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If this is true it should be the reverse. The worse your charisma is the more likely your taunt should succeed. This will never happen though because there are no spells that make you uglier and not too many items with -CHA on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You &quot;heard&quot; this?  Where? <br />
<br />
$50 says there's nothing to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno about that.  Haven't you ever seen a man who was too pretty and you just really wanted to beat the hell out of him for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After years of us speculating how taunt works I just wish they would explain it once and for all. Every class knows what stats affect their success rates, even tradeskillers know, but we don't know for sure what determines a successful taunt or even 100% what a successful taunt does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">exactly... all we really know is just pushed the button and hopefully the mob turns on you instead of the little baby casters behind ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Taunt is now Charisma based.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the Easter bunny was trying to tell me that the tooth-fairy knows a GM IRL who told him that very thing. I don't really believe him though.</div></div><hr />

I dunno about that.  Haven't you ever seen a man who was too pretty and you just really wanted to beat the hell out of him for it?   Plenty of times, thought that was a natural reaction. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is a natural reaction ... it's part of the pecking order, if someone is above you, drag him down. The one at top gets the most ladies, so there's good reason to get up there.</div></div><hr />

Charisma doesn't mean, necessarily, likeable (or even pretty).  Some of the most charismatic people are at the same time the most hideous creatures.</div></div><hr />
