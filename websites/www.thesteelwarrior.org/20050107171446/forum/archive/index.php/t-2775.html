<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok guys, main goal was gwetting 65 now its getting some ok gear. I'm in a guild that raids fairly often. The biggest hit i've be a part of so far is doing all the minis in PoS. Now with this force what could we be capable of doing to get upgrades(melee). also if you wanna look at my magelo and see my shit equip you could tell me what to upgrade and where i could get those upgrades without buying them. IMO i think i need to upgrade my earrings the most, then its shoulders. So any suggestions on what my guild could kill to obtain some upgrades?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off... get your defensive aa's.. ASAP.  (Speaking as a cleric, I'd rather have a lower level with their defensive aa's well underway than a 65 with only run 3.  I can tell the difference in the two.)<br />
<br />
If you have good CoV (ally) faction, do the bracer of benevolence quest twice, and do the draconic pauldrons quest.  Decent rewards and no plat spent.  And if you have the inclination, head in to Temple of Veeshan do do Halls of Testing.   Easily done with 1 or 2 groups.  More quests, little to no plat spent (depending if you hunt or buy your gems).  <br />
<br />
Next stop, veksar.  Camp the soulscream belt, thus freeing up your hands for decent hp gaunts (SS or ornate).  Or if you don't feel like taking an exp group to veksar, keep and eye out and whack kunark dragons for an RBB or CoF, or the CS dragon for CoCW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those quests look pretty cool. I'll have to get to some faction work first though *sigh* Anyone know of any mobs we can kill for some nice loot? We've killed Talendor but no CoF yet &gt;=(<br />
Benn thinking of trying to get more UP armor but the drop rate is insanely low now for wariror gear it seems nowadays(7 hours=1 drop) any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">vakaz(sp) the shade in pon, awsom shoulders ac 31 +65 hp. can also get his heart for your casters books while your at it.<br />
<br />
bracer of fortitude should be one groupable for you.<br />
<br />
to many ears to chose one though. <br />
<br />
ribbon choker or hp neck.<br />
<br />
radiant heraldic armor or ss/thurg<br />
<br />
many paths to take and much camping and cash to spend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess i'll have to look into trying to get some new earrings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, get ND3!  Then CA/LR or whatever other AAs you want, but ND3 should be your first priority.  That will upgrade you a ton!<br />
<br />
Now for gear:<br />
1.  Get better haste item.  Like Mokor said, get yourself a soulscream belt, or head to SG and camp felspine for his haste belt.<br />
2.  Now this depends on your guild, but continue to fill out your velious slots either with HoT or SS/Kael quested gear.<br />
3.  Your earrings make me cry! =P  I'd suggest camping up some fun in CT for a lizard bone, 'squito leg, Iron Cog earring (gnome event) or other hps earring.  Or if you have some cash, the bloodmetal earrings.<br />
4.  Rings, get another valorium.<br />
5.  Shoulders, vikraz the shade is a good one, if you can't, get forged shoulder pads, 15ac, 60hp I think.<br />
6.  Neck, clattering bone all the way.<br />
<br />
Good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When your magelo loaded, my eyes almost fell out.. <br />
<br />
drop that stupid belt and camp a heavy rubi in CT.<br />
<br />
Moktor bracers for teh ass, get Fortitude (I'd suggest Kizraks but I doubt you could tank Thangbrand, let alone his kriger PHs)<br />
<br />
Next should be a Shaderock amulet from VaDyn.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Shoulders, vikraz the shade is a good one <br />
there's no way on hell and earth he tanks Vhaksiz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i told ya i need upgrades, everyone thinks that just because ya got 65 that you got nicegear/hps. I've only been playing since Xmas 2002 so thats 8 or 9 months. also i only joined a raiding guild recently. the other guild i was in was more or less the social type. Anyways i'll try to get some of the stuff you guys are talking about. Sorry if my magelo scared you =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fulrik, try the Loyalist shield of honor quest in Katta/Tenebrous mountains for a nice cloak, it's doable by 1 group.  For haste, keep hitting mobs like Talendor for a RBB or the CS dragon for his cloak, like others have said.  <br />
<br />
For earrings, try the vah shir claw earring from ME *can also camp a nice range slot piece, Sentient Idol, in ME*, or if you can get your guild to hit CT, go there for a variety of earrings and other gear.   Lots of nice melee gear drops in CT, including the heavy rubicite girdle.  <br />
<br />
Also, keep hitting Kael, for CoV faction, as well as champion's gear *the champion's helm is pretty nice, especially*<br />
<br />
Once you have ally CoV faction, and you and your friends are equipped in Kael gear if needed; you can also do the bracers of benovolence quest, as well as hit HoT for the drops there.<br />
<br />
good luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I were in your position, I would get a group and go live in Veksar for a while. You can get enough upgrades to make BoT named a ton easier to tank, which is the goal you shoudl set for yourself. Luckily, you can also get pretty good exp in Veksar, the faster you get ND and some defensive AAs the better. Once you have bled Veksar dry, you should be able to move your residence to BoT and start working on getting some ornate molds.<br />
<br />
Veksar drops:<br />
Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets (A Highborn or A Noble)<br />
Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer (A Plagued Slave)<br />
Kylong Shinguards (Feral Lord Gulok)<br />
Darkguard Chestplate (Trooper Muruk)<br />
Soulscream Belt (A Rotting Shopkeeper)<br />
Mithril Spiked Collar (A Kylong Crusader)<br />
Kylong Darkmail Girdle (An Undead Chef)<br />
Kylong Darkmail Visor (A Kylong Crusader)<br />
Kylong Darkmail Pauldrons (A Decaying Slavemaster)<br />
<br />
All of these are regular named with PHs, you just need to find the camps and set up shop. None are particularly hard and they drop other tradeable items that should make getting a group to go down there with you pretty easy. With a few of these upgrades and ND3 you should be able to get up around 4khp unbuffed, which should make tanking BoT named a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Best part is ... no faction work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well an update is i got a new BP, new boots, same crappy earrings, LDoN amulet that gives around 9stamina, the draconic pauldrons and my unbuffed stamina is 207 now and my unbuffed hp is 3758 =\ getting closer i think.</div></div><hr />
