<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3105">A simple idea how to fix agro</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm not a warrior... a SK... but I was observing warriors for a while and indeed they need some fixing.<br />
<br />
Now, the central problem is the fact that all the agro generation that warrior has is not certain to work when you need it; all it is, is a RNG (random number generator).<br />
<br />
You may have EB and TB procs, and these procs would indeed get you agro - if they proc. And you cannot control it.<br />
<br />
Simple change would be, for all warrior weapons, change the effect from Combat (a proc, which may or may not trigger) to Triggered (right-click when you want it).<br />
<br />
Make it 0 cast time, so that you won't be interrupted even with no channeling skill, and that you can use it when needed. Balancing should be done through recast time so that designers can set it for example to 8 seconds, and if it proves too much they can increase it.. if it proves not enough they can easily decrease it.<br />
<br />
This would work in a group like this: puller pulls, warrior right clicks EB, gets agro instantly. After tash / slow / whatever, if you need more agro then click your other weapon (dual wielding should be useful), thus adding agro to what you have.<br />
<br />
This change should not require much work on developer/designer side, and it's fairly easy to balance by adjusting recast times. It would give instant agro on demand, which would solve 90% percent of warrior problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you saying 8 sec per proc? If so, we can now have I think 4+ procs on 2 weapons. Which means 8 sec per proc. Now we have a warriors that doesnt need to hit auto attack, he can just mash the proc key and hit the mob with a proc every 2 secs. I know, we can make the number bigger then 8, but still, that is a lot of casting in that amount of time. Any hoo, dont have anything else to say :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All and all a decent suggestion, but I do have one question: What happens for those who do not have a high aggro procing weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eight seconds was just the starting number for testing; after some period on test server and some on live servers, I guess the developers/designers would find out which number is balanced.<br />
<br />
As for those without high agro weapons, you can go to LDoN and get augments for your weapons. In a series of single group missions you get points, and eventually you get the augment, and this is available starting from level 20 (less points at that level, of course, but level 20 should not expect the same gear as level 60-65 anyway). You don't even need to be in a raiding guild for that.<br />
<br />
If 4 procs (2 weapons, normal proc and augment proc on each) are too much then do not change existing weapons at all.<br />
<br />
All that is needed is to add type 4 augments that are WARRIOR ONLY and right clickable<br />
<br />
Do you see how simple it is? Existing gear not changed at all; existing procs not changed at all; only one proc per weapon would be right clickable. They can make completely new spells if needed, pure agro, or snare or slow or whatthehellever.<br />
<br />
Actually it doesn't even need to be on weapons. If it's right clickable it can go into any slot. Just don't make versions for all slots, so that people don't get 15 right clickies for agro.<br />
<br />
Or make the right click spell a completely new spell line, that leaves a buff icon on caster (warrior in this case) for a while, to control recast. Then you won't get multiple chain casts.<br />
<br />
The central idea is RIGHT CLICK which is ON DEMAND, as opposed to current PROC which is RANDOM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As for those without high agro weapons, you can go to LDoN and get augments for your weapons. <br />
<br />
 If you don't have high agro weapons to begin with, where do you go to get the 20+ successful groups to get the augments?<br />
<br />
 Remember, folks, not everyone having this problem is 60+ with 30+ AA's and VT+ gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe people should step back and fix issue on naky toons, no equipment, bare knuckles. Now improve the warrior class. Pallys being naky still have theirs as do SKs, Warrior in this instance would be without these &quot;improvements&quot;. This is where the balance needs to be made any thing else is a short coming IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, come on, now you guys are just being petty. Aggro proccing weapons are not hard to find these days to use with this idea, yeesh. If nothing else, you could spend a whole 500pp on a yak, swap it in, click it, swap it out, not to mention cheap aggro weapons like the GSoT, CHoS, and SotB. How determined are you guys to bitch, even over suggested improvements?<br />
<br />
The real problem with this idea is that it would be too overpowering with the number of utility proc weapons that warriors get. Weapons like the ToD, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, and JStick all become exponentially more powerful when you can guarantee an instant proc. If you could force one proc a minute or two, that would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gimmel, if you go buy every warrior you meet a GSoT, CHoS or SotB...  so that when your change is made, they will have a proc to click...  then i will agree with you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, poor widdle warrior that can't afford the 800pp for a GSoT. Should I buy you some armor too, since you are too lazy to aquire the basic tools for playing your class? Maybe we should have a &quot;Twink the Warriors&quot; fundraising event on every server, then you'd never have to buy your own equipment at all! Sounds like that's the only way some of the warriors in this thread will ever get the equipment they need.<br />
<br />
Hint: LDoN is NOT PoP. Aggro control is not the end-all-be-all that is was then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, there is a lvl restriction on it, What about those under this requirement, No fix for them? You dont make a car run better by painting it and putting new tires on it. Sure it looks nice, but it still sucks. The thing is Mr. Gim, good ideas are out there that are not item based and people like those, but Sony wont do anything, so it doesnt matter really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You have become better at avoiding the Real Issue (212)!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to fix warriors by letting them instantly proc a weapon that taunts like the GSoT, then you can provide them with it. Sounds like you do not wish to follow through on that idea, so think of a better one :) But, alas, i feel we are not going to get a mature response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know that Sivok, and I think the idea is not a particularly good one for the reasons I listed above. My gripe is with the fact that much of the warrior class has become so accustomed to bitching, that it is the knee jerk response, even to a suggested improvement. To say at this stage of the game that aggro proccing weapons are difficult to obtain is a joke. And if you are too low level to be able to use a GSoT, CHoS, or SotB, then you are too low to be really dealing with this problem. The tanking inequity vs. knights doesn't become a major issue until the mid to late 50s at the earliest, and is primarily a PoP issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Remember, folks, not everyone having this problem is 60+ with 30+ AA's and VT+ gear. I am =/<br />
<br />
And I think it has been stated before. You should not have to buy an expansion to get your class balanced. So the work that needs to be done to fix warriors needs to go back to the lvl 1-50 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What if the problem doesn't exist in the 1-50 range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have no further comment because we are both right =\<br />
<br />
It is true, I never had an issue with the &quot;Agro&quot; problem untill 51-52 or so.<br />
It was the worst around 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hint: LDoN is NOT PoP. Aggro control is not the end-all-be-all that is was then. <br />
<br />
 A correct point.<br />
<br />
 However, you still didn't answer the question. If Warriors are having trouble getting pickup groups because they are viewed as an inferior choice to Knights now, what about LDoN changes that to the point where people say, 'OMG A Warrior! Get him quick!'?<br />
<br />
 And if your answer (Which logic will dictate) is that nothing in the equation has changed, then in what groups do they get these adventuring points in to get these aggro procs that you seem to think will help them get groups?<br />
<br />
 It's a vicious circle which the unuber have come to know really really well: To get good gear/weapons, you need to get groups in the areas where it drops. Underequipped warriors without good gear/weapons don't get spots in groups. See where it goes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Is Guts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Amazin someone comes up with a decent idea, next thing people are bitchin' about not being able to get a group to get the fix if it was ever used...<br />
<br />
So how the heck did you all get to where you are now .. solo ???<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd love a right clicky taunt / aggro / hate /  give me the chuffin mob when I need it / etc <br />
<br />
Having to play with lady luck is a pain at best .... its a standing joke in my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have seen groups OOCing for Tanks, no preference given, and been in groups and asked for groups with no problem. But my warrior is only 56, so things might change more later on, but I think people can see that getting the debuff in NOW is not as important as in PoP. Time will tell, but warriors are nowhere near as poorly off in LDoN as they were in PoP, though I think more needs to be don to differentiate them from the knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ive been cold called for groups atleast twice since ldon came out. I was putting a group togther myself at the time though so had to turn them down. So far in ldon it seems anytank will do and groups will take any they can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">as far as previous levels, about 98% of the time i am in a almost complete guild group. Problem comes when there are no slowers/healers in the guild that are up for a group or adventure...  then i need to go LFG and have problems in PoP. LDoN hasn't been out long enough for me to see if there are issues with me going LFG for them, but PoP was definitly a problem.<br />
<br />
I really don't have too much problems with aggro, even in PoP. But that is more of an issue with my friends and guildies being able to work together so its really not a problem...  but it does show its ugly head once-in-a-while. Its much more the acceptance of everyone thinking that warriors are useless in PoP...  so none get groups...  and that just adds fuel to the fire.<br />
<br />
I would love to see warriors get new abilities...  hell, you'd think we would have learned more in 65 levels than just to get hit well and /shield people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Good lord, aggro weapons are common as dirt.  If you are too lazy to go get an aggro proc weapon these days you don't deserve a spot in a group.  Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, if someone is complaining that they don't have access to a weapon of some kind that procs something with fairly high value hate, then they really aren't trying too hard.  There indeed a lot of proc weapons on the market these days, some which go for very little plat at all.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not keen myself on the concept of being dependent on gear to do one of our primary roles when no other class in the game that does what we do is as equally dependent.  Nor am I keen on the fact that procs are inherantly unreliable and generally no where near as good of aggro as a couple of casts of hybrid low level spells.  These things do indeed suck.<br />
<br />
However, not having a procing weapon isn't as valid an excuse as it would have been just 3 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, if someone is complaining that they don't have access to a weapon of some kind that procs something with fairly high value hate, then they really aren't trying too hard.

<br />
 Ahh, where do I begin......<br />
<br />
 Yes, I have a mainhand decent aggro weapon. Yes, I'm fairly certain most warriors have a DECENT aggro weapon. I'm also fairly certain that most of them don't have SotB main and CHoS offhand, which seems to be the godly pair of the non-Ele guilded Warrior. I'm also fairly certain that most of them don't have EB weapons, either.<br />
<br />
 Look at the weapons you carry - main, offhand, for backup. Ask yourself what kind of forces you needed to get them.....if they're older weapons, ask what kind of a force it would take to get them with pre-VT gear. If you could at all. (Since I don't play VT+ content, I'll rely on your judgment on feasibility.)<br />
<br />
 It's hard to get groups without proper gear, and it's hard to get proper gear without groups. That's all I was pointing out - the Catch 22 of the unuber warrior.<br />
<br />
 Oh, and Glatius, do you recognize this post? <br />
<br />
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessageRange?topicID=557.topic&amp;start=41&amp;stop=60 <br />
<br />
I'd like to also point out Aragir that the cheapest EB weapon I've seen on the market that is considered the bare minimum necessary, is typically for sale on my server, when it's for sale at all which isn't often, for 500k. A Paladin could outfit himself in pretty close to the best droppable gear in the game with that amount of plat. <br />
<br />
 Care to loan me 500k? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">GSoT - One mid 60s group in BoT, or 800-1.5kpp<br />
CHoS - One mid 50s to mid 60s group, 10-15kpp<br />
SotB - One mid 50s to mid 60s group, 6-12kpp<br />
<br />
Your quote of Glatius makes no sense whatsover, since it was specifically about EB items in particular, not aggro proccing weapons in general. Not to mention that pre-Droga revamp and post-Droga revamp are entirely different eras when in comes to the availability of aggro proccing weapons (GSoT drop rate increase occured just about the same time.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Gimmel -<br />
<br />
 The key for me in the above post were the words 'the bare minimum necessary'. That's why I used it - it juxtaposes nicely with his post above. :) <br />
<br />
 And of course, there's the fact that, in order to get the CHoS and the SotB, you not only have to be able to bring the forces (the easy part), you have to be able to get there avoiding Farmer John. Either that or magically pull at your values 16-27k of plat out of your ass. Now, we've all done that before, and can probably do it again, but I'd personally rather be grouping than farming. So don't give me bandaid procs that take forever to get - give me class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">right click proc has been suggested before.<br />
there are right click weapons, just very very few for warriors.<br />
give all weapons a right click is imo just crazy<br />
<br />
hmm bag full of weapons, hot swap box.. can click 10 weapons for 1000+ damage every round<br />
<br />
whining about pp cost gets no where.<br />
<br />
hell any proc weapons is aggro if u can proc every 8 sec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Partha, you're taking me out of context.  I don't believe that EB weapons should the minimum required level of weapons to perform well as a Warrior.  However I am frequently told that with EB weapons there is little to no problem.  I'm not sure I believe what I'm told, but if it's true then that seems to indicate that EB is currently the minimum required standard to have little or no problem.<br />
<br />
I don't claim that getting a lesser procing weapon will mean you have little or no problem.  I claim that trying to make it seem as though getting ahold of a lesser procing weapon of some kind is a huge hardship is false.   Getting a lesser procing weapon of some kind is no longer a huge hardship, merely a small or moderate difficulty, depending on what you go for.<br />
<br />
But we've already established that procing weapons, possibly with the exception of EB weapons and that depends on who you talk to, are not the entire solution and never have been.  However, lets bitch about things that retain value to be bitched about.  Does the complaint that procing weapons are hard to get ahold of still retain value?  I don't believe so.  Does the complaint that procing weapons don't do the job adequately still retain value?  Yes, I believe it does.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to tell me I'm wrong, then fine.  But don't try and tell me that you can't buy a GSoT for a few hundred or even a coule of thousand plat, because I seem the for sale all the time for less than 1k on my server.  If instead you want to tell me that even with things like GSoT, CHoS, and SotB Warriors still aren't performing as effectively as they should, then on that we would have agreement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 And I agree with you there - but as we both know and agree, if it takes EB to do your job, or SEEMS to take EB to do your job - and EB is not available - what's Joe 6pack Warrior to do? Too many people who post here (And you don't seem to be one of them) want to just write off Joe as long as they're doing not too badly themselves. Remember, the original poster of this thread started with the premise of EB and TB weapons - to compare those with SSoY's or Gnoll Hide Lariats or even CHoS - well.........<br />
<br />
Does the complaint that procing weapons are hard to get ahold of still retain value? I don't believe so. Does the complaint that procing weapons don't do the job adequately still retain value? Yes, I believe it does. <br />
<br />
 But the premise of the original poster is that procing weapons do the job adequately, as long as you're talking TB or EB items. I've seen a total of ONE BoC for sale in the Bazaar since it went live for 350k. I call that hard to get ahold of. ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I can't say that your idea is without merit.<br />
<br />
Let me propose something very simular -<br />
The &quot;Get Aggro&quot; ability +X Hate, 0 casting time, Y Refresh, Z Range. Invoked by typing /getaggro or by making a Hot Key. X, Y, and Z would have to be adjusted to make the ability a solution without being overpowering. I'm thinking they could start by using a typical aggro spell - something like X=300, Y=5 seconds, and Z=50.<br />
<br />
Make it available to WAR, PAL, and SHD.<br />
<br />
Warriors would benefit for obvious reasons. They would be able to augment the aggro produced by even mediocre aggro weapons and get both &quot;aggro on demand&quot; and &quot;ranged aggro&quot;.<br />
<br />
Knights would be able to free up a spell gem while not having to be slaves to aggro weapons since they can still augment this ability with their spells.<br />
<br />
It might be best to scale the amount of Hate produced according to level.<br />
<br />
This would still leave a role for the Taunt ability, aggro weapons, spells, and AE Taunt.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">For all of you who write stuff about aggro weapons ....<br />

I am an old school ( 99 )  Level 65 warrior , have around 195 AAs, wield a BoW, have some Elemental parts, nice HP/AC/ATK and I am one of our MTs. I use the orb out of VT for the extra aggro proc. I am standing nearly under the mobs.<br />
<br />
But a Level 60 Paladin with HoT Equippment can grab aggro way better than I can do while standing anywhere near the mob.<br />

<br />
I completely agree with your point, which is that you should really be much more capable at generating and holding aggro than the Paladin in much lower tier gear.  Now, let me ask another question, along similar lines.<br />
<br />
What does a Warrior in HoT level gear have to offer a group that is not blown away in every conceivable way shape or form by a Paladin in elemental gear?  Is his DPS greater than the Paladin's?  Probably not.  And don't even factor undead into the situation.  Is his HP greater than the Paladin's?  Probably not.  Does he have any of the abilities that Paladins receive through their spell icons?  Absolutely not.  And is defensive even much of a bargaining chip when you're talking an experience group and a Paladin HP advantage of perhaps several thousand HP?  Probably not.<br />
<br />
What is my point?  That with a sufficient gear superiority a Paladin is equal to or superior to a Warrior in every significant way and yet still retains all those &quot;extras&quot; a Warrior can never have.  While when the Warrior has the gear superiority, the Paladin still retains those things inherant to the Paladin class which Warriors never get.<br />
<br />
Now, does this make any sense?  That the Warrior can have all of his supposed advantages neutralized given enough of a gear difference in the Paladin's favor?<br />
<br />
I mean hell, I've been playing my Warrior since 99 as well.  And I've put a lot of work into him.  And yesterday a Rogue told me he had 100 more HP than I did given the same buffs.  So where is my vaunted HP superiority?  It doesn't exist in those cases where I've not been able to keep up in the gear race.  So what do I retain as my &quot;class&quot; advantages?  A few creaky disciplines that aren't particularly useful under most circumstances?  Shield and AE taunt?  What else?  Some ambiguous statement that I &quot;use&quot; my armor better?  Where is the balance, really?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">bah...  lets just forget about all this proc'ing crap.<br />
<br />
Change warrior taunt button, and ONLY warrior taunt button, so that when you hit it, it generates a EB type effect. Now, this may seem a little too powerful, so, lets increase the re-use timer on the button to something a little more than 6 seconds... say, maybe 10-15sec. And, lets make this effect have some kind of check (magic, level, skill, whatever)... so now this effect can be partially resisted...  still granting taunt, but not the massive amount that a EB proc would do.<br />
<br />
Pair this new taunt with the standard taunting weapons you have now.<br />

Worse case:<br />
You start to fight a mob...  no procs, tash lands...  no procs, slow inc...  no procs. You loose aggro with the slow, hit taunt, EB hits, you have aggro again...  hell, you could even hit it before slow if you wanted.<br />
<br />
Standard case:<br />
Fighting mob, some caster does something stupid and gets lots of aggro, or slow is resisted a few times...  hit taunt, EB hits, you have aggro.<br />
<br />
You'd think that this is how normal taunt is supposed to work, right?<br />
<br />
not an origional idea, but easier than all this &quot;get instant weapon proc&quot; stuff<br />
<br />
And yes...  aggro weapons are very easy to get, and i generally don't have a problem with aggro using my non-procing 2hs (war marshall's staff). I was just making the point earlier, if you are going to give warriors a skill where they can make a weapon proc, then you might as well make their nubie weapon a procing one. Its like giving someone a good skill that can enable them to do their defined class role, but saying &quot;oh, sorry...  you need to get a special piece of equipment before you can use that skill&quot;. So, i'm not saying we should ignore procing weapons, just the use of a skill that requires it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Cipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">This idea has been said taming your weapon or something.  I personally think it is a very good one because it would give us something like an sk or paladin.  Put the refresh time of proc weapon as much as their spells.  <br />
<br />
So if you are 65 with some sort of procing weapon your refresh time is going to be the same as a knight agro spell refresh time.  I am not sure on a pally's spell refresh time, but if it is quick then it could just be 5 - 10 seconds longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Olafsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You guys want everything.  How about all new warriors just pop out at level 1 with a BOC and a Bloodfrenzy.  I dont see the problem put some work in get yourself a aggro weapon and stop crying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Cipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Olafsky the problem is not when you are lvl 1 - 50 its 51 - 55 where the problem is.  If you read more posts you would see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Your proposal has some degree of merit Olafsky, especially when you consider that a paladin chancasting level 9 and 15 stun spells can generate about as much hate as an EB weapon, and was able to buy the means to do it from a vendor for a few plat.  Yes, lets propose this idea to the devs, all warriors begin play with a BoC and a Bloodfrenzy, and those of us who have been playing since 99 receive one the next time we log in.  There. Problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Olafsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I been playing since the day server went live so dont lecture me about people playing since 1999 want the same weapons.  All im saying is when myself and alot of other warriors out there did our levels in the 50's we were using bloodpoints and lammys and had no issues.<br />
<br />
You guys have it real good today with the number of &quot;stun&quot; weapons out there that are obtainable.  So stop crying put the time in and get the weapons.<br />
<br />
Oh and on another note  with the ridiculous proc augs you can get now by doing some LDON adventures life is only gonna get easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hey Olafsky, you've obviously formed an opinion based on tried and true principle of, &quot;I walked eight miles to school each day in ten feet of snow, uphill both ways when I was growing up.  Now STFU and suck it up you little cry baby punks.&quot;<br />
<br />
And my response to such an opinion based on such a principle is the tried and true counter arguement, &quot;Blow it out your ass you macho hyper aggressive blow hard.  No body gives a damn how hard you had it.  The problem exists and we want it fixed.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Back when lammies and bloodpoints were all the rage mobs hit for jack shit, itemisation wasn't totally out of wack, warrior dps probably kept up with nukers a little better, slows came when they came and nobody had a choice about wether to deal with taunt because keeping an aggro locking knight up made you med for 10 mins between fights...<br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
The environment changes olafsky, in some ways it's gotten easier certainly, but you didn't have many of the problems warriors do these days because the environment then heavily favoured you, so perhaps you should be the one to STFU?...<br />

The RNG isn't something you bse balance on. Weapons dont' balance classes. Got it?<br />
<br />
But if you are going to balance classes on weapons, then I assume you know that paladins and shadowknights are on just about ever single high end weapon.<br />
<br />
BoC = War/SK/Pal/Brd/Rng<br />
BoW = War/SK/Pal/Rng<br />
Droga weps = all/all<br />
<br />
Yet, you say that weapons balance us, when the classes we're trying to compete with have the same  weapons.<br />
<br />
Same thing with the augs... we're busy trying to get mroe procs to catch up with knights for aggro, while they get sta/hp mods to further close the gap on the HP/AC issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">It's nice to hear from Olafsky that when I get a Darkblade of the Warlord and Edge of Eternity and can bag a Blade of War any aggro problems I might have will be fixed.<br />
<br />
In the current pre-PoTime environment players aren't as disciplined as they were in NToV and the standards for maintaining aggro are higher. In NToV if someone pulled aggo off you it was their fault for overnuking or not maintaining max melee distance. There wasn't a whole lot of choice back then - Warriors Main Tanked.<br />
<br />
Now groups have a choice and Warriors frequently find a Paladin is MTing and they are the offtank. Frankly if the group could've found a real damage dealer the Warrior would be /lfg.<br />
