<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zxcvasdf</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dualwield BF and HG. The BF is augmented with 125dd ykesha and the HG augmented with the 100dd ykesha, as ykesha augments are lore.<br />
<br />
I now have about 2200pts unspent and I'm considering changing both to anger 3.<br />
<br />
Would the increased aggro make that worth it? Opinions please and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">about 300 more aggro each proc, maybe as low as 200.<br />
<br />
Worth it if you ask me, especially if you got nothign else to spend points on,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is worth it.  You will get a good agro boost and won't have all that knockback from the stuns either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never have had a problem with knockback from the stuns.. wierd that some have.  Maybe its because the stun component is resisted by everything over level 55.  <br />
<br />
Personally...no, I wouldnt swap out the augs.  I'd buy 40hp augs for my gear or something else, or save for the day you get a BoW or SEWS.<br />
<br />
You can't really be having agro problems with yak auged bloodfrenzy and hategiver are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zxcvasdf</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes mobs 55 and above are immune to the stun portion but they still receive the knockback from ykesha procs.<br />
<br />
I asked a few top warriors in my server and they told me that ykesha procs are alot less aggro, resisted ones even worse.. That is why I'm considering the change.<br />
<br />
I have WA5 and orb of the sky proc, but yes sometimes I still lose aggro to necro stacking multiple dots and bsts that slow/dot/nuke without stopping. Taunt + Incite isnt enough to hold me through those, unless i get a few lucky procs in quickly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a bloodfrenzy and a BoC, both with anger III, and had a ranger and druid actively trying to pull aggro off of me by chaining snare and nuking/flame lick etc and couldn't.  Necro showed up and she could pull aggro off of me at will.  I don't think you will notice a major aggro upgrade and a necro will still be able to take aggro from you with no problem.  Tell em to FD if they want to cast that many dots :). <br />
<br />
Necros are in a class of their own when it comes to aggro generation.</div></div><hr />

While I think the AngerIII procs have a slight edge, they're both so close in agro generation that I wouldn't even bother.  <br />
<br />
On a second thought, I look at your magelo and realize you're pretty fucking magnificently equipped.  Most elemental warriors aren't even that good and you already have 40hp/10ac augs wherever you can put them.  I guess if there's nothing else to spend your points on, then go for it.  <br />
<br />
Even with a BF/HG combo with dual Yaks though, I'd imagine your agro generation is probably pretty insane.</div></div><hr />

Aggro is better for sure, only problem now is that I cant tell whether EB or anger 3 is procing as they have the same spell message. :mad: <br />

I miss crit blasts..</div></div><hr />
