I'm wondering where I should invest my plat, a really good aggro weapon or get some really good gear?  Right now I'm only level 35 so aggro is not really an issue yet.  But I know that as I level up higher, the people I group with will have more damaging spells, weapons etc. so proc's are going to be a priority if I want to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
Tried to setup a magelo and can't get in from work for some reason, bah!</div></div><hr />

Since you're only 35 don't worry about agro weapons. But when you do just get the droga combo, it's cheap and works.</div></div><hr />

For the next 15 levels pay close attention to all the other things that help you hold aggro.<br />
Sadly, you will need all your plat for armor. You will also need all your plat for haste. You'll need more than your LDoN points for augments, and almost all of your plat for weapons. So, at any given moment, you don't have enough LDoN points and you need at least three times the plat you have.  :p</div></div><hr />
