<br />
So I thought I would ask...<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on my equipment? I can't help but feel that my AC is a bit lacking. Everyone I talk in my guild has a higher AC (heck a 48 Rogue has a better AC then me right now, that doesn't seem right)<br />
<br />
Click the sig for the magelo</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure yet really about the guild, changed recently. We WANT to do some stuff but we have trouble putting together City of Mist raids it seems. I guess you would call us Epic Capable...<br />
<br />
Moneywise, I have none. But with the right ideas, I can know what to work for and get the money to do so. Any stuff that is dropped at my level would be great too.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

at 40 i'm projected about 800something ( 810?820?) AC; full defensive skill; and about 1800-odd hp's with the normal crafted/vel fire opal/orc fangs/lammy/centi setup..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you can't see Magelo from work Shik, but are there any other pieces that others can recommend after seeing my magelo? I know Champ's is a good choice, but what else can I do while my guild is unable to Raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">farm like crazy and buy MQ of thurg and SS armour. I know on my server the bottom has dropped out of the market for these for some reason. Most thurg plate (apart from the BP /legs) goes for about 1k or so. <br />
<br />
I cant check magelo at work, so i ll have to take a look at it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd look into the Enchanted Dwarven armor for a cheap upgrade if I were you.  Agnostic halflings ought to be able to wear this stuff, and its not bad at all for the price you will pay.  On Povar the bracers will run from about 400p up to about 1500p for the breastplate.  Indeed, in terms of AC and HP the breastplate is basically the equivalent of barbed ringmail, for half the price.  I'll post my Magelo below, I still have many pieces of the enchanted dwarven armor on at lvl 54 while I wait for my guild to do Kael some more myself =)<br />

<br />
Any other suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah; that enchanted dwarf stuff is nice; also might be able to scrap together a few pieces of small acrylia at a decent price ( beefy AC, kinda so-so stats ); granted you find someone making it.<br />
i had a cleric back on TT that had half a suit of small acrylia I picked up for him really cheap.<br />
<br />
OK, saw your magelo ( at home now )<br />
