<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aamen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...and I'm not sure how to fix it.  Not 'my' warrior alt, the warrior I'm grouped with.<br />
<br />
It happens a lot, and I need some advice on how to educate them without coming off as condescending.<br />
<br />
They tend to favor a 2h a lot.  I ask them if they're using incite/bellow, to which they reply 'yes', of course, but I never see the 'angry' message.  With one tank, I started seeing it a day later.  Shouldn't they be dual wielding to effectively draw more aggro?<br />
<br />
I seem to be drawing more aggro from mobs then I should with these players, and, trust me, I am not nuking hard.  Some high end buddies I cannot draw aggro from, even on my best day.<br />
<br />
Is it the weapon, the player...hell is it me?  I want to maximize my dps, but obviously not at the expense of summon/pong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aamen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know theres a 2h that drop in PoF, and one that drops in PoE.  Sorry, I don't recall the names but I know it's one of those two.  Probably not augmented, they don't do much LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, a couple notes:<br />
<br />
1) They should hit with an arrow at least once before pulling into camp.<br />
2) They should be the puller (initial agro.)<br />
3) They should incite after shooting an arrow and not before hitting the mob.<br />
4) They should bash/kick whenever possible.<br />
5) They should use a 2h with anger 3 if in vxed/tipt or any hard hitting place for them.<br />
<br />
It is possible you are not seeing the angry message if they cast it away from you on the pull.<br />
<br />
Also, it is possible they are doing all of the above and you still have agro problems.  That is the very reason a lot of people will never group with anyone except a paladin.  Paladins simply own agro for most groups (90 percent of content) unless the warrior has 400+ AA and all the agro toys from PoTime.  I know I have some of the best agro I can get (two 1h with anger 3, weapon affinity 1) and any paladin that knows how to play can simply own me for most content where it matters (first 15 seconds.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hard to say without knowing what their 2H and dual wield weapons.  Dual wield isn't necessarily better, but it is generally more aggro if you have similar quality weapons.  Is his 2-hander a stone-etched war sword?  If so it's not a great aggro weapon if it's not auged.  Ornate greatsword is the only 2-hander from fire I can think of in my current sleepy state, but that's not a good aggro weapon either.  Best thing he could do to improve aggro is get Weapon Affinity (if he doesn't have it) and some anger augs from LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love my sews =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be easier if we saw his magelo hehe.Given any decent weapon with a3 a warrior can hold aggro ok through ep's at least if his group isn't being totally silly.The problem isn't just using a 2 hander.Lot's of people have tanked well for a long time with 2 handers before augs.There are performance advantages with differant setups is all.Not enough to go on atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is it just one tank, or is it several different tanks? If it's the latter it might be you and not them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The magic 9 ball says that it could most definitely be you that sucks.  Maybe look at your own tactics first before looking at the tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So... I'd like to see the tank's magelo before I start slamming the guy who came here and humbly asked for advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wasn't slamming, just suggesting since he asked if it might be him in his original post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">here's what to expect from a warrior with good agro setup:<br />
<br />
1) if he pulls with arrow and incites on the inbound the mob can be consistently slowed approximately one second after contact without drawing agro. if this is not the case then he is probably not inciting on the pull.<br />
<br />
2) even if he does so he will soon lose agro if he gets no procs. this is why most warriors insist on 4 stun/anger procs.<br />
<br />
3) a full minute into a fight agro is difficult to draw off a properly setup warrior. if you can easily draw agro that long into a fight he has a poor agro setup. MOST fights you can start chain nuking long before that. but its dependent on whether he procs and on how much offensive/taunt aa he has.<br />
<br />
4) if anyone besides the puller frequently gets hit before the warrior than that person probably got hit before incite was used. even undead proximity agro will rarely override an incite.<br />
<br />
5) it entirely possible its taking him several seconds after contact to turn attack mode on. such a situation will cause any debuffer to draw agro in spite of an incite. once the caster gets agro if this same warrior is slow to reposition himself on the mob it can ping pong for a long time.<br />
<br />
so my suspicion is that the warriors you speak of either are not inciting they have poor positioning skills or reaction time or they dont have good agro procs. obviously you dont want to go into a fruitless crusade to set straight every agro-poor warrior you ever group with. asking them meekly to incite on the pull will probably get you the most improvement for the amount of faction hit you could take with them. telling them to abandon their split blade will likely land you a bigger faction hit. but if you group with them regularly and they appear to be open minded i would say the advice to give is to abandon any weapon without a high agro innate proc and to exhort them to work toward ldon anger procs.<br />
<br />
by the way there is one almost foolproof way to find out if they are inciting on an ldon (assuming they are mt) without asking them. if they use offensive disciplines a lot they are probably not inciting much. reason this is true is there is not enough endurance regeneration to support an incite on every pull AND a lot of offensive disciplines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">here's what to expect from a warrior with good agro setup:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I have ambidex, but not flurry or ferocity.  I have WA1 (am working on WA5) and two anger 3 on two weapons with innate anger procs.  I am the puller.  I shoot an arrow until it lands.  I incite (don't have KT incite bellow yet, working on it) on incomming.  I hit attack as soon as the mob is in range.  I have tried inciting after hitting attack with no difference.  I only group with enchanters, I know nothing about shaman or beastlord slowing, since I rarely group with them.<br />
<br />
I will 100 percent always, every time, never fail, lose aggro if I don't get at least two procs before slow lands or if it has been about 10 seconds since melee engage.  I would put the chance of losing slow at only one proc at about 50 percent if in the first 5 seconds of engage.<br />
<br />
Now, having said this, it seems there are a lot of people that don't seem to experience the same thing as me.  I frankly hate playing in GoD, but the only place I can get groups are GoD.  So it is either soloing in BoT (which I can do for crap exp) or do ldon (which are crap exp and rather boring) for exp.  I am told I need WA5, but at the rate I can find non GoD groups it will take me 6 months to get 30 AA.  I get 4 or 5 AA a night if I play in GoD, but I can't stand to play in GoD due to this aggro problem.  I hate being useless.  I hate losing agro on almost every single pull.  I hate it when the mob is killed (20 seconds) while still beating on a cleric or enchanter.  I hate that I must depend on taunt working to play unless I want the enchanter to be the MT of the group.  As a result, I just hate GoD.<br />
<br />
Now, since I know I am inciting and I have the best 1h aggro setup I can get without PoTime, what am I doing wrong on positioning?  What about my reaction can I change?  I honestly need help, since I must be totally clueless if other people don't have my probelm with my setup?  Or is it that everyone already has WA5 and that fixes all the problems?  Am I the only warrior in the game playing in GoD without WA5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I couldnt open yer AA window from the magelo file you linked for some reason.. but, another factor that should help you (and any nuking/debuffing class for that matter) out A TON, is Spell Casting Deftness 3! I got those for my wizard ASAP since I was bad about getting agro sometimes.. now, he almost never takes agro. Great AA my friend ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: I meant Spell Casting Subtlety at level 3~</div></div><hr />

<br />
i wont dispute this since it is clearly your experience though not mine. ill say what i do but i dont think it will help because i think you do the same thing. i fling an arrow and the mob comes running or someone else pulls and i fling an arrow. i follow with incite when it gets close enough and it normally comes straight toward me. i turn on attack and the mob hits me. if the enchanter or shaman or beastlord is too quick on the slow he gets agrod for about 2 or 3 seconds but if he waits till ive done about 2 rounds of swings he does not get agro.<br />
<br />
why the difference? i have no clue. its not proc related since im not required to proc first to keep agro over a slow. i duel weild if that means anything. i have no offensive aa. i highly doubt its because i position myself better. although after contact i do always every time make the immediate effort to push myself forward to get as much in the mob's face as possible.<br />
<br />
so maybe its time to field the question to the experts among us. why does lokkak have problems keeping agro over a slow and i do not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I never had problems keeping aggro thru a slow, and a lot of you people are leaps and bounds ahead of me in aggro generation.  I never bought LDoN, so I don't have any augments, and I quit before GoD, so I never got any fancy aggro generation AA's.  I did however, have basically all defensive/offensive PoP AA's, a sceptre of destruction and a copper hammer.<br />
<br />
Now, a large between you guys and me is that i played my slower too.  I'd pull with an arrow, wait until the mob got back to me, turn on attack AND THEN Incite.  Pure hate seems to be fubared if you're not already doing melee damage, incite has never worked well for me at all when I used it before autoattack was on.  The other thing that can help you is to pay particular attention to your spell messages...if you see your slower beginning to cast, and you know it's a slow, get into the timing of how long it takes and taunt IMMEDIATELY after slow lands.  I lost aggro maybe 1 in 50 times doing the above ritual, procs or not.<br />
<br />
Now, having said that, I'm sorry, but the majority of casters are dipshits.  They solo 1-60 or 1-65, then get a group and wonder why their tank can't hold aggro while they unload their fucking manapool on high aggro spells.  Or they're still sitting while they send their pet into combat, get aggro, and then think that the appropriate thing to do in that situation is to burn the mob down as fast as they can.  It is the caster's job to compensate for their tank, if your tank doesn't have high end aggro generation capabilities, then you've got 2 choices...either tone down your dipshit tendancies, or spend a lot of time at your bind point.  Warrior's can only do so much, and while I'm not saying that all of them are doing everything they can, there are many more casters that don't know what they're doing than warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For what it's worth -- and I'd agree it might not be worth much -- my own unscientific observations match Haass's: I'd rather hit the mob before using the incite line. <br />
According to the theory I have in my head, what *should* work best is to incite at maximum range, since the sooner you incite the sooner the post-initial hate of the incite can start ticking away. But that runs counter to my experience. If I tag incoming mob with arrow, autoattack &amp; slam, then use incite I *appear* to get better results. And if I&quot;m pulling, I'd always tag mob with arrow for initial aggro then hit incite. You can shoot a mob with an arrow and still have time to incite, but often if you pull with incite initially you don't have time to shoot the arrow before the mob's on you.<br />
The only reason doing melee damage initially might work better is if for some reason initial melee damage and aggro is &quot;seen&quot; differently from pure hate damage. I don't have any actual evidence of that. But that 's the way it looks to me.<br />
<br />
If the original poster is never seeing the incite-line message when he's with the problem tank, I'm suspicious of the tank. Yes, if the tank is pulling and using incite on the pull, you might not see the first message. And, yes, if the incite refreshes late in the fight and the tank has solid aggro, then I can see the tank saving it for the next mob. But I can't see the tank never having incite available if fight goes on for a while and the tank does not have solid aggro.<br />
<br />
The other thing is the possibility that the &quot;good&quot; tanks the original poster plays with have a significant AA and possibly even a level advantage over the tank that's having problems. If you are a caster and get used to the aggro generation capacity of an advanced tank, you could be in for a surprise when you have to throttle back for a less AA'd tank (an effect that can also be heightened by gear differences).<br />
<br />
As for trying to tell someone how to play their class without offending them, heh. Very difficult. My shaman alt has on a couple of occasions been able to successfully give non-offensive advice to warriors, but only after warrior asked a class-specific question and I was able to establish that I knew what I was talking about by precisely and accurately answering that question in a tell. Then, as an aside (&quot;it can also help when the MT does X early in the fight....&quot;) I can mention something that I think the tank should be doing right now. Basically, until someone is ready to take advice and believes you are  source of accurate info, telling them how to be better is an iffy proposition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Exactly you can’t teach someone who does not wish to learn. If anything I'd point him to our boards and we'll make sure he goes through boot camp here :)<br />
<br />
Haass for drill sergeant and he wont loose agro before he drops dead ever again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeh, if you can incite right after you engage with melee it's a little better aggro imo.Doesn't mean you can't use it to catch a mob going by.<br />
<br />
A fast shammy malo followed by slow is a lot less aggro than a fast tash and chanter slow.If I know a chanter is going to debuff right away I hold incite until the debuff lands then immediately taunt/incite afterwards.If a shammy or slightly slower chanter debuff then  I engage with melee and incite and it holds aggro almost every time...well until the necro gets crazy hehe.<br />
<br />
I have most stuff like discs,taunt and incite mapped to keys next to my movement arrows so there's little delay and lag doesn't affect their use.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly why your tank is losing aggro ,but, the group has to play to the tank and run just underneath his hate generation.<br />

Ps. O and HOTT is godly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Gunnar, I have to agree. There is a night and day difference in my tanking if I have access to HoTT as group leader (I have the ablity, but have met with some difficult p/u groups where I was am not leader). I know when to taunt, when to Incite, and especially, when to /shield or AoE Taunt.<br />
<br />
The trick with Incite, I have found, depends on your slower. If your slower has casting sublety AAs, then you might not even have to Incite (though safer if you did). Agree, arrow on incoming, but don't Incite unless you know you are at the top of the hate list already. I go so far as to taunt, engage, then wait for debuff/slow message, taunt (until successful) and Incite. If slower has aggro between unsuccessful taunt atemps, then I use /shield. If slower is getting smacked really hard (but does not have low health aggro yet) I use AoE Taunt if available, then Incite. Do this (and have proper aggro weapons) and the mob will stick to you like glue for the entire fight as long as your group remains reasonable in aggro generation.</div></div><hr />
