<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mashin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">looked in the library, seems most of the info is for a lot of higher end people, where could i find some useful info for a new to game ogre warrior that follows the war god? level 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mashin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HAHAHA!, nevermind found out how to expand the library compendium, made it to level 22 yesterday, i apoligize for being such a noob.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congrats on the levels and the find!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mashin - What server are you on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Talk to NPCs in your guild is a good start as well as any other quests in your home town? If you looking for rwards worth the trouble dont bother, but some of them are sure fun thought. I really enjoyed the starting troll quests myself, like happy love bracer :) There is quiet a bit of lore in both Oggok and Grobb(well Neriak now I guess. Frogs be damned) and most of it is quiet well done. If you looking for spoilers just check out Alakhazam's site. Quests by zone then Oggok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mashin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm on the torv server, hehe can't remeber how to spell the whole thing, my friend has been playing since last year and after watching him on his comp this summer,seeing how much he enjoyed it ! I went out and got a computer and EQ, now he has personal problems and cant play. so i figured id play on the server he does just in case he gets things straightened out and comes back, I dinged 24 last night, this game is way to addicting:p</div></div><hr />
