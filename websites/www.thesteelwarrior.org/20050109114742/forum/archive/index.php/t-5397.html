Not in beta, just found the site. Think this is total bullshit, melee being relegated back to the crap that happened in luclin. Gogo uselessness.</div></div><hr />

We can't buy our weapons. At least weapons that will actually damage the mob. YOU HIT %T FOR 1 POINT OF DAMAGE WITH YOUR BLACKJACK, BECAUSE YOUR OTHER WEAPONS DON'T WORK YAY!</div></div><hr />

I don't have a good basis to go on, 'cause I'm just in a casual guild that's doing cutting-edge stuff like NToV (hey, it's fun for us anyway ;)).  But it seems like by just getting &quot;junk&quot; that nobody even wants (or buying toys in the baz for &lt;100pp), I have a 2hs,2hb,2hp that while they go roughly in that order in terms of effectiveness, the ratio isn't that hugely different between them all.<br />
<br />
Obviously the mob in that article as way beyond what my guild could take though, so I don't even know if this will affect me, and may only apply to those of you up there.</div></div><hr />

But, imo, this article looks like complete BS. dx9 effecting SS's?... and that mob looks like a poorly copied iguana. If it's for really. I'm gonna cry. And I thought that this expansion was going to focus on a Trans-dimentional federation of evildoers?

If you're not tanking then it will give us a reason to go to the bazaar and pickup something like a velium lance of some type to pull out of our bags for DPS or maybe those crowfeet lances will stop rotting, but for warriors who tank it doesnt matter how much damage we are doing.  Seru and Emp Ssra are prefect examples of mobs we can tank without doing any damage at all to because agro is not a direct result of DPS.  Even if these mobs are 95% immune to slash damage we will still be tanking them with BoW's / BF's / DBotWs' / BoC's etc, and if we happen to do no DPS for an encounter or 2 its no big deal.  Just look at how much DPS rogues do on encounters where they sit back and throw knives for 15mins.<br />
<br />
That said, it looks like BS to me.</div></div><hr />

I agree. But not for the same reason. I think it's bullshit, because I think the article is bullshit right now.<br />
<br />
I'm not in Beta. And right now, it's just a rumor. <br />
<br />
Maybe that is for real, maybe it isn't. For now I'm skeptical.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, keep in mind that if mobs don't have melee resistance most likely they'd just put ridiculous AC instead (ala Luclin) so no one gets to do any melee damage at all.  I think weapon resistance is a nice compromise, especially if the fights in Gates will be long (resistance to weapons certainly suggests fights won't end very fast)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that would really suck, Rogues being the only class thats tied to 1 particular weapon type in the primary hand.. every other class has an option. About the only saving grace for rogues in this situation would be to make the Backstab attack not count as piercing.<br />
<br />
TBH I kind of like the idea, it really does make sense that a creature with skin of rock would be relativly impervious to slashing and piercing weapons, yet blunt type weapons cause more damage than normal.</div></div><hr />

If you are mining, do you use a hammer or a pick ?<br />

It'd make sense from a balance and roleplaying standpoint, but knowing sony...:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no reason stuff needs to be any weaker to melee than they already are.  Besides it's nothing that can't be simulated by tweaking with HPs and resists.  I.e. something can be 'weak' against blunt if it has high resistance to spells, high resistance to non blunt weapons, normal resistance to blunt weapons, and lower than normal HPs (to a comparable raid mob).  If you make something that actually takes more damage from a blunt weapon or wahtever all that means is that mob will have more HPs to compensate for this weakness (because it can't be so weak that the fight ends too fast).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a skeleton for example...hard to do damage to a skeleton with a dagger.  A club, on the other hand, would do a far better job.  Likewise, blunt weapons would be inneffective underwater (too much resistance).<br />
<br />
Of course, maybe we're giving SOE too much credit here.  That's how I'd do it, I don't know how those halfwits are gonna implement it.</div></div><hr />

And also with DKP systems, you would clearly have to adjust down the prices on weapondry.  It could work but its a little late in the game to add it.<br />
<br />
Also, the gigantic danger is the silly mistake they made in Luclin with Ssaera Bane weapons.  They went through all of the trouble to make the Emperor only take melee damage from snakebane but forgot about magic.  What ended up happening is that snakebane weapons became a waste of time as long as magic damage worked.<br />
<br />
If they do an attributed system then they need to go all the way and include magic.  If a monster is strong or immune to every damage but one type, like piercing, then that also means magic damage.  Anything less is just a kick in the shins to all classes that melee.</div></div><hr />

Vanazir does I think around 130 or dps on average, not sure exactly and according to the link, the vanazir did 20dps, thats only about 15% or so as effective as the weapon can be, might as well be bindwounding the main tank, least that would be useful.</div></div><hr />

IMO there shouldnt be a negative impact on damage, there should be a bonus for using the correct type, like a club will smash a skelly to dust, a slasher will make a living mob bleed, a poker will do some crippling damage on human types, bash will show those crystaline golems whos boss ETC, it would be better to have a bonus than making everyone seem like a pus (come on, 20 dmg with a high end wep like that? ive seen level 20's hit for that with finesteel)</div></div><hr />

fuck you, you may have to deal with a resist NOW and then, but this is EVERY hit on that mob type, so dont give me that only fair bullshit not to mention there is a debuff line to eliminate that problem of resists in most cases, im sure sony WONT have the forsight to make a tash for lower weapon resistances, being able to do over a 1000 damage in one cast with a 15 second cast time DOES need limits, quit pissing on my class assclown<br />
<br />
and at least you have a fuggin spell books for you &quot;hammers&quot; it takes up space if we carry it around, costs DKP, and fucks some monk out of a nice weapon<br />
<br />
all this system will do is cause ALOT more problems for up and coming monks and rogues because now everyone will want their weapons &quot;just incase&quot; it will also bring about the first raid with 6 clerics, 1 warrior, and a about 20 monk/rogues</div></div><hr />

Heh, chill out, Mr. Grumpy.  I play a warrior, too, if you didn't bother to look at the magelo link.  I carry a weapon of each type already, along with weapons for snare...  I know it's a pain, but it's not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
Despite being able to debuff, there are many mobs that you still can't land a friggin spell on, especially as a shaman, since we have a relatively limited set of damage-type spells to choose from, and some of those, like disease, work so slowly as to not be very useful except maybe for soloing.<br />
<br />

Well... if melees weren't already underpowered and waiting on a vaporware melee balancing round 2 (first round was little more than appetizers)  then maybe hitting them with this would be fair.  As it is, melees are underpowered even without having to handle these weapon resists and casters suffering (poor babies) spell resists.  Why make the problems any *worse*?<br />
<br />
Of course they would also have to triple weapon drop rates in general and add, say, Dark Mace of the Warlod and Dark Spear of the Warlord (etc... for the other melee classes) to be more specific (we'd still have to suffer through the initial demand spike).  Oh, and depending on the levels this would occur at, add the ability to make a Jagged Lance of War and a Jagged Heavy Flail of War out of our Red Scabbards and some extra forms of the other epics...<br />
<br />
If they do this I hope they take the  drop rate given to melee weapons from caster gear... twould only be fair.  Or they could make it that only focus items in main/secondary slots had any effects on spells cast on these mobs, although that would still hit casters far, far, far more weakly.<br />
<br />
Of course, I could be wrong and melee balancing round 2 could be just around the corner and be all I ever dreamed of.  But the only rumors floating around are of melee nerfs.  One has to wonder if the devs coordinate at all because having this monthlong silence (after telling us that, fortunately, they realized that their old plan of openings was getting scrapped) getting broken by nerf rumors is... rather insulting frankly.</div></div><hr />

In fact any fight that lasts long enough for casters to OOM drops casters to basically subpar warrior damage (very subpar actually).<br />
<br />
You realize that if there's this mob that you do 200% more damage with blunt weapon it'd just have 200% more HPs than a normal mob so that if you've a raid equipped with just Vanazirs you don't tear this boss up in 3 minutes?  It is absolutely no different than a boss with normal HPs that take normal damage from blunt and take 33% damage from all other weapon types.</div></div><hr />

This impacts Warriors more than any other class since we rely on aggro weapons and aggro augments and also have to maintain DPS non-aggro setups.<br />

What's next? Give mobs weapons that go through Plate armor like butter but can't handle Chain? Are we going to need GoD bane weapons that can't be used outside of the GoD expansion and GoD armor?

As for damage options we can use almost any weapon that's not specifically a class-only thing.  I do not see how our DPS will suffer more than say rogue (piercing) or monk (blunt).  And if you're complaining about casters, there's a whole mess of spell reflect type effects on spdat and those drop caster damage by quite a bit as well with no way to circumvent them at all (most of the new spell reflect comes with +curse counter making it undispellabe).  There is a 100% spell reflect spell in spdat that'd drop spell damage to 0 no matter what spell you use, and on the other hand as long as a mob isn't immune to piercing, slashing, and blunt weapons we can at least do some damage.  So I don't see why we're worse off than casters or other melees.</div></div><hr />

After having thought about it a bit, I am much more mellow about it.  If many mobs are resistant, or if csters don't have similar limits put in place, then yes, it will suck.  If it is limited to a few mobs(they are raid mobs is my impression), and if casters have mobs where they are similarly limited(as it appears), then this is just a way to up the difficulty of encounters to balance them.  In that case it is not terrible, simply inconvienient as every melee carries at least one of each type weapon.</div></div><hr />

Oh, he certainly came alright.  I blacked out on the first hit, only to reawaken split seconds later from the divine touch of my trusted priests standing behind me.  The battle raged for minutes, hours it seemed, until finally the giant fell to the final swoop of my blade.  Brynju they called him, and a formidable art of war he was.  <br />
<br />
I gazed over his heaving chest during his last breathing moments of his life.  A sense of serenity overcame him.  No harm or foul could be seen in his eyes, but a smile.  A smile?  Slowly pulling a dagger from his belt, I took stance with my blade, but soon only to realize he meant it merely as a gift.  It was a tribute to my performance.<br />
<br />
Conjuring the last bits of his strength, his smile opened up as he whispered his last dieing breathe into my ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here Eriatha, would you like a good Shank?&quot;<br />
<br />
I could only help but chuckle.  Extending out my hand, I closed his eyes and kissed his forhead, finally allowing the once great giant to sleep.</div></div><hr />

Whatever though really, I already sit out a few fights as it is.  I sincerely doubt I am going to dkp a uinch of decent slashers/blunts just to do some partial damage on future pierce-resistant targets.</div></div><hr />

I personally am not in the Beta for GoD however i live with someone who is. That post on RPG is a blatent break in the NDA whomever posted it agreed to. Some people are reading this and wwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy overreacting. To say &quot;omg all these mobs in GoD are going to require us to have top end of every single type of weapon&quot; is about like saying &quot;omg we're all going to need shissar bane to be effective in luclin&quot;. What this is for mainly is to give a few boss mobs an edge on PC's again. For Velious it was a huge burst in DPS, for Luclin it was tons of HP and AC, for PoP it was another Huge burst in DPS / adds + waves type encounters. All this is doing is giving those fully equipped Time guilds who are chomping at the bits for something new, a challenge. Instead of shit that will just roll over and die , spewing forth lewts from thier carcasses. (not that i dont necessarly like it when mobs do that). All in all the expansion needs some more tweaking, and hopefully we can all be PLing our beserker alts by Feb 16, and have nice new lvl 65 beserkers by the 20th, and give chain molds from EP a home, instead of just letting them rott.<br />

Implementing it now at the very high end game, really is poor implementation more than poor design. <br />
<br />
There already are things similar for casters on Ldon  raids. Some mobs can  completely reflect spell.. imagine that caster nuking himself for 7k.. kinda hurts... but reflect is not on every mob, and neither should be melee resistances. Stuff like Skeletone limited damage from slash, none from pierce is ok, but ever mob is wrong.<br />
<br />
I have doubts about the article, because the picture is almost a literal copy of the D&amp;D monster manual... that and the fuzzy screenshot excuse, leads me to believe that this is a hoax.. <br />
<br />
If not, I better get those last 34 points of 2hb skill.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure many of us have let  a few weapon skills slide. But it won't take long to get them in good shape. And I know I always tried to have a weapon or two of each type in my pack and upgrade them as some drop came available. <br />
<br />
There are a few reasonable 2HP out there. And some decent 1HP. For 1HS/2HS we all have something, and 1HB and 2HB we have reasonable weapons. Sure, we aren't going to have the best of each weapon type, but we have more options than any other class. <br />
<br />
I like this new challenge. It makes sense. It's a real opportunity for us. It will make warriors more needed in groups as we will be effective on dam near any mob, as long as we are prepared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't fucking kid yourselves. These changes exist for 1 reason alone. Int casters, but mostly wizards. Wizards and their never-ending bitch over how little damage they do in comparison to melees. Personally, considering casters have been the kings of damage from SoL through PoP (I won't count LDoN raids because I really don't know enough about them and because few actually did them consistently). Why must this streak continue beyond into GoD is beyond me. Although I will attest this change affects warriors less than other pure melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think our rogues say they beat our wizards consistently in DPS.  And I'm sure stuff like decrease spell damage, mana drain, or reflect is very wizard friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mana drains are nothing new. spell deflects I've yet to hear of and decreased damage has been around for years. Yet, somehow on a boss mob that doesn't have colossal HP totals and low AC, wizards always hold their own or better for a specific boss than rogues or monks (wizards and rogues in our guild generally attest to this). Hell, most high-level wizards claim their biggest concerns these days is agro, not mana.<br />
<br />
So, with that in mind, considering this particular discussion IS about a high-end boss, and we've already established that nuking int casters can hold their own if not out-perform melees (which I am more inclinde to believe), and considering that reduced spell damage and mana drains were a part of EQ for a long time now. Now, keeping all that in mind, how do you still justify REDUCING melee damage on BOSS mobs and further widening this gap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladymir</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea IF it goes both ways... I mean why shouldn't a blunt weapon do 120% damage against a skeleton if a slash does 80%?<br />
<br />
In other words, there should be a bonus to counterbalance every penalty. <br />
<br />
Don't just penalize...</div></div><hr />

The Cragqueen Beast which is the first 'uber' people encounter in Gates of Discord has spell reflect.<br />
<br />
Also when I say mana drain you probably don't understand I mean like, -500 mana/tick, saving at -350 or worse and can't be cured AEs that can quickly knock out even the best caster.<br />
<br />
BTW, stuff can have weakness to certain weapons.  Ranger friends say certain stuff take more damage from archery.</div></div><hr />

Also, a 500 mana/tickdrain would be serious, but these haven't been seen yet, while the weapon reduc have been common throughout, and not exclusive to boss mobs (the things that lok like Amygaldan's from PoF have about a 50-70% slash/blunt immunity).</div></div><hr />
