<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So since LDoN came out to early January I have been grinding LDoN (slowly) to get 1492 plate from Tak (the helmet, which@#%^~! is visible on barbarians (reason I went hat over BP is I wanted a hatless look for the Lucin models--more interesting than the helmet look) and haste. In mostly HoT armor and with a WMBS I quite enough a tank for LDoN and actaully did not feel that I was breaking with warrior ways by getting some offensive AAS (heck DPS is important from everyone in LDoN...).<br />
<br />
Well I am back to BoT and starting some Tac's XPing...I have to tell you, friggin PoP mobs hit me hard enough (and over a big enough range of values) that, while I don't feel bad about the offensive AAs I spent, there is no doubt in my mind that for PoP xping Defensive AAs are much more valuable for groups than Offensive AAs. So, at least while PoP is playing a bigger part in my play time, I have no doubt that I will be grinding out another 37 AAs in ID, LR and ND. Already got ID1, LR1 and soon will have ID2.<br />
<br />
And I was so looking forward to marshall (though it would have taken a while, planned path was Punishing Blade 3, Furisous 2, 3, then Crits 1,2,3 and then finally Flurry 1,2,3). Needless to say, that plan in on hiatuous until I decide to grind out my Tak BP or something. :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol kailyn you big baby =-p You have like 800 more hp than I, you've got a big lead on AA, and you're talking about BoT mobs hitting hard? I was tanking bot with &lt;4khp unbuffed and nothing but run3! That sucked! Sounds like those wimpy LDoN mobs have you spoiled =-p I just recently started doing LDoN again after being fed up with it a month after it's release (mostly because I want your royal attendent helmet of flailing dead... that's yummy looking) and I have one observation to make: 65 normal LDoN mobs make a ravishing drolvargs look menacing again.<br />
<br />
You're right, PoP mobs hit pretty hard - just like they did BEFORE LDoN was out. Oh, and while you're back there in a-year-ago-land, can you please tell my former self what today's lottery numbers were? 10-12-52-95-13... THANKS you're a dear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kailyn ... group ME in LDoN! I want some adventure points tooooooooo!<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
BoT mobs never struck me as all that tough to stand up to. Heh. A little mend here a little earthwalk there and slow should have landed.<br />
<br />
Tactics mobs in some parts annoy the hell out of me. Decorin Brawlers, Hendin Shadowmasters, stuff like that. I don't try to tank in there ever. But I'm a monk. So duh!<br />
<br />
Everyone swears that LR5 is pretty much the biggest boost you can get as a tank. And ID 5 helps a bunch too. So you're probably on the right track going with the defensive stuff.<br />
<br />
Good luck ... and GROUP ME!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, yeah actually I am dying more in BoT now than I was pre LDoN. I need more defenses becuase my group mates are noobs. THen again there is the fundimental differance of being doubled for 919 or doubled for...lol don't even remember the LDoN normal max hit...what ever it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">380-393, depending on mob.<br />
<br />
up to 992 something on hard.<br />
<br />
where do you get doubled for 919 in BoT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you sit against a kriger? Those only hit 800s, and are pretty infrequent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought a Kriger could max at 919...whatever...<br />
<br />
Certantly way more incoming DPS in BoT (or Tac) than LDoN normal (haven't been able to convince guildies to try a hard yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">kriger more like at 740<br />
I'd not suggest you to do Hard yet, max tanking AA first and get little more HP :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL 717 looking at the small sample I have in my logs (all of 3). I would have sworn the firs time I fasted them I was getting upto 900's...<br />
<br />
Maybe this mitigation thing realy is doign something.</div></div><hr />
