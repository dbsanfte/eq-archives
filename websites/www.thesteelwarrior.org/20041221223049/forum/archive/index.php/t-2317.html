No flag needed?<br />
<br />
Is there a skill check when the combine is done and where is the forge that I would have to use for the combine?</div></div><hr />

Just give the dwarf in PoT in the building next to the bank 500pp.  He will give you Warrior Emblem and a Forge.  Just put Emblem, Mold, Tanaan Hammer, and 2 Sheets in there and combine and bam you get your gloves :)</div></div><hr />

30% haste, lasts 1 hour +, readily available in the bazaar, no MQ needed.  Everyone should have a pair. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cause I dont want to camp SF for 40+ hours to get the eyepatch.  Buy/Group for the mold and the rest is cake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(yes, I see why folks might want it for the haste.  Since I hunt in places where a slower is a prereq, I get a pocket speeder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, most of my exp in Tier 1 (up til 63) was done with RL friends.  I was usually the slower of the group (ToD) and the extra 30% haste would have been very helpful as I generally had no haste other than cloak (34%).  Besides, I find myself wearing the Ornate for the AC improvement over Myrmidom's.  10 AC or 33 (ND3) HPS is the question you have to ask yourself.  Since I very rarely have a Cheal hit me when I have less than 33 HPS left, which is the best piece of gear for me?  The odds of this timing occuring with Tier 2/3 mobs is pretty small.<br />
<br />
Self buffed and with Virtue, 33 HPS is less than 0.5% of my HPS.  You cant even see a 33 pt hit on the bar.  Plus I have the additional benefit of being 64% self hasted pretty much all the time for situations of slower dieing or spell haste wearing off until it is refreshed now (haven't tried Tier 3 without slower yet).  Maybe someday I will die because of the 33 HP's but I have to wonder if maybe someone else will die because the mob did 33 Hp's more to them because their AC was lower.</div></div><hr />

The self hasting would be nice for when I'm not grouped with a haster!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">one of the best items you can get for the money.<br />
no matter if exp grinding without slower, farming greens, duells or what ever. Lets say upgrading from 90hp SS gaunts to 125hp gloves of warding is a &quot;nice&quot; upgrade but ornate gaunts are so handy, just because they are so unique (oh well add THO belt and eyepatch, eyepatch haste lasts only 10mins thou).<br />
You still can bag them for the effect.</div></div><hr />

btw, ornate gloves are good clickie haste, not equip upgrade, clickie clickie clickie! $$</div></div><hr />
