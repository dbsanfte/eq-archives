<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>acfreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I recently came across alot of cash (sold an Earring of Lushest Foliage a friend gave to me).  The thing is though is that my gear is very good for my level and don't want to upgrade until 55 (ornate).  But the new magnetic gear is really awesome, and fairly cheap on Xegony.  Should I spend 160k on that or get ornate, and feel free to critique my magelo and give suggestions.  :)                            http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1122209</div></div><hr />

 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Magnetic is the bestest for the cost. Ornate still hasn't come down in price it seems and isn't worth paying double for.<br />
<br />
And where did you get your Darkened Blade? Been looking for one for a while now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>acfreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not sure where it drops but i know that the graohic is sweet as all heck.  I get inspected so much that my name is famous now i guess lol.  I have some friends that give me kleft overs sometimes and that was one of them, the agro on it isnt that great so far.  And scary, ill give you 20k for your lance even though its no drop  :p   Ill find out where it drops tonight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to your question... I'd go with magnetic over ornate.</div></div><hr />
