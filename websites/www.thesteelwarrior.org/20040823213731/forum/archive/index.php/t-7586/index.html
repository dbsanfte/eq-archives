<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Even though I do not play a warrior, I make this announcement for one.<br />
<br />
     As the guildleader for Councyl of Shadowed Souls,<br />
<br />
     We give our respect and our deepest sympathies to the family and friends<br />
     of Korthina.<br />
<br />
     She was for us, at CoSS, a founder, a family member, and above all a dear friend.<br />
<br />
     She passed on the 5th of June to the dismay of all of our guildmembers. Sadly it was not known until recently, and I give my most humble apologies for the delay in this announcement.<br />
<br />
     So.....<br />
<br />
     Korthina, to you this day I drink a beer for you.<br />
<br />
     Please tap one back for her, a true warrior that has fallen.<br />
<br />
     She will be sorely missed by us at Councyl.<br />
<br />
<br />
       From da Blackboo....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arvoreen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How she DIE? i Play on Xegony and have played with her a few times ..so have known her alittle ingame...esp when she was in FTS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Arvoreen.... <br />
             Her husband has not given any details. And I did not have the heart to ask him. Once he had taken care of things at home, and got himself back together somewhat, he (if he had the heart) would let others know. That is all that I know. <br />
    I do know that they were very close, and I can only, barely, dare glimpse at his grief. For myself I could not, can not, and will not think what it would be like if I lost my wife Vixcen. So, I have given him lots of space. Vixcen and I are basically leaving things up to him, we do not want to interfere. We did, however, feel the need to honor her passing by posting here and at the Warriors Armoury on the eqforums in her honor. <br />
   So, Arvoreen, I am afraid that I have few answers, other than to say.... Your concern does her honor and is well met.</div></div><hr />

In her honor I will make my attack call &quot; For Korthina SURROUND and ATTACK *said target here*&quot; Always heart breaking to hear of someone passing on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, so deeply sad to see someone die, espiecally a loved one. I can not imagine the grief I would feel if my husband were to leave me.  I offer my prayers and condolences to her family, her friends, and guildmates</div></div><hr />
