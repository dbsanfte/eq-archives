I was curious as to which augments would be better to add to them.  Should I put an anger3 or anger2 augment in these or should I get .. say the ykesha proc for 100pts and a 0.00 stun?<br />
<br />
Anyone's opinion will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If you raid and need the most agro possible use Anger 3. Yak procs are equivlent to anger 2, but with added dps. If you plan on raiding go anger 3, but if you do not go for Yak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least for mainhand id get Anger III. Then id put a cheaper aug on offhand unless you think you will be getting better offhand weap to aug soon. Kinda depends on how much you love/loathe LDoN too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you a MT for your guild? If so, anger 3. If you just do experience group content where your DPS matters, the highest Ykesha augment should be just fine aggro and more DPS. Never, ever get anger 2. We need this stickied, 'cause frankly it gets asked too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not disuputing you, Fitemore, but I'm hoping you can elaborate on your assertion that somebody should &quot;never, ever get anger 2.&quot; I ask because I'm 6 normal wins away from anger 2 and had been planning on buying one for my Sword of the Bloodsworn. Is the hate from that proc just not enough to put me at the top of the aggro list? <br />
<br />
I'm the MT, btw, of a family guild that rarely fields more than 2 groups at a time for our own goals. Right now those goals consist of finishing up Epic 1.0 for various folks, completing the alternate access PoP quests, exploring as much of GoD as possible. We belong to a raiding alliance, so it's possible I'll be the MT eventually when we encounter pre-Elemental PoP bosses.<br />

Anyway -- was just curious about the comment.<br />

Edit -- I hate typo's.<br />
Edit2 -- just noticed that was post #100.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  It's not that... it's that anger 2 is never better than the Ykesha procs. Anger 2 is the same aggro as Ykesha, approximately, and less DPS for the same cost (comparing the lowest Ykesha proc to anger 2). If you're already working on anger 2, just keep going and getting anger 3. It's probably overkill, but if you're already on the EF path you might as well go for the good stuff.</div></div><hr />

I put Anger 2 on my sotbs before really reading these boards too much.  I regret that and wish I had put ykesha on it.  Don't strip any augs for a while though, there's talk of the next expansion allowing augs to be removed and re-used.  This will change how people think and spend pts.<br />
