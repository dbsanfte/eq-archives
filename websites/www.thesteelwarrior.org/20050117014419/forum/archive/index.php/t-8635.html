Do you know a necro that had to FD after taping a mob's mana ?<br />
<br />
if I answer those 2 questions on my own, I tend to think that the effect on this weapon won't generate a lot of aggro.<br />
<br />
but the only way to know it is to try &amp; parse... ( fight same mob vs someone that has a stun proc on a same dps weapon.. see how often you get aggro on your proc )</div></div><hr />

I have yet to see the knights with Zun's blade appear.  My conclusion is the agro proc on this weapon is not so hot.  Not hard evidence but enough for me to avoid putting in on this sword.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The proc effect just removes HP and mana and does not confer any on you. Its a nice agro effect roughly on par with Force strike and 150ykesha procs since mobs hate mana reduction more than they do HP reduction after the nuke fixes just prior to PoP. Its still low enough to be easily kept up with by a BoW or dual anger weilding warrior or most Knights. <br />
Not too many pre-time procs have higher damage either for tank classes. <br />
Two thumbs up from me. Now to get one for my Warrior *grin&quot;<br />
<br />
Granted, most of the posters on alla are retards ... so not sure how much validity is in the statment.  I believed him till he pulled out the the &quot;Its still low enough to be easily kept up with by a BoW&quot; ... I'm 100% positive a BoW would run aggro circles around this blade.</div></div><hr />
