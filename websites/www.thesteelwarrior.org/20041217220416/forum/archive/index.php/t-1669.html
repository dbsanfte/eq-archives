I'm the same annoying git that posted about where to go next. Hardest fight we've done is Doomshade.<br />
<br />
So, what do I need to know about this guy? Is he spawnable? Do I need to turn in something? What's his spawn rate like? Hits? Any particular tactics I need to know about before I wipe my guild?<br />
<br />
Thanks all!<br />

Intact power cell + Copper node + Bundle of superconductive wires to the gnome in the building in the northwest.  Escort the gnome up to the northeast corner.<br />
<br />
He hits for 1400, slowable, 3 different aes (dd+stun, dd, snare).  I'd guess roughly 150k hps.<br />
<br />
He doesn't become targetable until the gnome gets to him, so you can pre-arrange your people around him.  Make sure you face him away from the door if you need factory flags (or the gnome will probably die to enrage).</div></div><hr />

Its a fun encounter, be sure to have some chanters running gnome control!  Don't let anyone get in his way when he moves though, or else he will despawn.  If you have a decent SA, then you and SA should be pulling mobs to raid.  You can get to the dragon's room in about 30-45 minutes if you keep your pulling pace fairly quick.</div></div><hr />
