Get some hp rings.  Weps should be easy to get.  500pp gets u a Lamentation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have no fear, you can be a Mithaniel Marr worshiper and a warrior and make it in the game just fine. I made my warrior when Kunark came out, well before diety armour even existed.  I picked Mithaniel Marr for what seemed at the time a good roleplaying reason.  You can get decent gear without being a Rallos worshiper.  But pretty much any thing like brellium/full mithril is exactly the same as Luminant Heraldic.  You'll have to deal with the +mana along with the +HP.  By the time you get to the higher levels, you'll have ditched alot of that anyway.  Just remember when looking at any armour HP is king and sta=HP.  It's hard to tell you exactly what to get without knowing your level, finances, guild type, etc....  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InarianSZ</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT is pretty decent for agro and goes cheap these days, at least on SZ, got mine for 1200.   If you're looking for gear I'd suggest questing for velious skyshrine armor.  Tons of HP on that stuff.  +90 hp on the gloves for example.<br />
<br />
oh and quick comment regarding one of the gear statements made earlier in this post.<br />
<br />
&quot;HP is king and sta=HP&quot;<br />
<br />
mostly true but imho hp &gt; sta because you can always max sta w/ other gear and buffs so it hits a cap.  There's no cap for hp.  If it comes down to a choice take hp over sta.  usually that's not a problem tho.  hp &amp; sta seem to come hand in hand on many items.</div></div><hr />

My giant faction is as low as it can possibly be, so I can't really say much about the Kael armor. :)<br />
Raldukan armor from UP is quite good for AC and stats.  Droga weapons and a GSoT.  Get that stuff and you should be good for a while.</div></div><hr />
