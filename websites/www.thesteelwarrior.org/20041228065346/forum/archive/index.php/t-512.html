<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">helm of the tracker <br />
<br />
That's the ranger helmet from the heads quest I believe.  If so, then in the &quot;arena&quot; area towards the back castle standing infront of the ice wall are three giants (far north).   The middle one I believe is the one that drops the heads, he's on a longer than normal spawn time.  There not &quot;in a building&quot; though if I got my quests right.<br />
<br />
Go play in the Arena area, camp up on either left or right ramp and have fun.   Armor drops there kinda rarley and get faction for your CoV so you can hunt in ToV Halls of Testing without worrying about KOS folks.</div></div><hr />

Also if ytou could get a an experienced 62 chanter you could wlak in clear way single pull guardian easily with Pacify alsoyou can single ANYTHING in the arena with Pacify. With a 62 Chanter and their spell that get a 62 that is a upgrade to pacify if i remember right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Ranger Helm of the tracker comes from Kalis Storm(somthing).<br />
<br />
When you enter the arena(assuming left ramp) have your monkie/SK follow the left wall and pull to the corner striaght out from the top of the ramp.<br />
<br />
Kalis is guarded by 2 PoZ's which are easilily splitable, but who you need to kill as they drop 2 of the other 3 heads you need for the quest.<br />
<br />
Kalis is basically a PoZ who hits slightly harder and faster.<br />
<br />
Just use spam heals until slowed and after that it's a cakewalk.</div></div><hr />
