What is being offered is nice, but it will not put the Warrior once again to the front of the Melee line.  Warriors will gain from where they are now, but will not become the<br />
Main Tanks, they once were.  If theyare<br />
willing to offer this up so fast, once they learned of the planned &quot;Stand Down&quot;, then I suggest they can offer us even more, to get us part way balanced again.<br />
I truly doubt if there is a War type that<br />
sits in on any decision making meetings, about game balance, at SOE. We need more stun weapons available to us, higher taunt etc.</div></div><hr />

yeah, i read everquestlive.com but i dont think thats the change that needs to occur. i think what they are propsing is going to have a success ratio similar to a warrior's riptose skill. it almost never occurrs. honestly, i dont think warriors will ever be fixed. pure melee will have the shaft until everquest is no longer being supported by soe. <br />

Imagine that.. Sony gives melee chara's something..<br />
<br />
and oh... then all them whining how it sucks..<br />
<br />
pfft..<br />
<br />
dude thing about it.. your diciplines no longer on timer's but a eurdence pool kinda similair to sta!<br />
<br />
think about it a Rogue using duelist for 2 mins... can you imagine the dmg.<br />
<br />
A warrior saying in defensive for 10 mins?<br />
or using ripostile disc.. for longer then 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
swear to god.. give someone a mile.. and they cry about being an inch short.<br />
<br />
no one got nerfed... /cheer !<br />
melee's go something specific to them.<br />
Casters didn't get an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Goes to prove... if your class isn't the uberest and most useful class... you will find something to whine about.<br />
<br />
Give it a month and i'll hear a melee cry because he doesn't have healing spells. <br />

heres the link for you to read before reading my post here.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
majso, your senario's arent they way i intrepreted the changes. <br />
<br />
your looking at this just from the discipline side of the house. ill quote the artice and you can follow it with me from my perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;several&quot; = not all disciplines will use this and probably not the ones you want to be on their own timer.<br />
<br />
&quot;probably&quot; = we havent decided wether or not we are gonna implement this anyway...we are just telling you what we think you want to hear because we dont want you to quit playing everquest nor do we want you to frustrate other players to the point of quiting everquest. we are gonna bide our time until everquest 2 comes out and when it does none of this will matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;own timer&quot; = you wont be able to use disciplines until you run out of endurance, you still have to wait for their timer to recharge (granted is very nice to not have to wait on used disciplines but its not gonig to slove the situation that pure melees are in, nor the demeaning role that warriors are no longer in)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines&quot; = oh, ok, so all hybrids get everything mentioned above.....then this changes nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;limited&quot; = the same sense that a shadow knight or a paladin has the limited tanking abilites of warrior (ahahahahahahaaha)<br />
<br />
This is how I intrepreted this new discipline system.......very much different from yoru intrepretation, maj. But there was a method tehy stated to help balance pure melees, let me intreprt that for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These &quot;Openings&quot; will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow, this seems like its going to be a class defining system of combat, im gettting all excited let me read further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, so that where the extra endurance that monk, rouges and warriar get is going to. i guess that eliminates any balance that might have occured due to the supposed &quot;superior endurance pool&quot;<br />
<br />
(insert EQ live warrior/goblin story here)<br />
<br />
Wow, thats a nice ideal story.......but ideal never happens. Here are my renditions of what would really happen.<br />
<br />
1) A warrior is fighting a goblin the battle rages on and on and when the goblin is down to 10% life and is running. The warrior gets his exceptional parry and perfroms a stunning attack! no one cares because it was too little too late.<br />
<br />
2) A warrior is fighting a BoT giant. Because its on a random seed, the exceptional parry never happens. Tuff luck warrior, kick him out for a paladin/SK who is guarenteed to get results.<br />
<br />
3) A warrior is fighting a BoT giant at the beginning of combat, he performs and excpional parry! He uses his stunning skill and misses because the giants are just too high level. The enchanter tashes the mob and takes agro. The enchanter dies 5 seconds later because he doesnt have the hps, even with Bot9/kazad, to withstand 2 double attacks in a row. But our warrior is a trooper he fights on and uses /disc defensive, granted we all know that defensive doesnt mitigate 50% damage and a non-elemental warrior would still be reamed by this giant, but our beastlord does indeed manage to land a slow on the giant. Five more times during the fight the warior gets an exceptional parry, but five more times he is ineffective and doesnt land a single effect(but endurance is taken away even though nothing happened...murpheys law). After the fight the enchanter gets his rez and is cursing about how that was his 3rd death today due to a warrior tank. The enchanter leaves to join his guildies who is tanking with a shadow knight. The group waits around for another 30 minutes waiting for a shaman or an enchatner to get on. None do, so the group disbands hating the warrior.<br />
<br />
If the changes that EQlive suggested were tot take place nothing will change. warriors still wont be able to give casters what they want...consistentcy. and even then no changes have been made, only an idea has been offered to the public, so claimming that pure melees have been given a &quot;mile&quot; is sheer ludicrous right now. only change and time will tell if SOE can/will fix the issue that warriors have right now. ideas dont hack it.<br />
<br />
The issue as i see it is that warriors are a wild card. They are completely based off the random number seed. <br />
<br />
1) hitting and missing is random - granted this is for all melees, but only the warrior was designed to hold agro with being able to hit the monster in mind. Sometimes i hit and both dualwield and double attack will proc 3 times before the enchanter is done casting his spell and on those times i hold agro. Other times I miss like its my job to miss(oh, wait). Ill hit the monster 2 times before the enchanter's spell goes off and i just think to myself &quot;damn, my enchanter is screwed&quot;<br />
<br />
2) taunt is random - its nice when it works. it would be nice to know if it did work. its bad for the group when it doesnt. paladins and shadow knights have guarenteed taunt......take them instead.<br />
<br />
i think thats all warriors do really. <br />
