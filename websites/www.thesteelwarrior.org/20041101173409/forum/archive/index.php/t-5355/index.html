<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my first Ele Mold last night(go me!)  Knew you couldn't put the 40 HP Solid Coal on it so was thinkin of doing the 20 HP/mana one from Guk.  Well shit, can't do that either.  So what should I try and get to put on the Gaunts?  Wait it out and try and get an HP aug to drop in an adv?  Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes. hp aug from adventures/ldon raids is the best for gauns bracers cause you cant put shit on them =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Figures.  That makes me sad (((</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bracers &amp; Gloves CAN NOT BE AUGMENTED with vendor items!<br />
<br />
Put +12 or +15hp stone froms adventures.<br />
Or all the +6 +7  charisma on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh yeah I actually considered CHA as an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since I've had no luck getting a +12hp augment from adventures I put a +10cha augment in my gloves. You can purchase one from Sro for around 350 points or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Browsing your magelo, I can think of some easy stop-gap augs to drop in the slot:<br />
<br />
Regen 2. Your regen's nowhere close to the cap right now, so, eh, it couldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
Vengance 4. Again, it wouldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
Enduring Breath. You don't have faerune yet.<br />
<br />
All of them would be about as useful as a 10 cha augment. <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soulflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CHA is a great aug in this slot ( +10 ), other option is a +5 FR / CR/ MR aug to help saves or you can throw in a +12 / +15 hp aug. Sadly,  Bracer and Hands are hard areas to Aug with Vendor Augs. More then likely to get good augs for them you will need LDoN raid level augs, but in the mean time, as people have pointed out, CHA is a good choice for the hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
I highly recomend, working some adventures and getting the +10 AC augs. Your AC is very low and the times have changed where AC is king again. A few hundred hitpoints is nothing compared to damage spikes or constant hits for max damage. AC augs wont kill you in points since they are only 510 pts each.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also consider that you are in Plane of Water alot, you might want enduring breath. There is a aug on the guk vendor fro 510 pts, that will grant you enduring breath. This would be a ideal aug for you crstalized acid bracer. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, grats on a Ele piece and I am sure you will see more as time goes on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">doesnt the 10ac aug go in bracers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You cant use that on any external armor slots its neck, face, shoulders, back and waiste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">humm +10 to any stat or +10 to any resist fit in gaunts bracers.<br />
<br />
but yep looking at regen 3 or ven 4 eb and the like or +15 hp from adv. since you dont need str sta whatnot. unless you want to go ft focus or bard augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">AoB from EC not bad choice either, helps regen and attack..</div></div><hr />
