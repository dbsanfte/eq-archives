<br />
Just curious, not sure that their is a point to the question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe low hp aggro is based off of a percentage, from everything I've seen. So yes, a warrior could in theory have enough hp to stay not only berserked, but always tanking due to low hp aggro. It'd be unsafe in basically all zones, naturally, but it would get safer the more hp you had compared to the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">06-13-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he means if you put on your gear after a rez (and mabey a heal) can you get agro from low hp agro because your % hp will go down as your max hp goes up when you put your gear on.<br />
<br />
The answer is yes, more so if your rezed and then gear up than if you get a heal after the rez but before gearing up.</div></div><hr />

  Me neither. Never even occured to me to interpret your post as that.</div></div><hr />

I see enchanters get lowhp aggro at 35%, and I can lose aggro at 30%</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone ever confirm this? It seems to me that it is a certain % based on relitive agro levels between you to the highest person that gives a chance to get LHA. Just tonight I am sure I was not summoned at 2% and was another time at 30-35%.<br />
<br />
Either way as Raaj and Fitemore said I dont think it is a real problem or even one I have witnessed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">percentage based<br />
<br />
And low HP aggro just an aggro modifier on your aggro value ( add some mega taunt I believe )<br />
You will be able to keep aggro even other gets low hp if your current aggro value can cover it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Low HP is % based.  Also when you just get rezzed, you're not on the mob's hate list, even if it's hitting you with AEs, it's actually not aware of you just yet so what HP you are at doesn't really matter.  Of course if you go back and hit the mob while just rezzed it will notice you as soon as your HP drops to low enough to be low hp aggro.<br />
<br />
And as the above post said, low hp aggro just adds a very large value, somewhere around 10000 by my estimation, and it is still subject to normal aggro rules.  For example, if two people are low hp aggro, then the person with more aggro before low HP aggro will get the aggro.</div></div><hr />

Putting on gear with +sta which gives hp does not. This was always the case, and I haven't checked in ages, has this been changed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Low health aggro occurs EXACTLY at 25% HP.<br />
<br />
Phantron's estimate of 10,000 aggro sounds in right, but I have not parsed it, but as a ballpark number is as good as it gets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">25% exactly?  Are you guys sure?  Has anybody done conclusive testing, or is everyone just going by eyeballing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm inclined to agree with phantron that the number is fixed, but HUGE. I spent a few hours getting bitch-slapped in tipt yesterday, and on one occasion the cleric got hit and ended up at 10% hp. I pounded taunt and incite to no avail, obviously, but when I smashed aetaunt I got aggro back instantly. Made for a lucky save since we had no backup rez :)<br />
<br />
Previously I would have thought it was impossible to overcome low hp aggro in any way.<br />
<br />
I guess that makes a case for no hate-cap on aetaunt, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm...so regular taunt has a hate cap?  I was told that it does not, that it only puts you to the top of the &quot;pure aggro&quot; part of hate, and not the other part that involves distance, sit/stand, who aggroed first, etc.<br />
<br />
Are you sure the cleric didn't just get a heal at the same rough time you hit AETaunt?  I'd believe that more...</div></div><hr />

There WAS a shaman in the group spamming, but at least on my screen I had aggro (via HoTT) for several seconds while he was at 10% hp.<br />
<br />
My experience with regular taunt is that it is capped. I've heard 500 as the max hate per taunt somewhere... How else do explain no taunt fail message but not getting aggro? Have a shammy or necro just PILE on the aggro sometime, and see how many successful taunts it will take to get aggro back. Or try to take aggro from a stunning pally :)</div></div><hr />

If they have unnatural aggro, via being the puller, or the first to damage the mob, or are sitting, or are too close to the mob (or you're too far away), this can happen.  There were taunt tests a while back that suggested Aggro is built up into two parts: Initial Aggro and modifications, and Pure Aggro (via spells, melee, procs).  Taunt only checks one of them, so if someone else has a lot of aggro via pulling the mob with a damage spell or something, it will not be taunted.<br />
<br />

Both of these scenarios involve &quot;aggro dotting&quot;.  Casting a dot on a mob will continually add aggro -- and a taunt alone will NEVER take care of it.  Chances are, you're taunting, getting aggro, then losing it immediately next tick when the dot damage is factored in.  Paladins who are stunning, likewise, will undoubtedly get another stun in after your taunt and steal aggro back.<br />
<br />
All taunt does is put you at Whoever_Has_Highest_Aggro + Small_Number, and makes it REAL easy to have your aggro stolen back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daabu:<br />
<br />
I don't know much about puller aggro etc. I do concur that it's not the same as straight up dps / procs / dot / debuff aggro. I sure as hell have a time of it getting aggro off the dumbass ranger who pulls with snare.<br />
<br />
Using HoTT, if I were actually getting aggro, I should see the mob switch to me at least until the next tick or the pally stuns next, right? I'll try play with this a little more soon. Most of the behavior I see on a regular basis is pretty consistent with taunt being capped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, bardeil, not if the mob is currently stunned.  HoTT doesnt update unless the mob is in offensive mode.  Stuns, mes, casting spells will not show aggro updates immediately.</div></div><hr />

How long have you been playing a warrior? I bet you also spam hit the taunt button when tanking, even tho you have aggro, so you can have more aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daabu: Ok I realize if the mob is actually stunned, mezzed, casting etc it's target won't update. I stand by my assertion about the taunt cap atm tho, do you have evidence it's otherwise? Can you taunt aggro off your MA if he stops producing it if you've been using no aggro weapons with 1 successfull taunt? <br />
<br />
I will go back and look at the logs for that fight and see if I got a taunt failure or not. If nothing else, it seems as if the &quot;cap&quot; may contribute to taunt failures. My percentage of fails is much higher on a mezzed, debuffed mob than it is when I just lose snap aggro to somebody due to a stun, slow or nuke.<br />
<br />
Romul: What the hell kind of a question is that? Are you adding anything useful to the discussion? I didn't think so. Crawl back in your hole or contribute something useful. No I don't spam taunt, and I've been playing a warrior for over a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you all get low HP agro just by gearing up?<br />
<br />
Just curious, not sure that their is a point to the question.<br />
<br />
And no you can't get low HP aggro by just gearing up, usually.  My warrior's naked HP is like 3700ish, after res, i sit at 33%, which is like 1250ish, after I put my gear on w/o heal, i sit around 50 - 60%ish, not sure on exact value but it goes up, not down cuz of raw hp, unless of course all you have is massive sta and low raw hp gear, then it could happen.</div></div><hr />

The results were somewhat inconclusive but to my reading by no means eliminated the possibility of a taunt hate cap. They did quite handily show that mashing taunt doesn't do anybody any good, however. Perhaps the taunt discussion should be in another thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only time that I've noticed a taunt being sucessful and mobs not turning on me, was if I was never on the mob's aggro list, and I try to taunt off another while not on the list.  But if taunt had any kind of cap, to the point where it takes multiple sucesses to fully taunt, and yet its not been noticed by most warriors, is obsurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had successful tuants not turn the mob to me a number of times, but it doesn't have anything to do with tuant not working I'm sure.  It has to do with the other people beating on the mob and the slow moving EQ update packets.  Tuant only puts you 1 point ahead of the top person on the list.  That person's very next cleave puts them right back ahead of you if your melee isn't outdoing their melee.  Since EQ doesn't send you packet updates every few milliseconds like a game of Quake does, you don't always get to see that the mob spun to you, then spun back to the other guy quickly.  You just see the illusion of him facing the other guy through the whole ordeal.<br />
<br />
That's where incite comes in.  To give you an actual lead on the hate list above the person that was previously at the top of the list, once you get there yourself with a successful tuant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't read the whole thread but low health aggro is definitely percentage based.  There's a cleric trick if you're DA'd with low health aggro you can click off all your hp buffs and get out of low health aggro range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, now I read the whole thread, and I consider the linked thread pretty conclusive.  I would say low health aggro is a &quot;bonus&quot; just like sitting or being the puller, but much larger, so while it is possible to taunt off of a low health aggro person, it's not likely that you could get a successful taunt and then get enough hate on top of that to get aggro before the low health person either dies, DA's, or gets a heal.  I have definitely seen clerics DA with low health aggro but not get hit when DA wore, so I believe in the 18 seconds of DA the tank was able to build enough aggro to overcome the low health bonus.<br />
<br />
There was a test (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6949) not too long ago that suggested that some changes might have been made to taunt to make it add more hate per press, but there is no doubt in my mind that a successful taunt can overcome any amount of aggro.  The DoT thing is true, but that has already been explained in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A successful taunt won't get low HP aggro off.  I have tried AE taunt enough times to know it doesn't work.  The modifier is temporary so you get whoever is highest (probably yourself) + 1, and then it compare that against the low HP aggro person + ~10000 and hits the low HP aggro.<br />
<br />
It's like how a successful taunt on a mezzed mob doesn't stop the mob from hitting an enchanter if they're sitting down, because you get Enchanter + 1 aggro, but the enchanter is higher because he has his aggro + sitting aggro, which is temporary.  <br />
<br />
Now, if you somehow had about 10000 more than the person low HP aggro, you could get it off him, but it's pretty unlikely in most situations.  A bunch of friends was trying to AE Fire and they say that eventually the mobs kill the nukers instead of chasing the low HP person since the nukers pile up enough hate over the low HP aggro person.</div></div><hr />
