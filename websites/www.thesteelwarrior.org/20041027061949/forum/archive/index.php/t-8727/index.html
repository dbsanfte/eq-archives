  I am trying to decided which proc to add to my BoC,  I am leaning towards the anger 3 or the 125 DD yak proc with a zero sec stun, but am unable to decide.  In my offhand I used a GBoS with an anger 3.   Just looking for suggestions from fellow warrs.  Without any proc aggro really isnt hard to keep, but a little extra never hurts.<br />

Thanks <br />
<br />
:cool:<br />
<br />
also my magelo as a second thought <br />

<br />
You've got a lot of pure anger already happening with the BoC and anger3 on GBoS. You might as well go for the extra minimal amount of DPS (not that 125 pts will matter to the mobs you're smacking around, I suspect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Move anger 3 to BoC.  Get another anger 2 aug for 510 pts instead of the 760 ykesha aug to put into the GboS.  Hate is nearly the same for Ykesha/Anger 2 and the 125 pt isnt that big of a deal in an offhand weapon.  That is unless you are ripping through hards in 30 min at which you could just suck it up and do 3 hards.<br />
<br />
Either way I would put the Anger 3 in the mainhand weap</div></div><hr />

I looked at it this way (I thought about the exact same thing)..<br />
<br />
BoC - yeah, it is an ok DPS weapon, but you can get a 17/20 from LDON easy enough.  BoC's proc is a pure hate proc which means it is solely for keeping aggro.<br />
<br />
Is the ykesha aug an aggro dealer?  Sure it is, it also adds some damage (figure 2 procs per minute so 250 extra dmg tops (without crits) so maybe 4.2 extra dps).<br />
<br />
Most folks agreed (way back before anger augs changed) that ykesha aug is similar to anger2.  Anger3 is definately more aggro.<br />
<br />
Assuming we agree with this then do you want 4.2dps (ykesha) more or 6.7 hate/sec(anger3) more?  (200 more hate a proc, 2ppm so 400hate / 60 seconds).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that 4.2dps most likely does not equate to 4.2hate/sec.  Also, why take a weapon which really is only meant for aggro generation and try to turn it into a DPS weapon?  If you intend to mainhand it and want to keep aggro, then I'd go for the Anger3 aug as it is unresistable hate added ontop of what it already generates.  If you're there to keep a mob glued on you, then DPS is irrelevant, the more hate you generate the harder the rest of the folks can hack/slash/nuke the mob and not worry about taking aggro.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you're only in one group situations and not raiding, in which case I'd say sell the BoC and mainhand your GBoS w/ykesha aug and offhand a copper hammer of striking w/some DD aug and you'll keep decent aggro while dishing some ok DPS.  You could also get your 2hander AAs and go that route if you can get a decent 2hander.</div></div><hr />

     Looks like I'll tag another anger 3 on the BoC I have more than enough LDON points so that is not an issue.<br />

I have a few 2Hndrs and almost all offensive AA's, still needing WA5 and SS.(all as far as 2HRs are concerned)  Grouping I almost always use my ornate greatblade, rarely greatstaff of the 4winds.<br />
<br />
Far as selling the BoC there is no need for PP at all.  Also since my guild is in EP and there us really nothing else I want that PP can buy.<br />
