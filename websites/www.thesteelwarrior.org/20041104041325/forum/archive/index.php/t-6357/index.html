<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately this little silk wearing pansy enchanter in my guild has been talking some yang about how bad ass he is, and how he's gonna whip my arse with his 500 DPS pets, blah blah blah. Of course were sitting in CoDb waiting for the rest of the guild to get there and I /d him, and he won't accept since it's not under his ideal conditions. So basically I just need  to know if there's any items with clicky annul or cancel magic that a warrior can use, items with charges are fine too I'm just gonna use it once to pwn this little punk once. I already have some dot potions so mez shouldn't be a huge issue, I just wanna see him one rounded by his own &quot;uber dps&quot; pet and my day will be complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A few on this list (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemswitheffect.html?id=49), no insta-clickies though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey thanks looks like it's Crystallized Pumice (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14524)  for teh win. Only 15pp from vendor in PoK, insta click would be nice to wipe his little runes off really quick but this should do the job. I feel like such a newb for not knowing they sold these at potion merchants lol. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen a duel where a paladin dispelled the enchanter pet and then just started dispelling enchanter buffs off him. Killed the enchanter rather quickly, and the Paladin never had to do anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah that's what I plan on doing, dispelling, then sitting back an laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fruitpie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok... as a guy who has a chanter main and a warrior alt I have to tell ya, if he can't beat a warrior not using pets he needs to get a life.  Here is the way, Rapture a lvl 59 mez is unresistable.  An unresistable spell plus the chance to stick root on a warrior who sucks from a distance will own you out loud EVERY time.  He should open up with it, then debuff the hell out of you, then wait for rapture to cycle, then cancel magic, then rapture and wait for it to cycle again, when it does he should root, nuke, mez from a distance he can get it off long before you run to him then back up and mez kite you.  It may take a long time but Enchanter &gt; Warrior in a duel unless the chanter does something stupid like, charm a pet, not have rapture up, sticks a dot on you, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds pretty easy in theory,  but when i'm dispelling him at the same rate, and he's down to 2500 little hp's and no runes if I get withing melee range and use fellstrike on him with a 2 hander it's all over. And self dotting can negate mezzes fairly easy. And chanter nuke does what 800 DMG on PVP? If he can get off 7-8 nukes at full force while mezzing, rooting, etc and still have mana than well, he deserves to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Das_bert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I played a Chanter for 3 years before I started my warrior, then started a warrior, I enjoy the warrior alot more than the chanter,  I know alot more about chanters than warriors but if the warrior has over 200 MR without buffs, Chanters will lose because they run out of mana.  since the only spell that is not magic based is Tash line.  The roots, and nukes will be resisted ALOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">and if he does get rooted or tashed, he can just pumice himself to drop them.</div></div><hr />

Mezz and Chanters have rapture, and in a PvP there is no LV restriction, now if the chanter beging to dispell you i would suggest using another dot as bliss will be inc shortly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Im a Six Boxor on SZ. When I PvE I have a warrior, 3 wizards, a chanter and a cleric.<br />

When I PvP I log the warrior and bring in another wizard.<br />

Get a Crimson Potion to stop rapture, which is unresistable at any level in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>renasu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Enchanter vs warrior fights can be one of the most interesting.  The chanter definately has the advantages, but you can even it a bit if you plan ahead and have the right environment.  <br />
<br />
The fight can go pretty bad though.  If you get mezzed, then you may find yourself tashed, slowed, rooted, and being pounded by a fast hitting pet.  Since we have zero channelling skill you wont be able to pumice anything off.  So to have a chance, you need to be on the offensive as much as you can.<br />
<br />
You must break the initial rapture by having a dot on you BEFORE you are mezzed.  The crimson potion can work as can our Warlord's Tenacity dot.  Once free, pumice, pumice, pumice (him) in hopes of bringing down his rune.  When he tries to recast it, hit him hard and bash/kick to interrupt.  If he gets rune back up, pumice immeditately.  Try to repeat this process as every real hit is important.   You may want to stop and redot yourself, but its a hard choice to make during the chase.<br />
<br />
A few other tricks:<br />
- If you cant pumice self due to a pet, use the fortitude disk.<br />
- There are insta click items, like forlorn sceptre, that can snare or root.  These dont work on a player with decent resists, but do work well on pets.<br />
- Don't underestimate how many pumice stones you may need.  Don't get two, get a dozen.<br />
- Most of our killing power comes from when we are beserk plus the Might strike disc.  If you get rooted/pet, you may want to let him get your down to beserk until you fortitute/pumice free then surpise him by stunning then killing him in 3 attacks.  <br />
<br />
I'm not mentioning the tactic of uncharming his pet, since I dont ever do that and he may not even use a charmed pet.  But that may be the way to go though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just an update, the chanter got owned hardcore. Started off he dispelled my dot and raptured me. Went and get his uber 550 DPS pet he keeps bragging yo me about. Sticks me with a nuke, then sends in pet, I took a good amount of damgage, maybe 2500 before I dispelled the charm and I was all over.</div></div><hr />
