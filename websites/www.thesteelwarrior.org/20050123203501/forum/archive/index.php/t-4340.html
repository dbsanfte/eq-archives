<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fieldweeble</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got LDoN the other day, and have only been on a couple adventures, so I've got some questions. First, I notice that my mistmoore catacombs adventure points are useless on adventure merchants other than the ones in butcher. <br />
<br />
Is there any gear other than the ridiculous 1-6 AP charms that works with any APs?<br />
<br />
Should I be doing a specific adventure type, being a warrior? If so, what should I save for at 49?<br />
<br />
Answers are appriciated :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The points you earn in any adventure go into a pool where you can buy gear that you have already unlocked. The points you earn in any specific theam will unlock items from those merchants. <br />
<br />
Because you have not unlocked anything from other theams, you can't spend your pool points in other theams.<br />
<br />
I would recomend working on Everfrost (for the Anger 3 proc at 1150 points) or NRO for the 1492 plate. Both of them will be very long hauls and geting the points you earn at your level (I suspect no more than 20, compaired to the 51 at 65) that until you getting closer to max points, it hardly matters where you earn them.<br />
<br />
My 32 SK has about 17 wins for all of 22 points.</div></div><hr />

I suppose I'll start on everfrost some time</div></div><hr />
