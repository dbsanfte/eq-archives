<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dravok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been away from Everquest for about a year and I am ready to start back into it now that I am settled in my house.  I use to play a SK but I don't have that account anymore.  I wish to get back into it with a tank class and a dps class.  I've decided to go rogue with my DPS class but haven't decided with either warrior or a new SK for a tank class.  I liked playing my SK but enjoyed the melee aspect of him more than I did the casting part.  I was wondering what changes have taken place for melees since I have left.  I'm sorry if this is been talk about to death and is in numerous topics but I thought someone could answer me or even link the discussion in a previous topic.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dunno about that. The reason I stuck with warrior way back when was, it wasn't that hard to get going. My mage on the other hand got stuck on that hell level known as 7. There's much more readily available and horribly cheap weapons and armor to get him started, too. Not to mention the noob quest armor.<br />
<br />
As for changes, probably the biggest one is the new combat abilities, such as the provoke line and the innate damage reduction.</div></div><hr />

then roll a warrior, if you don't use a knight's spellbook to its full power then you will neither be a good tank neither a good knight.<br />
<br />
the only drawback a see in your plan is that you will have no healing rescue at all with two pure melee. so normally a rogue would be better paired with a knight rather than a warrior. but if you can exchange or add a healer it would go smooth with a war. for example if you make an exchange you have the beastlord (good dps +small buff including haste +small heal), the shaman (good dps via DoT, but lesser than a bst, +powerfull buff and debuff including haste/slow and good heal for a duo), druid (little nuke +DS +port +strong heal +snare).</div></div><hr />
