I am trying to finish up my Epic and need the Red Dragon Scales. And is he the easiest to do? Is there an easier Mob that drops the Red Dragon Scales?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ragefire drops em.. find a buddy that is doing his cleric epic and let him know you're in the need of these..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't been to the Hole since the revamp but Nortlev USED to be at/near the bottom of the ramp to Master Yael's room.  Dunno if he's even there anymore.<br />
<br />
If he still is he's really not to hard.  Just like VS, chain rune your tank to prevent the big lifetaps and make make sure no one else draws agro.  If he cant lifetap, you win!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He now stands on the shore of the lake in Yael's room (now the Guardian of the Seal's room).  If you jump into the hole from just inside Paineel near Tox, you'll land about 10 feet from Nortlav (and go splat if all you're doing is jumping).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah you can kill him right in front of the new guys and no assist too, so bang bang kill!<br />
<br />
No agro at all down there so Have a cleric hit Divine Aura and jump in, then let everyone else splat and Rez em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Havent seen a red scale off a ragefire kill since about 2 weeks after they made him spawnable.  Only get that shite orange armour now.<br />
<br />
I'd say Talendor is probably the easiest source of red scales out there cos its not too hard to muster the troops to head to SF and kill a dragon, while getting your guild to the bottom of the hole can be a different story.  Ofcourse he tends to die alot quicker because of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting to the bottom of the Hole = PoK, Paineel Book, Zone over (50 steps away) Stop one second to DA, Jump in. Rez and Buff 5-10 minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just out of curiosity.  Would it not be easier to levitate down rather than fall and splat then rez everyone? or am I missing something?  <br />
<br />
Haven't been there myself so this may be a very stupid question...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorag</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I understand, No levitate in the Hole allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This may sound kinda stupid, but why kill everyone.  Could you not just kill a CoH mage and a cleric or something?  Sorry it just sounded like a more reasonable approach to me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">jumping is fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venz</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think if you hit the pool right you can survive...maybe im wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It centers you over the middle at the beginning.<br />
<br />
And yes, Jumping and going splat is both fun and funny, but yes, a couple mages could fire through a bunch of people pretty quickly too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can take a bard and have them do their group DA.  I'm not sure you can DA before you zone though, I thought you had to cast it after zoning or it would get stripped, but I haven't tried it.  <br />
<br />
You can also /q right before you hit bottom and when you come back from LD you will fall from the spot you /q'd at, which is pretty painless if you time it right.  I imagine this would be considered an exploit though.<br />
<br />
Also, it takes probably half an hour tops to just clear down to him with 1 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done the bard DA jump several times.  It's quite fun.  You have to be sure to move off to the side a bit as soon as you zone.  For some reason, if you &quot;stack up&quot; a bit, and one person is &quot;on top&quot; of another when the DA wears off, you end up taking the full fall damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard DA and Mage CoH down to him is the easiest way down, if there's no KoS mobs there anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you still have to get a spiroc wingblade from sky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got it already fortunately a while back,thanks to a raid that lasted eight hours do to Sirran always spawning way up high in the air and had to have a GM come like 3 times(how my GL got ahold of one Ill never know).Major thanks to the people who stayed up that late to get 3 spiroc blades for us &quot;needy&quot; warriors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm.Anyone know exactly how hard he is to kill?Allakhazam posts sounded like a lot of BS as usual.Could a solid one Eles geared grp take him out with chanter chain runing tank?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">jumping anywhere through EQ is fun...especially when you shank yourself on one of the chains in the old Plane of Air on the way down :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Echo of Nortav (sp) is down by the Gaurdian of the Seal. My wife and I , a druid fought down to him the other night and killed him.<br />
<br />
His melee is laughable but his LT proc is still a major pain.<br />
<br />
I would recommend bringing someone to do your DPS because at the rate he procs his LT your dps is utterly cancelled out. My wife nuked him as she healed me but it was still a pain.<br />
<br />
The stone wards outside the stone door respawn VERY fast and Echo will try to run so snare him.<br />
<br />
Dropped the scale and a sword that is Eru SK only with a clickable 10attack buff. <br />
<br />
Not a hard fight but more of a challenge than you would think, go evasive and get MR if you can, I resisted about 3/4 of his lifetaps. I can see how he would be a huge pain if you didnt.</div></div><hr />
