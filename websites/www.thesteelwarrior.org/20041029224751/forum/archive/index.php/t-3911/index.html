<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draynor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  I recently have brought my old, crusty warrior out of retirement and have a few questions on weapons.<br />
<br />
First, some background.  My warrior made it to level 53 roughly Velious era, before I put him aside.  His armor consisted mainly of Hate (Indicolite) and some PoG (Berserker's) pieces.  Needless to say, that stuff doesn't hold water anymore.  His weapons were also of Kunark/Velious era (2hs = Culler 31/37 dmg/dly and Defiance + Shimmering Partisan for 1hs combo).<br />
<br />
I went and had a guild smith help me craft Underfoot, which I am currently completing (got some big pieces like BP, etc.. already).  I think that was a good way to go since the BP only cost me 2k and the other pieces less (I also supplied BDs for the crafting).  Other items I purchased in the bazaar using AC as the main search parameter.   I've gotten his raw AC up to 1100+ w/out buffs.  His HP sits at 2500 unbuffed (remember, level 53).<br />
<br />
My focus for Draynor will be LDoN questing right now, since it yields the best XP for time spent and tanking PoP mobs isn't something I was looking forward to until his gear was better.<br />
<br />
My main question is.. is Underfoot sufficient for me now, and what would a &quot;cheap&quot; combo be for 1hs.  His current 2hs weapon is a Widebladed Greatsword (35/35 and stats and 25 AC to boot - yeah it's a pally weapon, but it was cheap).  My goal is to buy a Copper Hammer of Striking for the stun proc (I also have NO clickie or proc weapons other than the old Ykesha's - yes the ORIGINAL Yaks ;)<br />
<br />
What he uses now for 1hs is Naraithus (Veksar drop, 13/22 piercer I believe, for secondary), and Defiance in primary (9/19).  He also still uses the old, crusty frenzy sash from LGuk.  The RBG run about 7k and Soulscream Belts are 12k on Hammer.  That's a bit out of range right now (I have two 60+ characters to support as well).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be great.  I used to use slow, high damage offhanders because I recall the delay not being calculated on the offhand weapon.. Is it still this way or does dmg/delay make a difference for BOTH.  Of course it always has for primaries..<br />
<br />
I will edit this later with a Magelo link (can't hit Magelo from work, it's blocked heh).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depending on your server you should be able to pick up a frostbringer pretty cheap.  its a decent aggro weapon until you can get a CHoS and SoTB.<br />
<br />
Everyone on here pimps the greatstaff of Thunder, and let me tell you- they are right, its simply the very best avlue for the money (I see them generally for 300 plat).  However, it might have a level requirment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;Everyone on here pimps the greatstaff of Thunder,&quot;<br />
<br />
Has a req level of 55 though don't it?<br />
<br />
If so, he's still got 2 levels to go.<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking and/or Sword of the Bloodsworn and/or Frostbringer are nice aggro weapons. And they get better when you add in a hate proc augment like Ykesha or Anger, since you said you wanted to focus a lot on LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I strongly advise you to read up on the condition of the Warrior class before you start investing in gear and time.  I can tell you, this is the saddest state of affairs ever of Warriors in this game and it gets worse by the minute.  <br />
<br />
If I was in your position I'd move/sell gear and invest time/gear into the classes at the top of the food chain now.  Knights, Bards being top choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GSoT has required level of 54 iirc. Get one, you won't regret it.  Although if you're like some of us you may regret dumping your savings on it before the bottom fell out of the price. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can pick one up for around 100pp if you get lucky; either way you won't spend much. It's an awesome agro weapon, definitely get one. Required lvl 55, recommended 56, so I'd imagine at 55 you'd get 30/30 ratio instead of the full 31/30, but the stun proc should go off at 55 regardless.<br />
<br />
Like Darkoan said, if you can get cheap cultural go for it, but think about whether you want to play a warrior right now before you make any real investments into gear. The class is in really sad state at the moment, with no hope on the horizon. SOE's been working on stuff starting all newbies off with 200 in sense heading lately, to give you an idea of where fixing warrior problems is on their priorities list :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draynor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wanted to thank everyone for the responses here.. I hadn't checked back in a week.<br />
<br />
I did try to play my warrior a few days ago.. I found it less exciting and a bit unnerving.  I wasn't able to hold aggro on mobs after a shaman landed slow, or a druid nuked/snared.  I spent most of the time chasing mobs around as they aggro'd on other group members.<br />
<br />
Also.. the 2h weapon i'm using missed 3 out of 6 or 7 swings, and hit for numbers LOWER than the damage of the weapon.  I still believe that 2H skill is broken.  No warrior with maxed skill should miss 50% of his swings, or hit for such a pansy amount that he might as well not be hitting at all.<br />
<br />
I have been very excited about playing him again.. but all this incident did was lead me to thoughts about creating a (gulp) paladin.  I have always been a proud warrior, even a bit of a role player, since I have always used a warrior in any fantasy/RPG game.. but EQ warriors are broken.  They might as well take away our ability to hold weapons, as we are only fit to soak damage and nothing more..<br />
<br />
I see now that warriors (and only uber-geared ones) are simply raid tanks.. not grouping characters and never a solo class..<br />
<br />
Thanks again for any suggestions/comments..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i just moved servers - picked up a GSoT for 100 pp. rofl. bought mine originally for 40kpp.<br />
<br />
if you can get up to the usable level, its by far the best bang for your buck - as opposed to shelling out 20kpp on the CHoS &amp; SoTB combo.<br />
<br />
anyway, with the current weapons available to warriors - including cheap GSoTs, exping is not really a problem, unless you ahve a real bunch of idiots. i cant say ive ever had real difficulties finding exp group or adventure groups, so just stick it out and youll see the rewards.<br />
<br />
btw - if you think your 2hs damage with your warrior sucks, wait till you see what pallys do with the same weps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup Draynor, at your level with your gear I'd totally recommend rolling up a Knight.  We've seen no assurance that we'll get any boost from SOE.  The game is too far along now for a major overhaul.  With Knights having mid 90s of our HP and upper 90s of our AC, why not play one?</div></div><hr />
