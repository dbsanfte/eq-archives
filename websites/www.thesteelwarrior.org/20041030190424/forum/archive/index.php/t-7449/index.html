<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, here is magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=942461), i currently have 1400 ldon points, but still 200 or so away from 1492 in Nro.  I have LR 4, working on 5.  The LDoN group i group with 75% of the time is with my friends... i 2-box the cleric, friend 2-boxes ench/mage, and another friend plays his bard, and we get a random DPS to join us.  So i feel that i need to have a little more than what is necessary just incase of error(although i have been told i 2-box seamlessly, and i am confident in my ability)  Friend also 2-boxes pretty well, and we are getting bored of regular difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
With my 1400 points, i am still not sure if i want boots(since i might be able to get the Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44291)) or bracers(Which i could get the Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44289))<br />
<br />
Basically, I think i am getting close to being able to tank hard, but what AA(After ID5) and Equip should i be looking forward to?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: To clarify, I have LR 4, working on LR5.  I will work on ID5 next =)  The way i said it was quite confusing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scruppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get LR5 and then build Arms, bracers, legs or boots from ldon. Those seem to be your weakest slots(especially the boots). If you try hard Ldon in Butcherblock and can successfully do it or are close to being able to do it you could just wait till Bloodied boots, but right now your boots are your weakest slot.<br />
<br />
LR5 will make a huge difference, get that asap after you finish ID, or even before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you look kinda set, i would suggest run a few hards at first just to killed named and not worry about winning. if no named up try to win, and get used to healing yourself with the heavy hitters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can 3box hard ldon's for experience. I don't try to win(no way in hell I could). I have to agree with Mokor, getting use to healing yourself is the hardest part. I usually run 10k buffed or so; still a bit troublesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if your cleric bot has a deep mana pool and nice regen you will be fine .. otherwise you will run them oom without your defensive aa's and without 8k+<br />
<br />
try starting the cheals on incoming .. then start all cheals at 70-75% after it is slowed.  you will get several inefficient heals like that ... but it beats the hell out of chain spam healing to catch up from a misjudged heal time.<br />
<br />
key to hard ldon is a talented healer, talented puller, and a tank who non-tissuepaper tank (ie .. you need to have around 8khps at least imo).<br />
<br />
even with the best healers and pullers/slowers ... hard ldon is a bitch if you take someone in there with less than 8k hps who doesnt have all defensive aas and decent ac.  even a knight for snap aggro will get torn to shreds by the dmg spikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did one today, I was starting CH's at 50% with around 10.2k hp. Lets just say I am glad I can crit heal.... Otherwise I would have to heal again after CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">By the way, as a short term upgrade you could also pick up a Rock-molded Wristguard for one wrist.  I just got one on Emarr for 12k.</div></div><hr />
