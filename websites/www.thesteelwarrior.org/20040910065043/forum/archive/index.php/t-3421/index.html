I posted something on the item &quot;Ancient Gladius&quot; similar to what im going to say now. Maybe the zone items havint all been posted yet but right now this place looks great for almost any class but WARRIORS! Why even bother going there? All the gear that would be GREAT for a warrior is for a Paladin/Shadowknight. Those two classes can already surpass warriors in AC and in HP these days and this zone isnt helping one bit. Why should i even bother making a Warrior now if i can make a SK who is as strong as a Warrior tankwise but has the ability to cast spells also? Verant says they wanna make a balanced range of classes, then they make a zone like this. it used to be one of the main attractions of a warrior was his/her ability to use almost ANY weapon or ANY armor in the game, now its obvous thats a bunch a hogwash and Verant is now slowly changing the balance away from warriors. <br />

Graywar, <br />

I do agree that SoL has a high concentration of Pal/SK items, but you need to understand that these have been classes that Verant has for a long time neglected. <br />
<br />
Now moving on to you other point. You trying to say that hybrid friendly zones like the deep are ruining the importance of warriors is insane. Yes, knight classes can generally achieve AC much easier than a warrior, but I would not say the same regarding hp. Warriors are still the cream of the crop. And as far as tanking, especially raid tanking, warlords (60 warriors) still remain and ALWAYS will remain as the clear favorite due to the defensive ability their class gets. <br />
<br />
I just can't see any validity in your post. Take care. <br />
<br />
P.S. Although light on the named spawns, Deep is still a great zone for 1 group xp or high end raiding. <br />

Thought it was kinda funny.</div></div><hr />
