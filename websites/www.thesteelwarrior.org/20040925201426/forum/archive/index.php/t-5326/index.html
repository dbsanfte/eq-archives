<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i dont ususalt ask these &quot;what am i going to do&quot; thread starters, but i actually got into a bit of a bind and i need some info. i'm applying to a guild that, until GoD is out, is only really hitting EP gods and time, and i despertly need to know what my options are for armor upgrades. what 2h weapons are there that would be usable for tanking. from most of the other post i see here, the main options everyone considers is BoW or SEWS. also, are their any mobs that drop elemental molds that might get killed otw to an EP god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The three named mobs in the Corinav ring all have a chance to drop elemental bracers. If your guild is planning to do Arbitor as a back-flag, they'll need to hit up the PoE rings that drop loot (the vine ring drops plate bracers relatively often). The mobs in the FEnnin Ro cycle have a very small chance of dropping loot as well. The only choice you really have for 2-handers if you don't manage to get SEWS or BoW is to get a Plankton Greatsword from PoWater named. They're pretty much one groupable. The greatsword is 75/65 with stats and 125hp, I dont' believe it has any procs. It's not really much for agro either unless you aug it with Anger III.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vanazir maybe?<br />
<br />
Could try to pick up plate greaves from Phase 3 as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since you are just apping, I would assume that chances are pretty good you won't have first choice in drops for the most part. The good news is that chances are also pretty good that there are some nice items that are likely to be rotting if the guild you are apping to has been in Time for long. I won't recommend any god loots from the EPs because that stuff is still pretty good and likely to be snatched up by regular guild members. Obviously, try for any Raex's that you can get your hands on. The only real clearing that might result in armor drops are on the way to the Rathe and the 3 minis in Coirnav.<br />
<br />
As for the Time drops, there are actually quite a few options. Tier 1-3 loot is still very good and usually rotting or going to apps unless the guild has recently broken in. Here's the short list -<br />
<br />
Tier 1 -<br />
Pulsing Emerald Hoop<br />
Ring of Force<br />
Smooth Onyx Torque<br />
<br />
Tier 2 -<br />
Cloak of Ferocity<br />
Cudgel of Wrecking<br />
Gauntlets of Disruption<br />
Girdle of Restoration<br />
Glowing Chains<br />
Hoop of the Enlightened<br />
<br />
Tier 3 -<br />
Cloak of Wishes<br />
Necklace of Celestial Energy<br />
Earring of Xaoth Kor<br />
Faceguard of Frenzy<br />
Fiery Crystal Guard<br />
Mask of Strategic Insight<br />
Timeless Coral Greatsword <br />
Ethereal Destroyer<br />
Elem legs<br />
<br />
You should be able to get quite a few of the above items. If you plan ahead, you could end up with at least 8 or 9 quality upgrades that will likely put you over 10khp buffed.</div></div><hr />
