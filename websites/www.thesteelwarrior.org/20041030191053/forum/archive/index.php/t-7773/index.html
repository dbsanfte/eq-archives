<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macenion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya Guys<br />
<br />
i know there are a gazillion and one of these threads, but after lurking here for the last couple of months and playing my warrior constantly lately i need some advice.<br />
<br />
Wep wise i feel fine, have no real problems with aggro is more HP/AC that i am worried about atm. <br />
<br />
After talking to a few time flagged warriors on Xev have decided to do CA/CS before i go on with the hp aa so mainly looking at gear upgrades at the moment.<br />
<br />
have a total of 50 ldon points after getting my boots so looking at idea's i can quest with guild(max 1 to 2 groups) or solo with 65 mage. only have about 8k left in the bank as well<br />
<br />
first on the list is the loyalists shield for my back slot<br />
<br />
what else can you suggest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that the guild i am in is a family type with bare minimum of raiding and when we do raid somehow i have ended up as Guild MT heh. Most we have done lately is a  9 person raid going down and clearing the royals in chardok with only 1 death on the entire raid.<br />
<br />
PS;- yes i do have raid gear from when i was in Quiet Solitude but with rl rearing its ugly head that is no longer an option for me atm.  :( <br />
<br />
thanks in advance for ya help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest that you get rid of your &quot;Enchanted Sash of wonders&quot;. It has no good AC/HP for a Warrior. Sell it and buy a &quot;Heavy rubycite girdle&quot; instead if you can get one. If not, use the &quot;Putrid Belt of Rotten Hide&quot; you have in your inventory for now.<br />
Enchanted Sash of wonders: 8AC, 35HP<br />
Heavy rubycite girdle: 25AC, 85HP<br />
You can use tribute for haste. It doesn't cost much. You should get tribute HP/AC too.</div></div><hr />
