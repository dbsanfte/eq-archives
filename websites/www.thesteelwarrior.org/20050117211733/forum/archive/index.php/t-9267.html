Dye everything wimpy pink and you never have to think about fashion again.</div></div><hr />

I find this very lazy on the part of the devs. I still load up Velious textures because in my opinion, they look the best. I think it kind of took away the feeling of...OOOOoo look at that guy in full (Berserkers) he farmed POG a lot! You just can't get that awe inspiring feeling anymore. Now it's....Oooo look at the skittle colored warrior...he has no fashion sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sarcasm?<br />
<br />
Were you around in the days when you could tell who the REAL players were just because of how they looked?  <br />
<br />
Velious was the best expansion ever, simply for the armor textures.  A warrior wearing full Thurgadin with a custom crown was top dog for a long time, and that gradually faded to Myrmidon and later to Warlord blue.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, there's nothing in EQ that you can use to visually judge anyone on their proficiency of the game.  Level 65 means nothing.  Level 70 means nothing.  It could mean 0 AA's, it could mean 900.  Veteren could mean 18 AA's or 300.  Marshall could mean 42 or maxed. Black could be Kizraks or it could be Crustacean shell with a dye.  Nothing means shit.  That's not the game I started playing.<br />
<br />
I can't change the game, but I can stick to the way the game should be.  Dyes are bullshit, and so is lazy plate silver armor.  No armguards of repentance for me.  I've been gradually turning from red to black with my Kizrak's, and I'm not fucking it up by throwing in a gay silver piece.</div></div><hr />

You know what forever ruined my views of the armor system?  When the new Luclin models were released and all of a sudden the absolutely kickin' SkyShrine Guardian armor that I had looked pretty much like the armor every other woodelf was wearing...</div></div><hr />

That's one of the things I was pretty happy about. Personal style and preference came into play, as opposed to ego toting and appropriate gawkers. By all accounts and purposes people shouldn't be able to tell where you are in the game or what you've accomplished just by looking at you.</div></div><hr />

I always enjoyed seeing players that were higher level and had the awesome gear running around. It kept me motivated that one day i could be in there shoes. I'm not one to brag or boast, but it's always flattering when folks ask me what weapon i have or what armor i'm wearing and hearing the ooh's and aah's from the lower levels. It makes me realize how far i've come in the game and I always give the lower level players encouragement that they can be there some day.</div></div><hr />

I use dye, but I miss the days when you could tell the uber people by the color of their armor.  I liked being able to take a look at a warrior and tell you every piece of visible armor he was wearing.  People didn't ask for AC/HPs then because they could just look at you and tell if you were gonna suck or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soludar</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Brutul... Armor dyes kinda screwed up the game a lil more for me... I loved velious when seeing a warrior with blue arms/legs/bracer(leetness warlords armor) and black Gaunts,(gaunts of the dragonslayer) black boots, (vindi boots/boots of the storm) and black bp, (eradication/vindi bp) meant it was some bad ass mofo.  Not only did they look nice, but it was a status symbol wearing your armor, an upgrade from the silver(thurg), and brownish armor(Skyshrine). It meant you had killed dragons and hunted in places where most had never seen.....<br />
<br />
Now you cant tell the difference from a 10k tank and a 5k tank  :( . Even if you look at the weapons your screwed in trying to tell them apart (Hmm, brutish blade of balance/GBoS, lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's one of the things I was pretty happy about.

<br />
I guess i just will never get this.  Too much hippy bullshit fed to the kids or something.<br />
<br />
A defining part of what made EQ great was how your character looked, and how that look evolved over the course of 2 expansions.  This is why Allakazams has a fashion table.  If it wasn't important, no one would care.<br />
<br />
The fact is that people do care.  From the moment you set foot in EQ and saw a warrior standing in freeport with his executioner axe and his set of full crafted, you knew what your goal was, because you were lucky if you were even wearing a piece of fucking banded.<br />
<br />
By the time you got your crafted and your executioners axe, you had seen more than a couple warriors run by in Indicolite and you knew what your next goal was.  It was to look as cool as those guys did...because all the people your level wore crafted and you didn't stand out.  By the time you had a few Hate raids under your belt, Kunark came out and now the best of the best were wearing Cobalt blue, and it stayed that way for a LONG time.  The best warriors on the server were decked in full blue.  If you were middle of the road, you had the gauntlets and the boots and the vambraces.  If you were PL'd by your buddy's druid, you were probably wearing crafted still, and you wouldn't be a good choice to fill that tank slot in the group.  There was no questioning of it, you could look at someone and tell if they were at your gear level and going to be able to suffice in the group you were doing.<br />
<br />
I guess if you prefer the bullshit &quot;Everyone is equal&quot; philosophy then you'd have a reason for hating the progression of appearance the game created, but I just don't see how.  Appearance not only provided a visual indicator of what level of the game you were at, but it also provided you with a goal, since the armor looked progressively more cool, and gave you something to work for.  When Velious came out, Haass was in his 30's or 40's and I took absolute pride in the full set of Guardian I managed to farm up for myself in the first month or so of the expansion.  It wasn't much better than crafted in most slots...but until the top guilds started doing Kael every nite, there wasn't anyone else on the server that looked like I did.<br />
<br />
That's something that has been missing from the game since Luclin, and then was killed entirely with the dye system in LoY.  Luclin models and dye should have never happened, they're 2 of the biggest mistakes they ever made.  By allowing people to create their own color scheme, you ruined any sense of accomplishment for looking unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The same could be said for a lot of classes, especially clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really miss those days.  Velious was the high point of EQ.  It's been downhill from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone even bothers to quest Crafted anymore.  I haven't looked, but I'm betting its cheaper to buy the pieces in the bazaar then to quest it.  BUT....  I quested my OWN damn Crafted and wore it with pride!<br />
<br />
Something else that hasn't been said though.  People actually learned what the different things looked like.  Now days you could ask half the people in the group what Kizrak or Raex is, and they wouldn't have a clue.  Back then, they knew the difference between Myrmidon's and Warlord's not just by color and looks, but by name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you want to know what someone is wearing inspect them for gods sake<br />
<br />
i much prefer armor dyes, you have any idea how hard it can get to recognize an individual without pc names on if you use standard colored models and half the folks have similar gear? i remember playing a cleric and hopelessly spamming /rt trying to target someone who wanted a buff but i couldnt quite find them in a raid setting or tell where they were by sight quickly. with armor dyes its a LOT easier to locate people if you know what they look like.<br />
<br />
beside, without armor dyes, i couldnt be the Koolaid man :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realized after I started reading this thread that I don't even know what color most of my current warrior's gear is. He smithed chain armor for himself when he was level 12 and I think that's the last time he was more or less in one complete suit. Ever since he's looked piebald, selecting gear based on the best stats he could afford/loot/quest and not at all on looks.<br />
I'm afraid that when I see a warrior in a full suit of armor I assume he's likely a twink. If it's quest armor, I assume he likely bought an MQ'd, and probably could have gotten a better bang for his buck if he weren't wearing a single suit of stuff. I assume he's likely being played as an alt rolled by a rich caster. I assume he's likely used his twink gear as a crutch to cover the fact that he doesn't actually know how to play the class.<br />
When I play my shaman and I see a one-color warrior turn up as tank in a pick-up group I assume that I'm about to die, and just before the warrior makes the decisions that will get me killed, he will be telling the group how bad we are and how good he is.<br />
Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised.<br />
Warrior armor should be black and/or blue.<br />
Dyes are stupid.<br />
Silver is for pallys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like being inspected, nor inspecting, without asking.  I find it quite rude and have yet to run across a person who does the &quot;inspect, inspect, inspect&quot; routine who actually has a clue.  Maybe one day I'll get lucky, but until that day, I'll continue to consider it a sign of noobishness.  Now, when they actually ask...  They get bonus points for being considerate :)<br />
<br />
<br />
It's usually quite easy for me to spot who's who on raids.  Pre-dye, and post-dye.  When you play with the same people day after day, on raids, and XPing, you learn what they look like by their player model as well as their armor color.<br />
 <br />
<br />
LOL Brabble.  You can always ask them how important AGI is to a warrior.  If he says it's very important, then you know it's a rich caster twink.  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't judge on dye color per se.  I judge weapons.  It's critical to me to know whether the tank is going to have aggro issues with my rogue or not, so a tank's weapons will either put me at ease, or on edge.  I have been pleasantly surprised though.  I grouped with one guy in PoE who had a copper hammer and a CHSD who did a darned fine job of holding aggro.  His replacement when he left had BF and a BoC and was paying so little attention that I was tanking the mobs most of the fight.   Last I checked, the guy was still 66 and trying to get MPG groups.  I guess I wasn't the only one to have that experience with the guy lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, thank god for that  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
People weren't wearing that stuff for fashion btw.  The velious look with green arms, bracers, legs, (Warlord armor was green on barbs dammit) black bp, gloves, and boots was the best stuff you could get in velious.  You could eventually upgrade the arms/bracers/legs in NToV, but damn that NToV stuff was ugly, especially those green pants from Koi'Doken and Eashan's chain arms.  <br />
<br />
You could also spot a gimp by looking for frosted velium armor.  Some people that had it actually earned it, but anytime I saw somebody in that armor I remembered the pack of gimps that used to follow us around on Dain raids begging to loot frosted velium.<br />
<br />
You could even tell what guild people were in (to some extent) by looking at their armor because different guilds chose different factions.  There were so many good things about Velious.<br />

I worked my ass off for that gear. I killed and looted every single drop required to create it. I loved that armor.<br />
<br />
But I just about threw up when I equipped the first piece I completed (my boots). They were blazing neon green. Not just green. NEON FRICKIN' GREEN! A color that does not occur in nature.<br />
<br />
But I didn't dye it. I eventually had the full suit, including the sword, and looked like some horrific vision from a candy shop. <br />
<br />
When I started upgrading with Indicolite, I LOVED the color of that stuff, especially when combined with Champion's. Very cool.<br />
<br />
The reason I started using dye was to make fun of some folks in my guild. One of the other tanks, a huge barbarian, had a black/red dye scheme, so I showed up double shrunk at a group with the same dye scheme and joked that I was his mini-me.<br />
<br />
After that I couldn't be bothered to undye the black slots, so my wife gave me some dye to get red of the red.</div></div><hr />

I find this promising. Once I was on a pick up raid in Chardok and we were getting set up and some people were having a little trouble standing still while waiting for further instructions. I (being a Barb) was shrunk, so I hit duck and, while advancing and retreating in front of them, spammed /s Weeeee rrrrrrrepresent the lollypop guild, the lollypop guild...<br />

Ya know, I still have everything for the epic except for the red/green scales and  the queen blade on Tarew Marr.  That stuff used to be so hard to get, but it would be completely trival now.  I am halfway tempted to just log in there for a day, buy the scales in the bazaar, and drag a couple friends down to chardok to off the queen real quick just to finish it.  I could probably do the whole epic on Test in a weekend too, but I don't want to inflict plane of sky on anyone.</div></div><hr />

When did Brad McQuaid bail to start Vanguard?  There seems to me to be a point in the game when things changed, that time seems to be around Luclin.  It used to be that they would not make changes to the game that they felt were not good for the game, no matter what the player base demanded or cried about.  Or they would make changes to the game that they felt were good for the game even though they knew they were unpopular.  That never seems to happen anymore, they now seem to cater to whatever people want.  Maybe I’m going off on a tangent here, but dye seems to be something that people were crying for, but definitely was not good for the game and should not have been implemented.  I am one of those that definitely longs for the old days.</div></div><hr />

If my memory serves me well, Brad McQuaid and possé left during mid / late Velius era.<br />
<br />
And personally, I can still name most the items on screenshots from pre-velius era.<br />
I never really learned all the stuff from Velius by name, since I wasn't very active then.<br />
Which is kinda ironic, because the best gear on my warrior is from that expansion.<br />
But then, I stopped playing completely at early POP.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Magelo profiles and background pics (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28701) are for current gear.<br />
(and yes, I earned that damned Frosted Velium, dammit.)<br />

I liked the old way of telling what epople had by visual scan. It added a whole different outlook. It gave you seomething to strive for, to look like the players that you considered uber....</div></div><hr />

YAY. I've used dye but one day noticed that all my base color tints on my armor were pink.. WHY would they make the &quot;Toughest&quot; class in the game's best class armor pink?</div></div><hr />

There's nothing putting in dyes ruined other than aesthetic preference of the minority. I remember being able to tell what someone was wearing by sight, and when Indicolite was top notch and every warrior wanted to be golden. At a point though there became too many possible armors for you to tell what someone was necessarily wearing, and my main beef with not having dyes was the higher end armor always screwed you. The best armors aren't set armor. Look at magelo's of top end warriors and they'll be wearing a few pieces of Vadd's and some other mix-matched stuff thats better from boss drops. I think that was the one thing that truly annoyed me was that in order to be the best you could be, you HAD to become rainbow warrior. That's why I love dyes, they let you strive to get the best armor and still look respectable. <br />
<br />
One thing I definitely do agree with though, luclin models are the debil.</div></div><hr />

I never had the chance to wear a Cobalt BP, had a full set but BP and I can tell you for sure that Cobalt was the best looking set ever.<br />

Who knows, I might not go back to lurking straight away this time around. <br />

Damn, I'm impressed !<br />
You nailed it in one - 15 points for you.  :D <br />
<br />
And yes, the silvery Two Handed Axe was the thing to have as a midlevel Human/Barbarian warrior back then, because it had Serpent Sight on it. Hard to apprechiate racial attributes in todays EQ because most of 'em have been removed by equipment, not to mention Shamans and Enchanters pimping their spells on every other streetcorner you walk past.</div></div><hr />

I guess you have a point about the best amors nowadays not being set armors.  I guess I just wish there was some uniqueness left....  that when you got that uber piece of gear it had a look to it that was recognizable.  Dye didn't have to ruin that necessarily, but unfortunately nowadays all armor looks pretty much the same.</div></div><hr />

Since I came back, I've picked up a lot of Ornate, and I already had Boots of the Storm, so I'm slowly shifting from the red I used to have to the dark colors of Kizraks.<br />

Silver just is not gonna cut it here.</div></div><hr />

I love my colors to death... I'm patchwork and unfashionable, just like I damn well should be. Would I pick up silver vambraces? In a heartbeat. Why? 'cause they'd be the best stats... and clash with my red boots. I didn't ever desire to be fashionable, but it used to come with the gear. You upgraded, and everything somehow looked ok. The more you got of a kick ass set, the better you looked. It sounds melodramatic, I guess, but that really is the way I feel. I wore crusty when I had to, and dammit, people knew. When I was wearing a SSB, I looked like a football player. It was all good. Now, feh! Warriors match or deliberately don't match.</div></div><hr />

Sony had planned to allow the old Velious textures to be mapped over the new models, but they decided that it would overload most people's computers.  You can, technically, turn on the Velious armours with Luclin models, but afaik from expiriments on both my computers, you mainly get a buncha weird deformities in your Luclin models, with a few spots that actually work right.  You can see juuuust enough to know it would look damn cool if Sony ever implemented it.. like they said they would, once technology caught up. *cough-hint-hint-cough*</div></div><hr />

I still play with old models.  New ones are pathetic, only reason to use them is horses and horses are for wimps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">10-22-2004, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Haass.  I remember back in the day I had full crafted.  People often said I looked like a blue trashcan.  (Im a halfling)  I was damn proud of it.  It was awsome seeing people in that golden Indicolite color.  I personally miss seeing warriors in full sets of gear and color schemes.  It made figuring out what armor he had simple.  Now some people may say &quot;but it hurts lower level chars cause people will think Im gimp!&quot;  Well cry me a river liberal.  I used some crafted into my 50's along with Royal Frosted Velium, and other pieces.  It never stopped me from getting groups.<br />
<br />
I remember our MT had full set of Berzerkers Armor and was a barbarian.  I still think the most bad ass scheme was that ugly yellow look and the gems on the BP.  It had real character.  Now characters breath with their armor for crying out loud! (WTF?)<br />
<br />
I do not and will not dye my armor.  I have that pink stuff from LDoN, the black Boots of the Storm, my silver Helmet of Zek and I love it.  I see too many warriors run around today and I cant figure out what they are wearing.  I consider inspecting people to be one of the rudest things you can do, and as a result my inspect button has been off for years. (But Im wierd, I havent had PC names on for years either)<br />
