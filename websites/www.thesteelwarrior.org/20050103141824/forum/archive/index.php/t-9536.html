<br />
I am using two anger augments, atm in the epic<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/fpics/marble_sphere_of_ire.jpg <br />
<br />
And another anger 3 but type 8 (cant find iamge :P)<br />
<br />
At this moment using epic in primary with both anger augments and BF in secondary but have some problems in raids with agroo.<br />
<br />
What do you think friends? best put my BF in Primary and change one augment on it... <br />
<br />
Tell me somthing... and atm pass on more adv, really bored of it and need to rise to level 70.</div></div><hr />

Wish I had that combo or just the BF for that matter lol =)<br />
<br />
GL on your quest for answers.. I envy you!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're having problems I would suggest looking into finishing weapons affinity before you get to 70, since it does not take nearly as much to max as sturdiness did or getting to 70. Otherwise I'm not really sure why you would have problems with aggro unless you have a trigger happy group of wizards :)<br />
<br />
Also as an aside, working on an anger 3 for the BF would probably help...I know its a lot of work but if WA5 doesnt help much then that would most likely be the next logical step.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lost it on cursed the ohter night to a paly who was purposefully trying to with chain stun's....<br />
<br />
as to which weapon in primary, i'd throw the BF primary for 2 reasons...EB is more hate than anger3, and the 55% increased proc rate</div></div><hr />

<br />
When in raids must to clean, in trash mobs, can handle agroo most of times... +<br />
<br />
Got many n00bs that dont know how to control agroo, and a group of crazy wizards that start nuking at 99pct... <br />
<br />
BF prymary with anger 3 and epic secondary with the other anger 3 sounds like the best solution.... what du you think guyz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best solution sounds like educate your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you should let the over nukers die until they learn to control their aggro a bit better else you will continue to have problems regardless of your setup.  procs aren't always going to happen right off the bat, and if they are nuking at 99% and getting aggro, they will continue to do so.  Once you fail to taunt *cough* the mob back off of them a few times and they keep dieing, they eventually learn.  Of course, just explaining things to them first might be a better idea.  Have them wait a bit longer, use smaller nukes initially that will not gain so much aggro, etc.  Teach them now before they blow things on a major raid mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Losing aggro clearing trash is just gonna happen sometimes.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt worry too much but if the stealing aggro is a problem (ie they die) talk to them about it.<br />
<br />
WA5 and an anger3 for the BF are most important for your overall aggro at this point.  With your weapon setup you shouldn't really be losing aggro at all unless *they* are doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Mainhand the BF with an anger3 ... Offhand epic with another anger3 ... and grind out a 3rd anger3 to double up the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaQuiLLa</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last question... whats the best combo?<br />
<br />
1- Primary: BF + A3<br />
    Secondary: Epic 1.5 + A3<br />

I went back to BoW with anger 3 ... <br />

I know everyone says proc rate has to do with aug.. But Im not to sure, Epic 1.5 should be procing as much as BoW ....</div></div><hr />

Suppose when a guy is playing on the Euro server, and says his location is in spain, that maybe his guild speaks spanish?  I mean, this information is all within an inch of where you clicked on the guild link.</div></div><hr />

Reconquista is a spanish guild, everyone who wants to join us must speak spanish  :D <br />
<br />
But tell me... i need to know :P<br />

1- Primary: BF + A3<br />

2- Primary: Epic 1.5 + A3 + A3<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might try talking to the raid team first before switching weapon or augment placements. If they still continue to overnuke early or assist before it's called, let them die a few times. I find that MANY casters need the visual of seeing their bind point a few times to get the idea.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't yield good results, then try BF with A3 in primary and Epic 1.5 with A3 in secondary (could even add a Ykesha augment for fun and DD)<br />

I myself have epic 1.5 + 2x anger 3's and a Acrylia Blade + anger 3 and its done very well, that being said you should get Wepon Affinity Maxed..</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of European guilds that draw their members from many of the European nations, all of which speak a different languages.  Since English is generally taught as a universal language (Although French is apparently the universal language of the world, but don't quote me on that), most European guilds that I know of speak Engrish.  <br />

Doesn't Timmok live in Denmark?   Hell, he writes better English than most any American I know.  =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainingvodka</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mainhand the BF + A3.  if you offhand the BF the proc mod is FAR less effective and  if you are tanking who gives a rat's ass about your dps?  Your job is aggro.  Throw your epic 1.5 in your offhand with one a3 and a ykesha (or just any dps aug really) if anything.  you do NOT need 4 anger augs in your aggro setup -- it's overkill imo.  I mainhand a BF with A3 and off a unagued boc.  i only lose aggro when someone is *trying* to take aggro.  i only have wa1 and a max dex of 290.  offhand aggro isn't exactly worthless, but it's certainly not vital.   i even throw a dps weapon in my offhand half way through trash mobs sometimes, just for a laugh, and still don't lose aggro.  Hell I'll even turn attack off if I think someone is trying to steal aggro and let them have it.  <br />
<br />
if someone is *trying* to take aggro, because a) he/she is stupid or b) he/she ignorant... educate the person first.  let the person die second.  find new ppl to play with third.  that's what I do.</div></div><hr />

The swing aggro from the epic will be better than bf, procmod notwithstanding, so you're less likely to have problems before anything procs. Go do some ldon's so you can a3 the bf as well, however. If you're having aggro problems while clearing, have a paladin handle clears and just use warriors to tank the bosses.</div></div><hr />

Just ran the math and the difference in aggro per minute from procs is 727 in theory.  Later maybe I'll use the melee aggro formula's and see what that difference is.</div></div><hr />

Start with training, use your epic 1.5 and shield and force them not to take agro.  Peeps that continue to pull agro let die, if they still continue boot them from raid.  Do this till you can hold agro with your bare hands :p .  Your weapons are not the problem.</div></div><hr />

Warriors suck for trash (thats what pal/sk are here for) even with QuadEB + WA5 <br />
i see warriors in my guild loosing (or to be exact not getting) agro to/from Pal/SK.<br />
<br />
Trash just isnt our speciality.<br />
<br />
If you end up tanking 99% of the trash it means :<br />
- You dont have enough pal/sk<br />
- Your Pal/SK are slackers<br />
- Other fellow warriors are slackers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When MAing on trash pulls its not really your job to keep agro the whole time tell the mob is dead...If a Pally,Sk,or Warrior take agro from you move on to the next mob and start beating on it, When your previous target is dead Call for Assist on your mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you holding aggro on tough mobs is your job, and by extension, the job of your group/raid/guildmates.<br />
Of course there's nothing wrong with you holding aggro on trash mobs that you're trying to steamroll, either, but really you're just trying to get them dead fast. Pallies and SKs can generally take the hits from these mobs and they can ramp up aggro early, so if they gank you, all it means is that other dps folks can crank the damage faster. That's not a problem.<br />
Now, if your casters are ganking aggro, trash or boss, that's a problem, because the increased damage on the mob is not worth the increased risk of caster splat.<br />
So there are two tracks here: you maxing your aggro through weapons/AAs/augs/other little warrior tricks, and the group/raid in general learning how to modify their aggro generation according to the situation so as to max damage within exceptable levels of risk.<br />
There are a few squishy elements to maxing your own aggro, but in general the ability of everyone to play efficiently is much more fluid and harder to get down to &quot;perfection.&quot; Since the power of everyone will change over time, this is something that has to be an ongoing process for any guild/group that plays regularly together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bloodfrenzy is a nice weapon and is technically higher aggro than any one hander other than DBoTWL, Fleshbiter, and BBoB.  <br />
<br />
Still, though, i could see why on trash mobs it is somewhat lacking. <br />
<br />
Friend of mine mainhands epic 1.5 with a JoS offhand and does wonderfully on aggro clearing trash mainly due to the swing aggro of both weapons + procs on the side.  Thus, sometimes on clearing trash with a raid assisting the best option isn't always the setup with more procs but significantly better dps aggro.  Assuming you get your procs you're fine either way ... but in situations where you're not getting your procs ... you're fucked left and right.<br />
<br />
Clearing trash with a raid my guess is that Epic 1.5 is probably better aggro, but i'm not gonna presume to state whether it is better aggro over time or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwendle</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the same combo 1.5/BF and notice that wether im using 1 or the other in my primary, the knights (mainly the paladins) still (and imo will always) win the trophy for initial aggro. Weve learned not to fight over the aggro on trash, rather make sure that the knights and tanks are evenly distributed throughout the raid with healers in each grp. In fact, i went so far as to make a new channel for all of us to communicate in to help avoid confusion. We make our target calls in there in addition to any others to acknowledge our targets.<br />
<br />
  Paladins still manage to yank aggro when the trash runs over to rape the over-anxious wizard, or the tigger happy shaman/chanter ... which really is great for preventing deaths to &quot;those mana types&quot; ...but when it comes to tanking the Big Boss's, i agree 100% with those who suggested earlier that it becomes teh responsibility of your raid to ensure you keep your aggro, just as much as it is yours to make every effort to maintain it.<br />
<br />
  I always said that anyone can steal aggro from a warrior, it takes a really good player not to. Just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
<br />
 P.s. I do not have aggro issues weilding the &quot;Conan sword&quot; and the BF, altho i do seem to have to work a bit harder for it than i did with the BoW, as proven when i duked it out for aggro with a well geared paladin in and expedition. It seems with the approriate augments that it works VERY well, for all purposes.</div></div><hr />

2- Primary: Epic 1.5 + A3 + A3<br />

XDDDD<br />
<br />
I will calculate this tomorow to be sure but for now I think option2 should be better, especially for trash were you really need a high constant swing aggro generation.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : I betted wrong and loosed. in the Mainhand The swing aggro isn't wide enougth to overcome the proc advantage of the BF. but in off hand the epic swing aggro overcome the BF proc increase.<br />
thus BF+A3 / epic 1.5+2xA3 is the way to go at the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, your Bloodfrenzy will gain a higher benefit from WA5 than the epic will.<br />
<br />
Base proc rate:<br />
Procratemod on BF is 55 = 3.1 Procs per minute mainhand<br />
Procratemod on Epic is 0 = 2 procs per minute mainhand<br />
<br />
Add WA5 at 50%:<br />
BF = 4.65 procs per minute, an increase of 1.55 ppm<br />
Epic = 3 procs per minute, an increase of 1 ppm<br />
<br />
(Note: if you keep the augs the way they are now, the epic will win out.  If you plan to mainhand the BF, move one of the A3 augs over.)</div></div><hr />
