I have been killing the black guard looking things right at the zone in of HOH and the ones in the circle directly in front of the zone in.  If I kill enough of these will the blade eventually drop?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have the name of the mob that actually drops this blade.  I have looked all over and cannot find it anywhere.  Thanks,<br />

On a side note, I personally think the windblade is a piece of crap for warriors.  There's absolutely no aggro on that thing.  Good for when you're not tanking I guess...<br />

And yes it still drops, got one off a white Valorious Spirit in SW shrine last month.  They aren't really THAT rare, you just have to stay there for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personal opinion is fine, but you haven't used one for any length of time I'm guessing. Besides weaps with hate procs (enraging, taunting, etc) and stun procs (GSoT) the windblade does a solid job holding of aggro.<br />
<br />
Try it for awhile in both a raid or xp setup from behind...you'll find yourself often getting the mobs attention (and no, I don't mean rampage).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in a WW group in PoV over the weekend ... the MT was a 65 war wielding his Epics ... I was using my Windblade for the DPS ... I was consistantly pulling aggro off of him ... I finally had to switch to my dual-wield 1HB setup of a Bed Leg Club and Jade Mace ... my DPS went down, but at least I wasn't pulling aggro.<br />
<br />
Besides, I needed to get a few skill-ups in 1HB anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because someone doesn't go gray camping for drops, doesn't mean they aren't a &quot;made man&quot;.  The bazaar is a legitimate source of upgrades for many casual and / or non-uberguilded players who play smart.  Everyone has the same opportunity to get out there and &quot;make&quot; themselves able to get what they want (that doesn't require 30+ people).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree<br />
<br />
Some people like to play this game for the fun and excitement of going new places and killing new things, not fighting off sleep while camping some stupid mobs for hours and hours on end.<br />
<br />
But ultimately, that's one of the nice things about this game ... everyone can get out of it what they want ... if you wanna 6-box like Sam Deathwalker you can ... if you wanna just socialize and goof off you can ... if you wanna raid 40+ hours a week you can ... if you wanna exp grind with friends you can ... if you wanna camp and farm you can ...<br />
<br />
Different strokes for different folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Earring of the solstice I bought,Truncheon of Doom was a Gift from a guildy who got it in an AE group,I collected the components for my Valorium ring myself..<br />
<br />
Every Piece of gear after that,Weapons and Armor were looted of mobs by me,90% of them tanked by me.Including the LoY drops and even the Kunzar Kusch.<br />
<br />
You can buy all your gear in the bazaar thats fine,But you can't buy the pride that comes with getting it yourself.<br />
<br />
The time &quot;wasted&quot; so to speak farming cash,Through Tradeskills or mobs is no different than the time spent Camping the item yourself,And since we are warriors typically the time spent camping an item is with friends ,rather than alone holed up in front of some forge or fighting off druids in Rathe Mountains..</div></div><hr />

Whatever floats your boat, again wasn't trying to argue, just that I like a &quot;made-man&quot;... just my opinion, nothing more, nothing less.<br />

Back on topic ..................<br />
<br />
Ive fought in North East, North West, South, South East crypts, stil haven't seen a drop.. besides Hero Parts.   As I was moving to SE crypt I did notice 6 undead mobs and they are white suites (see thru invis).  Could these possibly be the white armor guys and not the living white suits??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cozlo</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see on here time and time again about what weapons and then how much... sorry, forgot y'all took the Dreadlands/PoV exp route for ease of access and then used /bazaar to make your magelo. <br />
<br />
For someone that &quot;doesn't want to argue&quot;, you sure do make a lot of assumptions.  For the record, I grew up in GD/EW/TD in my 40s, then moved to The Hole (love that exp bonus).  Hate DL, and was grouping in PoV/PoS with guildies / friends before it was opened to the masses.<br />
<br />
But you can't buy the pride that comes with getting it yourself. <br />
<br />
I am no less proud of tradeskilling and farming for coin/drops than you are of acquiring your raid-level ND items.  But, you're right, I am proud of my ND items too.<br />
<br />
To the Poster:  Dreadfully sorry I derailed your thread.  Good luck on getting your drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Get your group together.  These are undead critters, so necromancers, slay undead pallies, and of course clerics are very useful; the necro can slow them so you don't need a traditional slower.<br />
<br />
2.  Zone into HoH, invis up, and follow the left hand wall until you reach the three Wrulons.<br />
<br />
3.  Ahead of you are six Valiant spirits.  They are white armors and they are undead.  These are not the critters you are looking for.  They drop ethereal parchments, spectral parchments, and defenders lightblades; you can kill them as a warm-up.<br />
<br />
4.  Past these Valiant spirits is a set of stairs down.  The camp you want is in the room at the bottom of the stairs.<br />
<br />
5.  You will see that there are various Valorous spirits up in this room.  They are usually black armors which are not aggro.  However, they do assist one another.  They are PH's for the white armors which are aggro.<br />
<br />
6.  Pull them with Pacification or Harmony ideally, although they can be FD split if your puller doesn't suck.  They cannot be mezzed, snared, or rooted, and they mitigate slow; hit max is 544 from memory.<br />
<br />
7.  Be aware that the white Valorous spirits usually drop nothing at all, or sometimes ethereals/spectrals.  The Girdle of Mithaniel and the Windblade are rare.</div></div><hr />

Not true.  Lesser mobs all over Norrath wield bronze 2 handed swords.  You can even tell it's going to be the 2HS before they start swinging, it has this sort of leather handle on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've fought SE, both top floor and basement.  I've seen defender's lightblades drop like candy (the whole group took one each, then we had to start destroying them), and a couple of spectral parchs.  Oh, and hero parts.  That's it.</div></div><hr />

Ive heard of Windblade dropping 3 times in the last oh, 4 months i been in HoH, but not until recently i have gruoped there, exclusively.  I came here and read that windblades drop rarely.  YESTERDAY, i pulled a WHITE armored undead mob, wielding nothing but fists, he dropped it, and i won it.  Sells for 30k easy on CT.  Other than that, the undead mobs drop nothing other than Ethereals from my memory, however the humans drop hero meat *like candy*, lightblades, and specs (killed 3 in a row, and got 3 specs before).<br />
Also, the dogs drop wrulon claws :P, they're not common, but after 3 or so clears of them enraged squirrels they will drop, used for this nice earring <br />
