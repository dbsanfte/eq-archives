<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I cant see how todays patch can be seen as anything but positive for everyone that plays the game. If you cant find some good in it, then its possible that EQ is not and never will be fun for you. Anyway, /cheer SoE from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tooby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">great things i thought. The aug reusability really really helps. VP sounds promising as well, I havent seen any information, but i guess theres a chance it will less time consuming to get into than VT and make a great starting point for getting some gear before trying to get to the elementals.<br />
Changes to natimbi is nice too and Im guessing it wont really make a differnce to anyone but us casuals. <br />
Pet retention always nice not to have to wait for the Bst to get ready after zoning in to ldon. all in all it looks great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I'm not at the level that most of the LDoN-based changes will matter to me much, I do agree of course that it's a really good idea. In fact I don't know why it was ever an issue at all-it should have been implemented when LDoN first came out. <br />
<br />
The new VP sounds fun. Maybe a way from pre-elemental guilds to get some good XP/loot while waiting to break into EP, or another place to raid when there aren't other targets up. It depends what the new key quest is like really.<br />
<br />
As a player with a beastlord main, I *love* the new pet changes beyond words. Being able to see my mana numerically is a boon as well. <br />
<br />
Overall I'd say this is one of the better patches in awhile aside from the fact that they had to have an emergency patch this morning evidently   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are doing the casual vs raider bean counting--the only part of this patch that helps casuals more is the tribute change.

But I think the who patch is awesome--no more waiting for the pet casters to buff up after zoning in.</div></div><hr />

Already put in the feedback on my 6box saying I thought it was good. Put my plug in for elemental equipment too. And my 2cp is that the LDoN aug removal/sale benefits all but saleback of equipment benefits casuals principally. That being said gotta get new stuff to benefit alot of us who will only do 1492 equipment anyways so we have nothing to buy if we sell (unless we sell due to non-LDoN upgrade, such as Tak BP to Time BP, etc.). Only 81 more wins to charm cap my chanter, woot :)<br />
<br />
But wait I want 2 more themes which means 500 win cap and like 15stat/15resist/150 hp, etc. for the charm now the that BiC aug is so freaking awesome :)<br />
<br />
GD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lol, BB I mentioned the LDoN aug removal in a tavern post yesterday precisely to make fun of the idea there was nothing in the patch for casual players like myself. <br />
I can only do LDoNs one night a week nowadays because of work and family schedules. Being able to remove augs, as opposed to having to destroy them, is a huge deal.<br />
And it's not the only nice thing in this patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with the general sentiment. <br />
<br />
This patch has no downside (unintended regression bugs notwithstanding -- you should expect those, and they WILL get fixed).<br />
<br />
I sold long un-used LDoN merchant items back last night for 70% of their value. That reduced by 3 dungeons the number of &quot;grinds&quot; I'll have to do to put a type 2 augment on the Malevolent Helm I'm working towards. <br />
<br />
I removed and re-used some dropped augments that were collecting dust in my bank. I now have 8 more stamina and 10 more poison resistance than I did. It cost me more plat to buy the solvents than I made in the adventures where those augments dropped in the first place, so that seems like a fair trade for everybody. SoE pulled some extra pp out of the game, and I get to re-use an augment that I won fair and square 15+ levels ago.<br />
<br />
I also love that the patch message showed which of the changes were in response to community input. <br />
<br />
Two thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I see aug removeal and sale as a wash between ubers and causals. Ubers may turn over their gear faster and earn points far faster, but casuals get a far greater return on real time (as opposed to played time) from them. Being able to swap out an augment means that you don't have to spend 2 months recamping it. I know, even with my intense playing atm, that I would not sinking 2500 points into AC augs if they went away as soon as I upraded the slot. Ubers can afford that kind of commitment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Leelron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Good patch for everyone I think both raiders and casual alike; but the new elemental quality LDON armor sets that where rumored are sorley needed if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It was a good patch...aug re-allocation shoulda have been in the original design though.<br />
<br />
Another tier of LDoN equipment would be interesting...if it was properly designed (we covered this about a month ago).<br />
<br />
Still would like to see a process to retire old no drop gear w/o destroy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BB, selling augments back is a much bigger deal for raiders than it is &quot;casual&quot; gamers.  They are the ones upgrading gear and they are the ones with a much larger and wider selection of augments.  <br />
<br />
I don't want to see you toting this is a specific improvement for &quot;casual&quot; gamers, because that's not remotely true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gart,<br />
This is an improvement for everybody.<br />
<br />
Should SoE however introduce a new higher cost armor set, say 2000 AP's, the ability to sell previous LDoN armor for 70% IS a benefit. It cuts down on the number of adventures needed to upgrade. When I upgrade Warlord's arms to QVic Arms, the old arms and the effort needed to acquire them have 0 value going forward.<br />
<br />
Should a fully LDoN armored player decide to join a raiding guild, as they replace their armor with no drop raid armor, they can sell it back and buy augments or even a reasonable weapon (assuing LDoN HAS some reasonable weapon heh). I'd call that smoothing out the transition from LDoN to raiding.<br />
<br />
My point was not that this wasn't a benefit to raiders too, but rather it IS a benefit to some casual players and was greeted by silence. I was curious why this was the case.<br />

BB, selling augments back is a much bigger deal for raiders than it is &quot;casual&quot; gamers.  They are the ones upgrading gear and they are the ones with a much larger and wider selection of augments.  <br />
<br />
I don't want to see you toting this is a specific improvement for &quot;casual&quot; gamers, because that's not remotely true.<br />
<br />
I was a *casual*.  This woulda been a HUGE boon for me - I could have had dual auged weapons sooner, as an Anger II removed and sold back while saving for an Anger III is reasonable, while an Anger II destroyed for an Anger III would not have been (f'rinstance). Heck, an Anger I is better than an empty slot, knowing most of those points come back to you.  Losing a few points along the way on the sellback would not have been so bad I couldn't take it.  I even managed to upgrade my gear in tiny ways once or twice a month, and would have liked to aug some of it, but I'd been holding back, as I was waiting for a specific piece to hit those slots, and then I was gonna buy the augs.  Why waste the points, right?<br />
<br />
It's a boon for anyone, I see it as a big one for the non-raider set as well as the upper-tier set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It was greeted by silence because it's not a casual player specific benefit.  It's clearly a benefit for everyone with ldon points and augments.  <br />
<br />
Since raiders churn gear much faster, it's unquestionably a benefit with more magnitude for them.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying that's wrong, but to express surprise as you do seems very odd to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Being able to reuse aug's on another piece of gear is a tremendous improvement. Also considering I 2 box a shammy alot the pet zoning is great. The pet thing should help out alot of classes when doing LDoN's. having the pet prebuffed and ready to go before zone in. I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I fall into the casual category, no questions asked.<br />
<br />
The last patch made life a bit better for me, and for the people whom I game with regularly (other casuals, and a couple of hardcores):<br />
<br />
Zoning pets makes pets much more attractive. My wife plays a mage (sometimes I play her char, too, since warriors are such uber soloers, and I need some challenge in my life).<br />
<br />
Selling back LDoN is just a good idea all the way around. Look at what is sold on the vendors - tons of sets of armor, lots of augments, quite a few decent weapons. While it's true that you can often BUY stuff in the Bazaar for much less effort than earning points, as a lowbie, those items will be more likely to see use from the player base, now that you can &quot;invest&quot; and &quot;trade up&quot; your hard-earned points. I know I plan on using it on my lowbie wizzy.<br />
<br />
The VP change is AWESOME. Being casual, I had all the parts of the old VP key on me from several months' effort. I bought a chaining of the tooth - presto, I'm old-school keyed. After the patch, I had a chance to get into Skyfire and join a pickup raid of various Ubers from my server (EMarr) to kill the dragon. Now my casual-self is keyed for VP.<br />
<br />
Having looked at the VP entrance quest from a casual perspective, I'm still pleased. Now that I'm keyed, of course I want to get my friends keyed. As such, the new camps for the key will facilitate that, as well as the old key method (if you can ever find Trak up :\ bummer). Also, the quests from inside VP appeal to me, since some of my friends SOLO the mobs in question for the various quests. Usually. I think Vindi is a bit beyond soloing (until 70, at least!).<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm really tickled with the major changes - though, for some reason, the LDoN Hard I did today BEAT my ASS. Mobs were hitting me for max a LOT more often, and my AA haven't gone down (or my equipment!) since I last did one. I think they dicked up some more AA's :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">the pet zoning thing is great for most everybody. i like the idea that if i invite a pet class to my group he can summon the pet and two sets of armor for him while we are still forming the group and get a virtue for his pet. the first set of armor he gives to the pet and the second set he holds in inventory in case he loses the first pet. then when we finally zone in we dont have to wait for him to summon and finally say &quot;ok im ready with 70manna and could i please get a virtue for my pet?&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I was a casual player until i gave up playing a month or so back. The patch looks great but still leaves out a ton of zones that people bought the expansions for that they have a difficult time getting access to. The problem is compounded when your friends with people from multiple guilds and groups that used to be able to fight together but no longer have a good choice of places to go where all have access. I just could not see myself buying another expansion until I could get to even half of the zones from the previous. Knowing that a new expansion would just leave me further behind I decided it was best to retire. This patch does a lot but i do not think it comes near any kind of a solution considering it is still only a few zones that are now casual friendly and most of them are timed instances instead of being able to come and go like other zones. I guess it is a start but LDON I do not think will ever be the answer unless they change them up where all of the zones are not basicly a duplicate from the other camps and maybe make a few where you can just go in and play instead of having a time to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">maybe make a few where you can just go in and play instead of having a time to complete.<br />
<br />
You mean like Sewers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Are the Sewers like this ? I have no knowledge of GoD at all except for a couple trips over there. If the sewers are an instanced exp zone that is sweet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, they are instanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Even with that it is still leaves more of the zones where a lvl 65 character with 150AA must complete a quest of sorts or kill a boss mob to get access. My main issue was I just could not see buying another expansion where I might or might not be allowed into atleast 3/4 of the content without needing a raid to get access. The sewers are great but how much of GoD content is that. Now maybe if they let you pay for the expansion as you were able to open up zones might be an option but that still does nothing to bring the community back together where most zones could be accessed by all, so friends had more options of zones to fight in even if not all of them were in a large guild. I still like playing the under lvl 60 chars but that is because until level 60 most zones are open to all so there is never a question of where everyone can go.<br />
<br />
When someone needs to leave in the sewers can you replace them like other zones or do all have to zone out to pick up the new person? I stopped playing just after the GoD release when I started hearing there was already another expansion otw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">When someone needs to leave in the sewers can you replace them like other zones or do all have to zone out to pick up the new person?<br />
<br />
Yep...you can replace people at any time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You can replace people in sewer groups using the /dzadd and /dzremove commands, moving people in and out of your expedition, at any time. There *are* objectives that are supposed to be done, but there's no time limits unless you get to that part of the expedition and deliberately trigger it, there's no win/loss record or a leaderboard, so you can go in and grind all you like. Mobs respawn, and can respawn as named if you don't get any to spawn once you kill 20 (Sewers instance named only spawn - as either a named or a PH - when you either kill 20 mobs or 30 minutes passes. Vxed used to be like this, but when they reduced the # of kills for a win from 100 to 50, the # of kills before named spawn was also cut in half to 9-10.). Groups don't go to sewers all that often, so if you're forming a group and looking for people, look around for clerics/druids in upper tier guilds still missing their yiktu geomancy stones (Holy Light is **huge** for a cleric) and just about anyone that are working on the BiC quest and still need parts from sewers. BiC is the long, long gates quest with a few pieces from each zone - since sewer groups are rare, I'd imagine many people on your server still need pieces from there; I know I do. Even if you can't find people to join that are looking for stuff, the xp isn't half bad.<br />
<br />
I don't quite agree with Frodlin that the gap between BoT and KT can be bridged entirely with GoD single group stuff, but it's close; there's quite a bit of stuff spread out if you can find it, and Sewers are a part of that progression. I'm really not sure what a warrior would need to tank in KT at minimum, but one of the best tanks I've ever healed in Kod'Taz was a paladin with 6khp unbuffed that knew her class inside and out.<br />

Sewer mini-named are much like Ikkinz mini-named (DD and something like Airstrangler are two very different mobs) in that they're not really any harder than a trash mob, just a little more hp.

I've done Crematory with a 4khp unbuffed SK tank, and I've been 2-rounded pulling a trash mob in Lair at 6800hp self-buffed.</div></div><hr />

There is a full suit of warrior gear in the pre-Tipt zones that is around hard LDON quality or a little better (I think I never found a helmet, but one probably exists), and there are augments to be found too.  For those who need it, there is even a partial suit of lesser gear at normal-LDON quality in the earlier GoD zones, which you could use as a stepping stone.  It would take a while and wouldn't be too easy, but the progression path is there, and could theoretically be done starting with just cultural armor and epic-quality weapons.</div></div><hr />

The only GoD instanced zones I've done are sewer trials.  To get these you go to the temple in Barindu.  I don't know the person or words to ask though...someone else always does that for my groups.  (the don't let me be group leader...I'm just the meatshield  :p )</div></div><hr />

Hail the High Priest in the building near the temple. On the second hail he will give you a sewer expedition. The expedition can only be done by 6 people, and is instanced. There are four different sewer expeditions, and all must be completed in order to progress to the next tier of trials. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I listed some GoD warrior armor in this thread in the bunker (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8025).  There are also weaker pieces of armor than that, in Natimbi/Qinimi/Riwwi, which a young warrior could use as a stepping stone.  That armor list doesn't cover non-visible slots, since that thread was specifically about armor.<br />

Mokor made a pre-KodTaz warrior magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=528126&amp;alt=230751) which contains GoD gear in nearly every slot.  He missed the 125 hp shoulders that drop from random trash in Ferubi.  We never found a helmet in GoD, and only one earring, but every other slot is filled.</div></div><hr />
