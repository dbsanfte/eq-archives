As i was in PoTorment I picked up some ethreal bricks needed for the armor. Figuring I was doing pretty good, I strolled into the bazzar to check the prices of armor molds.<br />
<br />
OMG....WTF????? 100k for a bp mold. COME ON YOU CHEAP BASTRADS LOWER YOUR DAMM PRICES!!!<br />
<br />
I mean come on.... I can understand OOW items being high priced as the effect still hasent worn off yet, but come on 100k..<br />
<br />
So here comes the fun part, I expect some will say &quot;get off your lazy arse and lvl to get it&quot; or someone else who shall remain nameless will come on and say &quot;stfu you lazy whiner&quot; but i say what ever..... Its time these prices started to drop. If you can pick up higher end shit for alot less now, why not ornate???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember, aside from the new OoW armors, Ornate is the best stuff alot of people (me included) will ever have, so it makes sense for people's final armor to cost a lot. If it didn't, would you be satisfied having it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to post twice ... but this really eats my shorts and i'm not sure why.<br />
<br />
I can count on 2 fingers the BP's that are remarkably better than this in all/most aspects for warriors pre-Raex.  Yttrium seru bp and the Marbe BP from the rathe council.   Royal attendants may have a better hp/ac ratio but it's a lateral upgrade at best ... that and it requires a large timesink and the xp efficiency in ldon is moot.  RA also has no noticable clicky effect either.<br />
<br />
Ornate is good armor ... i imagine prices will fall on the smaller pieces, but not on the BP/Legs for a good long while.  The click alone is worth 50k to lots of people ... hell i know people who paid 200k back in the day just so they could have it in their bag for the click.  The same is true for ornate legs.<br />
<br />
So STFU .. not beause you're not uber ... not because i think you're lazy ... just because you're stupid and apparently to blind to see it.  As long as people such as yourself are content to buy your way to the top and there are retards buying platinum on ebay, there will be a market for Kizraks bp up and above 100k.  On my server they still float 150-200 so thank your lucky stars that you can get it so cheaply ... and thank your lucky stars that you can even buy it at all.  I know time geared warriors still wearing Kizraks bp because there is no noticable upgrade before Raex that's worth the investment.  Personally i find it stupid that you can buy it at all, but hey that's mudflation/eq for you.<br />
<br />
As far as i know you still can't buy any other bp that comes within spitting distance of the hp/stats on this for your chest slot ... not counting the invaluble click which make this bp worth keeping around permanently.<br />
<br />
Why when i was your age we had to go to Crushbone for our uber dwarven ringmail tunics!  And we had to cross orc hill going up hill both ways! .... In 2 feet of snow!!  ... and we LIKED it!<br />
<br />
*edit- ok 3-4 fingers ... there are a few luclin bps from VT that are also better (so shoot me)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Additionally, most people who farm Ornate arent ubers, they are like a moderately geared level 65ish warriors with moderately geared shamans and cleric bots doing it for the quick sell to buy better items for their bots or sell the platinum.</div></div><hr />

Magnetic BP damn close stats and on most servers is under 20k. If you have over 200 smithing skill you can make for under 10k.</div></div><hr />

Friend of mine got a shield drop and her first auction for it was for 300k and she sold it within 5 min. I understand you can camp this stuff, and I know that at lvl 55 I should be happy with what I have, but im not.<br />
<br />
I dont have a pocket shammy or cleric to help me out so I grind away. Ldon is one way but thats an even worse time. At my lvl everyone wants to do collects which for me gives a total of about 22 points and 5%xp. Is it worth it to waste away in the dungeons for a bunch of points i'll never see when i can got places with better xp?<br />
<br />
Guess my best bet is to go sit around in OOW and try to upgrade there.<br />
<br />
So there now I will STFU......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior friend of mine took a month off playing eq for fun and killed Hill Giants in rathe mountains for raw platinum at level 60, banking it and investing/trading with it.  He'd leave lfg up and only take groups from places he knew he could get high price drops in.  He also xp'd with a low level shaman/cleric and camped droga for the weapons to sell.  I laughed at him and told him he was wasting his time.<br />
<br />
1 month later the fucker had over 2 million platinum ... which he then spent on RZ helm, BoC, Ornate BP, ornate legs, SoD, CoF, 2 acid bracers, 2 earth rings, some random farwater plate, an EP bow .... get the picture?  It turned out his time investment was greater than my time investment in the long run.  There are lots of different ways you can get your shit in game, but all of them require the same basic ingredients: time and work.  <br />

Nobody's gonna make it happen for you, and creating yet another &quot;Mommy the uber man is keeping me down&quot; post won't fix a damn thing.</div></div><hr />

Get a group of friends(4-5 groups for your level) and Do Velious non-stop.<br />
Do NToV every time it spawns. AoW,Sleepers,Vindi,Tormax,Yeli. I mean, perma camp this crap. We loaded our twinks up on some very nice crap for free.<br />
<br />
This will also help you because you can get items to sell for heavy pp(Barb Mask, Flayed Barb Leggings, White Dragon Helm, Mithril Helm/Gaunts). Do something instead of complaining that &quot;ubers&quot; are holding you down, because your the only one holding yourself down.<br />

damn straight, prices are either ridiculously low or ridiculously high on xegony.  plus (for some reason) we seem to crash a bit more (or so i hear).  i will put more of the blame on the people who spend ALL of their time either farming or in the baz and then getting up several million plat before wreaking havoc on the prices.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it really is somewhat irritating to attempt to get anything done at level 55 that will get you armor anywhere close to ornate (seriously: the fastest way for you to upgrade is to run a bazaar trader for a month. Under no circumstances should you attempt to camp/loot/adventure your way to better armor, as you will not only be wasting your time, but the time of everyone who makes the error of going hunting with you. Even if your own time is worth nothing, for godsake be considerate of your guildmates, man, and refuse to tank anywhere but the fastest exp zone you can get to. Only the lazy and inefficient hunt for their stuff at that level, so you need to either get with the SOE program or just be proud of being so good at being lazy and inefficient that your friends will go places with you to watch you waste your time and their time tanking nasty mobs.)<br />
Worrying about the Uberness of toons 10 levels above yours can get you pretty wound up pretty fast.<br />
However, it can be an eye-opening experience to go to eqrankings.com and look at the authentic magelos of warriors at level 55. The top layer of warriors are obviously the twink alts of very rich players, but it's a handful. There are currently 38 level 55 authentic Magelos and if you have 1200 AC (can do with cultural in some slots) you'd be ranked 10th there. (And you don't lose ground looking at &quot;all&quot; Magelos, either: you'd be ranked 27th out of 100+ with 1200 AC).<br />
If you had 1304 AC you'd be 3rd, and I'm not sure what's up with the top guys but they are certainly not progressing normally as a warrior main.<br />
So, you, know, I'd just relax. If you're in the upper half on that list (say, 1145 AC and 3300 hps) just go fight in places that are fun to you.</div></div><hr />

Lets all suggest instead of required level on items how about required days played on alot of items and stop all this &quot;I hate them ubers&quot; shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it is a hell of a lot cheaper to make a magnetic BP, if you're willing to spend a little time killing lightning diodes and strategists.  You'll need the dented/crushed BP piece and another random piece to break down for magnetic metal plate patches and magnetic bolts.  So if you farm the &quot;molds&quot; yourself you'll probably spend about 50pp max on vendor bought pieces (ie. bolt mold, copper sheets, etc.)</div></div><hr />

I am no where near being in the uber club.  Have yet to even see Sol Ro Tower, even though all I am expecting to get is a lousy T-Shirt.<br />
<br />
Ubers have something you want, obviously there is something they want as well.  The low-end crap.  Take Spiderling Silks as an example.  Mind numbingly boring, but I was floored seeing someone buy them for 20pp each.  The stuff you sell to the uber today, will more than likely be the uber you buy from later on.  Its a viscious cycle.  The trick is finding out what is the hot item on the market, and work towards that goal.  Not everything that is selling at a mad rate is beyond a person's grasp.<br />
<br />
Along with time and patience.  I mean look at a Stonewood Compound Bow.  I spent 60k on mine, and now I see people sellin em for 35k.<br />
<br />
My only saving grace is my original toon was a cleric.  So I can whore out 225 min Virtue in PoK on days I don't really want to go grind.  I know I spit my drink out of my mouth when I was asked to do a rez run to Umbral Plains and was given 2k to rez 3 people, and buff them.</div></div><hr />

At 55 I think I was wearing an enchanted dwarven breastplate, and upgraded to a scarred acid tunic (Not sure on the actual name).<br />
<br />
At 64 I FINALLY got my Champion's Breastplate, I was so pumped after weeks of camping one.  Then the next day I won a Vindi BP on a small raid, it wasn't nearly as rewarding as the Champ's BP but it was a bit better for the HP and saves plus the invigorate clicky when I actually solo something.<br />
<br />
I didn't get ornate until level 66, but that was after selling numerous OoW drops.  I love this expansion, it's making me rich (&lt;3 Earrings of Lushest Foliage $$)</div></div><hr />

Luck has little to do with it. Bossbeachball isn't having &quot;luck.&quot; Boss is doing what Boss sets out to do in game.<br />
<br />
That's not an attack on Boss or you. So please don't take it that way. (This is the outhouse, so people might think it's an attack. It isn't).<br />
<br />
It's just the way the game goes. Some people focus more on doing the things Boss does. Others focus more on doing other things in game, and leave loot rolls or whatever up to luck. For example, maybe Boss farms those ornate molds he sells marked up on purpose as a way to raise plat? Plat he fully intends to sell to Yantis for money? That means luck isn't going to matter here, as Boss is going to do what Boss has to do, to achieve that goal. <br />
<br />
Again, to reiterate, I'm not knocking anyone for doing what they do.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to contribute ... at 55 I was wearing a Fungi. The same Fungi I wore until 65.</div></div><hr />

well lets see .. how should i put this ...<br />

get off your lazy arse and lvl to get it. you sound like a teenager whinging about the price of a ferarri.</div></div><hr />

Oops...I can't believe I overlooked the fact that he was level 55.  The best way to get one if you don't want to spend the pp, is to actually take the time, get your sash, head, beard, and bone from PoStorms and get BoT keyed.  Then get a couple groups and got wtfpwn that boss in the water tower and earn your own ornate BP mold.  It would probably be a hell of a lot more satisfying to earn it.  If I'm not mistaken I think a Windworn Chestplate has similar stats to the Kizrak BP w/o the clicky and used to run for around 20k...so that might be an alternative for you, too.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to burst the bubble, but over time the prices on ornate will probably be going up.  It's not like people getting upgrades in oow can resell their ornate, and with a lot of people playing in the oow zones there will be less people farming ornate which will drive the price up on certain items in which there isn't a one groupable upgrade in oow (bp, have to have the clickie, bracers are really great for clerics, etc.)</div></div><hr />
