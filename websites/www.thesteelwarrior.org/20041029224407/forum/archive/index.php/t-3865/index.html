<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Master_race(tm)</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Threw an Anger III aug into my great blade of storms, mainhanding it with BoC in offhand has proven to be amazing aggro. I practically spam myself with &quot;blah blah with rage..&quot; It's great and anyone who has this sword I fully recommend getting that anger III aug for it. <br />
<br />
Much &lt;3 for the Chatja!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GBoS with yak proc is killer too.<br />
<br />
Can use a shield if I want to no prob, and when I feel frisky, can have GBoS+Yak in main, and CHoS+Fire DD in off hand. 4 DD's proccing is fun spamage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice, just got GBoS and cat wait to aug it with angerIII, pls explain the agro improvement, may be matching the one on a BoC? or i just need to get a grip :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Master_race(tm)</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Before I got the anger 3 aug I mainhanded the BoC and offhanded the GBoS. When I grouped with my guildmates, aggro was a problem because the ones I group with are dual weilding Plane of Time weapons/Elemental God weapons and doing massive damage. After adding Anger3 to the GboS I don't have remotely NEAR the aggro problems I had before. The only times where I don't snap aggro on me within the first 15 seconds of the fight is if someone else pulls. It is a significant difference imho.<br />
<br />
And to answer your question the augmented gbos blows the BoC out of the water as far as aggro goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about a GBoS with anger 3 and a BoC with anger 3? Even copper hammer with yak proc will outaggro BoC with 1 proc, but if they both have 2 procs...Of course, either one is great aggro, i can keep aggro well with BoC w/ anger 3 and stormrider carapace(shield)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I updated a GSoT with an anger mod over the weekend.  I hold agro through shaman slows now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Master_race(tm)</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How about a GBoS with anger 3 and a BoC with anger 3? <br />
<br />
Well at that point I don't think aggro is even a question. It's going to be there. I would think the next logical step would be maximizing DPS. That would put you with GboS mainhanded with the BoC offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Flair, fill me in on GSoT + Anger 3 since you have one.

No prob Wompem.  I actually only Modded with an Anger 2 (200 pts from opening 1150 on Mir tree).   I have Ferocity 3 and PB2 if that helps with your context.<br />
<br />
The folks I usually group with are some former comrades from an elemental guild (I am by far the weakest equipped as I quit the raiding scene pre VT).  The main agro contenders I have are a well elemental equipped Wizard and Paladin (my paladin friend is about 10k buffed and has a nice array of mind boggling weapons).  Usually if the pallie is around we have him pull/tank and I do off tanks in LDoN....if he isnt I tank and chain pull with the group going flat out most nights regardless of pong.<br />
<br />
Before I modd'd my GSoT:<br />
<br />
1. I couldnt use it with less than enchanter haste and even come close to offsetting agro against the ellie wizzie and/or slower.  Mobs ponged like crazy.  I wound up using my CHSD/Bloodsworn just to keep agro..even though it cost me DPS.<br />
<br />
2. In a toe to toe with my pallie friend (periodically as old friends we test against each other) it was just plain sad.  Rarely would I grab agro off him.<br />
<br />
Now:<br />
<br />
1. the double stun/anger 2 proc lets me use GSoT with self haste only and keep agro.  If a mob pongs odds are I'll have it back fairly rapidly. <br />
<br />
2. In a toe to toe...with him stunning (we were screwin around that night I got it) I can take agro about 50 pct of the time.  So much so that I use WMBS if I'm off tanking so that I dont grab agro from him by accident<br />
<br />
The anger mods are a wonderful thing.  For high end warrs they are a nice boost up.  I'm afraid though for the point cost that mid level warrs don't get to see the same benefit.<br />
<br />
My next goal is to add an anger 3 to my CHSD and see what havoc unfolds ;-).  I cant tell you which way to go (GSoT 2x mod vs dual wield EB 2x mods)...personally I'm sold on big 2 handers...unfortunately LDoN had a dearth of them (but a nice selection of 1 handers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for the input on the GSoT with the Anger mod, flair....I just posted a new thread asking that very question.<br />
<br />
Unless you have access to a 1H weapon with a hate proc, the built-in agro proc on the GSoT plus either of the LDoN Anger procs sounds like it would be the best bet for agro managament....and the added bonus of a decent (agreed: not awesome!) DPS weapon with the 2 handed staff.</div></div><hr />
