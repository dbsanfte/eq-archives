<br />
I'm sure stuff like the Black Acrylia short/long swords, Black Blade of Tormenting, Blood Fire, etc, was already ranked once.  A secondary sticky post with weaps like these (and ones that get &quot;retired&quot; off the BLOB (Big List O' Baddies) would be extremely helpful for other n00bs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you got the cash, the frostbringer and some nice ratio offhander is all you need, snare whip wouldnt be bad if you really need the agro, but doubt its that critical. dun think another sticky post will help all that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">listing all possible aggro weapons in a sticky thread would use up all of TSW's webspace.  thats why they dont do it .... and theres so many out there, noone knows em all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undafut</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, really just thinking that one sticky ranking the ones that always get asked about might prevent the front page from having the same question asked in 4 different threads, again and again and again.  Far more wasteful of webspace, isn't it?<br />
<br />
There are a lot of folk who will never really see most of the weapons on the top 10 list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah id have to agree there. there are so many repeated posts about what weapon holds aggro for those who cant attain the top ten, and there are a lot who can't that i say it makes sense to have it. should cut down the no of threads on this at the very least.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a few problems with this idea and the top one is there is fun in finding out yourself, why take someones word for it?<br />
<br />
    Next, NO ONE knows which is best and which is worst.   I cant tell how many times I have read a thread when one guy loves weapon A and the next hates it, who is right?   Just look at the argo weapon list how many peeps agree about the order of weapons on it or even which weapons should be on it and your talking about a list at least 10 times bigger.<br />
    <br />
    A biggie for me is I dont want the same weapon every wanabe tank in the world has, I want something that works for me and no one else has.    Take the Windblade, its an awe some weapon but every tank in the game has one.   I love my GreatStaff of Thunder, little less damage but a lot better taunt and I see maybe 1 a month on CT.<br />
