<br />
1. Breaking mez, how to do it?<br />
<br />
Currently I taunt target, then use my berate disc, then attack.  I only taunt once, fail or succeed (just hate standing there waiting for another taunt), then proceed to pummel.   Is this correct?<br />
<br />
2.  Multiple mob pulls.  This question applies to single groups.  Ok, I know this varies widely depending on the makeup of the crew, but when do you switch from primary to another target?  To date, I've only switched off my first target if either A) a casters HP is dropping rapidly, or B) another mob arrives that has priority (ie, healer or caster).<br />
<br />
3. I'm currently using GSOT for my 2h, and COHS, and Seared Cleaver from sol C.<br />
<br />
Any recommendations for new weapons?  In terms of armor, I mostly have Fierce Heraldic stuff, but I do have about 1400 ldon points to spend (albeit in MM, which I've looked at and there are a few augs, but no warrior armor really)<br />
<br />
Any pointers in the right direction would be super,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I taunt...if successful, I then kick, attack, then disarm.  If the taunt is not successful, or if the mob still turns from me after mez is off, then I use incite to try and get the mob back to me.  Often, however, I'll get a stun from the kick then time enough to generate enough aggro without Incite.<br />
<br />
Generally, I only switch if I'm main assist, there are other mobs in camp, and the current mob is either in flee mode, or is about to die with enough tanks on it already to finish it.  Of course, emergencies happen...so switching to a dotted target that can't be mez'd or whatever will happen.   Also, occassionally, when we're dealing with difficult mobs in camp, even after crowd control is established, I'll briefly target off mobs and hit them with Incite if it's charged to begin the aggro building process...and let the hate...flow...<br />
<br />
Armor/weapons depend on where you hunt, and what your bank roll is.  The EF LDON armor is not bad, though personally I prefer to save up for the Takish armor, myself...but the EF is just fine for most warriors, and much more economical.  Weaponry, the GSoT is a good weapon...and it'd be hard to find a more economical weapon for efficiency until you see a better one drop in front of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also switch camera angles and incite a mezzed mob that's behind you, then when you are ready to kill it you're already higher up on the hate list, and if it breaks mez you have a good shot at being the person it runs for.  Usually, if I'm breaking mez, I'll taunt again if the first taunt fails, if the second one fails I just wait a couple of seconds so that the chanter wont get hit for more than a few seconds before the timer refreshes and I can taunt again, break it and hope the 3rd taunt works.  If the 3rd taunt fails, incite and hope for the best.  If you have it, and it's up, AE taunt is always a good last ditch effort too.</div></div><hr />

There are two zonelines, one in Sol A (passed sol goblin area) and the other in Sol B (near the upper-bats camp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given no other overriding concerns, I will generally attempt to taunt a mob 3 times if I don't get a success.   The little bit of extra time is worth it if you can avoid going through rezzing the chanter and all that that entails. <br />
<br />
Peeling off and attacking a second mob is extremely situational.   Who are they attacking?  If they're on a Shaman who's trying to root park them, then the shaman can take a few hits - I'll give them some time to try and do their job but keep on eye on their hitpoints.  Secondly - who are the other melees? - if they are capable of occupying the original mob and taking some damage for a while, then you have more freedom to go help someone else.  And lastly, what's the impact on the group?  I like to keep everyone alive if possible, but, in general, letting your cleric die is going to have a lot more impact than losing a chanter or a mage, for example, so I may take additional risks to save the cleric. <br />
<br />
If there is a second mob rooted or mezzed, I will always peel off the first one as soon as it runs (unless it's unsnared and is too close to other mobs), and begin to deal with the second one.  <br />
<br />
Finally - always have a plan.  When I'm in pick-up groups (and I'm always in pick-up groups) where mez MAY not be available for whatever reason, I always make one of the first things I ask 'what's the plan for adds?'  You'd be surprised (or maybe you wouldn't) how much it can help just having everyone aware of the general plan, and how often it appears that no one really thought much about this until it was asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do like you with mez breaking - get a successful taunt, Incite, then break. I have yet to have someone pull a mob I broke mez on with that routine.<br />
<br />
 Multi mobs? As Xenephex says, it's situational.<br />
<br />
 Thirdly, your weapons are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both questions are situational.  If it's say Hard LDoN or Ele planes xp group I wait for a succesful taunt + incite then break with slam into melee.  However if it's normal ldon I usually just break right after the first taunt success or not, chanters/bards can tank that trash basically so doesn't matter much heh, just want to kill and move on. <br />
<br />
Multi mobs situational, if they're easy stuff like normal LDoN and there's no CC and a cleric or druid in group I just tank multiples at once.  If it's say a resisted mez on stuff that hits fairly hard, I turn off attack, switch targets then taunt + incite off the chanter then switch back to the main target so they can land mez while I tank both, key is nondmg tanking the add really.  Nice to have a /shield hot key ready to for those situations and be familiar with your toggle between targets key, whatever you have it mapped to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the good information, I have a few additional questions based on the last post here.<br />
<br />
Toggle targets... this is something I've been using the mouse for, is there a better way to toggle between multiple targets that are in camp?  Do you have to target each mob once before this function works?<br />
<br />
/Shield.  I haven't used this yet, and I think I may be missing something useful, is this something that most warriors find useful?  My reading of it is that you basically act as a meatshield for whoever you target with /shield.  Can you still taunt/incite/attack when this is on?  Does it take effect instantly?<br />
<br />
Thanks much-<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Breaking mez<br />
As has been said, it depends. Ideally, you'd taunt until you get a successful taunt, then break mez with attacks. Poof, you have aggro. If you toss in your berate after a successful taunt, you probably won't lose aggro at all until the mob dies. If you don't want to wait the extra 6 seconds each time a taunt fails, a quick risk evaluation is in order. Is the enchanter/bard going to able to take a few hits while you try to regain aggro? The answer invariably depends on the damage output of the mob in question, and how well equipped said mezzer is. In normal xp groups like in BoT for example a reasonably equipped bard can take a few hits, as could an enchanter with a fresh rune - but you really don't want this to happen. The extra time is worth it when the mobs hit really hard. In a normal LDoN I will generally just taunt once, hit incite, and attack. If taunt fails, I'll wait a couple seconds while incite ticks, and then break. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't but in a normal LDoN there isn't a lot of risk for the most part. In summary, wait for a successful taunt, optionally use berate, then attack and you're pretty much guaranteed aggro. When time is of the essence, analyze the risk before making a decision.<br />
<br />
2) Changing targets<br />
Changing targets once you've engaged is almost always a no-no, especially when you have a chanter or a bard on crowd control. Let them do their jobs. You'll likely just confuse the people that use you for /assist, break mezzes, and get people killed. Even lacking a mezzer, you will almost always have at least one class that can root-park and/or snare kite an add should the situation require it. As Xenephex mentioned, the best strategy is to know what you're going to do BEFORE it happens. Make sure everyone knows what their roles are, and what everyone else's roles are. The wizard may not know that he's expected to be on root detail, or the necro might not realize that you need him to snare kite an add unless it's already been established. Like you noted, switching targets to engage a priority target, like an unmezzable/unrootable/whatever is acceptable, but everyone has to KNOW. This is a hotkey I always have on my first page:<br />
/g I am engaging [ %T ] - Please assist me NOW<br />
/rs I am engaging [ %T ] - Please assist me NOW<br />
Do whatever suits you, but if you HAVE TO change targets don't do it without telling your group. <br />
<br />
3) Weapons<br />
Your weapons sound fine. They should last you a long while.<br />
<br />
4) Toggle targets<br />
In options/keyboard/targeting you can bind whichever key you like to 'Toggle last two targets' or whatever it's called. Myself, I have it bound to CAPSLOCK. I use WADS for movement, Q to target the nearest NPC, E to target the nearest PC, and TAB to toggle between myself and my last target. Bind the toggle key to whatever is most convenient to you. It only works for two targets - the last two that you have actually targeted whether you acquired the targets by mouse, nearest NPC key, /assist, or whatever. It's a useful key. Bind it to something that you won't have to search for, and play around with it.<br />
<br />
5) /Shield<br />
Essentially this takes 50% of the damage that a mob was going to do to another PC, and applies 75% of the original damage to you. Say a mob swings at your shaman for what would have been 200 damage. Since the shaman is being shielded by you, he only takes 100 points of damage, while you take 150 points of damage. This can be a useful skill for saving the hides of your more fragile partners. Personally, I use /shield every time taunt fails, assuming the skill is available at the moment. My hotkey is like this:<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 4<br />
/shield<br />
This will assist the mob that I just tried to taunt. The '/pause 4' is there only to compensate for the slight lag that the /assist sometimes takes to actually switch targets. Once /shield goes off, hit your toggle-last-two-targets key, and get back on the taunting train. As has been said, disciplines and /shield don't stack. I believe the message it uses in-game is something like, &quot;Neither parties in a /shield link may be using a discipline.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope some of this is useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changing targets once you've engaged is almost always a no-no <br />
<br />
This is pretty much the rule to live by. I regret changing targets 90% of the time when I deam it a good idea given the present situation. It really throws a cog in the machine so to speak.<br />
<br />
Changing to the named, or even a healer happens. That's the 10% where it's a good idea, but I always make sure to hit my /g ASSIST ME IN KILLING &lt;&lt;&lt; %t &gt;&gt;&gt; button 2 times when I do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakaris</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For breaking mez, I use taunt once (success or failure), then Incite and then I attack with kick and then autoattack. If the mob then attack the enchanter or the slower or whatever, I /shield them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I try and break mez from behind-with bash, and do seem to generate a high number of stuns that way. <br />
<br />
That said, I almost never wait for a successful taunt, particularly in LDoN.</div></div><hr />
