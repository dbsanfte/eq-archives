<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ehlohir</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all!  Just turned 49 and leveling like crazy.  Like most warriors of my level, I have been busy capping my weapon skills (just finished Piercing, 1hb, 1hs, and 2hs - omw to 2hb!! Love MAULS!).<br />
<br />
So here is my question, does anyone make the effort to max their Bash, Throwing, or Hand to Hand skills.  I know that some of use use a shield to stun/taunt but with kick giving stun at 55, is it useful.  ( I should mention I am a wood elf and do not have slam).<br />
<br />
Are these skills just for fun or so they actually have a real purpose in the game?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I love BIG HAMMERS and can anyone tell me what a really kewl looking 2HB is?  For example, been training with a Bed Leg Club (1hb) and not only is it wicked fast for training, but looks KICKASS!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help all!</div></div><hr />

<br />
H2H is fairly useless since there are no warrior usable H2H weapons. I think my skill is 3 due to the occasional punch thrown while switching out weapons.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I never used throwing. But I have known a few warriors who had that bracer that summons hammers. Since nowadays most of the best range items in the game are bows, I doubt too many warriors use throwing.</div></div><hr />

Capping it isn't difficult though.  When mobs were snared and running, I would remove my weapon as we finished it off, and got it maxed in a few days.<br />
<br />
As for throwing, one reason many use it is because you can get items with unlimited charges of summon throwing items.  Either the bracer from Skyshrine or the bag from Ssra are the common ones.  But with the Bloody Ancilles Pouch, arrows are no longer much of a hassle, though it does have a component.<br />
<br />
Bash is the only one of those 3 I haven't maxed, simply due to the fact that I use a 2hander, it's not as easy to ghetto bash.  It's not very useful unless you can slam.</div></div><hr />
