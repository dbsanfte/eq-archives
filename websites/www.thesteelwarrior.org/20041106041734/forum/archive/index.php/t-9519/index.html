<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LotharoftheHillPeopl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have now finished maxing my 2hs 2hb and piercing and need to get back to what I do more damage with.  My 1hs and 1hb have been falling behind in damage recently.  I just hit level 37 and am wondering if there is room for an upgrade.   I am looking for something for 10k or under that could be used to replace my Blackened Acrylia Blade or my Ethereal.........(its in my magelo).  I see alot of people using a SoBS and am wondering if it would be more or less effective than what I have at this level.  Howabout CHoS?  Here's my magelo for anyone to see what Im currently using.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I here this all the time.  I know my gear is plenty sufficient for my level.  But what I want to know is what is better for me.  I plan on hitting 45 by the end of the week.  What will help me get there faster.  (Being PLed by a 60 druid)<br />

Well then, since you're so smart, all you need to do is head to the bazaar, sort by price, and buy the most expensive thing you see.  That would be better for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol Haass<br />
<br />
If you are being powerleveled by a druid then your weapons don't matter because you are using the damage shield for DPS. Just wait til 50 and get CHoS and SotBS.</div></div><hr />

Sorry if I made myself sound conceded there.  This is my first war and I am trying to make sure he has all the right stuff once I get to a higher level.  A better question would be; Since the SotBS and CHoS seem to be the most highly suggested weapons available.  At What level would these become efficient to use.  The CHoS doesnt proc until 50 I believe but I think the SotBS does at 40.  Would it be best to buy a the SotBS at 40-45 and use it with the Blackened Acrylia LS or should I wait until 50 with the weapons I have, then purchase the other two?<br />
Thanks<br />
Lothar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes.  buy the sotbs now and use acrylia offhand, then get chos at 50 and use that main hand with sotbs secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used a similar combo till 40 and held agro just fine. <br />
<br />
You must be someone who likes to upgrade stuff a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i used to use Bloodguard Wand of Walking Dead (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23242) and Razor-Edged Shan`Tok (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20853) before i got my droga combo.  That wasnt too bad of a combo if i do say so myself, even though theres no procs...its what i had and managed to hold agro (mostly in BB ldons)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because pre 50 or so, you don't need procs to hold aggro.  You'll do just fine with any old piece of trash you can find laying around.<br />
<br />
The only time you need to worry about aggro is really when Casters start getting mana regen that lets them do more than nuke once a fight.<br />
<br />
And for the love of god dude, shrink down that sig a little.  I like ya's and all, but fuck, that sucks to scroll past every time :p</div></div><hr />

Okay, if you're serious about this, don't upgrade your weapons. Don't do all your leveling with the druid. Group now. Group with people you know who you know know how to play their classes, then group in pick up groups. Learn to read what your group is doing and how they are doing it. In pick up groups, learn as fast as you can who can play and who cannot and make any adjustments you can. Watch in particular what happens when personel changes in a group. Certain changes will cut or increase healing, runners, adds, crowd control, dps, buffs.<br />
Know the buffs others can cast on you, what they will do for you, whether they require reagents. If someone fails to cast a buff on you that you know is useful, ask politely, in a tell, for the buff as time and mana allow.<br />
Let your groupmates know when critical buffs are about to fade.<br />
Time the mob spawns everywhere you fight. this should be automatic and you should be able to do it in your head. Know the characteristics of the mobs in the zone: their relative ATK, hps, MR, pathing, aggro radius, potential to run.<br />
Start positioning mobs now, and never stop doing it. Position with respect to pets, to group members, to the pathing of other potential wandering mobs; stay within range of your casters. There is always an optimal position to tank a mob in. At your level, it hardly matters whether you position the mob optimally, but do it anyway. Practice when it doesn't matter, not when it does. Do this when it doesn't matter, do it when it does, do it early, often, always, and twice on Tuesdays.<br />
Know and use your abilities and capacities. Range weapons, /shield, slam/bash, bind wound, sit, taunt, proximity aggro, incite line--use 'em all, use 'em in the right order at the right time. Is your group on a med break and your shaman is canning? Are you standing there at full hitpoints doing nothing, rather than using your BW skill to make the shaman's canning 1/3rd more efficient? Is the mob you're fighting a caster? is your bash/slam up? Do you see a casting message?<br />
Know the abilities of your groupmates' classes, and do what you can to help them do their jobs, particularly enchanters who are attempting to mez mobs.<br />
Judge the feel of the power of your group. How fast can they kill mobs? how much rest do your casters need? Ask mana. If healer/crowd control is low, you call the break. If a caster needs a med break, always second the motion, especially for healers/crowd control. Med breaks are shorter than corpse runs. If group is not out of mana, pull faster, but ramp that up gradually: a bad puller believes that faster pulling is always better, but a good puller pulls at the maximum rate the group can kill, with very little time under or over that optimal risk/return curve.<br />
Know the levels and classes of everyone in your group and where they are set up. Watch the health bars of your groupmates. You shouldn't have to look for your cleric when his hp bar starts to drop--you should already know where the cleric was set up. Know where the mobs are. If more than one mob comes to camp, you should have a darn good reason for tanking them in a certain order. There is always an optimal order. Tanking in the optimal order may not matter at the level of the mobs you're fighting now, but there will nevertheless be an optimal order and that's the order you should tank 'em in always. Practice when it doesn't matter not when it does.<br />
Be cheerful, calm, and don't be afraid to talk strategy with groupmates. Don't run out of arrows, water or food when you're fighting. Don't whine when you die: it means that the mob was hitting you, which was a good thing.<br />
In some ways tanking as a warrior is made up of a whole lot of little things, none of which matter by themselves, but all of which matter in the aggregate.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nice post Brabble!  It is so true that someone who's been PL'd to ooberdom really has little to no idea how to play their class to the level that someone who has gone through it all how it was meant to be played.  It still amazes me to this day how some high level players don't know even the simplest aspects of their class.<br />
<br />
When I started playing this game a few years ago, all my RL friends were in their late 40s early 50s.  When I hit level 10, one of them made me a full suit of banded and gave me a hand made backpack.  Other than that, I was left to fend for myself.  Sure I got a few hand me downs here and there (Walrus Tooth was teh oober!!) but they were few and far between.  For that, I'm greatful...this game is about the road, NOT the destination and those that don't realize this are sorely missing out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LotharoftheHillPeopl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Brabble,  I thank you greatly for your imput,  I am knowledgeable of the game to a high amount seeing as I have been playing for about 3 years.   I figured I knew alot of what it takes to play a warrior but apparently haven't.  I think I underestimate my gear mostly because my main is a monk (68).  And I have been trying to keep at par the soloing ability of a monk that I am used to in a melee class.  Aggro had never been a factor and it was something I had generally tried to avoid.  I keep up my taunt and try to keep my weapon delay as low as possible while using the AC, hp, sta formula to keep up my tanking ability.  I will continue to research the things you have posted above and again, thank you for your help.<br />
With gratitude,<br />
Lothar</div></div><hr />

Well, take what I say with a grain of salt. I'm 3/4ths crank.<br />
Good players who take up a new class will often be good at the class, simply because they've seen examples of other players, good and bad, playing that class. They know what it's like to play with a skilled tank/caster/melee/whatever and notice the difference in what bad players and good players do. But it's also the case that it's difficult to play a second toon as well as you would a main. At least, it is for me. I started a shaman alt partly because one day I grouped with a shaman who explained that the buff I wanted &quot;really didn't do anything for tanks&quot; and I thought, &quot;Hmmm. I just paid half my savings to increase those very stats and it's too much trouble for this guy to buff me?&quot;<br />
So, heh, I like the stuff shaman can do, and I like how much they can improve a group, but when I move from the shaman to the warrior I always experience a deep sense of relief. The sort of relief you feel going from only knowing what you're doing 1/3rd of the time to knowing what you're doing 1/2 the time.  :D</div></div><hr />
