<br />
yeah they will be cheaper in 6 months....but why wait if you can use the upgrade now......silly to be greedy</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not greed, it's simple economics.<br />
<br />
On a level 50 warrior, the difference between this, and any of the various 1k weapons in the bazaar will be minimal.  Better to sell it now to people with huge bankrolls clamoring over new stuff.  In 6 months, when your warrior is 65 with 100 AA&quot;s, and could use a new weapon, you open up the ol' bazaar screen and see it listed for 25k.  In the meantime, you've either gotten better gear in other slots, or you threw one helluva party.  You win either way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, if you get a great sellable drop early, sell it fast.  However, the time for the prices to drop is measured in weeks, not months.  The Edge of Envelopment started off selling at well over 100k, on my server, I picked one up for 60k the other day (most people still are trying to get 80-90k out of these).  At 60k, I over paid, but can do it since other people over paid for the stuff I sold.  <br />
<br />
The key to buying is patience.  The key to selling is patience except for after a new expansion, sell it fast.  If you get too greedy and mark up your price, you may not sell and loose out due to the market dropping.</div></div><hr />
