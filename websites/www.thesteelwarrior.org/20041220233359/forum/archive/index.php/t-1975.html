I would say it was either from here:<br />

<br />
or here:<br />

http://www.rumormillnews.com/ <br />
<br />
LOL, but seriously, bard, druid (has two actually), ranger, and cleric (which they said they would never do) have spawnable mobs.  Though your going to despise it if they make you hunt in EJ farming four shards to put in a box that you can only get from a camp in SOLB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone can camp Sev, it is just  a matter of how much effort one wants to put into obtaining their epic.  If you wait for it to be handed to you on a silver platter you are in for a rude awakening.  You may have to /gasp, get help from friends or guildees and track mob spawns and deaths for months.  Sure it sucks but anyone can do it.  Heck, if you don't have friends to track you can make a low level mage I think (sense summoned) and park it in EJ and check now and again.  Of course if you don't have enough friends to help you track it, it is doubtful that you will be able to muster the fast support needed to kill Sev when he does spawn.<br />
<br />
Now with the level increases, AA, new readily obtainable gear and all, anyone can get their epic if they are willing to put forth the effort.  I cannot think of an epic mob that cannot be killed by 2 high levels groups with ease.  I want to say one group but I am positive 2 groups are safe.<br />
<br />
IMO, epic parts should not be campable in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

With all our big mobs having been on rotations since Kunark, Sev was on a rotation.  That would be good in and of itself, if Sev wasn't such a pussy now.  Currently 28 guilds on the rotation.  At a 7 day spawn (maybe) that's over half a year wait between Sev killings, and as you know, he doesn't drop the scale every kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well he drops it like 95% and it's not that easy if you work everyday from 8-5 on saturdays your mostly raiding day with guild then sundays is family day try camping something for 24 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point it seems pretty irrelevant whether or not Sev is spawnable. 10-20k in the Bazaar buys you a Greatstaff of Thunder, which is at least comparable to the epic, if not better.</div></div><hr />

I know it would be tough for me to put together a force capable of killing a kunark dragon in the time required to beat everyone else to the damned thing, and I'm not alone in that.

I'd like to see a spawnable Sev, even if it did mean I had to camp 'pearl shards' or something for a few days.  It would at least give me and some others a chance.<br />

I don't recall reading anywhere in this thread saying this meant Epic v2.  I personally think it would be great if people could spawn Sev, god knows I spent forever camping that stupid dragon (and I still don't have epic :D).

I've had my Ball of Everliving Golem since level 49 (I was actually 1 of 2 warriors who still needed the ball, so they gave one to me and one to the other). I've had a red scale since level 40, but Sev has always been a thorn in my side.<br />
<br />
I camped him for a week straight before PoP Release, found him up once, and had him stole.<br />
<br />
Twice more he was stolen by a burn squad to sell the scale for cash.<br />
<br />
Last time we were engaging and a CH got messed up, tank went down and then everyone else did, once we got ressed and start to rebuff we saw a member of an opposing raid force come running toward our camp with Sev in tow... so that was that.<br />
<br />
4 Attemps, 0 Wins, No 70k to pay for a Scale, No Epic. :(  :(</div></div><hr />

I think all told from start to doing the combine was around 8 months.  Sev I camped for a couple weeks before he was pwnd while I was offline, handed the scale the next day.  Then again... I got my Epics at hmm lvl 58 or so when 60 was the max... I believe this was early-mid velious.<br />

VP dragon has got to be a better plan for 90% of the warriors out there.  He wanders right to the zone in for heaven's sake, his lair is a 30 second run from zone in, he's practically always up, and he drops the scale at least half of the time.  Camping Sev for 6-12 months is absurd, when you can kill Trakanon 5 times in 2 weeks, and then take 20 people to VP for a one-hour Hoshkar raid.</div></div><hr />

Umm....no you can't.<br />
<br />
Trakanon is a 7 day spawn...<br />
<br />
2 Weeks is 14 days...<br />
<br />
14/7=2<br />
<br />
Well, that makes 2 kills in 2 weeks, dont have any idea where the heck you got 5 from.<br />
<br />
And if you think that the teeth drop from th spawned trakanon, you are very wrong, becuase the certainly do not.</div></div><hr />

In 15 days you could get 3 trak kills and he drops 4-6 teeth each kill. So you could have 12-18 ppl keyed up in 15 days. Assuming that the tooth is the only part they had left.<br />
<br />
The prob with Hosh is his massive regen rate. Been on 8 VP raids.<br />
First 2 dropped scale for other Warriors. Then when it was my turn up for scale we were rotating VP with another two guilds. Dropped for them and not us &gt;&lt;. But did finally get my lightsabers. Managed to get a decent collection of VP weapons also :-p<br />
<br />
Don't care if there are better weapons out there now. I'll use the epics for a bit then might think about getting other weapons. Do have a GSoT for 2HB skilling though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Epics&quot; pretty much novelties and toys for most classes at L65. The main use I get out of my epics at this point is that I can equip them for when in town and people won't bug me to link them. The classes that do retain an actual value of their epic at this point do not have enough upgrade options to retire the thing or said upgrades are not attainable for them.</div></div><hr />

I dont have 300k for a boc and my guild cannot take out the mob that drops it.  The only weapon that i know of thas equall is the one that drops off the poi dragon--and then again thats if i win a roll against 10 other people wanting it.<br />

I wield a sword of the blood and a ChOs.  Are you saying that these 2 weapons are better than a weapon that procs pure hate?  <br />
  <br />
<br />
I know I may well get flamed for this, but IMO pure hate isn't as good as its cracked up to be. I use Blade of Carnage, Sceptre of Destruction, and Great Blade of Storms as my aggro weapons. I also have epics, and used them for many months, though I have them banked now.<br />
<br />
While I can't speak for CHoS/SotBS directly, SoD's anarchy proc was definetly more aggro than Rage of Vallon. Stuns + DDs are definetly big aggro, and so is +hate, but it's not like you can get one hate proc, and turn off attack and go afk. <br />
<br />
As for SoD and GBoS vs BoC, I really don't notice much difference in the aggro per proc or aggro per fight between the weapons (this is where I'm going to get flamed I'm sure). In fact I usually use SoD/GBoS when exp camping. I hold aggro quite well, though of course not perfectly and there are still occassional aggro problems. However, if I put my BoC in it's not a magic cure all. I can still have problems at times with it too.<br />
<br />
There is one situation where BoC really shines over SoD or GBoS though, and that would be on very resistant mobs (Seru and Emperor are the best examples of mobs I fight now). Resists still generate aggro, though they don't seem to generate as much. Enraging blow can't be resisted though, of course.<br />
<br />
Anyways overall my point is that pure hate is not always clearly better than a stun (or debuff I suppose for that matter). And even though I haven't used CHoS/SotBS, I would be willing to bet that they're both better than the red epic, in the main hand at very least (24 delay is just too slow for a main hand weapon)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, the GSoT for 400 plat in the bazaar is better than epics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bloodsworn and the copper hammer are better than epic.<br />
<br />
Since the epic has a DD with the +hate proc, it can be resisted, and if its resisted, the +hate is not added in.  Even if the bloodsworn and copper hammer are resisted, the resisted stun portion of the proc still adds a lot of aggro.  I would suggest getting LDoN and doing a lot of Guk / Miragul adventures, and going for the 14/19's in each, and adding the ykesha procs to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even when resisted, the red blade generates aggro.  <br />
<br />
I used my epics for a long time when they were still viable for me and resisted procs created virtually no agro. The difference between a resist and a nonresist were night and day. <br />
<br />
They also really made it a very crappy weapon when they took out the ability for the proc to be partially resisted though. That was so gay. I've seen few things that were more moronic in my time playing EQ. The weapon was already underpowered and they made it worse... but that's another discussion.</div></div><hr />

Sad to say it's not a great combo for holding agro. It does okay when I'm grinding with lower level guildies, but in a random BoT grind I get out-agroed by just about anyone. <br />
<br />
As for the blue blade...I carry it around in PoK and towns because having two lightsabers makes people stop and stare for a minute (feeds the ego) but the only time I actually use it is either for underpowered mobs or when I use my Silken Whip of Ensnarement and absolutely NEED to have it proc. Handy for duoing with a shaman friend of mine or for dueling with any class that tends to run from you. =)</div></div><hr />
