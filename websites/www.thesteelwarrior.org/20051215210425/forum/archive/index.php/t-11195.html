<br />
I personally have a hard time even thinking of giving up 10 strength and 15 stamina on my shield, even if its AC is a bit shy (1937AC) of a lot of the top blue shields out there.<br />
<br />
Is there much of a benefit from shields like the Dracconian Deflector or the Barrier Shield that I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthax</div><div class="date">04-05-2005, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first number I always look at is the block rating.  As much as I spam shield block during fights, that extra damage reduction will definitely add up over time.<br />
<br />
I am using the Draconian:<br />
<br />
2153 Armor <br />
40 Block <br />
+7 Stamina <br />
+10 Fire Resistance <br />
Requires Level 58 <br />
Equip: Increased Defense +15<br />
<br />
I am giving up 8 stamina compared to your 15, but I would think that the extra block rating, AC, and Defense more than makes up for 80 health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 70hp loss isn't much at this point, and 15 defense is 1.2% more avoidance. The high armor makes for good mitigation. It all adds up to taking less damage. Block rating only matters so much. Honestly I don't use shields for the block, since a block means so little for avoiding damage anymore.<br />
<br />
Barrier shield has the highest block value of any shield, but honestly that doesn't mean much, If you want one I'd only suggestion using it to AE dinky mobs (though skullflame is better for that) or to farm grey mobs.</div></div><hr />

Sta and str are nice, but you use shields for the armor, and (lesser) for the block value.   Seeing its the only slot that you can get actual block value from, that make it priority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Argent Defender <br />
Binds when picked up <br />
Off Hand (Shield) Shield <br />
2121 Armor <br />
39 Block <br />
Passive: Has a 1% chance when struck in combat of increasing<br />
chance to block by 50% for 10 sec. <br />
<br />
I know it has no stats but unless I'm mistaken that is really one hell of an effect.  Even if it is only 1%, it lasts 10 seconds (that right?).  Is there something I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, extra block is nice but against stuff you'll be fighting at that level, you're still gonna be hit really hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1% means it'll go off super rarely in normal fights, or decently in AE fights, but I'd rather use something like a crest of retibution for AE fights... <br />

I couldn't find a situation that shield was useful in, especially after getting a skullflame shield, so it ended upg etting vendored :/</div></div><hr />

Got my shield of group wipe, AKA skullflame the other day as a drop.  It's pretty nice all and all, and the thing actually procs a halfway decent amount. (It procs like mad near sheep/saps especially.)  The only disappointing thing is the current graphic is an itty bitty teeny weeny buckler.  I'd still carry around a backup shield if you get this one tho.</div></div><hr />
