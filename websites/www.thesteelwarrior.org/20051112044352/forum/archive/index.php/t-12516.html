Is it worth goin all out FR or is some +def needed. Since he's elemental will +def do much to stop his dmg? I can buff out to 325 Fire Resist atm (Aiming for 302 unbuffed) or 425 Def. What setup will bank me the most mitigation and stability in a Geddon fight.</div></div><hr />

What setup will bank me the most mitigation and stability in a Geddon fight.Even with high fire resistance, a double crit from Geddon can spell trouble. I would go slot by slot and use your best bang for buck, with a little bias towards fire resistance. +60-80 defense should reduce your chance of a double crit to acceptable levels.<br />
<br />
His melee atacks, while fire based, can still be dodged/parried but it's not worth stacking defense just for unreliable avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">08-17-2005, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say as much FR as you can get.  I usually had 260fr around 5k hp and we really didn't have many problems.  At 300+ (which I have now), the damage output he has should be -much- more stable than what a meager amount of defense will give you.  (The crushing blows are typically the problems, not the crits.  They also have a lot higher rate it seems).<br />
<br />
In addtion:  I've noticed pushing a real high FR virtually eliminates 1/2 and more damage hits, stabilizing a lot of damage that way.  Just so I can brag some, I got the firelord stacking dot up to +2500 before I ran out of firelords.  Which is way harder than geddon hits with over 300 resist.. so yeah, thats my vote. ^^</div></div><hr />

Actually, I havent died since I went all out FR.</div></div><hr />
