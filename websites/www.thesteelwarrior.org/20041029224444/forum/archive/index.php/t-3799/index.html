<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I know this is a three year old topic for a lot of you, but my guild is gearing up (ha) to do vindi and I was looking for a good guide on tactics for him.<br />
<br />
I did a search here, and while a lot of the posts have a lot of information on him, most of them presuppose some prior knowledge.  For example, I know what cornering is, I just don't know what corner. :)<br />
<br />
can someone point out a decent vindi guide?  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here is what I did. (I had a real guild crew - level 60 was the highest, I had max hps of 6300, but about 36 people at the fight)<br />
<br />
1) Monks pull him solo down the left side ramp of the arena.<br />
<br />
2) I am standing in front of the Rampage tank.<br />
<br />
3) We both shoot an arrow, he shoots one, I keep shooting.<br />
<br />
4) I pop Disc defensive as he runs toward me.<br />
<br />
5) All healers begin to cast a heal that is 4 seconds or below on me...<br />
<br />
6) The first cleric in the Complete Heal Chain is casting the first Complete Heal. As soon as they cast, they Send a tell to the next cleric in the line (They also have their own channel) where he tells everyone in the line, CLERIC 2 CAST CHEAL in 5 SECONDS!.<br />
<br />
7) All bard songs are off.<br />
<br />
8) Everyone is standing off to one side.<br />
<br />
9) I am in the closest corner PAST the left side ramp.<br />
<br />
10) The Rampage tank has a level 58+ druid in his group that heals the second the tank takes any damage at ALL.<br />
<br />
11) All 2 of my paladins are watching my health. If it gets to 20-30% they fire off LOH (Only in the beginning)<br />
<br />
12) I have a Damage Shield on me that Consists of a 45 pt mage DS, a 33 point Shaman DS, and as soon as the bards can SAFELY begin singing, another 45+ DS.<br />
<br />
13) I melee for the first 15 seconds, Hoping or waiting to see some procs from my weapons.<br />
<br />
14) I call Assist for all the melee to come surround Vindicator from BEHIND.<br />
<br />
15) They are all standing as far as possible from him, while still being able to hit him.<br />
<br />
16) I now have a Semi-circle pushing EVENLY on all sides of Vindicators backside.<br />
<br />
17) The bards turn on their songs as soon as assist is called.<br />
<br />
18) Enchanters land Tash, Bards put on OOS, and Shamans attempt to Malo ,and then CRIPPLE (very important)<br />
<br />
19) Around 75% health, the nukers begin to Nuke. I did not allow pets on my first vindicator fight.<br />
<br />
20) I am shrunk in the corner facing UP, walking backwards and attacking.<br />
<br />
21) The clerics are casting a complete heal every 5 seconds. There are 5 of them rotating.<br />
<br />
22) Everyone has been told to use their F9 key to make sure they can see exactly how far they are from Vindicator and that they are keeping as far away from him as they can and still hit him. They also spread out to make sure their semi-circle is nice and evenly distributed.<br />
<br />
That was about it. With that strategy, Vindicator was dead before we needed to tank switch. It lasted about 3 minutes in total.<br />
<br />
I lived through the whole fight. The only time anyone died was when Vindicator got pushed on top of me during the push into the corner and the game thought he could not see me and switched targets to a Mage and a Ranger.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<br />
My ex-guild's experienced monk had trouble single pulling Vindi which he was able to do before. He mentioned about Vindi not warping anymore.<br />
<br />
We ended up spending an hour trying to split him from his 2 guards but still failed. At the end, we assigned 2 split tanks to get on each guard. Kill the guard while the MT building up aggro. Guards dropped like rock. MT called assist and everything just like what Jakle said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The funny thing is, I took just my 17 guildies to vindi a couple months ago and the two guards got stuck in the Ice wall, and were running at the enchanter the whole fight.<br />
<br />
Which is a good thing, since I don't think we really planned on what we were going to do with them anyway LOL...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To make it fun, set up inside at ice wall, assign add tanks and pull (nice corner on the ice wall to use)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raiddinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild does vindi like so.<br />
<br />
When raid time comes close I go, ok if you can heal say something.<br />
<br />
If I get 7+ people who can heal I say everyone head there, everyone being less than 3 groups, I believe our first kill was with like 15.<br />
<br />
I (bard) am the best geared person in guild so I do my own RTing with 4.5k unbuffed and about 1550 ac when doing the fight.  A warrior would do better here but we have nearly 0 tanks in guild.<br />
<br />
We go 3 healers in rotation at delay 40, our paladin who 2 boxes his druid is usually on emergency duty to watch the MT/RT for LOH and celestials and what have you, the rest of the healers are pure RT healers.<br />
<br />
We have no monks in guild so puller = me too.<br />
<br />
I run in and go tag vindi, preferrably when he is on the far side of the bridge so his guards wont be far behind him when he hits the wall.<br />
<br />
Once I tag vindi I run the hell back across the bridge and left (we always fight on the right side) I stay up top but over near the left wall you can jump off of, that way vindi will hit the corner of the ice wall and run into the corner instead of running straight at the ice (I get faster warps this way).<br />
<br />
In a minute or 2 some random combination of vindi and his two guards will warp out onto me, and land on top of me and hit me for like 5000 dmg at which time I have to kite them around with like 1 bubble of life left.<br />
<br />
If all 3 warp then I kite around and turn to face them and hit autododge disk to give me 9 sec to gate vindi, after a few casts a gate will stick on him and I run down the ramp and fade off aggro from Vindi and get a CH.<br />
<br />
While everyone is killing the 2 guards I head back up and start repulling vindi in the same manner as before, tag him, run like hell, get him stuck in the corner, once he warps out kite him around for a while if the guards arent dead yet and if they are just go ahead and bring him back to the raid and kill.<br />
<br />
So far we have killed him twice like that, but neither one were flawless victories, we managed to lose our MT so far in both our kills but the healers have managed to assist heal long enough to drop him.<br />
<br />
Thats at CH delay 40 on a fairly well equipped tank compared to other guilds breaking into raid mobs, im guessing 2500 hp from gear plus HP from AA (~70 aa).<br />
<br />
If I had an extra healer im sure a 30 delay CH chain would keep the MT perma up, dropping back to 40 again once the MT has better gear or so.<br />
<br />
So far I havent been having problems RTing with 3 RT healers on me, but we push the envelope getting in fast cripple and debuff calls and risk summoning/death to some casters.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps somehow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All of this is very helpful, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We go 3 healers in rotation at delay 40,Do you mean that your healers have a hotkey to cast cheal?? If so, teach them to count to 4 and press the cheal button themselves. Using hotkeys to determine how long between spell casts is a sure way of getting your MT killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i woudnt go with delays. it doesnt take v much effort to count out 2/3/4 seconds rotations.<br />
<br />
dont underestimate how much dmg yoru DS will do, so do stack em up. 300-400 hits from Vindi x 100 point DS is a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
before you pull vindi, take the time to mark out exactly where people should be.<br />
<br />
+<br />
+YYYYY<br />
+<br />
+Z    Z<br />
+           <br />
x++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
If x is the corner where you are fighting him, place all your casters along a line at Y, at max casting range. Test out casting range to work out max distance before the pull.<br />
<br />
Melees should also wait at that spot with the casters until assist is called. When assist is called they should move in behind vindi and push to wall, maintaining max melee distance (kinda like where the Zs are).<br />
<br />
Explain the concept of rampage list and hate list to the guild. theres a good post about it somewhere here. only the rampage tank and Main Tank should tag vindi on incoming. Pallys make good rampage tanks.<br />
 <br />
Pets - inevitably, some will always get in the goddamn way - either aggroing early on vindi and screwing up postiion etc.<br />
<br />
i would go with what another warrior said and say dont use them for first time. alternatively, get casters to call them up once Vindi is well engaged. If you do call up pets before vindi is engaged, get them topark them well the heck away from the corner i.e. behind Y.<br />
<br />
Dont go for a tank switch the first time, it just adds to the complication. Just time your defensive and about 10-15 secs before it wears out, call it out and ask for spam heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ryld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What is Vindi's damage output to be exact?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In the parse I have from about 2 months ago, his max hit was 700 points and his DPS around 550. I reckon my AC have been 1200-1250 and I don't think I had any mitigation or evasion AAs at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">P.S. ^ is all non-defensive. He hits 450 max iirc with Defensive on, leaving him around (?) 400-500 DPS in any given round....<br />
<br />
Not sure on that last number lol.<br />
<br />
I know it is approx two hits a second, parcelled out in 2 second delays of 4 hits.</div></div><hr />
