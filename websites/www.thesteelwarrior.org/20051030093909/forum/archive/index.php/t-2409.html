Bard Song Info<br />
<br />
To bring some light to the bard part of your problem the three most common songs for a MT during a raid and their effect would be (bare with the long explanation):<br />
<br />
Warsong of Zek<br />
1: Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
2: Increase STR by 36 (L62) to 37 (L65) <br />
3: Increase ATK by 17 (L62) to 18 (L65) <br />
4: Increase Damage Shield by 15 <br />
<br />
Rizlona's Call of Flame<br />
2: Increase Haste v3 by 30% <br />
(exluded all the caster crap)<br />
<br />
Psalm of Veeshan<br />
1: Increase Damage Shield by 14 (L63) to 15 (L65) <br />
2: Increase All Resists by 73 (L63) to 75 (L65) <br />
4: Increase AC by 7 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now these three songs from a lvl 65 bard who has Instrument/Singing Mastery at 3,<br />

Correct me if I'm wrong please, this will go on my guild webpage when finished :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy crap Baadan, that's borked.  All that crap doesn't stack.<br />
<br />
I got a spawn to kill tho, i'll be back in a few and correct it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here we go.<br />
<br />
Haste:<br />
Vallon's Quickening (ENC L65)<br />
2: Increase AGI by 52 <br />
3: Increase DEX by 33 <br />
4: Increase ATK by 41 <br />
5: Increase Attack Speed by 68% <br />
<br />
Captain Nalots Quickening (Eyepatch of Plunder)<br />
1: Increase Attack Speed by 20% <br />
<br />
Nalots effect and VQ don't stack.  The icons do, but you're not going to get extra haste.  So Nalots is useless.<br />
<br />
Rhino and Raptor don't stack with Focus, so those are scratched too.  In addition, Wrulan is completely useless because anyone who's grouped with a 65 shaman is going to max AGI with Ferine Avatar.  I'm not sure how Diaku stacks because I don't own that POS spell, but see above.  Completely useless with Avatar.<br />
<br />
I'm also fairly sure dain ring doesn't stack with shaman potion, so that cuts down your DS a lot.<br />
<br />
It's not as incorrect as I thought it was, but it does have a lot of extra crap in there, mostly the stat buff part.  Focus/Boar is about all you're going to get from a shaman unless they're bored, and I haven't even touched the Wrulon buffs since I scribed FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the easiest answer is it changes depending primarily on your unbuffed stamina versus max stamina.  I mean, there is a set amount of HP you can get from kazaad, blessing, Fo7 and brells.  Those HP are 2402, derived from:<br />
 <br />
Kazaad - 910<br />
Blessing - 618<br />
Fo7 - 544<br />
Brells - 330 <br />
<br />
<br />
Above and beyond that it all depends on how high you still need to go to reach maxed PP stamina.  Some of the warriors in my guild have almost maxed stamina so their Magelos are pretty sweet.  I'm a woodelf with okay, but not fantastic gear, so my stamina still has a long way to go.  The high-stamina warriors get very little HP upgrade from Boar;  I get significantly more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You forgot Call of the Rathe, ranger spell: 10 damage shield and 34 AC, doesn't stack with Coldain ring buff which is annoying since I use that as insta clickie.<br />
Also the amount of hps you get from stamina buffs goes up with gaining natural/planar durability and physical enhancement AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fixed my post.<br />
<br />
And here is a question, given the choice, which one of these two would you choose?<br />
<br />
Call of the Rathe (RNG L62)<br />
2:  Increase Damage Shield by 10 <br />
3:  Increase AC by 34 <br />
<br />
Kilva's Skin of Flame (Potion)<br />
2:  Increase Damage Shield by 1 (L1) to 33 (L65)<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know just how much Bards can up resists?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given your 3 choices I use Call of the Rathe 99% of the time for the extra AC.  Rarely I use shaman DS potion against unslowable fast quad hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I often go with CoTR and:<br />
<br />
Girdle of Living Flames, Spikecoat<br />
1: Increase AC by 23 (L39) to 25 (L44)<br />
2: Increase Damage Shield by 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Diaku stacks with everything.  It's actually somewhat useful for the average level 65 guy if you believe str/dex actually does anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few buffs you are missing:<br />
<br />
<br />
Ferocity is nice. 150 ATK, 65 to all resists, and 40 to stamina. Only lasts 6.5 minutes and costs a peridot though.<br />
<br />
Also Spirit of Bih Li (shaman sow) adds 15 raw ATK. Not much, but could be substituted for resists if they aren't needed. Outdoor only though of course.<br />
<br />
Also some smaller clickies that can be used such as: grim aura (gobbo earring and other items), clicky aura of battle (fear shoulders + others), thorny shield/icicle aura (ntov/vt cloaks + others). <br />
<br />
Really I think trying to find a &quot;best buff setup&quot; is going to be impossible. There are too many buffs out there and many are quite situational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rolsdar</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ferocity is nice. 150 ATK, 65 to all resists, and 40 to stamina. Only lasts 6.5 minutes and costs a peridot though <br />
<br />
Ferocity doesnt cost a peridot anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changed again.<br />
<br />
Added Ferocity.<br />
Added Spirit of Bih'Li.<br />
Removed 10th Ring and all other item effects. Item effects are too complicated, there are too many and not very mana people have access to them all, so sticking with Spells only gives everyone an equal chance at them.<br />
<br />
One more question: Do you go for 15 buffs or leave slots open?<br />
I know that if you have 15 and get dotted or something by a mob it overwrites your first buff. The buffs listed seems like all there is, but with them all it is 16 buffs, which could be trimmed by not having Bih'li or some of the resists or even the 60sta buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should uncap haste, boy would that be cool.</div></div><hr />
