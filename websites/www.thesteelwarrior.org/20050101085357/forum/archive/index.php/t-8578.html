It seems to me that theyre no endurance regen items and that it goes up VERY slowly when you are out of it. How do i get it to go up faster than 1-2% a tick?</div></div><hr />

Even in a fast pulling exp group with just one Bellow on inc, tends to run out eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That may depends of your level too, at 54 if I'm hungry and thirsty my endurance will not regen anymore, and it's the same for HP regen, beeing in the same state remove totally the natural regen and led you with only AA and gear regen.</div></div><hr />

Weapon weight has no effect on endurance whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep it had effect on stamina but no longe since the endurance patch, as invigor and acumen...<br />
<br />
but beeing if fightings or not affect the endurence regen, maybe linked to autoattack.</div></div><hr />

First of all, I can explain your &quot;Endurance penalty&quot; and it wasn't introduced by the Devs.  I'm willing to bet that your base stats are far lower when naked than with gear on, and since your endurance pool is based upon your total of your combat stats, naturally you'll have less once you put on your gear.<br />
<br />
Second of all, some people are WAAAAAYY too goddamned incite happy.  I understand that some of you have only been playing warriors with the new endurance system, or have been brainwashed into thinking that incite is the only way you can hold aggro, but you DO NOT NEED it to hold aggro.  You don't need to incite every damned pull, warriors didn't lose aggro EVERY pull before.  You only need to incite when Taunt fails and you're not proccing enough at the moment to hold aggro.  Go look thru a log sometime, and I'm willing to bet that a good chunk of your incites are basically wasted because an aggro proc comes between the time you incite and the time when anyone could have possibly taken aggro from you.  <br />
<br />
You're right, endurance is not mana, but it's your endurance, and if you want to use it, you need to learn how to use it efficiently, or you're going to end up with an empty bar and be so crippled by the thought of not being able to do anything that you think you're supposed to be able to do that you're going to suck as a result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Despite the efficient/inefficient debate over the use of Endurance, it does regenerate rather slowly. If I had to suggest a fix for this, I'd be kind of torn; I wouldn't like to see it come in the form of a spell (thus taking up a buff slot) but that's how the casters do it (Kei and whatnot.)<br />
<br />
That aside, I can see some Warriors burning through a bar of endurance rather quickly Inciting every pull. I myself used to BotM for every incoming, until I realized in the long run it wasn't helping that much. But for a Warrior without strong aggro weapons I would imagine the need to use this ability per inc is probably much greater.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Mistikat<br />
<br />
correct me if im wrong but i dont think sitting helps. turning off attack DOES help. for example if you pull with an arrow at long range and immediately turn on autoattack you will be penalizing your endurance regen rate. wait until the mob reaches you or at least is pretty close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did they recently add an endurance penalty when ressed? I dont remember it being there at the start but seems to be at 30%ish after res now.<br />
I think that's your gear's +endurance, which is empty endurance when you loot your gear.<br />
But seriously, that shit regens SLOW !! It has gotten to where I'm sitting between pulls trying to get it back faster when I'm at 20% or less.<br />
First, sitting doesn't improve your endurance regen.  The only factors are attacking or not attacking.  Second, if your regen rate bothers you, then buy the AA's to improve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furthermore, if you say you are doing hardcore pulls... Keep going without incite and let your groupmates know how it is without warrior mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainingvodka</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all about knowing your toon and your class.  Incite is NOT crucial 100% of the time.  I used to go OOE all the time on zerg LDoNs because I would use incite every pull...and it's a *waste* of end.  <br />
<br />
The solution is pretty easy, if you feel you NEED a aggro disc...hotkey Provoke up.  When endurance is low, or if you want some extra snap aggor during a fight...hit Provoke instead of Incite.  The end savings are HUGE, and you should be high enough on the hate list that provoke will be plenty enough snap aggor. Doing this should allow at least 1 or 2% regen per fight.<br />
<br />
if you get *dangerously* low...tell your party and then use Taunt only until you regen a bit.  you may lose one or two mobs but casters at lvl 65 expect a few blows to the chin and they ought to play accordingly (i.e. not sitting during mez breaks or running around with a mob on their tail)  Just taunt the bish off.  Aggro procs are essential.  if you don't have augs or pure hate wpns...GET them!  (i still need anger III myself so i'm working on it damnit!)</div></div><hr />

Keeping Incite going about once a minute plus cycling my Evasive disc will drain it pretty fast.  By the time I get excruciatingly low though, we're ready to kill anyways. :)</div></div><hr />

Also if you want endurance to come back faster, don't move.  Moving lowers endurance regen.</div></div><hr />

I find it very unreliable to get enough aggro before slow without using bellow.<br />
If i get early procs then its np but otherwise the slower gets a beating :)<br />
I sometimes ended OOE and could't use my defensive Discs when i needed them.<br />
<br />
So whats the Problem now with the spells like &quot;Invigor&quot; or the level 3 Bard song &quot;Jaxan's Jig o' Vigor&quot;? Are they completely useless now? It seems to have no effect if someone casts invigor on me. In my opinion they should change it that way that these spells effect our endurance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've long been in the habit of using Berate regularly, and incite for the bigger, important stuff.<br />
<br />
Even in LDoN's, whatever i burn on Berate, is regen'd fast enough so I'm always 90%+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garim</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One:<br />
 Sitting and holding still both used to increase the speed your Endurance regened.  I doubt they changed that, but I havent tested it.<br />
Two:  <br />
  My guildmates are QUITE a bit better geared then me, so when I end up in an all guild LDoN or GoD groups if I dont use incite quite a bit of the time, I dont hold aggro.  Using incite a lot will definatly run down your endurance.  Especially since im basically tanking for a group that can handle more then me, I end up using defensive or evasive just about every time it recycle's.  <br />
 I generally handle this by telling them that I am going to be unable to hold aggro, and they are just going to have to deal until i get enough endurance back so that I can hold aggro, and use a defensive disc on a bad pull.   I have been in the habit of sitting as long as I can to increase my endurance regen and it does seem to help, just like HP's.<br />
   In case you were wondering I have a cord hilted spike driver for an aggro weapon, and I weild a prismatic battle hammer in my off hand so I keep avatar on myself.  Helps my aggro proc go off quite a bit more.  It still doesnt help enough to stop me from having to incite in these kinds of groups.    I have tried bellow and provoke and they dont make enough of a difference that they made me switch back to them.  I just let the shaman eat aggro for awhile till i get a proc or i have enough endurance to incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One...Sitting doesn't help regen endurance atm imo.<br />
<br />
Two...The end regen aa helps me alot.Tho if you chain mitigation discs with incite on fast pulls you'll prolly run dry regardless.<br />
<br />
Three... If you're frends are much higher geared it's the dps classes that should be yanking your chain.Higer aa'd shammys give less aggro with debuffs.Unless they are chain dotting early after slow.Incite is a big help early in an engagement though.Especially with fast debuffs from folks without the spell casting subtlety thingy.</div></div><hr />

OK that explains it, I've geared up considerably since endurance went in so of course my naked end percentage is much lower.. *bonks self*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistikat</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the penalty I noticed was in fact the gear I have stacking back up to where it is normally. I noticed I was regenning 20 endurance per tick standing in place or sitting. Not sure what it is fighting, too busy to look. The AA's sound nice, but I am low in AA atm, only 72 so I will be going for some more important ones first. Just wish that Zing worked still. Tonight I was in a group doing LDoN, with friends who are all time+ geared, and all their weapons, EoE's, Ethereal Destroyers, those curvy lookin blades from Gates, all have procs, and then they add aggro procs on them so they can tank for their groups when they dont have a plate tank around.  I was having a HELLUVA time keeping aggro locked. I burned thru my whole bar of endurance 10 minutes into the BB adventure. Fastest burn thru ever for me. And the sad thing, I don't think I had solid aggro on any mob save when I got 4 or more procs off my A3'd BoC in the beginning of the attack ......  Hehe it was fun tho we mowed thru adventure after adventure fast.  Anyways I stopped using Incite after that first mission, unless I really needed to pull aggro off the healer.  That ranger makes a strong case for getting WA5.... He had it and I wished right there I had it maxxed as well. Well, off to go dream of upgraded gear and all the AA's I want.   Laters.<br />

So maxing the GoD AA would give you all of a 10% boost there to 33.  I'm not sure what the combat regen rate is on it.  Maybe I'll remember to check soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">something to try out.... watch your endurance numbers tick up.  when you see a tick happen, count to 5 and turn auto attack off.  wait for the endurance number to tick up and then turn attack on.  Rinse &amp; Repeat.  <br />
<br />
Its tough to do but it does gain back endurance quicker that way.  The same thing works for mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herzog</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you guys remember the days before endurance bull and incite/bellow? What did you do then?  Personally I never run out of endurance unless I am tanking a log fight mob in pop or god maybe if back to back mobs. Most of the time in exp groups I dont touch bellow. You guys got spoiled with the new ability, now you bitch more about how you run out of enduance.<br />
<br />
Basicly all I am saying is the regen rate is fine really you just need to learn to use it less then you have been, 1 eb proc, 1 anger 3 proc, or 1 anger proc all are equal to 1 bellow/incite for inital aggro. :D</div></div><hr />
