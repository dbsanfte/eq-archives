<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">07-18-2005, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple questions about faction in AV.<br />
<br />
First, I'm almost to honored.  Does anyone know the pts it takes to get from neutral to friendly, friendly to honored, honored to revered, reverted to exalted?  I'm curious how close I actually am to getting to exalted having almost hit honored.<br />
<br />
Second, what's the best way to build faction in AV?  I am hearing that it used to be by ninja-looting, but now it is shared?  Does that mean whenever someone turns something in when you are in the instance that you get some faction as well?  So it is best for faction to be in the instance when people are turning things in?  Is there any benefit to turning things in yourself?  What are other ways to get faction up?  Do you get any faction for killing other players or npcs at all?  Do you get faction for capturing or defending graveyards, or is that bonus honor only given when you when or when the instance ends?  I know you get a ton of faction from winning....  that has been obvious.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">07-18-2005, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3k faction from Neutral to Friendly<br />
6k from Friendly to Honored<br />
10k from Honored to Revered<br />
21k from Revered to Exalted<br />
1k to max Exalted (for Frostwolf insignia)<br />
<br />
<br />
I just finished AV, first time I have done it since patch.  Wow.  What a huge difference.<br />
<br />
Usually it would take all day to finish one instance.  Now it takes 3 or 4 hours max, that I've seen.  We won in 2 hours.<br />
<br />
As far as faction, biggest bonus i've seen is killing the opposing sides leader.  For Horde, it's Vanndar.  If you are in raid that tags him, you get 700 faction.  That's huge.<br />
<br />
I believe everyone in zone gets 1 faction point when someone does turnin.  I saw some that were 2 points, not sure what was handed in.  I bet opposing side supplies (Irondeep for Horde).<br />
<br />
So faction is just ticking away, it's great.  You can stay at the front lines, and not loot, and still get plenty of faction.  If you do loot, each turnin is 1point.  For the spines/hearts/etc.  Didn't run any supply runs, those are probably more points.<br />
<br />
Killing NPC's nets faction I believe, especially enemy commanders.  I'm notsure on capturing GY's or towers and whatnot, but I would imagine so.<br />
<br />
Bonus honor is given when you leave.<br />
<br />
I think the patch vastly improved alterac valley.  It's more about the players instead of the gaurds and summons now.<br />
<br />
I'm having a blast and can't wait to get exalted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">07-19-2005, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info, it helps a lot.  Last night I zoned into an instance where the alliance were already in frostwolf keep.  I hate it when that happens.  Then after about 30 mins I got into the other instance which we won within an hour (3 hours or so total on it).<br />
<br />
So what that breaks down to is it takes 40k faction total to get to exalted.  That's not too bad, I probably have 11-12k faction since I'm a ways into honored.  That's three wins, although two of them were probably 5-6 hour sessions pre-patch.  :)  I would say I've spent 20-30 hours in AV and I'm 25% of the way there.  Just another probably 80-120 hours to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">07-19-2005, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faction is definetly front loaded.  A bunch of those quests give big faction, but can only be done once, or just give faction the first time.  But the patch changes give you a little faction pretty much constantly while you're in there.<br />
<br />
So yeah, just a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

That's because 30 horde vs 20 paladins, 15 rogues and 5 others isn't fun, nor is it worth our time.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when it's 10 on 10, and you can't bring the zerg, funny how it's classified as &quot;Easy wins&quot; for the horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys can't bring more than 30 horde to the fight?  What is up with that?  On my server we usually have two AV's going, both full on both sides.<br />
<br />
As far as easy wins, there is no such thing unless you're playing against serious gimps.  So are you saying your alliance are gimps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-21-2005, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What server are you on?<br />
<br />
Boulderfist is what you would call a low pop server, and it's goddamned low.  Not impossible to not see someone in an outlying zone all day.<br />
<br />
And it's heavily skewed, Alliance &gt; Horde.<br />
<br />
So yeah...usually there's not 40 people aware and able that there's an AV instance up.  In fact, I believe this last weekend the only reason we had one up was thru a coordinated effort on the blizzard server forums.<br />
<br />
And yes, the alliance are gimps.  I fall prey to such tactics as moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, moonfire, moonfire.  Skillfull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, on Blackhand, yes, Warsong does = easy wins for the horde.  Why?  Because basically, for some unforseen reason, the Alliance (which I am a part of) nearly refuses to work together.  In your average PUG, maybe half the members will work with you while the other half seem to be there just to farm kills &amp; CP's.  You can ask anyone from Blackhand Alliance and they will tell you the same.  The general attitude of the alliance is just join the fight and play...if you win, or get a flag for some bonus points, wohoo!  For one reason or another, the Alliance simply cannot work together in WSG here.  I just don't know why.<br />
<br />

<br />
Pretty well...yeah.  Ask any Blackhand horde, they'll tell you the same.  Some of us manage to defeat the odds by forming our raids beforehand, but seldomly do we have the right individuals on to do so (meaning, friends).  There are one or two alliance guilds who can own in WSG, but they keep to themselves mostly.  Understandable.<br />
<br />
This is also the reason why the horde won't do AV on Blackhand...why would they I guess, when they can farm 10x the amount of  honor cleaning our clocks in WSG.  It's sad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">07-21-2005, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wierd.  On Deathwing, we have a hard time getting Alliance to join AV.  The patch seems to have helped, we have 2 instances gong at once usually.<br />
<br />
Still, the horde absolutely own AV.  I've probably been to AV 20 times, and 19 times we were winning handily, finished about 6 of them, killing vanndar.  Once we lost a few towers, but they couldn't get close to our base.  Just guesstimating on the numbers.<br />
<br />
Absolute ton of pallies.  Hunters and rogues next, with a fair amount of mages.  On the alliance in AV, i mean.<br />
<br />
I keep waiting for Alliance to get better, but just not happening.  Usually a small group, maybe 4, that venture from the zerg frontlines, and mess with our wolves, towers and GY's, but they are nothing more than a nuisance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">07-22-2005, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just giving you guys a hard time.  :)<br />
<br />
I'm on Tichondrius, high pop server.  We usually have 2-3 AV instances going at any one time.<br />
<br />
Seems like on our server the sides are pretty balanced.  The horde may win slightly more than the alliance, but not by much.  It really all depends on if there is someone who is knowledgeable about how to win who is really taking charge and leading.  If no one is taking charge and leading then we lose.  Typically if I see a lot of members from one of the top guilds in the instance then I know we're most likely going to win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm on a PvE server and am 58 and have not really engaged in any PvP at all.  I intend to get involved at level 60 tho.<br />
<br />
There is 1 or 2 things I want from the WSG vendors that require faction and I wondered how the WSG faction and if/how it varied to acquiring AV faction.<br />
<br />
Note that I've never been to a battleground so I am unaware how they vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-24-2005, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 60, at least, you gain 14 rep for your team capturing a flag.<br />
<br />
You gain 50 rep for turning in the mark of honor.<br />
<br />
It takes 6000 to go from friendly to honored.<br />
<br />
So yeah...you're gonna be there awhile.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it is just that I've spent more time in AV...  but WSG faction seems to be abysmally unbearably slow.  Also, at least from a warrior standpoint, the AV rewards seem much better.  Although I've never looked at it from a caster standpoint....<br />
<br />
I like both instances equally as much.  It takes longer to get going and figure out what is going on in AV.  WSG is much simpler, protect your flag, capture your opponents flag.  In AV you have mines to capture, supplies to gather, different things to turn in to get different npc's such as riders or npc bosses or upgrading your troops armor, and you have to figure out how to capture graveyards, destroy bunkers, etc, etc.  WSG is smaller, faster paced, more individual combat.  AV can be really frustrating as a warrior because you can charge into a group and get yourself slaughtered and oftentimes you just don't get heals.  What I find is that if you are in a raid that is organized and heals then you win.  Last night I was in the top 5 in AV for killing blows, but the previous night I was down near #40 because I was getting zero heals.  We also won in less than two hours last night and lost hardcore the night before....</div></div><hr />
