Some of the new stun guns cops are using are no joke. I saw a ~6'5 250lb guy get hit with one and nearly pull off a backflip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, that's kind of plausible, but I'm not really buying it.  It says the kid was cutting himself on the leg when they tasered him.  Now, I don't know about you, but I'm thinking that if I'm holding a piece of class against my leg when someone jolts me with who knows how many volts of electricity, that isn't really going to reduce my chances of hurting myself.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the old ways work best.  You walk over, grab the kid's wrist, twist his hand with your other hand to make him drop the glass, and then smack him on the butt.  He's a six year old kid and should be treated as such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a very good point. If he was in the middle of cutting himself, losing control of his muscle function (which I believe electrical shock can do, depending on the voltage) he could end up hurting himself even worse than if the cop had just tried to grab him.</div></div><hr />

You're assuming that this six year old kid is &quot;normal&quot;.  Sorry buddy, no six year old kid waving sharp pieces of glass around, fending off senior officials, is fucking normal.  <br />
<br />
I bet the kid learned a damn good lesson after being shocked with 50,000 volts.</div></div><hr />

Had the kid had the glass to his throat, tensing muscles would drive the glass in to his neck.  I feel for the people who had to deal with the situation though.

<br />
Walking up to him and grabbing him would probably have been as effective or more.<br />

<br />
Instead of thinking it is ok because he had a screw loose how about thinking about WHY he had a screw loose?<br />
<br />
Could it be all the drugs we are putting in em, that we are just now admit are causing massive depression and increased suicide in children?<br />
<br />
Could it be his mom and dad are nuts?<br />
<br />
Could it be that school is just that bad these days? shootings and stabbings, other inain shit that have popped up along with the overuse of medication?<br />
<br />
If it was your kid, you would be kicking that police goons ass, what a damn police state and it is even worse when I see that you find shocking people is perfectly ok so I guess the media brainwashing has done wonders on your brain.<br />
<br />
God this is sick, the kids head and the fact that no one wants to go into WHY all this school violence and insanity is happening.<br />
<br />
Hell, I've seen a cop disarm a 250 pound man with a knife, so with all their training why was this needed? the kid is going to be scarred for life and hate police.<br />
<br />
I've been shocked by a coke mechine with a loose wire when I came out of a pool once, and I know how your muscles can lock up and shake when you get shocked, that kid probibly puried his leg and they are not mentioning it.<br />
<br />
Yeah I have a bleeding heart, its tears for my country.</div></div><hr />

I actually do agree with Glatius.  How hard could it have really been to overwhelm the kid, especially considering he's just a little six year old?  However, I do know there's always a shitload of legality issues when dealing with these situations.  The cop was probably protecting his own ass considering how many sue happy people inhabit this country.<br />
<br />
Stick to the bottom line, Gerick.<br />
<br />
-The kid is no longer cutting himself and fending off senior officials.<br />
-The kid is now being referred to a psychiatrist, a psychologist with a medical degree.<br />
<br />
The psychiatrist will figure out your questions:<br />
<br />
-Why his screws are loose.<br />
-If his mom and dad's screws are loose.<br />
-If the school is really that bad.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do agree with you with all the &quot;inain shit that have popped up along with the overuse of medication&quot;.  Considering 99% of all your brains fuctions *work* due to chemical reactions, it's extremely, extremely easy to introduce a new chemical into your system and start messing with which way the gears are turning.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to hazard the guess that tasering a six year old is much more liable to gain you a law suit against the police department and against you as the officer than most any other action you can think of short of beating the kid with a baton or putting a bullet in his head.  You see the criteria applied by the law is what would a &quot;reasonable&quot; person do given the same set of circumstances.  I seriously doubt that the police department attorney is going to be able to easily convince a jury that a &quot;reasonable&quot; person would taser a six year old kid holding a piece of glass.  If I were an attorney, which I'm not, and I was representing the police department, I would recommend they settle, fast.</div></div><hr />

You guys may flame me for it, but sometimes immediate reactions to problem causers is a good thing.  I remember being a dumb little cock myself and firing darts at the USPS truck.  He flew around the corner so fast that I fell flat on my ass as I began to hear a barrage of swear words to my face.  I was never more terrified in my life.  But hey, guess what!

<br />
You're certainly entitled to your opinion.  I just have my doubts that it's shared by the majority of the U.S. population.   Normally most reasonable people don't advocate jolting six year old little bastards with 50,000 volts.  You're right in that he may have learned an important lesson.  But then again at six years old, he may not even understand what happened.  However, regardless of whether or not he really understood what happened and learned or didn't learn an important lesson, a jury would be considering the &quot;reasonableness&quot; of the officer's action and if there weren't other more &quot;reasonable&quot; alternative actions available.</div></div><hr />

6 is kinda young to reason things through rationally.<br />
<br />
Therefore my money is on him being told so often by 'concerned' lawyers and his parents that he was a victim that he'll begin to believe he did absolutely nothing wrong and the system is out to get him.  <br />
<br />
I'd have no sympathy for the kid if he'd tried to kill his principal or something, but he was obviously distressed enough that fucking himself up with a shard of glass to get ppls attention &gt; whatever current situation he'd been going through.  <br />
<br />
The only real moral I personally get out of this story is that NONE of MY kids are Ever.  Going.  To.  A.  Public.  School.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have my doubts that it's shared by the majority of the U.S. population. <br />
<br />
And what would the majority of the U.S. population have done?  Swarmed the kid, took the piece of glass away from him, and smacked the back of his hand, telling him,<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you can't do that.  Don't do it again, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Like that's ever fucking worked.  That's the main reason we're here in the first place.  Do I think the little bastard understood what he did wrong after being stunned with 50,000 volts?  Of course not.  He's barely at the age where he begins to understand concrete thought, let alone abstract.  However, do you think little six year olds understand the value of hard work and economical planning when they're told not to steal a piece of candy?  Heck no.  All they need to know is that if they steal a piece of candy, daddy is going to tan their little hide.<br />
<br />
You know what's wrong with society?  We try and teach our pet dogs the worldwide influences of Machiavelli.  This particular kid doesn't need to know the definition of masochism.  He's simply not going to understand it.  You know what the kid probably learned?  He probably learned that getting people's attention by breaking pieces of glass and cutting himself is a pretty dumb fucking thing to do.  ;)<br />
<br />
Don't touch a hot stove.  That's a pretty dumb fucking thing to do!<br />
<br />
 The only real moral I personally get out of this story is that NONE of MY kids are Ever. Going. To. A. Public. School. <br />
<br />
There are plenty of reasons not to apply your kid into a public school, just as there are plenty of reasons not to apply a child into a private school.  However, I'd argue you, and in a friendly manner, of course, to at least give me (the reader) a better argument than that. :)<br />

I work for the council(government) as a linesman/jointer/fitter for australia just to clear something up. Voltage does very little to the body other then provide a presure against it. Its actually the amperage that can deal excesive damage to the body. But due to the fact the tasar guns have very little to make them hurt anyone.<br />
<br />
The only way that someone can get hurt from these is from the presure pushing you on to a knife or whatever.<br />

<br />
If he did, then at least one good thing resulted out of the situation.  However, I still firmly believe that a jury would not see the officer's action as &quot;reasonable&quot;, unless of course they all happened to think like you, which seems unlikely.  Let the punishment fit the crime and all that.  While the child may not have been in true physical danger from being tasered, which seems somewhat debatable given that he was waving around a piece of glass and pressing it against his body when they tasered him, the amount of pain he experienced as a result would be considered by many people, imo, as torture.  You don't torture six year olds when they do something stupid.  Part of being a six year old is doing stupid things.  And if you taser them every time they do something stupid, they'll soon be a quivering heap of fear curled up in the corner unwilling to even move.<br />
<br />
Similar incident involving the same police department which I read just a little while ago.  A 12 year old girl was skipping school.  The police happened to cross her path and were escorting her back to their vehicle so they could return her to school.  When they got to the car, she bolted.  An officer chased her for some ways and eventually tasered her to stop her.  He claims he did it for her safety and his safety, since she was headed towards a busy street at the time.  Yet it seems to me that if he'd simply stopped chasing her, she'd have stopped running and then no one would have been in danger.  And truancy, while something to be discouraged, is not normally considered a criminal offense worthy of being physically subdued.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I think that more than anything this shows how stupid adults can be, rather than how stupid children can be.  Maybe those officers need to be jolted a few times with 50,000 volts so they'll understand exactly what it means and use it only in situations really justifying it.  What are they going to start doing next, pepper spraying infants who cry too loud?  Letting the dogs loose on jay walkers?  Using fire hoses on children who curse?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah,  the 50,000volts in the article is probably only quoted for shock value, since it's such a large number to use and most people won't realize the differences in watts/volts/amps . The kid most likely just had his muscles lock up,fell over and was physically fine afterwards. Still, it was probably pretty traumatic for the kid. I'm not really sure that those kinds of weapons are tested (and I  hope they aren't) on people that young.<br />
<br />
That said, I really have a hard time understanding how a 6 year old child armed only with a piece of glass can fend off a security guard, principal, and TWO police officers to the point that the taser even came into the picture.<br />
<br />
It's really kind of frightening to think that the people who are there to keep order couldn't think of a better resolution to something like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.thearmedcitizen.com/gunpages/tasers.htm <br />
<br />
Report by Craig Rimlinger<br />
in the July 29, 2004 issue of<br />
The Fort Wayne Journal Gazette<br />
(He opted for a 3 second charge instead of the normal 5 second duration.)<br />
<br />
&quot;The three seconds are a blur, but I remember the initial shock, the ridiculously intense pain, the inability to coordinate any muscle movements and the total stiffness that engulfed my body. I opened my mouth wide, unable to utter a sound. I didn’t feel the two prongs from the Taser lodge themselves in my back – just the electricity, pain I later described to an editor as, “hell times 10.” A few minutes later, I felt fine. My legs were a bit wobbly but not shaky enough to keep me from standing or walking.&quot; <br />
<br />
While it seems reasonable in many circumstances to put an adult who is in some way resisting the police through such an experience, it doesn't make much sense to me to put children through it, barring there being some extreme danger to others involved.  But maybe I'm too liberal because I feel a child shouldn't be put through &quot;hell times 10&quot; for any but the most extreme situations.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Also found this from this linked article:<br />
<br />
http://vancouver.cbc.ca/tasers/<br />
<br />
&quot;One problem is the pain. There's a reflex called vago-vagal reflex and in severe pain circumstances what you get is, this reflex lowers the heart rate and it can grow dangerously low, and your heart stops. <br />
<br />
&quot;The reflex is not going to affect the heart muscle itself. It's not failure of the heart, it's failure of the control of the heart,&quot; she says. <br />
<br />
In 2004, Vancouver police have fired their Tasers a total of 26 times – mostly in the city's West End and Downtown Eastside. Two men – Roman Andreichikov and Robert Bagnell – died. <br />
<br />
So in Vancouver at least they have a 7.6% fatality rate on the use of tasers.  It's pretty close to 1 out of 10 people dying from their use.  Of course that figure may not be typical, but should still give people pause.  Is this really something we want used indiscriminately?  Particularly in situations where other less extreme methods appear to be available?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My chemistry really sucks since I sorta slept through it during high school, but how many volts are in an amp? isn't it like as an example = 1200 watts / 120 volts = 10 amps?<br />
<br />
No clue, would like to know a nice conversion!<br />
<br />
Anyway, I really don't think it was the best idea to taser the fucking kid, but at least hopefully his parents will get him help or something. He seems like he really could need it if it's just not an attention thing or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my understanding of it, watts and amps are two different things, and there is not a conversion factor to them because they do not measure the same thing. Amps from what I know are more like the &quot;energy&quot; behind the volts, which is just pressure. You could be shocked by 500,000 volts of electricity but if the amperage was low enough, wouldnt feel a thing. On the other hand, you could have a low volt count but higher amperage and it could still kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, this is FAR  from the IDEAL solution, but things could have gone much worse. For one, consider a slightly different situation (which should clarify your understanding from above). You have a 6 year old kid with a piece of glass... sure, he can't hurt the officer with it, but he can slash his neck open if they get too close and the adds for the hospital being able to help that is pretty low... assuming he doesn't cut into his spinal chord which is also located there. Granted, the kid was cutting his leg at the time (?) and physical stopping probably was safer overall, however, one point needs consideration. It is never pointed out that the glass was in a feasable position to be taken away from the kid. It might have been a half-inch from his achilles tendon or his hamstring, either of which could easilly cripple him for life. We need more facts to analyze before we can judge completely.<br />
<br />
Again, yes, I think the force used was not the best. Given the situation however, the officers had to think fast and must be cut at least the slightest slack for acting in a hard situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well; there are Volts, Amps (Amperes), and Ohms. Than there are Joules, Watts, and a bunch of other terminology.<br />
but for you who likes the maths;<br />
<br />
volts/ohms = amperes .. which means it takes 'x' amount of volts passing through a wire with 'y' ohms ( ohms=amount of resistance, in my telephone world a copper cable that is between 19 and 26 gauge will have 0.083 microfarads which is a measurement of ohms ) will produce 'z' amperes.<br />
<br />
so basically volts are the push, ohms are what's held back, and the amperes is the power recieved at the end usage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would take a fair amount of determination and the strength to go with it cut through the muscles of the neck, let alone get to the spinal cord, which happens to run through the vertebra of the spinal column and isn't easily hacked into.  I just don't buy that the risk was very high of six year old child being able to do that.  It's certainly possible that he could have stuck the glass into his throat, but with how much force?  How deep could the cut have really been?  And how quickly can a six year old really react when they see an adult closing on them to take something away from them?  I'm sorry, but this scenario of a six year old child using enraged strength to hack his own neck, cut through the muscle, into the bones of the spinal column, and into his spinal cord just doesn't logically hold up.  It's extremely implausible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
amps and volts can be converted into one another but one may go up with the other staying relatively the same, a stun gun uses just enough amps to over come the skins natural resistance and is not fatal.<br />
<br />
Amps is the working force of a electric charge, volts in the current... shit I can't remember 2 years back  :eek: <br />
<br />
I'll have to go dig up my old papers on the subject.<br />
<br />
ah ok amps = electrical current; a measure of flowing electrons, electrons do the work so this is the working force, amps very depending on the resistance it overcomes, while voltage is the measure of the amount of energy used to get from one point to another<br />
<br />
so a really high voltage = even fatty (me) gets a hell of a shock :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felnar</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few things:<br />
<br />
1) We don't know how deep the kid had already cut himself before.  Chances are, since it's a 6 year old, it wasn't very deep.....but we don't know that for sure.<br />
2) From what the article said he had drawn blood-so there was blood on the glass.  Does the kid have HIV, AIDS, or some other disease which is communicable by the passing of bodily fluids?  We don't know that either.<br />
3) The police were called.....why not just have the school's security guard handle the situation if it could have been easily handled?  Why didn't the school call the child's parent(s) to have them come and calm the child down/take away the glass?<br />
4) Does the child have a history of this kind of behavior?  Maybe he HAS harmed adults in the past in situations such as this, and THAT is why the police were called.<br />
<br />
Point I'm trying to make here is....we don't have all the facts, so it doesn't really make sense to speculate one way or the other.  The cop(s) could very well have been out of line, but maybe not.  We do not know what was going on in that room at the time, nor do we know what the cops were told when they got there.<br />
<br />
As for the other situation, which I read about as well....again-we don't know what was happening.  The article said the girl was drunk.  How drunk?  Drunk out of her mind to the point where she may not have known the danger present by running towards a busy road?<br />
<br />
Before jumping to conclusions on things like this-just think about the possibilities, as newspaper articles reporting the use of stun guns on children might be prone to leave things out.  It's a bit more sensational(I.E.-sells more copies  ;) ) when it's told the way most are thinking it is, rather than the way it may have been.</div></div><hr />

In the end the evidence against O.J. was pretty substantial.  And yet we were still told to &quot;suspend&quot; judgment.  And all these years later he is still looking for the &quot;real&quot; killers.<br />
<br />
Anyway, more to the point.  I find it much more likely, given that the circumstances have been reported somewhat accurately, that the police used poor judgement than some unusual situation beyond our knowledge existed that made their actions far more reasonable.</div></div><hr />

Police officers follow a protocol and probably knew that the taser wouldn't kill the damn kid.   It's probably documented somewhere that if x- happens you tazer the individual which would then release liability from the officer. At that time I guess they could sue the police department and say their policies are negligent, but I guess we'll see.  <br />

<br />
Treat him just as you would anyone else with a weapon.  Had he been able to slit his own throat people would be screaming about why they didn't taser him.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How can the police taser a 6 year old child?  The answer is simple.  The same people having an outcry about it here would be bitching up a storm if the police tried to subdue the child and the child was actually hurt during this.  What if the policeman left bruises on the childs arm when grabbing it?  Would you be crying about police brutality then because the police officer used &quot;excessive force&quot;?  You know some dipshit somewhere would and don't deny it.<br />
<br />
People complain about every little thing and sue at the drop of the hat instead of taking responsibility for their own actions.  A child's actions are the responsibility of the parent in part as they are responsible for teaching a child right from wrong.  A 6 year old should know by that age that breaking a picture frame and cutting themself with a piece of glass is wrong.  If they do not grasp something like this, the parents have failed, not the police, not the childs teacher, not society.  The police chose to stop the child without resorting to physical measures.  The taser shocks the body but leaves no lasting effects.  They did not have days to think about their decision.  A child was hurting themself and they had to react NOW.<br />
<br />
I was not at the scene of the incident, were any of you here?  Do you know the child was at arms length?  He may have been 15 feet away for all you know and threatening to cut himself if anyone came closer or actually cutting himself at the time.  I will agree that a child probably would not have the strength to get through the neck and do major damage, but the femoral artery in the leg would be a target that would be a possibility.<br />
<br />
Back when I was in school teachers would not have put up with that kind of BS from a student.  They would have dealt with the situation as needed before it became what it was.  Today, with the ACLU and lawyers filing frivolous lawsuits everywhere, people are too afraid to do what needs to be done for fear of being sued or arrested.  Parents are being arrested for spanking their child which is absurd.  Teachers cannot spank unruley children anymore.  Spanking is not child abuse.  Letting your child do whatever they want with no consequences is the true abuse as it ill prepares them for life.<br />
<br />
People will say that 6 years old is too young for learning basic things like this and I will say that is a cop out.  When I was 6 I was hunting with my father.  I had my own .22 rifle and shotgun at that age.  I knew what they were for and that you did not harm yourself or others.  Your actions had consequences and sometimes those consequences were painful on your backside.  Yes, a spanking now and then hurt, but I was never abused and I learned.  I honestly believe it did pain my father more than me when he had to spank my brother or I for something.  I realize this now that I am grown.  He did it out of love and it was the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
Let me ask all of the people here second guessing the police and their actions.  What if your child was running towards a busy street.  You are not sure you will stop them in time.  Your child will reach the street in 2 seconds.  You have a taser in your hand and you are 100% sure you can stop them with that before they run into the street and it won't permanently harm your child.  Would you use the taser?  What if your child was holding a gun to their head?  Would you walk over to them and take the gun away and risk it or would you use something that would guarantee they won't pull the trigger?  It is easy to sit here on a board and second guess other people's actions.  It is hard when you are in the situation and have to make a split second decision.<br />

If you want to talk about the current/power capabilities of a Taser, consider the fact that they run on 8 AA batteries.   Max current on them is about 160 mA (0.16 amps).  If the cop had more experience with children he probably could have handled this better, but as it was, it neutralized a delicate situation, and while it was probably traumatic for the kid, he didn't get hurt, and you could argue that he was already pretty damn traumatized and it kept him from hurting himself worse.  Cops have to react in the heat of the moment to real situations and then all the Monday Morning quarterbacks get to criticise them without actually being in the situation.<br />
<br />
I don't think a taser is necessary to deal with a 6 year old, but at the same time I would not be outraged that the cop decided to do it.  It's not like he pulled out his .357 and blew the kid's arm off or something.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree that it's nothing to sue over, and I don't think it's necessarily a 'bad' thing or that any line was crossed in using a taser in general on someone if it's necessary. The issue I have with it is how it got to that point in the first place. We don't have all the facts, but going off what we do have this child fended off four adults (3 of whom are 'security' personnel) with a shard of glass from a picture frame. That's something that's hard to believe, no matter who you are. I could believe a teenager or even a pre-teen, but at 6?<br />

I would definately advise against shocking a child with his finger on the trigger, you just may end up pulling it for him.<br />

Anyway like I said, my questions about the article don't revolve around whether or not it's moral or ethical to use a taser on a 6 year old, but rather why it had to be used. It would help a lot if we had more facts, but eh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a large part of the problem.<br />
<br />
I'm 30 years old, when I had just hit school age it was the early 80's and for any child ( well ok, for boys ) who had trouble sitting still there was a revolutionary new treatment: Ridalin. <br />
<br />
Starting around the time I was 6 or so any kind of punishment of children, even non-physical, became an enormous taboo. Throwing thousands of years of successful child-rearing strategy out the window,  the fucking hippie head-shrinkers and &quot;Bleeding-Heart&quot; society fucktwits, decided it's better to drug your children into a zombie stupor then have to actually discepline them and teach them proper behavior. <br />
<br />
This had happened before, but my generation of kids was the real turning-point for behavioral drugging, and the consequences are huge. A lot of my (male) peers have had to fight mental illness, addiction problems, and other side-effects. <br />
<br />
Nearly 2 out of every 3 of the boys in elementary school with me in the early 80's was on some drug. You can't tell me that ADD or ADHD effects 66% of the population. I didn't buy it then and I don't now. What's worse is almost all the other boys who were put on medication in elementary school went on to Prozac, or Zoloft, or Paxil as we hit teen and young adult years. <br />
<br />
That Suicide is a side-effect of Paxil, Zoloft and other MAO-Inhibitor drugs is only now starting to get media attention. But it's too late for Matt LaRoche, who grew up in my town, just one street away from me ... <br />
<br />
I can help but wonder at the sinister irony if Matt had been medicated all his life because his parents were perhaps afraid they might harm him if they disceplined him, Instead they gave him drugs which ultimately led to his death in 1991.<br />
<br />
Matt had been on Ridalin and Zoloft from about age 9 until 17 when he hung himself in his room. <br />
<br />
By all accounts, both professional and personal, with the exception being the school psychologist ..... there was nothing wrong with Matt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was scared shitless.  I don't think I've run since.  I thought the guy WAS a cop.  I thought he was going to shoot me.  I started crying and asked him if he was going to shoot me.  <br />
<br />
My parents weren't the worst, but weren't that great in that stage of my life, but still, I reciognized and had the upmost respect and fear for what I thought was a law enforcement figure.  <br />
<br />
This kid didn't even care.  There's something wrong with this kid.  I seriously think that a lot of you are underestimating the blatant, unrivaled havoc that an irate 6 year old can cause in a temper tantrum.  The news story looks better portaying a poor defenseless child with a piece of glass and the big bad policeman that shocked him...<br />
<br />
I guarantee you this kid was ripping his flesh with the glass, he threw the frame on the ground, which means he probably threw other things too. (Think - books, plaque, golf trophy.)  It doesn't say what he was in the principals office for in the first place.  I'm picturing knocked over furniture, broken glass everywhere, frazzled hair and red faced screaming.<br />

<br />
I'd be more willing to concede that the 12 year old might have needed to be tasered than the 6 year old needed it.  Personally, I feel that a police officer has an obligation to only hurt people as much as required to control the situation and keep people, including themselves, safe.  And while I will grant that for every situation that makes it to the news where the police used too much or inappropriate force, there are probably hundreds or even thousands of incidents where they didn't.  But there are also a lot of incidents that even though they used too much force, it still didn't make it to the news.<br />
<br />
I think this particular police force is probably not using their &quot;non-lethal&quot; force correctly.  Just because it's considered &quot;non-lethal&quot; does not make it &quot;completely harmless&quot;.  And therefore it should be used with appropriate caution.  They don't even know exactly what the long term effects of using a taser on a child might be, because no studies have been done on it.<br />
<br />
An out of control adult who is using a piece of glass to cut themselves and may use it on the officers if they try and subdue him/her using pure physical force?  Yes, I can absolutely see in that scenario it is in the best interests of all concerned that the police officer uses a taser.  I don't see a six year old in the same light.  I don't even see a fleeing 12 year old in the same light.   &quot;Non-lethal&quot; != &quot;Completely harmless&quot;.  And if a police officer can't subdue a six year old without having to rely on a taser, I sincerely have misgivings about the effectiveness of our police.</div></div><hr />

If you ask me the little fuckwit had it coming.  Granted it does seem a little bit harsh, but if he had already cut himself multiple times and they were honestly worried he might stab or cut himself in a bad bad place .... which would you rather have to deal with?

It would help a lot if we had more facts, but eh.<br />
<br />
The answer to this is that so many bleeding hearts in this country that a teacher, policeman, any grownup, and soon any parent that lays a hand on a child to discipline them is brought up on charges.  You won't see a teacher today grab a child by the ear and lead them to the principals office.  Why?  Cause some idiot will say they are abusing the child and file a lawsuit.  You won't see a teacher get out a wooden paddle today to discipline a child for the same reason.  The ACLU and organizations like that have seen to this.<br />
<br />
I am in no way advocating abusing a child but this country has gone way to far in &quot;protecting&quot; a child.  That is why the children growing up today for the most part act and behave the way they do.  There are no consequences for their actions and the media trys to blame &quot;society&quot; for peoples actions now.  I see many children today throw temper tantrums in stores and hit their mothers when they don't get what they want.  That is a behaviour that will continue in children if their parents do not teach them that this is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
For the most part, children like this 6 year old are crying out for attention and love.  I do not know if this is the case in this instance but I would wager that it is.  You are correct Raaj, more of the facts would help but I don't think it would change anything that happened in this instance.  School officials and policemen are running scared of lawsuits.  They perform their jobs at the risk of being sued every day.  They defused a situation where a child was trying to hurt themself with a piece of glass.  They did it in a very quick and decisive way which stopped the child with minimal risk to everyone.  I don't think &quot;little Johnny&quot; was quietly sitting there poking himself with a piece of glass or the police would never have been called.<br />
<br />
If this 6 year old were sitting next to a fellow student and cutting them repeatedly would using a taser be justified to incapacitate them then?  Would it be justified to save the fellow student?  If the fellow student were your child would you sue because &quot;someone&quot; didn't protect your child?  Would you be upset if the police used a taser to subdue a child slashing your child with a piece of glass?  If the taser would be justified then, why is the fellow students life and safety something worthy of incapacitating the child for and not that childs own life and safety if they were doing to themself?<br />
<br />
Just more to think about,<br />

<br />
Now...that being said, there is no way a competant LEO should have had to resport to a LDF scenario to subdue a 6 yr old child, period.  There is absolutely no way to sanction this.  Do not be surprised if the officers involved are suspended pending review, and will more than likely be fired.  There will definately be a civil suit identifing, the school, the principle, school officer, as well as the two responding LEO's as defendents.  Considering the shock value of this (excuse the pun) I would say they have a very good chance at meeting the burden proof necessary in civil litigation. <br />

second note, a taser has never EVER once been the *primary* cause of any death. there are a number of deaths that have been recorded where a taser was used, but it was never proven to be what killed the individual.</div></div><hr />

The training also involved them having it used on them at least once, if not more times, so they know what it's like and will use it with discretion.

Kicked his wrist?  You go girl with yo rambo kung-shiz-fu tactics.  If shit had hit the fan and he sliced himself yet again or better yet you broke his fucking wrist, you'd have caused a fuckton more damage than a stun-taser.  Tasers these days have projectile electrodes, thus you can shoot someone in the blink of an eye who is many feet away.<br />
<br />
Not trying to stir up yet another argument off-branch but seriously it's time to stop bitching for bitch's sake.  This isn't targeted specifically at Gerick but back up and look at the scenerio.<br />
<br />
These police were not shocking the kid to teach him a lesson, they were disarming the situation as they were taught to do.  My guess is they did everything here by the books to the letter.  Kicking the kids wrist would not have been by the book.  Had anything gone wrong and they taken different action these guys would have been in serious trouble.<br />
<br />
The kid had threatened others.  The kid had threatened himself.  The kid had already sliced himself in multiple places.  This situation had progressed beyond the point of trying creative tactics.  WHO THE FUCK CARES if the kid hates the police as a result.  My guess is that he's already been taught to hate authority based on his actions that day.  He posed immediate danger to himself and the officers<br />
<br />
The kid sustained less injury (just some pain) from the officers than he would have if the officers hadn't done what they did.   Yes 50,000 volts will hurt.<br />
<br />
Some people here are way too fucking ready to criticize everybody.<br />
<br />
I swear I've gotten stupider reading some of this shit.  They did it by the books.  If you have a problem with that then contact the national police headquarters or head of whatever/wherever and have them change the books.  The only thing that made this situation special was that the culprit was 6 years old.  A<br />
<br />
Any 6 year old who can readily slice himself and fucking threaten others in such a manner is not your average 1st/2nd grader and should NOT be treated as such.  Disarm them quickly/safely with no permanent harm and deal with him on a psychiatric level later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to think this went on long enough for the police to get there?<br />
<br />
6 year old or not it was a dangerous situation, and the action the police took probably saved the child much more harm in the end.<br />
<br />
It's easy to say &quot;well if i was there then i would have ... &quot; but fact of the matter is that you werent there and that you can't possibly understand what went into the making of this decision.  I agree that it seems it should have been possible that you could forcibly take the glass from him (after all he is only 6) ... but i realize that these people probably already tried it or something close to it.  Hell, it was probably the first thing the principle and/or security dude tried to do.  It obviously didnt work, so the taser was the next best and safest option.<br />
<br />
If it was done by the books and the officers are fined/punished for it, may the perverbial god have mercy on our souls, because we're a bunch of fucking hypocrits on a witch-hunt.  Unless it was not done by the books the officers did nothing wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not condemning the police as having been way off in left field on this one, but barring some very significant facts showing that this kid was far more dangerous than your typical six year old, I'm not ready to assume that just because the police officers did it, it must therefore have been correct, proper, and by the book.  And even if it was by the book, sometimes the book is wrong and needs to be changed.</div></div><hr />

Tasering is painful but otherwise pretty harmless.  It may have seemed extreme on a 6 year old ... but this 6 year old had created a pretty extreme situation and was a far cry from your average 6 year old.<br />

I know when i was 6 i wouldnt have had the drive/balls to cut myself once ... much less repeatedly.  He was a danger to himself and that danger needed to be neutralized.  I hope the officers don't get in trouble  :(  .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tasering is pretty harmless under certain situations.  If the person is an adult of reasonable size and weight.  If the person isn't abnormally fatigued.  If the person's body isn't otherwise stressed due to alcohol or drugs.  If the person's body doesn't have some other flaw that could potentially be aggravated by the shock, such as weak heart.  If the effects of the taser don't cause the person to lose their balance in a situation were falling could be particularly bad (ledges as an example).  Most of the time, with most people, tasering is merely extremely painful.  But that's not always the case.  It's not truly &quot;non-lethal&quot;.  It's more like was said above &quot;less lethal&quot;.   And no one really knows how much the risk goes up when a taser is used on a child.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not kung-fu shit by the way, its what they trained them to do before they had tasers to use any time there is a tiny bit of threat, hell the constible of my county is right next door, sure as hell doesnt use a taser for shit.<br />
<br />
Tasers are set up for full grown adults who probibly already have their personality set in stone.<br />
<br />
Kids are smaller, still having changing brains, and this one here probibly will grow up to be a cop killer now... its kind of like giving a 200mg dose to someone whos weight class dictates a maximum of of 50mgs of that kind of drug.<br />
<br />
Tasers can kill people with weak hearts, weak eletrical signals (like say, small children) can cause heart tremmors or shock... might even bring out a seizure that was previously unknown.<br />
<br />
Pain isn't harmless if it doesn't leave marks... kind of why torture is illegal and all  :)<br />
<br />
You know, the cop could have just grabbed his wrist and help him up by it... if he was swinging around the glass (wasn't he to busy cutting himself up for this anyhow) something as simple as a nightstick could stop that PDQ.<br />

I disagree...<br />
<br />
Any competent LEO should have been able to undertake this with no assistance/stress what-so-ever.  The only additional cuts he could have recieved would maybe be his hands when the glass was being removed after subduing the child.  Threats to the officer were non-existant, imo.  The child ceased to be in danger, or any potential harm to anyone else upon the LEO's arrival.  I was not there but I feel safe making this assertion.<br />
<br />
Ill even go so far as to say the School Principal should be removed from his position for failing to take charge of the situation and remove the glass from the student's hand.  Especially once other school employees arrived.  We're not speaking of teen-agers here.  We're speaking of stepping in and immediately preventing further harm to this child.  I think I would have come un-glued if I found out this person sat there and watched my son, hurt himself...without doing anything other than picking up a phone.<br />

<br />
I completely agree with Ugle.  Until proven otherwise this is what I believe should have happened.  The officers arrive on the scene.  They speak briefly with the principle to determine what appears to be the situation.  If they have gloves, which they very likely do (remember we live in an age where you can get HIV from a dirty needle, many officers carry gloves to offer protection from such things when searching suspects), they put them on.<br />
<br />
One officer is assigned the objective of making sure the child doesn't manage to scamper around the second officer.  The second officer closes in on the child, reaching to secure the arm that the child is using to hold the glass.  He lifts the arm up over the kid's head.  If the kid is resistanting, he either places a leg behind the child and uses body leverage to put the kid off balance and lowers him to the floor using the secured arm to do so in a controlled fashion, or he simply pulls up on the arm until the child can barely keep his toes on the floor.<br />
<br />
Either way, the kid isn't going to be able to do much more than kick, scream, and flail around with the unsecured arm.  At that point the officer simply focuses on removing the glass from the child's hand as safely as possible.  Pressure on the wrist can be used to assist in forcing the hand open.  Surely the officer is strong enough to pry the kid's fingers off the glass if need be.  The officer either ends up with the glass in his hand, or the glass clatters to the floor.  Either way, mission accomplished.  And the whole thing shouldn't take more than a minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IE them even beginning to approach child results in child slicing himself yet again, but this time perhaps in a lethal or otherwise very damaging manner.<br />
<br />
My guess is the child had isolated himself off in the corner of a room far from the reach of the adults ... police talked with him and then perhaps made movements toward him. Those movements agitated the child and he sliced his leg to show he meant business.  You can do a surprising amt of damage in mere seconds with a sharp piece of glass, and given the kid's prior actions the officers were led to believe that any movement on their part could yield a bad situation.<br />
<br />
Solution?  Taser him from the far side of the room.  Electrodes hit the child in a fraction of a second and the other officer rushes to catch the kid from falling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For this to be reasonable, there would need to be an indication that the kid was actually cutting himself deeply enough to be the kind of threat to himself that you envision.  If the cuts were deep enough, then yes perhaps what you say makes sense.  If on the other hand, which is what I believe to be most likely, the cuts were pretty superficial and while they probably bled some, weren't causing an immediate threat of him bleeding out and weren't an indication that he could cause a wound that would be of that level of threat.<br />
<br />
Have you every tried to intentionally cut yourself?  To actually be able to cut yourself deeply enough that you're not just breaking the skin takes some real focus.  It's really not mentally all that &quot;easy&quot; to do.  The body, as you well know, has built in resistances to the whole concept of self mutilation because of the negative impact of pain.  Most people couldn't override that resistance if they tried.</div></div><hr />

Gerick this has already been stated many times.  This was not a hand taser it was one of those taser guns with a range of many feet.  It shoots out 2 little electrodes which clamp onto or prick into the skin.  After impact the shock is sent forth through wires.<br />

Of course this is what they're saying.  They are going to portray the situation in the best possible light for the police department.

&quot;We can't be sure if that the child was not harmed other than the little tiny probe pricks you get with the taser. We have no reason to believe that the child would have subsequently cut his vein.

They did the correct thing in calling someone trained to handle the stiuation better. None of you know the size of the room or positioning of furniture... so tactical bs like you circle that way ill circle this way doesn't mean shit. If the kid was behind the principals desk and the only avenue to him was around obsticles then it's substanially more dangerous to the child to attempt to overpower him. I've revised my magic marker test. Tell the kid to color on himself before you disarm him and watch how much ink he can cover himself in.

Speculation, which goes against the norm.  You don't know that.  Yes, the child was behaving abnormally, but we have no indication how abnormally beyond a willingness to cut himself enough to bleed. <br />
<br />
They did the correct thing in calling someone trained to handle the stiuation better. <br />
<br />
In general I agree.  I'm wondering about the security officers involvement, but I wouldn't necessarily expect teachers to get involved in a physical confrontation.  Calling the police at least superficially seems reasonable.<br />
<br />
None of you know the size of the room or positioning of furniture... so tactical bs like you circle that way ill circle this way doesn't mean shit.<br />
<br />
It certainly is more relevant than your speculation regarding the extent of the child's abnormal behavior.  You know less about what the child was capable of than I do regarding the physical set up the room.  Class rooms do tend to be big square or rectangular rooms after all.  Therefore assuming that they were in such a room isn't a huge leap of faith.<br />
<br />
I'm glad some of you weren't involved in disarming the situation becuase it's that kind of typical macho atiitude that would have facilitated that kid's death or much more serious injury. <br />
<br />
So you think that believing that an adult male LEO would have substantially more physical power than a six year old child is based on macho attitude and not on an understanding of the reality?  Six year old children are weak.  Statement of fact.  It is known to be true.  It's not really open to serious debate.  That isn't machoism.  That's an understanding of the limitations of six year old children.  Their muscles haven't had a chance to develop.  Hell, even most teenage boys are weak in comparison to similar sized adult males, because of the same thing.  Muscles continue to form and fill out into the early 20s.  But a teenage boy is certainly far more of a threat than a six year old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That right there is overwhelmingly abnormal for a 6 year old ... 6 years old .... 1st/2nd grade .... ninja turtles and legos age ... you know ... i'm just learning my letters and basic arithmetic ... not to mention he had the presence of mind to break the frame get the glass and threaten/use it in the first place.<br />
<br />
Apart from his head spinning around in circles while breathing fire and punching holes through brick walls i really don't know how a 6 year old can behave much more abnormally than he already was.<br />
<br />
Any child with such presence of mind and the willingness to cut himself and make himself bleed in the first place is certainly a danger to himself if he decides to mutilate his own body in an attempt to keep people back ... especially since at the age of 6 nobody really understands the concept of death.  He doesn't know how far is too far or how much danger he had really put himself in.  You can't treat him like any regular rebellious child, because most normal kids wouldnt voluntarily put themsevles in such a situation much less slice themselves open and smear their blood all over themselves.<br />
<br />
That kid does not know the boundaries or even his own mortality.  As such, if he can inflict that kind of damage on his body voluntarily how the fuck can you trust he won't kill himself if pushed hard enough.  The situation was disarmed.  Yay .. stuck the bastard in psycho treatment and lets get on with our lives.<br />
<br />
As to the &quot;i'm stronger than a weak 6 year old&quot; argument ... that is irrelevant.  Once the police reached the kid it was game over for him.  Nobody is disputing that. The question is how much damage could he have inflicted on himself before the police got there.  Chances are that damage would have been significantly greater than the taser shock he experienced.</div></div><hr />

If the kid was behind the principals desk and the only avenue to him was around obsticles then it's substanially more dangerous to the child to attempt to overpower him.

Any competent LEO should have been able to undertake this with no assistance/stress what-so-ever.  The only additional cuts he could have recieved would maybe be his hands when the glass was being removed after subduing the child.  Threats to the officer were non-existant, imo.  The child ceased to be in danger, or any potential harm to anyone else upon the LEO's arrival.  I was not there but I feel safe making this assertion.<br />

&quot;If the kid hadn't already cut himself multiple times the best option would have been manual disarmament. As is, though, he proved himself to be capable of inflicting great harm on himself and was therefore a threat to himself that needed to be neutralized.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, how was the child out of danger? &quot;Most adults can't cut their own necks deeply enough&quot; to paraphrase - how about an adult willing to cut other parts of their bodies open? Agreed, the 6-year old can't do shit to the officer... but he can hurt himself plenty. I can recall when I was 8 I was pretty messed up myself (which is why my father has spent jail time) and I nearly killed him from 20 feet away by throwing an object at him. It was a plastic hairbrush. It punctured a door and snapped into two, falling to the floor. Ever heard of the Unbendable Arm technique from martial arts? Same application.<br />
<br />
A kid can't cut open an adults neck excluding severe circumstances (which may be warranted by this), however, they are more than capable of cutting through their own necks (keep in mind that they have VERY little muscle there and the windpipe is near the surface) leading to the conclusion that to try to close with the child could have killed him. I'm confident in saying that while it is not KNOWN that the kid would have killed himself it is very possible.</div></div><hr />

But seriously.... kid is 6 and holds himself as a hostage. Something's not right.  The cops no doubt should've used force to stop him.  Whether they should've tackled him or tazered him I'm not sure.... but he's alive and fine now isn't he? The only person hurt in any way in the whole ordeal was the ...umm.. assailant(?) so I don't understand what's wrong.  Kid threatens to kill himself ---&gt; Zap he's neutralized ---&gt; no one else is hurt and he's alive and well today.  <br />
<br />
I could see why tazering a 6 year old seems outrageous, but point is he's alive, no one else was hurt, and next time he thinks about doing this he'll relate it to being shocked to bajeezus.  Trauma isn't always a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you're right.  But do we as citizens really want to allow the police to utilize a taser gun whenever they get the notion?  Shouldn't there be reasonable constraints when using a taser gun is considered too extreme or too dangerous?  And if using a taser gun against a six year old is okay, when there certainly appear at least superficially to have been other viable options that would have been less traumatic, where is the line on tasers?  Are they going to become the solution of first choice from now on?  See where this could lead?</div></div><hr />

I agree.  IMO they had already reached the Use of Force Line.  They had to manually disarm the situation somehow, and of the available options this one was the safest to everyone involved.  I'm sure if this case is publicized strongly we'll have a better idea of room placement and the reasoning into the officer's decision.  I, for one, am not one to jump to conclusions and go no a witch hunt just because people had to make tough decisions in a tough situation.  I'm sure Ugle, having been in the military, can appreciate this.  People in the line of fire who deal with extreme situations on a daily basis are inevitably going to have to face scenerios like this.  When that time comes and they face a brutally dangerous and controversial episode will you hang them out to dry?  Oh yeah ... some of you already have.   All i can say is thank god you have no authority.<br />
<br />
From all their training and experience they did what they knew was best, and in the process they disarmed a bad situation w/out hurting anyone in the process.  The fact that you (the collective you) are willing to crucify them without knowing all the facts and comparing this situation to a racist cop tasering a black/mexican/indian/whatever-the-race out of hatred and annoyance really makes my blood boil.  They had passed the line of rationally dealing with the child (henceforth referred to as 'the culprit' as any 6 year old who can do what he did is no child in my eyes) and the culprit had threatened and partially carried through with self mutilation.<br />
<br />
Tasers are not for punishment ... they have not been used for punishment by the law men.  They are for disarming deadly situations in a non-lethal manner.  Yes it hurts, but it also hurts to have your arm twisted and be thrown to the ground and handcuffed.  Painful disarmament goes with the turf.  If the culprit had been 14, 18, 27, or 35 you'd have no problems whatsoever.  This time he was 6, and you're letting that get in the way of good judgment.<br />
<br />
Shame on you.</div></div><hr />

MIAMI -- Police have acknowledged using a stun gun to immobilize a 12-year-old girl just weeks after an officer jolted a first-grader with 50,000 volts. <br />
<br />
According to the incident report, officer William Nelson responded to a complaint that children were swimming in a pool, drinking alcohol and smoking cigars on the morning of Nov. 5. <br />
<br />
Nelson said he noticed the girl was intoxicated and was walking her to his car to take her back to school when she ran away through a parking lot. <br />
<br />
Nelson, 38, said he chased her and yelled several times for her to stop before firing the Taser when she began to run into traffic. The electric probes hit the girl in the neck and lower back, immobilizing her.<br />
Nelson said he fired for his safety along with (the girl's) safety. Paramedics treated the girl, who went home with her mother. <br />
<br />
The company that makes the stun guns claim they are safe for anyone over 60 pounds. <br />
<br />
Fresh fuel for the police flames heh.  <br />
<br />
What about this situation?  Drunk 12 year old running from the police almost ran out into moving traffic.  Police tasered her to prevent her from getting hit by oncomming traffic.  This one was 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vick</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where i don't agree with tazering the 11 year old girl for playing hookie or whatever i see tasering the kid as a viable solution to what was happening. Hear me out.<br />
<br />
Broken piece of glass. Sharp on all edges. Kid was probably palming the fucker cuz he dont know any better. stepping towards him can cause kid to freak out, clasp down on the glass cutting the hell out of his hand (maybe perminant damage) and still giving the kid a chance to lodge the piece of glass into a random body part. <br />
<br />
The article didnt go into detail but i doubt the police were exactly standing next to the kid. probably had a good 10 feet gap between giving kid plenty of time to cause real damage if provoked. <br />
<br />
I sympathise for all kids that fuck up by mistake because they don't know any better. . . within reason. Kid touches a hotplate, burns hand ouch lesson learned. kid pulls a gun, shoots a friend on accident. Kid doesnt get punished but the parents do for leaving the gun within reach. somewhat understandable but kid would at most go through psychiatric evaluation. 20 yr old person who never dealt with guns in origional country, moves to america, goes to friends house sees a gun and starts playing with it outa curiosity. shoots a neighbor or something and hey he's in jail time. <br />
<br />
You may say there's a difference in these 2 situations. Common sense would probably come up. but say you went to somewhere COMPLETELY foriegn to you, see something that looks cool, pick it up and hey you just killed your friend. You feel like shit but didnt know any better. All around same situation imo. People have to learn by mistakes. <br />
<br />
But this situation with the 6 year old kid is different. It wasn't that he didnt know any better. He was past the point of putting glass to arm to see what happens. He was fending off Full Adult's with it showing he knew that he could hurt himself badly. That gives him an adult's mind in the situation. <br />
<br />
Once again, steping towards him would cause serious harm. So from a distance how do you resolve this when talking doesnt work. Non Lethal Ammunition is basically what your looking at. Options: <br />
<br />
Stun gun: can't get close enough to touch kid thats out.<br />
Tranquilizer: takes a few to kick in giving kid still time to cause harm. Thats out<br />
Taser: set it to low amp (still high voltage apparently) and shoot him. Chance of kid still grasping glass but thats gunna be a risk no matter what. but kid falls to ground before he can lodge it somewhere.<br />
bean bag projectile: knock a kid's head off<br />
<br />
Look at it all the ways you want. An adult with a piece of glass is half as dangerous as a kid with one. Cop got kid controlled before he could further hurt himself and got him some help. Bitch about needing more police coverage, crime is too high, then bitch about work they do to save a kid from himself. It doesn't sound humane but niether was cutting yourself with a broken piece of glass. <br />

Works for me.  The key is &quot;Objective Reasonableness&quot;.  They just need to be able to articulate their actions later.<br />
<br />
My only complaint about the TASER/6 Yr old incident is it is very hard to justify.  It is extremely inflammatory due to the childs age and the stigma attached to the device in question.  <br />
<br />
In the above case I would say it is justified.  Of course not being present in either case it is hard to play the 2nd guess, game.<br />

I'm not sure if school violence has actually gone up or just that few event's considering the number of schools in the US gets so publicised that everyone knows about it. News stations found that with Columbine there was outstanding ratings. And saught after school related violence to exploit. That's my take on what's happened because im sure there were school shootings its just noone really publicised it to this much of an extent. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the few event's that happen are known about. and the people that commit these offenses are generally depressed, have a chemicle imbalance in their brain or something else. Not always their fault but they are the ones commiting the act do not forget that. A mentally retarded kid shoots up 30 people. Can't really say it was entirely their &quot;fault&quot; but 30 people still lost their lives. The true fault is in the people that neglected to see their depression or problems and their fault for not going to someone to talk things out. People like this need to be in the special attention classes (slow people, crazy people, and depressed people). These classes were first implimented not entirely to keep them from ridicule but for safety of all students. They have great risk of freaking out and causing harm. Not their fault but that's the cards they have been dealt. <br />
<br />
Society has gotten scared to single people out and put them in special classes because parents get mad because they think the school is calling their kid's retards. All kid's are different but parent's need to see that these kid's are different in a way they cause unordinary risk. This kid with the glass is a good example. Im glad that he flipped out in the principles office rather than a classroom with a bunch of 6 year old's running around playing with lego's in teh shape of space ships. the taser probably won't teach the kid a damn thing. But it allowed the officers to subdue the kid and get him to help and help keep him from harming others and himself. <br />
<br />
This is gunna sound crude but Parent's of these kid's and other people in general need to stop blaming this music or that movie or this drug for the fuck up's of the kids. The kid is who caused the fault. They may have been influenced to do such but they still did the act. Manson's minion's are the ones that killed because of manson influencing them to. but they still deserve to rott in prison and then in hell. <br />
<br />
You say but he's just a kid. Well with what he's been dealt, he's a kid thats gunna grow up to be on the news again, in a worse way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Verbal<br />
Handcuffs<br />
Baton (ASP, Side-Handle, Straight, Riot)<br />
OC<br />
TASER (All types)<br />
Stun Gun (Stun Projectile wood, plastic, bean bag, gel)<br />
Grappling Techniques (Choke, Pressure, Locks, etc)<br />
Improvised Blunt Trauma (Flash Light, Clip Board, etc)<br />
K-9<br />
<br />
The list goes on and on...the more of these one has available the less chance there is of an actual Firearm Incident.  I posted these as there seemed to be a lack of knowledge of some the options available.<br />
<br />
/salute<br />
<br />
Verbal didnt work as said. Can't get in range for handcuffs, Baton, stun gun, grapling techniques, improvised blunt trauma. <br />
<br />
Improvised Blunt Trauma isn't something that is taught to cops to use. Baton is designed for using as a blunt weapon in a way it will subdue the oponent but is gunna cause the least amount of damage. Once you start swinging flashlights ect your crossing over to accessive force and law suits fly. <br />
<br />
There is a fine line of what a cop can use for force. They are equipped with a gun to use as last resort, Baton for defenseive use and for clubbing with a forarm action. If you swing the baton in any way, you've crossed the line. The flashlight is used for a source of light. any other use is prohibited unless suspect has taken away baton and is still a HIGHLY sensative area as if you can hit someone with a flashight you can use hands to subdue without that much force. Flashlight is something that would be used out of rage and unprofessional.</div></div><hr />

First...<br />
<br />
I wasnt advocating one technique over another or applying them to this situation, in way/shape/form.  I created a list.<br />
<br />
Second, Improvised Blunt Trauma is taught, hehee.  IF you do not and someone uses one anyway that is where the door to litigation is opened.  BTW, since you brought this up...if someone takes a LEO's baton, Deadly Force is authorized  in most jusrisdictions.  The un-skilled use of a Baton is Deadly Force.  It is listed as LDF for a LEO, only.<br />
<br />
Batons are used in many ways.  Only one of which is as a Trauma device.  Swingin Flashlights, as you call it is not excessive force per se.  Un-proffessional is losing your cool and causing un-due harm to someone in your custody.  Try not to pigeon-hole here.<br />
<br />
Firearms are indeed a &quot;Last Resort&quot;.  Even drawing your weapon can be construed as Deadly Force.</div></div><hr />

Holy fuck that would have been huge.</div></div><hr />

Seriously guys, cut the crap. You're comparing apples to fucking rhinos ... they really have absolutely nothing in common.<br />
<br />
Well Apo, you're entitled to your opinion.  But I still haven't seen you offer anything to substantiate your opinion that the six year old was cutting himself deeply enough to have been a serious immediate concern.  A quote from the police department is more propaganda in their defense than a valid impartial evaluation.   The news article I read gave no information as to how badly the child was actually injured when the officers showed up on the scene, merely that he was bleeding and had the piece of class.  For all we know those cut could have been on the caliber of paper cuts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vick</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the kid was cut at all is enough for immediate concern. Sounds like your saying oh he's just scratching himself let him be. Kid's are easily scareable and easy to startle them. A kid holding a piece of glass scared now because cops have shown up is a dangerous thing. ANY slight movement towards the kid can cause him to freak out and lodge this piece of glass into a body part. Any will do. Lets say he gets spooked and shoves it into his leg like the &quot;authorities&quot; are claiming. 6 year old's legs are rather small and chances of hitting an Artery is great. I dont know if they had paramedics at the scene but chances are a young kid can bleed to death in a much faster rate than an adult. <br />
<br />
I do believe the kid deserved the taser, but i dont believe the kid deserved to stab himself and bleed to death. People who are influenced in such a way they make hte choice to commit something like this deserve punishment because that will forever be in their head that this is what he should do. Wasn't his fault entirely that he thaught about doing it, but his fault that he did it. Influencer, whether its parents or bad teachers or whatever, deserves much harsher punishment but the influenced are not in all accounts Victims and should be treated as hazards to society.</div></div><hr />

If this is really how you think I hope the police/psychs whatever find YOU soon and put you where you can't do any harm.<br />
