<br />
I'm not too familiar with Veksar or the certain spawns/camps but he spawns near the where the dragon spawns.  He's got some adds in his room, once pulled he stays put, he will not roam back to his room.  You can pull him to zone in, but he gates.  He wasn't trackable from zone in for a druid.<br />
<br />
Easy fight though, a guild paladin solo'ed him for about 50% after he gated and summoned (pally died when Galuk was at 1%).  Probably take three decently equip'ed people.   Also, he's undead so slays will land on him.<br />

Since you cant loot stuff beyond your flag progress you can't progress any further then this step either so you just have to sit and twiddle your thumbs waiting on repop and hope that you get him.<br />

   Did Girplan Devourer Sunday. An old guildy who is now in a more raiding type guild was looking for help and I was in Scar with the Shambot collecting my drops.  Well I never bothered to ask beforehand but after wiping once with 9 toons, and getting a few more and finishing off the Devourer, he couldnt loot the drop. And none of us knew any other warriors ready for that step so as far as I know it ended up rotting.</div></div><hr />

Can't believe people are bitching about this... waiting on one or two mobs respawn is NOT the end of the world people.  FFS think of how many spawns we had to deal with on the first one compared to this one.  This quest is much, MUCH easier then the old one.

Seriuosly - its not like theres loot on him that can be farmed.  He's a bottleneck, and one that doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense to have this kind of respawn time on.</div></div><hr />

well Kilzalot I actually went through this crap with the original epic so kindly refrain from the &quot;takes a mile&quot; BS.  Its beyond exasperating if this is true.<br />
<br />
If it is a spawn every ~2.5 days then that = ~146 epics possible per calendar year (which seems like alot but if you factor in warrs plus twinks on a server basis I assure you it is not). That is called rationing...it this the EXACT same BS that was done with the original epic (rationing being Sev in that case).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Turelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I cannot give you an exact loc, but it was very close to the Decaying Slavemaster when we ran into him. We were given a vague loc of near shopkeeper, so I took my group there.  We bumped into a ranger who needed help with his epic spawn (highborn area) so we helped him kill A____ Highborn and then he tracked towards Galuk Drek for me.<br />
<br />
So I can at least narrow it down as being between the area where the ranger epic mob spawns and the Decaying Slavemaster, closer to the Slavemaster.<br />
<br />
However, I was also told that he likes to wander, aggro on people and corpse camp (while I suspect this is less of a problem now, it may mean that the Slavemaster spot is not his natural spawn area and he may have been dragged there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>methojs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I can try to get an exact loc, maybe mark up a map but honestly the verbal descriptions of his location have been right on the mark.  I used the verbal description given on Allak, took a rogue down there and explored, decided that I had found the place described and was correct.  It wasnt easy because I wasnt familiar with the zone but I became familiar, ran around everywhere until i knew I could reach him in a couple minutes.  We took him at spawn point, but he can be pulled to zi, only problem is if he gates.  When I found him up I had logged in the rogue in to check and he was not up.  So I logged off, did something on the web and right before I was headed to bed for the evening logged in the rogue again on a lark and found him up.  Luck.<br />
<br />
Someone had posted 2 days +/- 12 hours.<br />
<br />
Based on a recent patch I had determined that 7pm on the evening in question was -12.  I would need to check log but the mob actually spawned at ~1am or at -6, 42 hours after patch.</div></div><hr />

NOW, my questions: IS he trackable? wasnt sure, druid could NOT track from shop, so i have been using a rogue. and 2, anyone have a CONFIRMED respawn time?</div></div><hr />

Excellent point.  The spawn time on this mob is retarded.  It also pretty much guarantees that those of us who raid a lot and are in mandatory raid attendance guilds will not see him because we cant sit on our asses in Veksar for 3 days in a row. <br />
<br />
Hey SoE: Make him triggerable.  Questing is fine.  Sitting on your butt for 3 days, much less fighting other people for the camp that have to do the same thing, is not only not fun, its ridiculous.  Crap like this is the reason people get sick of EQ and leave.</div></div><hr />

Basically, although it's normally a 3-day spawn, it spawns when you zone in if you're at the right point in the quest, or within 2 hours if it was recently killed.<br />

<br />
Went there with 2 time geared groups and he lasted 30 seconds.  So I cant tell you for sure.<br />
<br />
But the guy that got his piece on sunday did it with 6 people Elemental geared and had no problems at all and killed him in 2-3 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I had a tracker in zone at the time I turned in my hilt, he did not pop.<br />
<br />
Left my tracker in zone as I ran myself over there, he did not pop when I entered the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's definately a camp... and the last thing I need before my final fight :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The camp is defenitely BS .... if you don't have alt's, or good enough friens who will elt you use their alts to track, your basically stuck in the room killing the hand that spawn's in that room for 50 hours or whatever the case may be untill he pop's ... then hope and pray you can get 3 or 4 other's there including a slower and a healer before someone beat's ya to the punch.......that's BS.<br />

I thought we were done with this camping bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I don't mind camping stuff.<br />
<br />
I do mind trying to camp a mob that:<br />
<br />
1. Does not have to be done in order.<br />
<br />
2. Has a 24 hour spawn window.<br />
<br />
3. Is massivley overcamped.<br />
<br />
4. Needs a group to be killed.<br />
<br />
5. Is the only mob that gives this type of bottleneck out of all the epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Galuk Drek is definately not triggered by any warrior, it is an ultra-rare spawn that we SoE apparantly wants us to wait forever for and fight eachother over.<br />
<br />
I deleted my Kunark epic Scabbard container before LoY came out to make bank space, so Korbuk made me do the pre-quest. After getting over being annoyed by that, I had FUN working on the pre-quest, and FUN working on this quest itself... until the Elf wench in FV sent me to get her book back from Galuk Drek, and now I've been stuck here for a few days and facing many more, and so now this quest is about as fun as a malignant colon tumor. Sorry SoE, but I don't see how ruining everything is fun.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of /feedback on this sillyness, will start doing that now as well. I don't know of any other 1.5 quest that requires that you wait days for an ultra-rare random spawn that is not triggered nor up on zone reset, so I don't see why it shouldn't be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Uh, you're just missing when it's killed then.  It's on average 2 1/2 days on the respawn.</div></div><hr />

Please God, make the mean men include Galuk in their patch. I won't tug on my sister's pigtails no more when she takes my chocolate milk if you just make the mean men fix this spawn.  Thank you so much, God, your loyal servant.</div></div><hr />

this is what most say, but i have kept a rogue SoS there since last sunday when it was killed last, if the mob would have spawned rogue would have died or had logs of someone killing him.   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Xolerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I can confirm that with 100% sure, its 2 days +/- 12 hours. When I first camped him he poped 36 hours after servers up (2 days - 12 hours) but I didnt have any healer to help me. Next time I spent exactly 53 hours camping him since last kill when he spawed. The last 2 times he spawed on Maelin server were 55 hours and 53 hours after last kill. So we can assume its 2 days +/- 12 hours.<br />

Been clearing Hand in his room and few others near with 4 boxed char (70war, 70cle, 70enc, 66 shaman). 20 min pop and corner is safe even if you ols.<br />

Watched for him all day on my dr00d, but didn't expect anything - a Euro guild warrior was there early camping back there with a full group since early morning, and he was due to spawn.<br />

They gave up later that night, and about an hour later he popped.  Wuwu...will have my epic tonight.</div></div><hr />

Did not hit that hard, one groupable with some decently geared folks.  Might wanna bring a few more just to ensure you get the kill when you find him up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Braddox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">I just got him this afternoon.  I was not able to track him from zone in, or from the first room with goblins in it using a druid.  I'd suggest either having a ranger track for you, or parking your druid one hell of a lot closer to where he actually spawns.  Luckily for me a guild ranger was in the zone checking on a different mob when I asked them to check Galuk for me.</div></div><hr />

I was in the room past him pulling frogs and the local hands for EXP, such as it is there. I was not able to sneak on past him to get teh others I had asked to help, he agroed.<br />
<br />
Got him to 9% 3 boxing WAr/CLR/ENCH (charmed hand for DPS)<br />

Pally and Ranger I grabbed fom ZI as I CR'd made the difference.<br />

I did Galuk yesterday.  When I zoned in I got one of those screen messages saying that he was up and waiting for me.  Not sure how long it took my group to move in to get to him, but it was likely a bit longer than 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">The developer that came here on another thread said he stays up until the warrior who spawned him leaves the zone (ie LD, die, etc.) and then a 15 min timer starts.  If they don't get back in that time he will despawn.  If they make it back it resets that timer and I am assuming the timer doesnt tick down again until that warrior leaves the zone again.<br />

<br />
At any rate, you get a message something like this &quot;Galuk Drek has sensed your presence..... he is waiting for you!&quot; when you zone in and are at the correct step. Caught a few of the local seq mule trackers offguard.</div></div><hr />
