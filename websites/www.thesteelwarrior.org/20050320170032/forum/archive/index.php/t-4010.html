It's about me wondering if anyone was playing FFXI. I was stating that I am on the Ifrit server. Capiche?</div></div><hr />

I created an Elvaan warrior and if I do put any time into it down the road I may pursue the Samurai job.<br />
<br />
However I still want to get my warrior alt to 65 first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reports so far sound pretty good. I actually kind of like that people are not flocking to it enmass like I am sure WOW will get when its released. The language barrier will be a bit of a problem but I hear    <br />
the servers are filled with mostly very nice people. I also like the idea that high end raids are not 72man lag fests, I kind of like the smaller scope makes the actual person feel more important. They could change that though who knows.<br />
<br />
Seems like a nice little title, and from what I read well I am going to go a warrior definately at the start. Paladins I hear are the main tanks which sucks :), but I hear warriors higher up can do some impressive dps. Might do Samurai or Dragoon classes as well somewhere in there.</div></div><hr />

Never like FF that much and reviews about it were not that great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That reminds me of the MUD days...before UO, before EQ. The (roughly) DIKU based world I played in was schemed such that warriors had the craziest DPS possible - via raw damage, 2 massive weapons, your +dmg from both hands applying to all attacks, and a crazy outlook on haste (doubles all attacks). No one else could compare, though second place was often debated.<br />
<br />
I don't mind tanking, it's a rush, but I liked the DPS world, with HP and AC, much better. I've been disappointed that EQ never really pursued that too much; at least, not beyond playing an offensive warrior (which is sad, if you don't have the defense).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FFXI warriors are a LOT more focused on DPS. They have defensive abilities, including a &quot;Defender&quot; (/defensive lite) ability. But Paladins ARE the primero uno tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or you could just go Ninja sub-class and Dual Wield.</div></div><hr />

Are we all going to try to get on the same server? I'm on Ifrit with a few RealPoor people, and was wondering if anyone else is interested in joining us...  <br />
<br />
Ok I broke down and bought the game, I am also on Ifrit.  Finding me is easy, I'll be the one running around aimlessly cause I have no idea what the hell Im doing.  I did get level 7 last night :)  Im not quite sure I like the interface yet.  Visually its impressive though.<br />
<br />
Oh my FFXI name is Randalflag<br />
<br />
Maybe see you in game....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only warriors get &quot;Provoke&quot;, and it is awesome.<br />
<br />
Paladin/Warrior = The tank. :)<br />

-Junk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerapheus</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Precisely, Konj.  I beta'ed FFXI (Cactaur Server, wuwu) and heard from a LOT of higher levels that the ultimate tank is a PAL/WAR, followed closely by SAM/WAR and WAR/MNK.  Hell, even NIN/WAR makes good tanks from what i've heard about one of the ninja's end job abilities.<br />
<br />
WAR is a required job though for any who want to be a real tank due to &quot;Provoke&quot;, a level 5 job ability that is an effective taunt that recycles every 30 seconds.  Any other class that thinks they can taunt without a WAR sub are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You were informed wrong. The best tank IS PAL/WAR, but SAM/WAR isn't because of the armor. WAR/PAL/DRK all wear what we'd call &quot;Plate&quot; Dark Knights are NOT tanks, but instead DPS. You only want the DRK tanking when almost all your group is dead. <br />
<br />
Warrior/Monk might be decent, but you'd have two conflicting skills...(Warrior's proficiency in Great Axes (2H Axes), and Hand-To-Hand combat)...You'd get Chakra though, but it probably wouldn't be too much aggro.<br />
<br />
1 thing really bothers me though....WHY NIN/WAR? Ninjas wear like monk armor.....</div></div><hr />
