<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started a warrior in hopes of doing well in PvP and also wanted in instances.  My plan was to get high enough, get the ubar gear, then PvP when the battlegrounds come out.  To me, WoW is more about PvP than instances.  And to be frank, warriors are pretty gimped in PvP.<br />
<br />
Yeah Ive gotten some kills in, even had fun with intim shout when the Horde was raiding.  But Ive found these few facts to be sad, but true.  <br />
<br />
1) I only generally do well in PvP if I am higher lvl than them.  But this can be applied to all classes.  <br />
2) I do well if I have the element of surprise.  This is generally true, but against a few classes I still lose.  The ability to heal in combat is the single reason why our class isn't exceptionally strong.  We are tanks with med to high damage, but we only have one life.  And unfortunatly that life is very small compared to other classes.  How much more HP's do we Really have above rogues?<br />
3) The last thing is that I can slaughter other classes, BUT its on a 30 min timer.  A 30 min timer in PvP is an eternity, esp since it seems like we are the only folks with 30 min linked timers for our specials.  Other classes are usually 5 to 10 min timers and they are independent of eachother.<br />
<br />
So Ive given up as a warrior in WoW, rolled an alt and am already lvl 22 (started this week).  I would highly suggest anyone that thinks the warrior class is gimped, to try another class.  It took me 50 lvls, and 4 months (was in beta) to realize they are NOT gonna be doing anything drastic or soon.  We will NEVER be on par with the other classes, because boosting us would boost raid encounters.  All I see are nerfs coming, and I'd rather be on a top tier class than on the bottom.  There is a reason they singled out warriors and warlocks for the changes.  Why put so much work into the warrior class when if you put half that much work into another class, you'd be ubar.  <br />
<br />
Late game WoW is all about battlegrounds.  If get stronger with more kills and will want to benefit your side.  Warriors maybe ok for PvE (other classes are stronger like paladins), but for PvP we would be at a serious disadvantage.  As for now, Im shelved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And as far as the pally argument goes, if you lose to a solo pally anywhere near your level then you pretty much suck, sure they can heal, but they also have ass for DPS.</div></div><hr />

I get a 1k+ heal ever minute if i use my heavy mageweave bandaids.  Funny how fear lasts 8 seconds just like bandage =)<br />
And as far as the pally argument goes, if you lose to a solo pally anywhere near your level then you pretty much suck, sure they can heal, but they also have ass for DPS.<br />
and against pallies, I get to heal atleast 2x.  Once when they shield then later in the fight when I fear them.  btw, pallies are able to cast their shield while under the effects of silence.  if this bug gets fixed (some think it is not a bug) then they're gonna have a much harder time with thier &quot;I WIN&quot; button.<br />
<br />
this is not the WoW whine boards so I wont say 'bye' like I normally would.</div></div><hr />

Soon everyone will be lvl 60.  Once the playing field equals out, its gonna be hard times.<br />
<br />
Have you really pvped a paladin?  Their dps is comparable to ours and if they are in defense, they have 4 lives.  Even IF they do crap damage, its enough to wittle you down before you can kill them 4 times.</div></div><hr />

Every time she was close to death, heal. She ran low on mana and she took off, I couldnt pursue because I was close to death and out of mana so we both got to regen mana when I caught up she got a lucky crit melee hit and won. This was me as a shaman, against a paladin 3 levels above me. If we had been equal level, id have wrecked her butt. She just had enough of an edge in mana over me to outheal me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont really have alot of trouble with most classes in PvP or duels...it helps that my guild meets up once a week or so and has a fight night, so we can all learn each classes weaknesses/strengths.  <br />
<br />
The biggest pita for me is the damned Paladin.  I can normally beat them but it takes freaking forever.  Purge is the largest factor in beating most classes, but is key to beating a Paladin, along with a well timed shock, of course...hehehe.  I absolutely hate Paladins...annoying as all hell.<br />
<br />
I look at the Shaman/Paladin as the 8 ball for each side.  The equalizer, so to speak.  We'll see on the battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because one gets mortal strike and the other doesn't.<br />
<br />
From my experience, give a pal and a war both the same 2hander, an offensive war will outparse an offensive pal, as it should be, since pals can still heal as such.  Mortal strike + the crit dot talents seems to be quite a bit more than the +25% dps seal we use.<br />
<br />
People think paladins do high dps due to the seal/atk sploiting that was going on.  Remove that and its a lot less clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">fix the silence bug and paladins will be much easier to deal with as a prot spec'd war with shield bash silence.  that they can cast their dispelling shield when silenced and get rid of every debuff is fucking GAY!  Currently the best one can do is stun the bastage and that only works a few times (they stop being stunned after 3 or 4 stuns).<br />
<br />
Pallies may get some nice DPS talents but they gotta pay through the nose for it.  We start being able to dump our first talent point into crit modifiers where they gotta drop 25 talent points into the Retribution tree before they get theirs.</div></div><hr />

I have more trouble in PvP vs warriors then I do against any other class. I love the bind wound idea when pallies go invincible lol never occured to heal when they did their thing.... damn I can think of a few times that would have put me over the top against higher lvl pallies. Another extremely beautiful thing warriors get in PvP is Execute omg it's like the last 20% of the opponents life bar may as well not exist.... I love watching a pally start his heal at 40% health and die the moment he reaches 20% before his heal gets off. WoW warriors have more utility in PvP then they ever have. One question tho... How do you fear an opponent in PvP I cant figure out how to target myself to do intimidating shout (I'm assuming thats the skill you use) I love using it when I'm fighting multiple people solo, but when its 1 on 1 how do you fear the opponent?</div></div><hr />

errrr you dont target yourself to cast intimidating shout hehe =O  It fears everyone around you except for the guy you have targeted, who stays and &quot;cowers.&quot;  Of course if there is any sort of DoT on your opponent, it wont work (ie Deep Wounds nerfs it).</div></div><hr />

I respec'd and got rid of it.  I also picked up last stand and left TM at 2 (to see what it was like).  So far very few complaints, if any.  But it does lower your dmg output to skip Deep Wounds =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman are evil. You really dont expect a shaman to deal out as much melee damage as they do. At least at the mid levels. If my enemy cant stun me and keep me still, he will lose, no matter what class he plays. Ill keep swinging around you, dotting and insta nuking and hammering away just wearing whoever im fighting down. But you can really cut down on my effectiveness if you equip your fastest weapon and target my totems. In two hits you can remove my ability to subtract 12 damage from every hit you manage to land, and remove my heal for 8 damage every 2 seconds. They suck a LOT of mana out of me so if I replace them, I wont have the mana to heal myself very well. If I dont replace them, then im giving up alot of my staying power. First order of business in one on one or group fighting, take out the totems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every totem (except for the taunting one) has 5 health, right?  If so, I think I've just come up with a nice use for Thunderclap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totems are rarely worth the time it takes to kill them in PvE, and I doubt this changes in PvP especially since some mobs actually get special totems.<br />
<br />
For example you can destroy a totem that subtracts 12 damage, but that takes up one of your round, plus whatever it takes to target the totem and then target the shaman again.  Same deal with heals.  Also, at least with PvE, I know there is no way to tell the difference between a NPC is dropping a heal totem or casting a heal on himself, but spell interrupt abilities never work on NPCs when they use totems (unsure how this works with PCs).  So it is better to let the totem stay, with the assumption that no one's going to cast the same totem twice, so you can tell when a healing spell is actually being cast since the consequence of not stopping a heal spell tends to be worse than the consequence of not stopping a heal totem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe thunderclap does not destroy totems. :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, I respeced to arms -&gt; MS + fury (crits) last night and soon after that I went out to try it on a lvl ?? warlock (me being 43 war at that time) who was raiding menethil harbor with his lvl 60 shaman friend. They got me as soon as I got off the gryph. After I came back and rezzed they were a bit spread out and the warlock had 75% health with a guard on his tail. Having plenty of rage potions cause im an alchemist i took a swig and jumped into the fray. I dont know what happened but after the second MS the warlock died. It took like 10 seconds to do it. They did take revenge later though but it was sweet. <br />
<br />
Killed a level 50 rogue the same day, without MS, you know how :p Killed a level 47 mage, all i did was drink a frost protection potion, cause 99% of mages go for frost line and their defense depends on frost ae's. Then you have pummel. A rage potion and a couple of MS and heroic strikes is all that it takes to turn the tables vs a caster. Surprise helps too. If they turn tail and run you can intercept or stop attack and charge. Duelled a level 39 paladin who was 3 levels below me but the nerve of that guy he challenged me. So I beat him up good after sunder and kept disarming him (TM is teh win). He healed a couple of times but I beat him so much eventually he couldnt time it for the third and I executed his ass. I finished at 60% health. I always have healing potions, invis potions, run speed potions and spell protection potions for teh win.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Change my class? Hell no. If I have a healer on my back I'm an unstoppable beast. Tbh, I did get tempted to start a rogue but I didn't. Reason being I've been an EQ inmate for years and now finally I have freedom and the powah I wanted playing the same class I always play and a great game!!~ I still get owned in pvp sometimes but I take it as a challenge. I also believe warrior issues will be adressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-21-2005, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totems are insta cast spells, you cant stop them. But, if you take that single round to destroy say the stoneskin one, you have no idea how large a chunk of our mana gets wasted to put it back up. Its almost the same as a major heal spell cost wise, so look at it this way. &quot;If I take two rounds and take out his stoneskin and healing stream totem, and he puts them back down. He can now cast one less heal spell that would take 5 rounds or more to negate.&quot; If a shaman wants to be stupid and keep putting them down, let him, we may do fairly solid melee damage but its not good enough to outwiegh the losses from not nuking and dotting and being unable to heal ourselves. Oh and yes, aside from the taunting totem, which you wont ever see in a pvp fight, all the totems have 5 hp. So if you have some super fast low damage weapon, equip it and take out those totems as fast as you can lol.  I personally play where I put down my totems once, if you destroy them, I accept it and keep fighting. But then, im actually a fairly intelligent fighter. The majority of players really arent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figured totem were instant cast, but the problem is the animation on them makes it look like you're casting a normal spell.  Instant spells should really have a different animation from normal casting spells.  You shouldn't have to go for a 50/50 guess on whether an animation is an actual spell or just left over animation from an instant spell.</div></div><hr />

Burn the combo points then, it's not hard. Expose Armor/Rupture, take your pick. Snare totems are going to fucking kill you if you don't take take care of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if there are no tweaks before battlegrounds, I see warriors as more of a support class rather than in the van as we are used to. we will be extremely annoying if played properly, and that's fine with me.<br />
<br />
warriors could use some tweaks, but if you consistently lose in PvP, your gear/level is underpowered, your talents are not optimized, or you just suck at PvPving with a warrior.<br />
<br />
also priests are rather good in PvP. a priest bud of mine wins many more duels than he loses. all else being equal, the only times a pally really has an advantage against a priest are if the priest is undead or if the pally has amazing resists in the right places.</div></div><hr />

To date, I havent lost a single fight with a warrior who was less than 6 levels above me. I beat a warrior three levels above me without even bothering with my totems.

In group PvP every round your hitting my totems, my group mate is hitting your &lt;insert random fingerwaggler_001&gt; or worse...you.<br />
<br />
My totems in PvP are mostly resists, poison cleansing, AoE, or snare.  Any others I cast are all bluffs (i.e. low mana cost lvl 1 totems to confuse and make you decide to kill them).  I find a lot of my totems are mostly not useful in largescale PvP, as there is too much movement...and they have limited survivability.  But, the ability to distract my enemy and have a couple useful ones in there...every second you target my totems...is another second for you to be gang-targetted.  Something to think about.<br />

If you can get a solid stun on me, you can kill me. Thats really all it takes one on one. Stun me and ill die. I dont know when warriors get shield slams and such but once you do, use them on me and ill go down fast.  Thats how I lose my fights. A rogue gets a stun on me, or a caster immobilizes me.  My range damage isnt exactly huge so I can be kited to great effect.</div></div><hr />

I can't drop a shammy with 2k+ ac and quite honestly, better melee DPS than me in the stun of a concussion blow.  Not with Stoneskin + healing totems and the ability to heal.  Pummel and Shield Block stop one spell..but the lockdown on the spell school expires before the recycle time.</div></div><hr />

led with Charge, immediately used Slam/Hamstring. popped Bloodlust in time to MS him before he healed. knocked out two totems as soon as they popped. switched back to Defensive for Shield Bash (no silence on mine) twice. didn't use Retaliation or a potion, had 800 HP left at the end.<br />

armor was around 4800 at the time. used a Sword of Serenity + Mograine shield.<br />

<br />
Well, I guess we need to start quantifying this, because a Protection warrior is different than a Arms warrior, and so are the shammy builds too.  The cow I keep trying to take down has 2600hp, 3300ac, mostly enhancement build..with flurry, parry, shield spec, crit spec, and 2h weapons.<br />
<br />
By contrast, I run at 2850-2900hp and 4700ac with a shield out, and at 3300 or so without.  I can't put the fucker down THAT fast.   Well configured shaman are ridiculously powerful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A flurry shaman with a windfury imbue is no slouch at DPS either.  He puts out some serious hurt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the shaman I took down was horde, doubt I'll get his build :p I've put enough points in arms to get MS; the rest have gone into Prot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my build is currently full enhance except for 5 points in restoration to lower my heal cast times by a whole half second. I just got flurry 1, 2 more points and ill be able to train in parry. I have to admit, right now im not impressed by flurry, mainly because a 10% decrease in swing time isnt a huge chunk when you are using a 1.9 speed weapon. Im sure once ive got it maxed out to I think 30% decrease that ill be really noticing it. As for you, I honestly dont know what to tell you, when you have a shield up you have him beaten on armor but your dps drops, when you take off the shield you get to hit harder but are on equal ground with armor. Considering that shammy is melee specced, you might be better off staying sword and board and try to joust him. Keep him from hitting you and wear him down. Thats how I win my fights. When i get hit, I take a LARGE chunk of damage from 2h users, so I do my best to not get hit. Ive got to practice my snare kiting to make it even more effective but right now im just circling, running through and generally being almost impossible to center on.  About his only weakness is his lack of mana. He will cast spells slower and most likely for a larger mana cost if he went full enhance so you might be able to outlast him if you do it right.<br />
<br />
I just recently learned a couple new trick that never occured to me so ill have to agree, that shaman are definately a nasty piece of work when played to the full extent of their abilities, but there are ways to beat them. Its all just a matter of circumstance.</div></div><hr />

:confused: I thought shaman was horde-only and that paladin was alliance-only ?</div></div><hr />

Not by a whole helluva lot tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, any Shaman who goes toe-to-toe with a melee class, post 40, is asking to lose.  Shaman are heavy hitters to be sure, and with Flurry/Windfury/2H/Shocks/Talent enhanced Nova Totem, their damage spikes cannot be prepared for.  But...when you play to another core classes strengths and not to your own, you basically are asking for Lady Luck to take a dump on you.<br />
<br />
Ideally fighting a melee a Shaman should use Shield/1H, and kite the melee.  Even with Hamstring you Frost Shock, Earthbind, Ghost Wolf and move away, then just shock to death.  Higher probability of success.  Depends on spec a bit but not much.<br />
<br />
I always try and take away my opponents advantage hehe...not hand it to them.<br />
<br />
This is, of course, my $.02 and with inflation probably worth much less.</div></div><hr />

Imagine a whole raid force of paladins.  You'll have so many soldiers that can heal themselves and each other.  If they get in trouble, the put up their shields and run around to confuse the enemy.  A force of say 30 paladins would have able 3 to 4 lives each.  You'd never know which one can still invincible up, and if you nuke the wrong one you'd be wasting mana.  Could this force be taken down?</div></div><hr />

And with 30 paladins unless the mob is truely ba-assed, you are likely to have the timers reset before you get though all 30.</div></div><hr />

Supposedly not on our server.  Slightly more shaman than paladins; there are a fuckton more hunters and warriors for world-combined than there are shaman or paladin tho (and there are more hunters and warriors jjust on the horde side than there are shaman).</div></div><hr />

I think overall shaman are actually one of the least played class past the early stages. There is just way too much strategy involved to &quot;wtfpwn&quot; people or mobs as a shaman. I was reading that on the blizzard boards at least. Something like 9% of total horde characters across all servers are shaman. Your mileage will vary from server to server of course. I know I sure as hell run into way more hunters than I do shaman on my server at least lol.</div></div><hr />

Hmm maybe its across most servers.  I rarely see that many shamens, a lot more rogues and hunters.  Then again, its usually the hunters and rogues that come into our lands to gank the lowbies.  I don't see too many warriors or shamen coming to gank people.  Rogues and hunters I think are just designed to do that.  Rogues for obvious reasons, and hunters have track.</div></div><hr />

halfway-coordinated priests, rogues, or hunters would not have a difficult time. a fight with pallies and shaman might be interesting to watch once or twice.</div></div><hr />

It's also EVERY goddamned attack on Tarren Mill on Hellscream anyway.<br />
<br />
Fucking pussies.  Lets attack a level 25 town when we're level 60!<br />
<br />
Me and my shammy buddy dropped a 60 paladin who tried that shit at Hammerfall.  A level 50 guard may not stand a chance against a 60 pally..but with a little help from my friends Hamstring and shield bash, he did okay :)</div></div><hr />

Meaning, i can nuke the ever loving crap out of that ?? warrior that is running around, and 8 out of 10 times itll land for very solid damage. Whereas anything about 3 levels above me mob wise, i end up wasting a ton of mana hoping I get a spell to stick. Oh sure, my nuke for 150 damage doesnt exactly frighten a warrior with 3k hp but the point stands, I can actually fight someone that high level if I have to. 99 times out of 100 ill lose but at least it isnt like getting jumped by the ?? guards lol.</div></div><hr />

You must miss all those millions of horde attacks on Southshore; but you wouldn't hear the 38301010110 announcements we get a night on Alliance defense. <br />
<br />
Even better are the myriad of attacks on all the NPCs in Auberdine by level 50-60's...so that our level 10's can't complete their quests.   :rolleyes:   <br />
<br />
The paladins are, for the most part, fucking pathetic in terms of skill or knowledge.  I've come across exactly one good paladin aside from the one Chal plays.</div></div><hr />
