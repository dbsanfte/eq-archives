<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi yall!  We went to Kael last night to kill Vindi and found statue up.  So naturally we killed statue (cheap bastage dropped 3 hammers, but a talisman shard too) and then decided to go for Idol and AoW.  We had about 25 non-EP raiders (avg lvl 63) so we weren't expecting to win, just wanted to try it.  Hehe our MT lasted a whole 8 seconds on him, the raid lasted about 8 seconds more lol.  It was the first time for most of us on him, so we're just stoked to have popped him.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I'm wondering where the best spot in the Arean is to corner tank him.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It used to be in order to corner a mob you'd need a perfect corner and a big enough difference in mob size vs your size to do it, since the mob would warp past you and still hit you if not. Now that they have some real collision, you can in theory &quot;corner tank&quot; in any small little notch in the wall.<br />
<br />
We used to set up down the ramps from the arena though, gave the pullers more room to work with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the first 3 at the frozen wall, then move the raid outside of right arena's ramp, pull a few green/lightblue mobs there that cast, and put necros into groups with healers - have them mind wrack those giants and you can do this kill with under 20 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">can do all of em up at the little niche to the left of the icewall, where the stonewall meets the temple of the vindicator.<br />
<br />
now you can use just about anywhere though... dont forget to not dual wield for aow, or you're eatin 1k ripo's and often =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you very much yall for the info.  We'll try him down the ramp from the arena next time and see how that does us.  We fought statue and then idol back near their spawn points and succored out for AoW pull.<br />
<br />
I didnt get the best look but it appeared that once you were down in Statues pit back there you were stuck.  Is there a way to run out from back there once your down those big steps or does the puller have to go out through the PvP arena?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your puller should be pulling the statue up... nobody should be pulling from way back in that pit, you kill him at the icewall, in the corner on your right (where kallis spawns) Then to get idol out you run up to the big door in the middle of the arena, where the PoZ's are, get to the door and type /target the_idol_of        once you have him on target, taunt a few times til ya get a successful one, once ya do - drag him back out to where you killed statue (to the right of icewall in the corner) idol is slowable, has no loot - then you do the same thing for AoW.... OR you can go and move everyone to the right of the steps into right arena, and kill there, have someone go up the steps that lead into the pvp arena he'll aggro the person who ran there, then pop out on you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">im guessing yall slowed idol because of how badly yall lost to AoW. if you have to slow idol to win then you shouldnt risk blowing the spawn for about a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guess correctly, we did slow him.  Next time we wont (good pratice if anything).  AoW was killed on Karana about 18 hours after the despawned on us.  There was no server reset afaik.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you get to the see invis guards if you go left from there to the ramp and set up raid right there. Corner Vindi&gt; statue&gt; and Idol is hard to corner becuase he is shorter than the rest of the mobs but with gnome illusion  he is ok.<br />
 Now for Idol and AoW we move even farther left in the hall back in the arena side corner. We have found this to be the best place to corner him during the *(&amp;*()&amp;$ where nobody could corner shat. I just got ring last time we did him. The BoC droped for the first time for us. Only took 6 kills. I bid on ring and let the BoC go to our 3rd tank. I am MT/ ST But we are farming SSRA and holding out for a BF !!!!<br />
  least amount we have had would be 35 for AoW.</div></div><hr />
