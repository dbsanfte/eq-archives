<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">in your 50s <br />
<br />
1% per kill?<br />
1% per two?<br />
<br />
just curious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I was 54 if I saw the blue bar move in an hour it was good XP, but back then 54 was a hell level and Karnors Castle XP sucks.<br />
<br />
On my enchanter which was 52 when PoP came out I levelled up to 60 mostly in Plane of Disease courtyard (which I still consider to be the best XP RvR up to 60) I was making a blue bubble of XP every 8-10 mobs so I would say 1% per 2 mobs is phat XP in your 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">good exp in the high 50s now is exp% every 2 kills.  you need to go to the very hard stuff in tier1 to achieve that, like PoN gargoyles or PoD castle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can say I 2 box with my cleric but without him grouped in Veksar at 54 I am getting 1% about every 1.5 mobs so according to what I have heard this is pretty damn good. We will see how it goes when I roll 55</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am talking about a full group, bud. What mobs are you killing in Veksar, the bloodgills at zone in ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aye</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Happy to get a blue an hour in karnors, then I got my seb key and... well I can't remember how fast it was there. Then PoP came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">More recent info :)<br />
<br />
Last night in POS fighting the armadila looking things at the pond, at lvl 58 was getting 1 % per 2 kills and they die easy. The lvl 60+ in grp were gettingg 1% per 3 kills. This is also what I get when in POV when camping RC and LC. So I would think this is what to go for in T2 planes. Just look for the easiest to kill at that % per kill. Is what I am doing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good exp is any movement whilst having fun ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya, but the exp bar is also the fun o meter!<br />
<br />
aye<br />
those are low 40s, you dont get highlevel bonus from them at all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some of the information here seems misleading to me..<br />
<br />
Good xp is not measured per kill. It is measured over time.<br />
<br />
1 AA every two hours is good xp to my enchanter. 25-30% of a level per hour is good xp to my warrior.<br />
<br />
If you measure xp per kill you may actually end up getting bad xp. Fighting mobs that take you 2-3 minutes to kill for 2% is a lot LESS xp then killing a mob every 45 seconds for only 0.75% per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah but I was asking as a 2-box duo not a group. Thanks for all the info<br />
<br />
As for those 40 lvl mobs well its about all this 2-box duo can handle safely enough to actually gain xp it seems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As for those 40 lvl mobs well its about all this 2-box duo can handle safely enough to actually gain xp it seems <br />
<br />
Is is still bestter to kill 30 blue mobs in 60 minutes then 10 yellow-red mobs in 60 minutes.  (This was just an example to show a point)<br />
<br />
Correct, exp over time &gt; exp per mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It only takes one damage spike from one of those yellows to ruin your night. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bordaaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree with you but what you are suggesting is just not possible with my 2-box duo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">group up ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree good exp is over time. It is also relative. In my 50s in Howling Stones (Seb was crowded and KC and chardok just sucked) a 1/2 yellow was a decent night (3hrs). Then came Velious and it was easier to make in Velks/Kael/etc. Luclin brought us decent exp in Seru, UP, Akheva, FG and the godliness of AE groups in the Deep. Today its not even in the same league with POP zone modifiers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Deep AE took like 3-4 days to get nerfed ? ;P</div></div><hr />
