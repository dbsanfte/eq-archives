with gates so far there are 5pct legs and at least 2, 2pct augs, so could go to 20pct<br />

Well, there were +shielding augments from LDoN before gates was released, and you left off +3% on the Shield of Strife, so it would have been possible to get abover 15 even prior to the new augments/items.<br />
<br />
Whether it's capped or not, I don't know, but I doubt it seriously.</div></div><hr />
