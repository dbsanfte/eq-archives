<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With Virtue and Shammy buffs i hit 7.4khp.  I haven't been raid buffed in a couple of weeks (slakkin on raiding but i digress) so i guess i could hit 7.7khp or so in raid trim.  Something in that ballpark.<br />
<br />
Here is my Magelo.  Its not up to date on the AA, but the gear is correct.  I'd update it but Magelo.com seems to be down ATM.<br />

This gear i have is all droppable/player-made stuff for the most part.  I'm Rallos so its a no brainer --&gt; FH all the way.  I'm going to upgrade hands to SS-Myrmydon.  My guild is about to start doing NToV regularly in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
My question is after doing NToV, what will my HP approx?  The player made stuff is really incredible by Velious standards.  Checking Allak for ToV gear doesn't show the incredible upgrades I was hoping for.  There are lots of upgrades, but from the quick check I have done my guess is i'll gain 300-500hp if i get the drops.<br />
<br />
What is a typical war AC/HP in full NToV gear?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">prob not much more AC or hit points; maybe....errr, 50 more AC and 200-300(?) or so more hit points except for them stupid items like a katana of pain.<br />
<br />
out of all of ToVN; all i ever was interested in was a Gadlaurek(i never can spell that thing; forgive me); destroyer belt, mask of venom(which i still wear); and the beforementioned stupid katana of pain(which i still use). <br />
<br />
I'm still basically still in SS/ToVN gear and going from kunark-era/ss to SS/ToVN it was minor if that.<br />
<br />
My opinion? Unless you're going for Vulak you can buy most of the items that are comparable/better than ToVN_grade and get more usage out of it for quite some time to come.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd have to agree with Shikari NToV loot is not something to write home about for most part that 200-300 hp upgrade would take you a good long while unless guild lets you loot more then one item per raid. ToV quests gear ei Bracer of Speed and Vulak rules thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah there aren't too many great items in NToV, and the really good items will have everyone fighting over them.  Mask of sky, ring of sky and belt of the destroyer are good things to look for.  Also cloak of thorns as the poster above mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make a fake magelo profile with the items you hope to get out of NToV and look at your HPs.  Your not likely to get much out of asking what warrior HP totals were like back when other guilds finished in NToV as for alot of warriors the buffs available would have been different, the level cap and AAs available would have been different and its likely stuff like FH wasnt around to compare with either.</div></div><hr />
