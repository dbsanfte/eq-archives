<br />
Have sense? Did my DPS raise a bit?<br />
<br />
I mean sometimes i get a low dmg critical hit so where is the benefit in raising more Critical Hits rate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of the offensive AA are huge dps increasers but when taken together they do add up.</div></div><hr />

However, Fury of the Ages 3 is much better than Combat Fury 3, according to everyone I know who has it.</div></div><hr />

92288 Damage from Critical Hits (17 per minute) 12.8% of Total Damage<br />
[...]<br />
So in short yes definitely do the AA skills to increase Critical Damage. It will add around 12% to your total damage. <br />
In short, no.<br />
<br />
Only 1/3 of each critical hit is &quot;bonus damage&quot;.  The rest of the damage would have happened whether the hit was critical or not.<br />
<br />
That means about 4.3% of TheGiantOne's damage was produced by hits being critical.<br />
<br />
But he would have gotten some of those critical hits whether he had those AA's or not, so not all of that 4.3% comes from the AA's.<br />
<br />
I don't see how we can judge the value of these AA's, unless we know what the percentage of damage would be without the AA's.</div></div><hr />

The only real way to test the performance of offensive AAs would be to parse before and after with the same weapons.  I am just about to start my offensive AAs so I suppose I could do some parsing now to try to get a feel for it as I get the AAs, but it will be a while before I actually have them I'm afraid hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also adjust the crit procs to reflect the increase from normal procs. like the melee was adjusted. the 33% 66% or 100 whatever lvl your ingenuity is. that would have been normal proc damage.<br />
<br />
edit: er wait i just noticed. theirs a aa to increase crit damage? i thought it just added more % chance to crit. might want to fix that. if it is that way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">crit dmg is roughly 1.7x the damage it &quot;would have been&quot;.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, flying kick crits for 306 with a noncrit max of 175 (ratio: 1.75 roughly) ... while my REBB crits for 473 from a max hit of 288 noncrit (ratio: 1.64). guess damage bonus (or lack thereof for flying kick) plays a role.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mainhand: SoD <br />
46396 Damage from Anarchy Proc (3.1 per minute) 6.44% of Total Damage 720K<br />
14400 Damage from Poison Proc (3.2 per minute) 2.00% of Total Damage 720K <br />
<br />
Doesn't this contradict the 2 procs per minute rule? I could possibly be misunderstanding your results, but it seems straight forward enough to me. Perhaps the SoD is one of the exception weapons?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So perhaps the numbers are discounting Inginuity3? I guess what I mean is does your parser divide the damage by the base proc damage or in this case 288DD? <br />
<br />
This would allow the average damage to increase assuming critical blasts and such. Then once divided over time would show the 50% gain.<br />
<br />
I realize I am straffing from the original poster's intent, but procs caught my attention. The 14% total increase in damage sounds believable to me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 11:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem is that he isn't fighting one mob for a continuous stretch of time.  There is basically no way that offensive aa's can add another proc per minute on 2ppm weapons, esepcially since I have about half of those AA's and I'm still under 2 ppm with 285 dex.<br />
<br />
Something's borked, don't take this stuff as fact.</div></div><hr />
