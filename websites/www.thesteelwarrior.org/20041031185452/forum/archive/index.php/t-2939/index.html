<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so first time poster try not to flame me too badly, but last night I was crawling through HS and got the Adamanite club as a drop.  I'm a shaman so I didn't think too much of it, but later as I was getting ready to sell it in bazaar I looked it up online and all the sites have it listed as MNK only, but this one clearly says WAR, MNK.<br />
<br />
So are all the other sites wrong?  Or was this just recently changed with the revamp of HS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know, but if this is true that would make a pretty decent offhander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm...will definately be looking into this when I get home. I have fond memories of using that club on my monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">False.  It's monk only, just checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haass is the mace you checked one that dropped preRevamp? It could be quite possible that this is a new version of the mace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Both Live and Test show MNK only still<br />
<br />
Adamantite Club (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6604&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's BS.<br />
<br />
I want my monks to be tanking with Adamantite Club and Baton of Royal Stature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I could have sworn I saw two classes listed on the thing, but it's sold now so .. oh well.  There's no way I'm going back down there to camp another one as I was just wasting time really.<br />
<br />
Thats too bad because this would be a great weapon for warriors :(<br />
<br />
I did look it up in bazaar to see if someone was reselling the one I got, but all the ones listed had only one class, MNK.</div></div><hr />
