<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the layout was changed, I'm find it a little harder to get around the message board...<br />
 <br />
1) I can't find a link from the front page to the message boards!  On the front page I see various links for:<br />
 <br />
a) search for new posts<br />
b) latest forum topics<br />
c) private messages<br />
d) news archives<br />
 <br />
But I don't see an actual link to the forum list anywhere.  Am I blind?<br />
 <br />
2) The drop-down list of forums has vanished from the thread-reading view. It used to be at the bottom, below the last message in the thread. I used to use this to hop quickly back to the same board or other boards after I finished reading a thread. Now, I have to backtrack, or scroll back to the top of the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I changed my bookmark to be http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum and there is a search for new posts link there.<br />
<br />
I agree with the previous poster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>corillis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a button with 'home' top right. That takes you to the forum. Took me some time to find it too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in the same boat.  All the graphics appear to be disabled...I just get little white boxes with X in them where every button should be.  I've also got amazingly slow load times.<br />
<br />
Was running clean as a whisle for me a week or two ago...I'm guessing it isn't on my side because the rest of the web is working fine.  I've cleared my cashe etc...really love this board and hope these problems go away soon :(</div></div><hr />

1. Which theme are you using? There is a &quot;home&quot; button on the tren-z theme. With the &quot;traditional&quot; theme, clicking on the logo will bring you into the forums.<br />
<br />
2. Forum Jump has been re-enabled.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why you're having any problems, I made a little change that may fix your problem - let me know if it worked. I have one more thing I can try otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm using vBulletin_3 theme, because I like having a light colored background.  Perhaps this is the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the forum jump!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hope ya don't mind my saying... but having the major link into the forums be just the logo at the top of the page is pretty confusing for the casual user.  It's a great shortcut, but not a great main access method.  I'd strongly recommend a link from your menu bar - I've come to expect that when I see menus, it will be my main method of navigating the site.  I'd suggest changing the New Posts link to be &quot;Forums&quot;, and then have Get New be a pick off of it, along with a link to the main forum page, and maybe direct links into the individual forums.<br />
<br />
Just an idea, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">oh yeah, i know.. it's not ideal.. most people get linked directly to the forums though so it's not a huge deal.<br />
<br />
I'll work on getting something a little bit more solid up there, though.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you did but it worked!  I see buttons again and everything.  Much happy now!  Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />
