So I'm looking at using the &quot;official&quot; windowed version of the game in order to continue my low-grade hydra habit.<br />
<br />
I have tested it, and you can get two instances running at one time on one computer.  But what I can't find any info on is any way to switch quickly back and forth between these instances, ala EQW.  Without this, windowed mode simply isn't worth using. <br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your game resolution is lower than what your desktop is at, you should be able to see the taskbar down at the bottom (or if not you can move the windows so you see it, so just alt+shift+r and click right to the other window</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming that this is it (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7fc46855-b8a4-46cd-a236-3159970fde94&amp;displaylang=en).</div></div><hr />

Yes, thats the one. When you get it installed, on the left you should see a bit list of programs. Look for Everquest, then when you click on it an entry in the right with eqgame.exe should show up. Right click on this entry, and then click &quot;disable entry&quot;. This will enable alt tabbing out, but be warned that the windows key and ANY window that would normally pop up over programs will now pop over EQ instead of EQ staying on top.<br />
<br />
To make it easier, use alt tab and cycle through until the last two (or three + windows, dependant on how many your boxing) windows tabbed were both EQ. Then you can just press Alt tab to switch to the other window. Its not as convenient as EQW, but it doesn't violate your EULA and its just as easy to use, with a little effort.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sad when a lone person can make windowed mode work 10x better then a team of devs can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, the Application Compatibility kit did the trick, though its still a bit kludgier than using EQW was.  With EQW I was able to switch windows by pushing one button on my mouse.  Now I have to push two (mouse has five buttons).  But the important point is that I don't have to move either hand off my normal keys/buttons to do this.<br />
<br />
Does seem more resource intensive than EQW though.</div></div><hr />
