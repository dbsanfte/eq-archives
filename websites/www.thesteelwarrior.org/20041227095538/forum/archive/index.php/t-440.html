<br />
First we have a level 65 warrior who trades in haste belt for a dain belt, then insists their shissar ring (enhancement haste III) gives melee haste.  So essentially have a level 65 warrior running around with no haste, despite everything people tell them.<br />
<br />
Then, a SK who is arguing with me that the taunt skill adds a fixed amount per success, and doesn't put you top of the hate list on a success, + a small number.  He is now instructing tanks to mash taunt all the way through fights, including SK's, Paladins and all the other warriors who aren't MT.  No matter how much I try and show him how taunt works (even to the point of demonstrating it) he follows a line of &quot;I know I'm right and I know you're wrong&quot; and continues to instruct everyone else.<br />
<br />
*smacks his head against a brick wall*<br />
<br />
Sorry for such a negative first post on these boards.  I was actually mostly positive on the old ones :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can understand an SK not knowing how taunt works, they rarely use it, and they think they know everything just cause they are SKs,,, but a 65 warrior that thinks focus effects = haste, boot that guy from the guild, and find a level 5 newbie, hed prolly make a better tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I can say is tell the Warrior you are now dumber just for knowing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats one of the saddest things I've ever heard.  You should point both of them here.  If they still don't accept the facts, you should kick them out of guild for being complete morons who will only hold you back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know about other Knights but I use my taunt button quite exstenivly in order to gain aggro.....<br />
<br />
Gindan flayer or other such high DPS relativly hard to mez mob is running towards enchanters, sometimes one stun isnt enough to grab aggro, but a sucessful taunt puts me above him regardless of where I was so Its still a valuable tool in any &quot;Tanks&quot; arsonal for getting aggro, and One should use all the tools avaible to then....<br />
<br />
Sorry for the side tracking =p<br />
<br />
Yes both of those people were stupid...<br />
<br />
Hey maybe you could have the warrior test out proc rates w/ lower haste =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like a couple out of control newbies to me.  Send em over here and we'll straighten em out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shissar ring gives melee stats (AC 8 sta 4 hp 80) P.<br />
Actually enough that i still wear it over any other ring i have (9th coldain ring - has one ac more but only 50 hp and i am stamina capped atm so 9 sta are basically worthless to me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can also tell them josua that if every item you wear is &quot;Magic&quot; than non-magic weapons can't hit them too !!<br />
<br />
but yeah; kick them to the curb as soon as you can..let Darwin weed them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josua</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Brutul, glad to see you're still around.  I've actually made a little migration to the test server myself lately and found it to be good fun.<br />
<br />
These issues seem to have resolved themselves :D <br />
<br />
The warrior with the shissar ring &quot;haste&quot; item has been gone for a while now and the SK seems to have gone kinda quiet on his arguments lately.<br />
<br />
Said warrior now appears to be applying to join our servers &quot;uber&quot; guilds. :rolleyes: I certainly find it amusing.  Now I have to decide whether to inform them of this event or just let them discover for themselves.</div></div><hr />
