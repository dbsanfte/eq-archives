<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jmc82</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all!  My normal exp group are all making alts to play up to 20-25 and then play primarily in LDoN.  Now, we all tend to roleplay alot, and sometimes sacrifice STATs, DPS, etc. in order to use equipment that better suits our visions of our characters. I've never played a warrior, but that's what I'm going to roll with this time-a Barbarian Warrior. I want to use a 2hs weapon-preferably a polearm of some sort, but a sword is fine too. What I want to know is, is there a 2hs weapon that will let me hold aggro that can be bought for 1-1.5k? I don't want to spend too much on him, but  I need to be able to maintain aggro.  I guess if thats not possible, I'll go with a Barb Beastlord, but I would really like to try a warrior.  Any input/suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'd say the easiest, cheapest, best all around useful weapon for the lower end crowd that could give you the most bang for yer buck is...<br />
<br />
<br />
A Mithril Two Handed Sword.<br />
<br />
21/39 or something; with inborn 31% haste. sure it's cookie cutter but it works<br />
<br />
the polearm that i'm thinking of ( weighty polearm ) won't really come of age on you until your 40's...so i'd go with the sword</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">mithril two hander built in haste cheep as dirt.<br />
<br />
if you want to go old school shiny brass halberd<br />
<br />
but as a barb Langseax of the Wolves all the way for roleplaying getting you buds to do the quest would even rock.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Matsuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">iceflame is 2hp<br />
<br />
but holds agro since it does quite a bit of dmg<br />
<br />
very cheap<br />
<br />
1k or less even on the most expensive serves like lanys.<br />
<br />
35 dmg 43 delay ish.<br />
<br />
edit to the post below.<br />
<br />
on my ogre I hit for 80's at level 20.  before level 20 I used a crys spider fang.  if he wanted to keep 2h up he could easily use a centi war spear.  besides, iceflame looks like a polearm. and a centi war spear is better than both the weapons you posted, and also is cheaper.<br />
<br />
and centi war spear is at least not a sword it's kinda like a polearm. <br />
<br />
20 dmg 30 delay 5 ac and some sta I believe.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nathsar Greatsword 17 dam, 30 del + 10 str. It's a very good low level weapon, good for skill gains and good for aggro. It's cheap as well (about 100 pp on my server). If you have a little more gold, go for the upgrade Ornate Rune Blade.<br />
<br />
btw, Iceflame would be crap at his level becasue of damagecap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Langseax, if you're gunna role-play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tillain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doesn't really matter what you use, holding agro really won't be an issue in your 20's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did the Langseax of Wolves quest when I was level 22, back when it was one of the best 2h slashers in the game.  Can't tell you how cool it was to finally complete that one and get my first real 2h slasher.   Later upgraded it to a Mithril 2 hander;  Mith 2h is one of the cheapest and best twink weapons out there.  Good damage and 31% haste, tough to beat for a newbie.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you can save up about 5k, consider buying an argent protector.  Its a very nice sword for low to mid level and it has no minimum level and a pretty decent ratio.   It doesn't have haste but FBSS is like 1.5 to 2k and is plenty of haste pre-45.<br />
<br />
Also, at North Ro at the LDoN merchants they sell a warm emerald shard (50 dd, rec level 30) augement for 40 points that you could put on it once your guy is level 30 or so for a little better damage.  The points come real slow below level 45 so I wouldn't try saving up for a Ykesha proc or anything until later, not worth the effort and you will get better weapons in your 50's anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mithril 2-hander sucks even with the 31% haste. 21/40 becomes what, 21/35? Hardly a decent weapon.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you look into the velium weapons out of dragon necropolis, the velium claidhmores. They are cheap, have no level restriction, and look really cool to boot (long, sharp, silvery blade, with a sharp point and golden hilt &amp; pommel).<br />
<br />
The best of these is 32/36 (Exquisite Velium Claidhmore (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27046)) and the worst is 30/40 (Velium Claidhmore (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=27037)).<br />
<br />
Even the worst one is good at 30/40, holding agro pre-50 is easy with anything, and you can get these cheap as they are now 3 expansions old, from the Velious era.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Matsuri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">it actually becomes 21/32 for those who are curious.<br />
<br />
better than ORB or Nathsar but I'd use centi over it.  ORB and nathsar being with no haste of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aye - plus, even 21/32, you can get something that's cheap and with comparable/better ratio, and THEN haste that with an item.</div></div><hr />
