<br />
well now im DW a BBoT and a BCA and im pretty happy with it, so now im back to working on armor again<br />
<br />
here is my current magelo:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=461541<br />
<br />
i wanna start taking advice ive heard and start getting HP related items, like orc fang earrings, spider eyes, etc, but if i do these upgrades will the drop in dex affect my procs? and if so will it be really bad<br />
<br />
i stand to lose around 24dex with the suggested upgrades, and that seems dramatic, perhaps keep my mushroom veil and cushion the drop to 12dex or so, <br />
<br />
any thoughts really appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rangers glade parsed the differing proc rates as DEX increases, and as I recall it boiled down to :<br />
<br />
1. DEX increasing from 75 to 255 (the max at the time) changed proc rate by 2.5%.<br />
2. There were only noticeable increases of procs at caps of 100, 150, 200, 250.<br />
<br />
So, to answer your question, keep your DEX above 100 as a minimum and work on hard numbers of AC and HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, even as you pass 50 or so you'll prob gain so many +dex items you'll be looking to trade it off for hp/sta/ac. at 62 with full SS (minus bp ) +epics i was sitting at 230 dex without even trying. <br />
<br />
long as it's over 100 i wouldn't fuss with it. focus on the AC/sta/hp's and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree dex is virtually irrelevant for tanks. HP/AC are the two most important, so STA is the stat to work on.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe the parse showed only a 2.5% increase in proc rate from 75 to 255 though, cause I know when I was younger there was a huge difference whenever I got boon to both procs and skill ups.<br />

<br />
I also heard dex increases the chance you get a chance at a wpn skillup, but agi affects the chance of actually getting the skillup...(i.e.;  higher dex = more chances, higher agi = more likely with each chance)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found a difference below and above 100. So jsut keep it above 100 and youll be fine. Most of the time you will be grouped with a sham/ench or both so you can boost your dex via their buffs anyway. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnok</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding item based stats, your ac and sta/hp items are what you always want. I do think that its important that you always grab available dex buffs. Dex isn't important enough to replace ac/sta/hp on your items, but getting a high dex using buffs is important. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we have becomes a class that soley relies on how often we proc to hold agro. That is unless you are in the top 5% of the game and have crazy weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It helps with crits, skill ups (something at my level I still am concerned about, but at 60+ that's a non-issue), and hey, if it adds 2.5% to my proc rate, I'll take that too.<br />
<br />
BTW, importance of sex was something I figured out before the importance of dex.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">alright i think ill prolly just keep the veil (its a nice item and i got it for free) and work on other stuff, orc fang earrings are so cheapy, any recomendations on cheap bracers and gaunts, i was thinking i might quest the soldier's bracer, i think its 10ac, 3sta, 1 dex, better than my LC bracer, and what about gaunts, anyone know some cheap gaunts that can upgrade the crap im wearing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kebilal</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell the BCA - its rubbish, honestly.<br />
<br />
Throw the SC in Offhand<br />
<br />
Get a Goranga Idol for yr range slot, swap bow in and out as needed.<br />
<br />
Look for a Tattered Mantle to replace yr Seb Mnatle<br />
<br />
Sell ya Adamantite Ring, replace with another 6/65 Velium ring.<br />
<br />
Replace both CC ears with orc fang ears (cheap option) or look for Vah Shir Claw for one, Griffon Fang for other (expensive). You could also go for a pair of BS Ears (the 35hp/35mana ones - old skool, but good)<br />
<br />
For bracer, I would look for a crafted or a crusty - more ac than what you have and you are a bit concerned with stats.<br />
<br />
Gaunts are a bit harder - I would maybe look at selling off the FBSS and trading up to a pair of SC handwraps - a tad more haste, same ac as current gaunts with 3 to every stat. That opens up your waist slot for a cheap high AC belt like a chitinous belt, or perhaps you would prefer a TBB....if you don't wish to spend the plat though, head to Velks and start grouping there. CC guants and SCHW both drop in Velks, and you are in a good level range to start trying for groups there. Be patient though.<br />
<br />
Ditch the wolf cloak, seek out a Spider Fur cloak (this is also a velks drop, but you are unlikely to do any of the dog camps at 51).<br />
<br />
Those are all cheap options that I have used in my time through the late 40's up to mid 50's, hunting in KC and Velks and Seb. None of it is uber endgame stuff, but you are after cheap viable upgrades - a few ac/hp here and there and it adds up.</div></div><hr />
