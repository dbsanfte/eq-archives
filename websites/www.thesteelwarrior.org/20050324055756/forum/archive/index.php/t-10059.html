<br />
has anyone done this trial and won scince the patch went through??<br />
<br />
im guessing that any group that was geared enough to actually win this trial wouldnt need the drops that drop here<br />
<br />
did this with a qvic/anguish geared group (twice) and couldnt get past the second wave<br />

The trick is not to waste mana on the commanders that are extremely resistant, and you've to use lower mezzes (all mezzable are 65 or lower) because you now have a smaller mana pool.  If you're using level 66+ heals it'd most likely kill your mana in a hurry.</div></div><hr />

the ae kept going off and everytime it did we had about a  3000 endurance/mana/hp reduction<br />

huh these mobs are mezzable?? tried 2 times with both a bard and a chanty to mezz here and all were unmezzable, both bard and chanty being among the best on the server</div></div><hr />

im not really debating if its doable as im sure it could be done, but could it be done by  a group who actually needs the drops......</div></div><hr />

I'll admit it was hard, but still very doable.<br />
<br />
All of the melee were OOE by 2nd or 3rd wave, and Cleric and Druid were OOM by named (luckily cleric had epic 1.5) and we beat named with me at 40% hp and both healers completely OOM. Enchanter burned two bars of mana himself (using gather mana) on DPS/Runes. We never mezzed anything tho.... Definitely harder, and possibly a little harder then it should be, but considering the loot that comes from it, it's really not out of balance.</div></div><hr />

Not only great stats but that clickie is VERY valuable unless they have Quarm shoulders or Ikki4 Cloak. My guild is pushing towards Anguish (3 trials beaten so far), and I'd wager that about HALF of our casters coulds till use that belt. Hell, the aforementioned group that I beat it with was for the sole purpose of getting the belt (Chanter and Cleric need still). Instead of getting the belt, we got the Eyepatch which rotted since the 3 melee in the group already have it. So I really don't think that the loot is no good for the people who can win the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trials are still doable, and some changes were needed, but some were overdone.<br />
<br />
I have done more MPG trials than anyone else on my server, and the trials in all fairness were probably too easy.<br />
<br />
That said, casters were already incredibly gimped on Efficiency, and making caster DPS even worst won't accomplish much, expecially as warriors are already far ahead of wizards in damage in this trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korgo</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ingenuity has been changed harshly as well.<br />
<br />
Before Cleric; (healerX), Bard DS, Mage DS bst and mage pets owned this trial in about 7-9 minutes.<br />
<br />
Now:  Same group the boss mob poofed after 15min of straight fighting at 10% health this has happened on 2 attempts  now.<br />
<br />
The regen there as well has his HP have been greatly increased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I recall the AE never took anything away from your current mana/endurance, it just lowered the max so it makes no difference if it was going off once and staying on forever or once every 5 seconds.  Now the endurance/mana drain is constant, but you're never supposed to not have the AE on anyway.<br />
<br />
And this trial has always been hard to manage mana if your casters simply refuse to acknowledge the fact that they have about half the mana pool they used to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">12-20-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron, how exactly is a caster who relies on mana supposed to 'manage his mana'?<br />
<br />
I avoid nuking on commanders, rely mostly on Pyrlien skin to do damage, have maxed mana regen etc, make sure to use my epic twice / fight, and I manage to hold up OK with pets factored in.<br />
<br />
Wizards on the other hand are absolutely pathetic.  I have some parses from Msha's and trials where wizards get shit on by every single other class.  Mages do OK, but only in virtue of the pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild is just elemental, only fennin killed and I do these trials with guild groups alot =p Though were also KT flagged and farm ikkinz/yxxta/kt for things. Along with hitting OoW mobs like hulcror/chailak/feratha/zun`muram etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if i'm missing something but I did this trial 12/19/04 and passed it with ease as I have in the past... Think i'm like 30 and 2 for all trials but body.<br />
<br />
Did Subversion(Tactics) 12/20/04 and passed it with ease...Realms when my lockout ended on that.   I've yet to see any real differences?</div></div><hr />

However this doesn't mean you should toss your biggest level 70 nukes on the commander and do 50 damage with your mana bar, and then complain it's broken, which I have seen people do.<br />
<br />
Same with clerics using their level 66+ heals and then go OOM after the first wave, or Enchanters that insist on using Euphoria on everything and complain about not having enough mana left over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Proc from despair was hitting and doing dmg (not sure if this happened before cause I just recently got it) but proc from the hammer off of bluespark wouldn't ever land.<br />
<br />
The bosses name changes from Master of Ingenuity to Master of Ingenuity (Reflective Sheen) so you know when not to click a nuke (magician tried a nuke but resisted but only one so)<br />
<br />
That and his hps seemed beefed up because our dmg shields didn't seem to eat through as fast (no parse to back up though)</div></div><hr />

Arcana trial is doable with the AE. A eplanes/time geared group won with the AE on us about 1/2 the time. Was not too bad. Shaman I think is a must for this trial, for slows and heals and dps. Nothing beats a shaman's ability to regenerate mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barangi~E'ci</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried Efficiency last night with a group setup we've used before and won. Tried having the bard use DA to block the AE which used to work, but that doesn't work anymore. The Master of Efficiency will just keep casting the AE in 5 sec intervals till everybody in the party is affected. Other than that, I noticed no change to the trial.<br />
<br />
Trial of Ingenuity, Master of Ingenuity nulified any DS I had one the last time I tried him and did so as fast as I could recast them. I had Fireskin, Thorny Shield and Shaman DS potion on at engage and they were all stripped when I landed first hit on the Master. Tried reapplying Thorny Shield and 10th Coldain Ring, but they were stripped right away again, so the use of DS on this mob is out if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only trials I anticpate having to do a different set up with is tactics in which one of the dps get replaced with a necro for int ldon chest spells, again bard pwns with aoe invis and his own lockpick stuff.  and can mez the two adds.<br />
<br />
Fear, bard does his fear (aoe)<br />
Effeciency (gee extra mana regen and dps!)<br />
Ingenuity (gee high dmg shield extra attack = more dps from bane)<br />
Power, what needs to be said?<br />
Body (nukes and all three weapon types) <br />
<br />
yeah bards pwn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, but do you not find it funny that a trial named 'ingenuity' is being changed because the players were too ingenuos and beat it in a way not designed by whoever made those trials  :p <br />
<br />
That said, I have no problem with the DS fix as a mage, and as a mage I do OK in most trials except body, but please please take a look at caster DPS, its fallen behind so much in those trials, the only reason to take an enchanter or wizard in any of those trials is out of pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well normal DS might be okay but Pyrilen Skin was definitely overpowered for Ingenuity.  I wouldn't be surprised if it does more damage than the rest of the group put together.<br />
<br />
Caster have it pretty tough on efficiency too since you can't nuke the commanders (and maybe elites too) without wasting all your mana.  The length of the fights (15 mins) also tends to favor melee as well, and of course there is Weaponry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rydeon</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ingenuity is still a f*cking joke, I can beat it with 4, I usually use 5 for it though.  Just have to work together, also the whole DS thing, well nifty little thing about this trial now, he *POOFS* DS when he hits you even bards DS.  Bards DS will come back when it is sung again but all other ds's are poofed including Guard of the earth etc. Its overall one of my Favorite Trials, I also love Subversion.  Efficiency and Destruction are both way way to easy and needed something done, It was overdone however for efficiency and they have since fixed it.  I still think both of those trials are overly easy and need something done to put them more in line with the other trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not complaining about the increased difficulty of the trials.  I am very willing to recognize they were far too easy for the reward, and I farmed the hell out of them pre-patch, and I think we got 20+ of efficiency belts in my guild.<br />
<br />
My complaint was with the fact that some classes are totally obsolete in those groups.  A trial is 'hard' when it requires classes to play very well, for example, trial of fear with a shaman healer requires excellent play by everyone in the group, with fast CC, everyone using wierd tools, and great CC.  A trial like ingenuity takes nothing at all except a very specific group make up, and a certain gear standard.<br />
<br />
Right now, enchanters and wizards are not merely obsolete but a drag on the group in almost every trial.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can occopy the 'slower' spot in efficiency, but a shaman is far superior and so is a beastlord or a bard.  Enchanters are excellent in fear, flat out terrible in destruction, absolutely useless in ingenuity, very good in subversion (charm one of the two guards of the boss) absolutely horrible in weaponry.<br />
<br />
Wizards are sub par DPS in destruction, nill DPS in efficiency, useless in ingenuity, bad in subversion (the worst choice for int caster), bad in weaponry, very bad in fear.<br />
<br />
Magicians and necromancers hold up OK because damage shields + pets for mages, and mindwrack for necromancers plus the ability to dot multiple mobs.<br />
<br />
I do not mind harder trials.  I mind 'more specific' trials, where the difficulty is not in playing excellently, but it is in assembling the required classes.  Personally, fear is the trial where play skill has by far the biggest impact on success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is extremely unlikely all classes are equally useful consider there are so many of them.<br />

Some classes just have it worse than others.  There's really not much that can be said about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way. I had done Efficiency on patch day. It was quite exciting!<br />
<br />
The AE went off like every tick and couldn't be cured!<br />
<br />
Still won with a Wizard, Monk, Rogue, Shaman, Cleric and myself.<br />
<br />
I believe the cleric and shaman were pretty out of mana on the last wave, my gf had to Donal's heal me heh. Inspite of it being horrendously bugged at that time it was a lot more fun that it previously was. Allthough I can't see anyone beating it w/o a very high dps group anymore, and some pretty good gear (as it was when I did it). I've only heard since then it was changed once more that the AE just isn't curabe, doesn't get chained anymore? I havn't done Efficiency since that win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you make them much harder without increasing the gear you're left with trials that people do just for the aa and that's it because thier gear is already on par or better.</div></div><hr />

Well not always, they are challenging when you cant get a guildie or a friend and have to teach a newbie how to do it and they obviosly screw up and make trials hard for you. <br />
As it stands today, having done all trials after the patch, the difficulty from Easiest to Hardest-<br />
Power, Subversion, Realms, Fear, Body, Arcana.<br />
<br />
Realms is probably the easiest with the right classes with lots of error room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually what was said was that the AE was recast until everyone has it.  So you can DA to avoid it, but after DA fades, he'll recast it until everyone has it.<br />
<br />
IE read the thread please.<br />
<br />
(Following the link at the beginning will show you this:<br />
<br />
As of the latest patch, the Efficiency debuff will be cast on any player that doesn't have it, and it checks in regular 5 second intervals.  The trial is designed around the fact that you have to fight using limited resources, and as such the debuff is meant to be on participants of that encounter 100% of the time.  Any methods that enabled you to cure it, avoid it, or negate it were loopholes.  I'm not adverse to readjusting the difficulty of the fight if it's harder than intended, but not by eliminating the main purpose of the trial.<br />

Pyrlien Skin works in Realms trial still<br />

Arcana trial is so fucked up that the RvR is like doing ikkinz3 for nothing but endurance augs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quarm loot in general has much better effects than trial loot<br />
<br />
Not really ...<br />
<br />
Quarm Belt vs Weaponry Belt = 10% Striketrough (thats all)<br />
Arcana Mask vs RZ/P3 Mask = About the same counting HP/AC differences<br />
Arcana Pikestaff vs VDD = About the same, i would say actually a bit better<br />
Ingenuity Cloack = I bagged my Quarm cloack for that one<br />
Something Earring = Better than P3, Worse than TT,  Quarm = Best earring in EQ<br />
<br />
<br />
So tell me, why should 1 group of EP be able to easily farm P4 P5 Equivalent loot ?<br />
Inkkiz Trials were possible with EP, and gave Early time loot.<br />
I dont see why MPG should be doable with EP (hence no upgrades) and give Time &amp; Time+ Loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't seen time+ loot my self in these trials, and as to why EP geared should get time quality loot in these trials?<br />
<br />
Maybe because time loot is three expansions old and to those in time + loot, these trials are easy enough, and for the EP+ folks it's still a little bit of a challenge.<br />
<br />
But again it's all just a argument that doesn't need done.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's like saying why should a sword with time level or + quality be obtainable in yxxta by killing primals...  which takes considerably less then a time raid and is doable by eps...</div></div><hr />

Then I went and did a few tonight.  These are still incredibly easy, I don't see what the problem is.  If you're having problems, then you probably need to revise your strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">londo</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try them without stacking groups with melee damage and see if they aren't a bit more challenging.  These trials probably are pretty easy if you're not using many of the obsolete caster classes in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The group wasn't stacked.  I don't see a warrior/bard/ranger as being elite dps, and we had some of those &quot;useless&quot; caster classes.  As I was saying, just revise the strategy.  I was in utter amazment how EASY these were for the QUALITY of loot they dropped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The people that whine about the gear it drops and are geared above it... /shrug go cry in a corner in mpg raid trial or anguish! =p<br />
<br />
or GoD raids...<br />

hehe</div></div><hr />
