<br />
I'm sorry if this is  an old question, as I'm sure it is....but, I read back through both this board and the old boards, as well as using the search feature, and I couldn't find it, so here goes....<br />
<br />
How does your guild handle MT rotation/duties etc. ??  I mean, do most higher end guilds have 1 MT ?? 3 ?? 7 ??  Every warrior who generally shows up ??    Does the MT do the MT'ing ALL the time ??   Just the &quot;big&quot; mobs ??  any raids ??  Do the top 3 MT's in your guild rotate MT duties on each raid ??  Or is number 1 ALWAYS MT number 1 ??  Number 3 is always number 3 ??   From the ppl who I know in higher end guilds on my own server, it seems that most guilds have 1-3 MT's,  who are always the MT, and who generally receive gear before the other tanks.  I like the idea of several MT, such as say 2-3, for the reasons of A) the usual MT having a night off, or not being able to raid, B) preventing burnout of the MT, and, C) as someone told me, if the usual MT leaves, after being the one constantly upgraded by the newest/best drops, the guild is somewhat screwed/high 'n' dry.<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate any feedback on this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my guild we have 8 warriors. One relatively new warrior who is being geared up and the other 7 who have been around a while. Our guildleader is a warrior, so we usually let him do GL/officer duties and he's our fill in guy when needed. We have our own chat channel to discuss our tanking rotations, and who will do what when. We usually share our tanking duties and do not rely on just one warrior. There is only a few hp's that seperate us so gear isn't much of an issue.<br />
<br />
We all take turns. It keeps us all happy and no favorites happen or we don't get stuck in a rut thinking only this or that warrior can tank mobs. I'm really impressed with how well we communicate with each other and watch each others back when shit hits the fan.<br />
<br />
gearing up only one MT is gonna hurt in the long run. Like the above poster said, if the main tank for the guild takes a night off, can't make it, or gets burned out, you are gonna be set back a tad if only one warrior has the gear and the rest are subpar equipment wise.</div></div><hr />

Tanking makes warrior happy and feel usefull.<br />

If you are doing Emperor SSRA (1 time fight, hardcore) then<br />
you should put your best tank on him. Sloppy Emp fights<br />
rarely have a good ending.<br />
<br />
Lter in the day you are doing KT (not that hard), you dont need to<br />
put your best tank (best=hp/ac wise). I am sure there are<br />
some other wars that can get the job done.<br />
<br />
Having many warriors is important.<br />
Keeping them all happy &amp; satisfied is even more crucial.</div></div><hr />

As a warrior, I cant stress this enough.  We dont do anything special as a skill other then get smacked in the head really really well.  We feel so much better being in the front of a mob &quot;reminding&quot; it who is boss.  Anyhow as to rotation, my guild has made a very successful run at HoT with the idea of having 2-4 tanks, with 2-4 offtanks (depending souly on how many warriors / knights / sk show up) and using defensive to its fullest.  We have 2 warriors that are flat better equipped, so they do all our big encounters, but all our lesser ones, the normal large encounter RT and ST's get to have fun as MT's while saving the clerics buttloads of mana by using defensive.  Rotation is important when crawling if you want to save mana and use warrior abilities to their fullest.  Otherwise, yeah I like going to raids and tanking instead of hitting tilde and watching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As said before, for the most part on new high end encounters we put the best we have on it.  For mini's we just have a tank order which, since we usually dont die on it, just rotates around as we get to each miniboss.  Other then that once a mob is being farmed we switch out to other tanks to spread around the experience of the mobs and also to prevent burnout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 4 warriors.  The top two hp / ac wise do most of the tanking (usually me for PoP mobs, other for prepop mobs).  Our third tank is only missing a couple levels and is also a great tank, so he does farming mobs when he's on, and could easily do most if not all of what we do.  For the most part, who is going to tank is decided by us warriors, and we do what we can to rotate.</div></div><hr />

I too have been in MT rotation on mobs such as Avatar of War you need a few hevey geared Tanks and Very good CH wheel for most high end encounters.<br />
I am in the same guild as Bellringer and our leader likes to spread the work around a bit til we get to the hard ones. <br />
I do feel aa is very important to being a good tank also..as is gear but all warriors can get aa..i would also like to add that DEfense and HP aa are the most important to have first rather then Offense!!<br />

Though me and 3 tend to argue over whose going first, cause well, were so damn close, its hard to choose, but hes got more AA, so i usually get with the clerics and make him tank.<br />
<br />
Anyway, should give all your tanks a go at everything, if they can handle the job, else your just toting around a few dual weilding pallys with no spells.  All play and no work makes smakz a dull boy.</div></div><hr />

We have 3 65's who do most of the work, and then me, I pick up the raids where they don't want to MT.  I'd like my chance at tanking the big boys, but no luck for me until I get 65 and a couple levels of LR, and have saved up for a BoC...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tank with the most HP is also the only tank with a BF. In addition to his BoC he is the Tank for the premium fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild leader tanks probably half the time and we have 4 other tanks that do it the other half. He has a bit of a lead on us in HP, but the other 4 of us are all about the same. We have a couple of other new warriors, but they're not as well geared yet and don't do as much tanking.</div></div><hr />

Klainis?  :D or is Henora the other Tank :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For trash mobs you should let everyone tank.  In short fights, taunt is probably the most reliable aggro tool a warrior gets and as long as any warrior's taunt worked, that's more or less good enough.<br />
<br />
For bosses and stuff is obviously make sense for start with the best guy first and work your way down.  However, since tank switch is never easy, it might not be a bad idea to let your best guy go second if you're expected to lose a tank anyway because the first tank has the easiest job, aggro-wise.</div></div><hr />

Klainis... heh, forgot about him, he's always on Fald now =p<br />
Other tank is fairly new to the guild.  Henny does make a damn nice tank though.... when I was 53 we duo'd arena in kael, she tanked better than me then =p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having only one person as full-time MT isn't good in the long run.<br />
<br />
This kind of thing seems to evolve into situations where you have full-time MTs, sole pullers, pull clerics, slowing shamen, same person always in charge of cheal rotations etc.<br />
<br />
Causes resentment between them and the peons they use to provide their fun, and runs the risk of the guild collapsing like a pack of cards if they all decide to leave together or push for major changes to their own advantage (which can happen).<br />
<br />
Dakkin's assessment: Sometimes unavoidable if no-one else is remotely close in kit, AA and/or raid attendance, but a Bad Thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Phantron thats what we do the tough guys tank the tough mobs and the other tanks have her training on the farming mobs.:D <br />
<br />
Its not so good to have warrior which are untrained to be a MT so the all have to do that job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has 5 warriors who do tanking duties.  MT usually goes to the first one to show up, unless we need heavy duty tankage, at which point it goes to the best eqipped guy available.<br />
<br />
As the lowest level warrior in the rotation, with the worst gear, and a love of tanking with a 2h weapon (drives our RL nuts), I don't get too many shots.  If get to MT enough though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GlowanMcLean</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a pretty healthy tank line, with 8 65 warriors and a few more who are still working up towards 65.  We look at experience, aaxp, and gear to choose MT when we fight a mob we expect to be especially tough (or new), but other than that we try to give everyone some chances to tank, to include our senior paladins and SKs.  If the mobs need defensive, then we look at disc status, of course, and keep it to warriors.  We also have a lot of fun with add tank duty and have recently started including some of our beastlords on adds just for fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 1 warrior pushing 9k hps (our GL) and he MTs pretty much everything.  Me and a few of the other warriors are sitting around 8.3-8.7K so we normally set a MT rotation about 3 deep with me in last place at 8420 raid buffed.<br />
<br />
On the bright side I actually get to play with aggressive at the end of most boss fights since we rarely lose 3 tanks on one mob.  Our biggest exception lately is Emperror Ssra.  When groups are made for that, the tank group is teasingly called the &quot;Death group&quot;.  We figure we're doing good if we average less than 2 or 3 deaths each on Emp.<br />
<br />
My usual role on most raids is offtank and/or rampage tank.  Not much glory but it can still be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has friggin 20 warriors on the roster. We usually only have 6-11 on major raids though... (I know what you are thinking... ZERG!) and we also have our own chat channel, in which we call out who has agro, which mez'd mobs have been pre-taunted, which mobs we are tanking, discs, etc.<br />
<br />
We usually have a MT list, and sometimes we have a main assist tank for all the mobs leading upto mini's, and we'll call out (in the guild MOTD) tank order for the god/mini. We have about 4 warriors in the 8500+ HP catagory, so we don't have just one main main tank. <br />
<br />
On some of the &quot;smaller&quot; raids like Vindi, Statue, Idol, AoW we'll have some of the &quot;lesser&quot; tanks like myself take turns on them, depending on lvl (by which I mean AA count... cause just about every warrior in the guild is 65) wether or not they have BoC/BF/EB procers, AC etc.... and for the most part the tanking order is decided by the raid leaders/officers and put onto the guild MOTD.  I know last time we did AoW I was the tank for the idol... and that was 1500+ HP ago... (That AoW was nice and gave me a BoC and a nice new Helm as well)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We go in order based upon an old agreed upon MT rotation which is loosly based on a combination of activity, hp, and AA.  Once the rotation is in place it's difficult to jockey around within it.  I'm normally third though when there's a Rampage mob I'll take that instead and have the 4th go to the 3rd slot due to my cleric bot always being there.</div></div><hr />

My guild has a warrior channel and we generally toss around MT duties quite a bit, with about 7 or 8 full time warriors there is always something to tank, especially in places like Sol Ro or elementals now.</div></div><hr />

We rotate our tanking duties fairly evenly. Being the guild's main tank though, I usually tank all the really big stuff, and newer stuff that we do. But everything else, we just switch duties to whoever feels like tanking that day. <br />
<br />
We also /random 0 100 for tanking duties, and lowest roll has to tank :p   We do this a lot for when we need to assign an MA for Vex Thal, cuz tanking there for 7 hours or so is very tiring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally speaking our guild uses a primary MT who also happens to be an officer of the guild. However, at any given time over the past year I would say that 7 of us have been the MT at any given time. Generally when we set things up on a raid, we decide on a MT order in a channel, then broadcast it to the raid. Depending on where we're going we'll assign add tanks or we won't, we'll assign rampage tanks, or we won't. In some cases we'll even go as far as assigning a 'oh crap!' tank if we have enough of them on a raid. As for gearing up, we try to kinda keep that pretty even. One of our warriors has a chart he made out of boredom one day I think, that shows what our 'buffed' HP would be with full buffs to that effect. He's also got on same chart, a comparison w/ a few warriors that are about even in terms of flagging, or elemental guilded. <br />
<br />
 That idea itself has caught on for our casters and priests as well, as it shows where you are in relation to others on the server, and helps the guild identify where you might have some weak spots in comparison to others. Very rarely do you see our MT crew ayeing against each other on items, because we're aware of what each other is interested in, and what would help improve us as a whole.</div></div><hr />
