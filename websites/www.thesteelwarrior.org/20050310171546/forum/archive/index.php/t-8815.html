<br />
I am here on behalf of www.AGOauctions.com to show you the newest addition to the EQ community. AGOauctions.com is an EverQuest online Bazaar for players to put up their valuable items and equipment to be sold for EQ ingame currency (PP). This site is not about selling equipment, characters or items for money and it never will. We deal only with legal PP. Please see AGOauctions as a simple alternative to the EverQuest Bazaar.<br />
<br />
AGOauctions.com was created to help players that use a Dial-Up connection to have their items and equipment available online for sale 24 hours a day while they are not connected. This is meant to be used with the Bazaar in EQ to increase sales for both buyers and sellers.<br />
<br />
Posting items and equipment is free and will always remain free. AGOauctions does not receive any sales commission nor does it require members to pay registration fees. Becoming a member is free and all services offered on the site are free. AGOauctions was created to give something back to the EQ <br />
community, not take something from it. There are some premium services offered at a very, very low price but they were implemented for people who wish to contribute to the site and it's growth, not as payment or to force people to pay for using the services.<br />
<br />
If you wish to visit, see what we are about and what we offer, feel free to visit www.agoauctions.com. We believe strongly in the EQ community and our site is pop up free and we do not track our visitor's behaviors nor do we install any spyware on your machine.<br />
<br />
If you would like to join or be a part of the AGOAuctions team and help promote, build, develop and monitor the website, we would be happy to use your help. Please e-mail us at info@agoauctions.com for more information.<br />
