<br />
His Harm touch does 401 but he can't reuse for 72 min I belive, After that is spent he Hits rapidly for a max of 19. Age is in the 50's if i remember right.<br />
<br />
Very close zone in to warrens if you take too much damage.</div></div><hr />

He doesn't cast or move or even seem to mind being stuck full of arrows.<br />
<br />
You can find him at the very north of the zone on a small chunk of land at the mouth of the river.  Conned blue at 55.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And went to bank to take an item i put in few times ago.<br />
Saw a cleric training his skill on one banker seems not responding. the cleric was afk then i think i was safe doing it ;)<br />
<br />
Will try it to raise my H2H for fun one day :)<br />
<br />
i think not enough room to train range weapons. by the way my archery is 233 soo not soo bad for a warrior.<br />
<br />
good luck trying that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beryll</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, i found the one in painell.<br />

<br />
