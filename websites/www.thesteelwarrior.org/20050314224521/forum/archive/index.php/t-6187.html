I've played the game since the beginning but I just love luclin and  cant seem too leave. <br />
<br />
Basically I am the only regular war that plays in my guild so I tank all the mobs we raid in luclin. But recently we had the addition of two wars, so for the last mob we raided we split the healers up into two groups and had one war use /shield while I held agro of the mob. It worked well but due to being 65 with most AA's I dont get any damage spikes from luclin mobs. <br />
<br />
I was just wondering would using this smothen out the damage spikes from PoP/GoD mobs and give less chance for the MT to drop, and also do any guilds already use this skill?<br />
<br />
Have a good one =)</div></div><hr />

If I see one spike in damage its a reflex to type out /shield soandso. Often times that buys myself enough time to regain aggro or it gives the current tank time to do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelusx</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohh I understand the use it brings for groups( I usually make hotkeys for all robe casters in group and healer for /shield). I just meant for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I regularly shield other warriors and knights when I'm not MT. You can even do it on named mobs, if you're careful. Basically, it cuts down on the damage hitting the MT by enough that it'll be easier for the healers to keep them up until the mob is fully debuffed. Casters generally die too fast to use /shield on them sucessfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as raids go it depends. Shielding a main tank in time without at least a druid watching you is certain death. Pre-elemental rampage should be less risky to shield on. Something you might consider also is shielding a rampage tank. Spending two AA in the PoP shielding AA effectively doubles its usefulness. Thats a good chunk of time where damage is being spread out. Slap on a shield in the offhand and further mitigate the damage penalty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Overall damage isn't normally an issue on raids. If you're running a tight crew, then I can see that. If you're farming, the extra damage normally isn't an issue. It is FAR worse to have a MT die and other people to drop too than it is for there to be additional damage generated.<br />
<br />
It's sole purpose should be to use help that careless nuker or healer that is about to get squashed. <br />
<br />
  Nukers and healers don't last long enough in EPs+ to get within shield range and for you to click the button. Also, nukers don't need to be saved. They get to die as punishment.<br />
<br />
As far as raids go it depends. Shielding a main tank in time without at least a druid watching you is certain death.  <br />
<br />
  Actually, what I do is shield the tank for about 4 seconds or so (until I'm in a danger zone), and then run out of effect range for /shield. That ends the damage you're taking. <br />
<br />
  Incidentally, shielding also causes the mob to be hit by TWO sets of damage shields! That'd probably actually be some significant added damage on some mobs, if the shielder had extended shielding. Seeing as it also doesn't prevent a warrior from attacking, it would be converting healer mana to added DPS.</div></div><hr />

Does that work for you or is it bugged for everyone?<br />
I've tried to make a hotkey as follows:<br />
line 1: /emote is about to SHIELD %T<br />
line 2: /shield %T<br />
<br />
This works for the first target I shield, but then the hotkey substitutes the target name instead of the %T in line 2.  Line 1 remains unchanged.  I've bugged this once about 2 months ago, but it still happens.  Anyone else care to comment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For your macro you don't need the %T. Since you have the person targetted, /shield will suffice.<br />
<br />
I have one hotkey with a dedicated shield target- typically the enchie or cleric in group. I don't notice the other warriors in guild shielding much, and I may not be helping tons, but I figure getting in the habit paid off at least a few times saving the lesser classes ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duh, I wasn't thinking straight I guess.  Thanks, I'll update my hotkey.<br />
BTW: my use for it is in hard ldons when although the pickup shm/enc/wiz said they have plenty of hard ldon experience, they sometimes forget and snare/nuke/tash/slow too early and get beat up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never use shield. Never have, never will. I just focus on keeping the mob on me, no complaints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">03-17-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for the most part shield in god is immediate death.  The only time i use it is when trying to grab aggro in the first place if say a retarded sk decided he was going to offtank and spam darks while deciding to be a mana leech.  I use a pretty simple key /assist on one line /shield on the next.  Keep mob targeted first, you eat up half the dmg hes taking + makes transition easier.  Also use it a bit on chanters or clerics, but the fact is the radius is retardedly small and its really not worth it if you have to go out of your way to get in range to shield someone.  Shielding an mt is stupid, if you wanna be usefull stay on the back of  the mob and hit it~ 2 minutes of melee is better than 2 seconds of glory shielding a tank.</div></div><hr />
