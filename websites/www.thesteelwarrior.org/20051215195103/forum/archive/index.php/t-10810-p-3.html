But then again I don't really know, and I am drunk atm, so take that with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-10-2005, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting thread.  One thing that did catch my eye tho:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm curious why you mentioned raids in this sentance.  You are claiming that STA is a great deal more useful in raids, but I'm curious to what degree.  I myself am debating STA vs avoidance in gear choices and am gearing myself up solely for raids.  I'm sure I will have some gear to swap in and out but my first choice gear I will intend to have the most effecient raid tanking gear.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'll be more detailed. It's not so much raid tanking as boss tanking, and I mean solely 40 man raids.<br />
<br />
Against Onyxia, if you have 8k hit points, it doesn't matter what crap gear you're using (almost) as 3 healers can switch off healing you ALL damn day. The hit points give them a larger margin of error in cast time in case some burst dps comes along. Essentially hit points always do that, but its only really a boon in a situation where your healers can't run out of mana (like Onyxia). <br />
<br />
In a 13 man general run (like the one i did last night) tanking gear makes all the difference. I could have had hit points all day, but in the end I would have just needed more heals. Needing heals as little as I do gives more room to heal others that are taking AE damage, etc.</div></div><hr />
