<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quetazl Coatl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know I haven't posted very often (maybe 3 times) and don't take me for being a whiner. But after reading and agreeing with all the class balance threads and becoming more disgusted with the narrow mindedness of the people in charge at Verant, I've decided to become less of a lurker....<br />

 Do yourself a favor and stop reading them. You'll be much happier. 90% of them are so full of shit it's ridiculous. And a 4% taunt mod on a knight means fuckall and it's retarded to whine about. <br />

 What we need is a warrior only pair of panties for all you little ladies to get in a bunch.</div></div><hr />
