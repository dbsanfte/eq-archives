<br />
The first Vah'Shir Warrior in Vex Thal.<br />
I finished my key, and entered Vex Thal on April 18, 2003.<br />
Please let me know if you are, or know for sure that there is another Vah'Shir Warrior in Vex Thal. I am just curious.<br />
<br />
Also... do you know of any Vah'Shir Warriors toteing around a BoC? I just wonder. I am not trying to brag, I just want to make sure before I get a little too overjoyed for being a server-wide first.<br />
<br />
Thank you all!<br />

Toting around a BoC ... <br />
<br />
Its all in the sig.<br />
<br />
And theres been a VT Keyed Vah Shir warrior on Xegony since before PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
But he's still quite a ways away from a VT key. Needs Emp key and a lot more shards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Utopian has two Vah'Shir warriors that are 65...<br />
Sebrix and Lutath. Rekker in RI is also 65, but none of them have VT keys, or BoC's... that I know for sure. <br />
<br />
And I don't have to worry about competition on the BoC part... I got mine in the 23rd of this month. :D (same with the Helmet of Rallos Zek... thank you FU!)<br />
<br />
I talk to them a lot in game, or at least as often as I can. I think I was 4th or 5th on making 65 amongst them. Lutath was first one to 65, that I am pretty sure of... barring some Mattari vah shir warrior hitting it first.... damn Team Asia! :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raaj beat me to it. Pawz got his BoC pre-PoP and I would imagine he finished his VT key as soon as he joined CTV back in December. I know he was one of the first kitties to 60 on TT if not the first, he was a leveling machine. He was probably one of the first to 65 as well. He's a hardcore power gamer to say the least.</div></div><hr />

but Smakz HA HA! I beat you! ;oP<br />
<br />
J/K you prolly have my arse kicked in the AA department, and equipment, and flags.... so I'll shut up now. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I think Lu was first to 65. He was quite proud of his levelling.<br />
<br />
Man ... now I'm getting all nostalgic.<br />
<br />
I remember first meeting him in Netherbian Lair. We were both level 20 something at the time. Heh.<br />
<br />
He dinged 60 before me. And dinged 65 before I even dinged 60.<br />
<br />
He's one crazy cat. Also one of my best friends in game.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerar_Povar</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I may not have the most AA's of the Vah'Shir overlords on Povar, but I know I am first on the VT keys/BoC. <br />
Now it's just all about getting the most HP's. :D<br />
So far I think Sebrix is at a little over 5k unbuffed (if his magelo is up to date) and I am at 4975... so I am closing in on him... one big differance... I don't have ND3, or PD3, or PE... which I think he has all of the above... 2 AA's and I'll have ND3 finally... so woot! 5215 hp I think. I suppose I could finish up that cloak of greater pernicity or whatever it is... that'd push me over 5k easy, BUT I don't want to give up the AC/resists of my Lodi... Stamina on the CoGP won't do me too much good... as my sta is 253 unbuffed now... and after 255 sta is super watered down. =\ Oh well.<br />
I should really try to score some new boots... the champions isn't really doing it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danathor</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would imagine Pawz gets more recognition because he did get to 65 first, and he actually earned his VT key.  Didn't just tag along with the #1 guild on the server for emp and loot a free power source in some lame alliance to keep us out of VT back before PoP like some people did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pawz-TT</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I recieved my BoC before PoP, and VT key last December because the guild I was in previously was not a VT guild, im not in any race I just play and have fun.</div></div><hr />
