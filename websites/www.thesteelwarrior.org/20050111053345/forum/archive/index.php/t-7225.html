<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angry_Tank01</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phase1.  You have to complete 5 trials within 1hour, your allowed 18 players per trial, we have the first18 take Fire then Water, second18 take Air then Earth, then the other 18 take Undead.<br />
Have people in raid as reserves able to help out if a trial is going bad.<br />
<br />
You'll probably complete Air / Earth / Fire first time no problem, Water + Undead are a little tricky.<br />
<br />
Phase2 is just killing trash and 5 named, (you can zone more people in now to help) this shouldn't take you the whole hour.<br />
<br />
Phase3 is a boring time sink, kill 8(?) waves of 14(?) mobs + 2named per wave.  Nothing hard about it really, yellow cons are mezzed, red cons offtanked.<br />
<br />
Phase4 = TT, Saryn, TZ &amp; VZ.  TT and Saryn are elemental level hitters, with annoying AEs and adds which spawn at certain %hp.  TZ is similar to TZ from the RZ script, except he hits alot harder.   VZ is your first big problem in Time.<br />
<br />
If you're anything like my server you'll only get 1 day per week rotation, make the most of it, and GL.</div></div><hr />

Until you do the trials a few times, people will mess up.<br />
<br />
As Angry said, P1-P3 are pretty easy once you do em, P4 depends alot on your tanks gear and a fair few clerics. <br />
<br />
Only point I'd disagree on is Tallon, he'll be your first bump, we used a faster chain first time than anything in the E planes and got whooped a few times, would say him and his bro are the first 2 &quot;above elemental&quot; encounters. Vallon is the harder of the 2 imo though.<br />
<br />
Apart from that Goodluck! And don't waste DKP, if you use it, on P1 crap. Wait 2 weeks and get it all cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are the P1 areas filled with a lot of TMez or regular mez or an even split<br />
<br />
Can the P1 mobs 1 round a 10k warrior?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should definately go try it before posting here asking for that much help.<br />
<br />
An overview of the zone is one thing - not even knowing what p1 mobs hit for is being lazy. Your warriors got you to time, so they're obviously ready for it...don't worry so much.</div></div><hr />

vallon was harder to kill the 1st time, but imo tz is harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better than what we had )  Infact we only have 4 warriors.<br />
<br />
&gt;Are the P1 areas filled with a lot of TMez or regular mez or an even split<br />
<br />
Each trial is different, mezzables can be spotted by name / height / guess!<br />
<br />
&gt;Can the P1 mobs 1 round a 10k warrior?<br />
<br />
Unless P1 gets bugged and you get Quarm as a boss, no. )  Named hit for about 1100max, some slowable, some not.<br />
<br />
&gt;Would we expect 1 group to finish up their trial ahead of others and be able to help the other 2 groups or is that not possible?<br />
<br />
Fire will finish then move to water, Air will finish then move to Earth, Undead will probably finish just after Fire &amp; Air, so our undead team is meant to stand in reserve waiting on any problems, but usually they just afk =/</div></div><hr />

fire doing water and undead doing air is what we normally do. earth can be done by your worst 18.<br />
<br />
air and undead are the easiest to wipe too, should be a solid group of 18 to do both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoyed our figuring out as we went along. Sure, some mobs take longer, but it's a lot more rewarding when you best it.<br />
<br />
It's more intense to me.  I'm still a young tank compared to the others in my guild, but I am getting more opportunities in Time. <br />
<br />
It can be really frustrating when someone starts an instance before the guild is ready. Things like that are going to happen though.  I think this zone fosters total teamwork as much as the elemental gods do, if not a little more because everyone has to play their spot on the team. <br />
<br />
Congratulations and Good Luck!!!</div></div><hr />

We were reduced to making people sit in the tunnels and not by zone in's for the trials :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
air and undead are the easiest to wipe too, should be a solid group of 18 to do both.I agree. Earth is by far the easiest trial. Unless you are fielding a crap load of people, take the best 18 for undead/air, next 18 for fire/water, and 2+ groups for earth.<br />
<br />
Also, depending on how your rotation works on your server, you might be able to hit Time T1 late nights for practice. Even if you don't get loot dropping instances, it's not a bad idea to have everyone learn the trials. The faster you can get these perfected the better since you always have to clear T1.</div></div><hr />

Shrug, we've not beaten Quarm yet, but we've killed VZ 6 or 7 times and all but I think once were single-tanked, np at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vallon is a joke to single tank.  Set up a 0 pause rot assuming you have 10 clerics and go to town starting with furious and spamming a /stand hotkey.  Ive died to him 1 time in our entire time farming.  He really is a pussy, and you should be able to drop him under 30% till your disc is up.  The only problem is cc for adds, and for that just throw a few chanters shaman rangers and wiz to strong root then snare.  Another thing you can do which most guilds were not able to is true shot vallon.  Im 99% sure all pinned mobs in time are now trueshottable with the dx 9 patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya its easy once you have good gear setups and are used to the actual fight.  Same with every mob in Time once you get to know the fight, simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this what everyone does? We always do Air/Fire/Water, then whoever finishes first goes to Undead, whoever finishes second does Earth.<br />
I don't think Fire has ever beaten Water or Air, so Fire are the afk team, with one group cajoled into sitting outside Undead just in case.</div></div><hr />

We always do Fire+Water, Air+Earth, and Undead.  May not be the best setup I guess but everyone is used to it nowadays.</div></div><hr />
