<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey the skills and all arent correct but that doesn't matter, i've got 400k, and was hoping to buy a BoC, but then i've been reading around and people said that unless your gear is as good as it can get bazaar wise, i shouldn't buy it, but a BoC sounds really good for the aggro and the other slots that arent upgraded are easy to upgrade anyway.. Hoping to try and get BoC and offhand a OSoW.<br />

Your weapons are good enough, you'd be better served buying some new (and higher ac) booties, helm and shoulders. If you get more aggro, that's super but your focus should be on raising hp and ac. <br />
<br />
  Skills that do matter: Defense and offense should be 252 (capped).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No worn haste at 65?  Er, that's a tad unsettling.  There's a large number of haste items you can afford or camp with a partner.  Seeing as you have a very nice belt, I'd look for haste in the back or head slots.  CCoW or CoF or Cowl of Mortality should fit the bill nicely, these can be had for far less than 400k and should be your number 1 priority to purchase/camp.  <br />
<br />
Your aggro weapons look respectable for now.  If you are looking for armor, I'd save your plat and dive head first into some North Ro or Everfrost LDoNs.</div></div><hr />
