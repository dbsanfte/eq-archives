<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">GM Hemlock is being fired from his job as a GM for SoE. I always found him very helpful and a nice guy. He tried to help the players and knew it was all about keeping the players happy, they pay for the game and are what keeps it alive. <br />
<br />
If everyone complains to SoE about this or atleast send their backup for the guy, they might know what we want and he might get another chance. You never know. <br />
<br />
Link the SoE GM boss? Is: acrosby@soe.sony.com <br />
<br />
Mail them and tell them our concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The two best guides on Mith Marr, Kevarn and Lili, were nerfed too :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, but why is he being fired? You cant just blindly send your support for somebody when you dont know the circumstances. Sure, maybe he was a great guy dealing with the customers, but how do we know there wasnt some other issue behind the scenes - like maybe he punched out his boss or something (just an example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oh shit, you aren't supposed to do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in EQ land; nope. usually fair play and good judgement = dismissal.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What Shikari said )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">but like sturgis said; we only know half the story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree...I like to look at all sides of the story before I make a decision (and I do...most of the time).  I take responsibility for my actions...so I would rather make a bad decision based off all the information so I have no scapegoat, rather than a bad decision and just write it off to not knowing enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I've heard from a friend who was (stress the was)a Senior guide the Customer service department was riddled with petty feuds and one upmanship. Wouldn't surprise me at all if someone who cut through the BS to provide a human face to CS should get cut off at the knee's. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I worked in that role (Senior Guide) for another game for a while. And yes, that whole culture is full of petty bickering and what Valeris said.<br />
<br />
Where I was we had one group that was like the Guides here, and the rest supported in game quests, events and such. I heard horror stories about our quest groups. The group I was in was pretty solid, but you could still see issues.<br />
<br />
The GM's were for the most part, fairly young, and not that well paid. <br />
<br />
I have never needed a GM here myself, but have seen them and guides come for my friends and they seem to do a pretty good job. It's pretty hard to do with the limited tools they are given. Players always assume we had more &quot;powers&quot; than we did.<br />
<br />
The job of helping players was a lot of fun, but the politics sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My comment most concerned the Sony employed GM's not the guides (who far to often find themselves in the middle taking a hammering over stuff they can't change). <br />
<br />
Much respect to the guides.</div></div><hr />
