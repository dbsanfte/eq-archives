<br />
This being my first post for my first character for my first mmorpg, I apologize if i write anything stupid.<br />
<br />
Im currently playing a lvl 32 human warrior on cenarius (PvE).  Im using a 1h+shield w/ protection spec setup and enjoy it, but I have seen more then a few warriors with a 2h setup and was considering one. Any advice would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thx</div></div><hr />

Particularly 2 handed weapons. Nor does being prot specced lock you into defensive stance. Feel free to swap around weapons and stances. As you get higher, remember that you aren't married to a talent build either. 1, 5, 10 gold is not much as you get higher, and even the max price of 50 gold for a retrain is not a lot for an end game warrior.<br />
<br />
We have also learned over the years that there really aren't any stupid questions. Just so you know, I don't think the WoW devs know about us, but many of us are verterans of EQ and those devs do know about these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SebastianDesoto</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice to hear, I'm a noob too. <br />
<br />
I've noticed that I'm doing more stances switching the more I play, even though I'm proc spec. It seems the talent builds are only enhancements of your skills. After I realized this, I decided it wasn't a waste of money to buy as many skills as I can and experiment with them. In groups, I'm the tank and have been asked many times to agro control so I'm glad I went proc spec. However, soloing, I tend to be in battle stance. I just learned Berserker stance. As soon as I get some cash to learn berserker only abilities I’ll be experimenting with that.<br />
<br />
I'm a noob, but I do have some advice anyway. This is a CHARACTER. If you think its looks cool to dual wield, then by all means, if it is still effective, dual wield. If you think it looks cool to run around with no shirt, then do it. I was in IF the other day and saw a level 60 female warrior that had no bottom on and real sexy looking top armor. Everything matched and she was dual wielding daggers. It looked awesome.<br />
<br />
I started to read this forum to learn more about playing the warrior. A lot is over my head, but I have pulled some stuff here and there. I can’t read the &quot;Dev's have spoken&quot; thread anymore. It just got way to big, with flaming and too and too much stuff that’s beyond my level of enjoyment and understanding. By the way, where do you people get the time to record and study your combat logs?</div></div><hr />

Man you are so clearly wrong.  Just wait until Kermit gets here and tells you how wrong you are.  If you put any points at all into Protection, the shield can never leave your arm, and you're locked into defensive for the rest of your days.<br />

What is the point in having three stances then? You might as well never switch if that is the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never stated that protection spec wasn't useful or not worth using. I've only ever said that if you want to solo beyond mediocrity then protection spec isn't gonna cut it. Sure you can solo with a protection spec, but you can't do it fast and with almost no down time. Can you run instances MS/Arms spec... sure, but will you take more dmg probably, and unless you invest the time in getting top of the line for your lvl gear you will have some trouble with bad pulls in an instance.<br />
<br />
btw KermeyKhazi &lt;--- wasn't my choice for my EQ frogloks name..... friggin brother was trying to impress some net chick thought she would think it was cute... blah.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Haass will come back with some smart ass reply... Like &quot;What the Fuck get a clue man you fucking retard. Get your head out your ass and start fucking reading what the fuck im typing. Fuck I'm such an angry angry little man......&quot;</div></div><hr />

With bandages/food I dont have much downtime at all. I will often run into battle with 30% health left because i know that I can last. Although Im sure that I kill somewhat slower then more dps geared warriors, Im not too upset because I like instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only ever said that if you want to solo beyond mediocrity then protection spec isn't gonna cut it.  <br />
<br />
And I've only said about 1000 times that I have a regular group that I group with, always.  Grouping is vastly more important to me than the soloing I do for an hour after work and you still cling to your MS &gt; ALL bullshit.   You're like the kid in kindergarten who thinks he's cool cuz he's got a red crayon and his friend only got a blue one.  They're the same fuckin piece of wax, but you're convinced yours draws better.<br />
<br />
Just go back to eating paste, least that way you're quiet.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I didn't post logs of a fight with me against an even con to prove I've got a bigger E-Penis than anyone, I did it to show that warriors CAN in fact solo, no matter what their fucking build is, and can do so effectively.  You start making comparisons about 17 seconds of damage in one fight, and everyone who played EQ is laughing their ass off at you.  You're like the guy who comes into the Proc rate discussion and says &quot;Man, u guys are all wrong, cuz I've procced 3 times back to back before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bottom line, I don't care what your preferred build is.  Do what you wanna do.  Just don't go telling people that your build is gonna be the only way they're gonna be able to do anything, because it's total bullshit.  Arms, Fury, Protection...all of us are here, and all of us are still playing the game, so there can't be THAT much goddamned difference.  <br />
<br />
You stop with the gung-ho, &quot;Arms and DW 4 lyfe&quot; crap, and I'll stop riding your ass.  Capice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My god Haass your reading comprehension must have cut off at a fucking kindergarden level... that or your eating paste comment is from experience and it's damaged you more then you think......<br />
<br />
I never said my method is the only way.... How you get &quot;dual wield 4 lyfe&quot; out of any of that I don't know. It's a fact you dumb fuck that Protection tank unless he runs around with a fuck ton of rare/epic weapons solos a fuck ton slower then a MS/Arms spec and a MS/Arms spec takes more dmg in instances unless you have a fuck ton of Rare/Epic gear to make up for the lack of a 2000 ac shield. So take your Super 1337 3 man &quot;we can do it&quot; group and go run your instances and shut the fuck up when people who solo and know how to fucking do it better give advice on how to solo better. I don't fucking talk shit when you give advice on how to run an instance with 3 people and do it well, so shut the fuck up when I give advice on how to solo well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you say this with a straight face when you're blatantly asking where you have to go to solo in the forum below this one?<br />
<br />
Sorry to break it to you, but you're a sheep dude.  You haven't had an original thought yet, as evidenced by the fact that you feel the need for the community to justify every one of your gear, hunting, and guild decisions.<br />
<br />
Should I use this weapon or that weapon?<br />
Where do I find easy mobs to kill that don't require me to think?<br />
What do I do when my guild leader says that I'm a fucking lameass?<br />
<br />
These are not the signs of a man anyone should be taking advice from.  Would you listen to you?  Now, go ask your mommy what pajamas you should wear tonite and get ready for bed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go with whatever works best for the situation.  You should ideally have 1h + shield, a 2h and an extra weapon for Dual Wielding.  Protection dosen't lock you into anything, although later on it makes DW more effecient than 2h if you're fighting lower mobs.  (That is of course, assuming you get up the tree far enough for 1h spec.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was asking if anyone had any places they like to solo at... what because I haven't been to every fucking location I can't solo well? Shut the fuck up you ha-ASS. I notice when I ask questions about gear selection most look but can't say anything to change my mind since I'm pretty right on with what I think. I just like to get a different perspective before spending 200g to change my set up.... but you wouldn't understand that concept since you use a group to carry your ass when you need something. If I as random noob01 saw your posts and combatlog I wouldn't take you advice either, but if I saw my posts and combatlog I'd at least look twice and consider that I may know what the fuck i'm talking about.  Considering you're protection specced for a group and take more dmg then a non protection specced warrior two lvls lower noob01 would take one look and conclude like most that you don't know what the fuck your doing when you open your mouth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the input everyone. Im planning on investing in a one hand weapon for DW but sticking with my prot spec. I think this will help a lot because I can switch to DW and back without switching stances and thus losing rage without tactical mastery. There are a lot of times when Im not taking much damage but I need to raise my dps/rage (after disarm, when I lose agro in an instance, when fighting a caster and shield bash is on cooldown, ect..). Also my 1h spec in the protection tree should make DW slightly favorable to 2h.</div></div><hr />

Ive been sword/board, two hander, even duel wield at times all thru my career.  It sorta helps with the cosmos ui in that you can parse your dps during your fights.  I personally find that two handers are better for me due to my axe spec, MS, and other factors.  I kill mobs faster using a two hander than when I used sword/board, but thats due to my build.  I say try it out and see which one you like better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm protection spec at level 47.  When I solo I either use 2h (well, Blight, a pole arm) or sword and board (I have a purple 32 DPS 1hander).<br />
<br />
First off, ignore the MS people who tell you &quot;protection is teh sux&quot;.  For the most part they have either never tried protection spec or they come from the perspective that grouping should be optional and solo play the norm.<br />
<br />
Second, you can solo just fine as protection spec.  As Haas pointed out, being a group oriented tank with a protection spec doesn't mean you are restricted to only using a 1h weapon and a shield.  If you are fighting mobs -1 or -2 levels below you that don't deal much damage (the ideal XP grind mobs), go 2hand or dual wield and chew through them.<br />
<br />
When I fight mobs that are my level or higher, though, I switch to sword and shield and defensive stance.  My DPS does drop and the fights last longer.  But I also take far far less damage, so that I can kill 2 or 3 level 47-48 mobs before I have to rest (as opposed to trying to do it with 2h, where I need to at least bandage after each one).  I have improved revenge, and for solo'ing hard mobs it + shield block makes defensive stance very nice.<br />
<br />
I also use defensive + shield when I get an unexpected add.  You'd be amazed at how much more survivable these situations become (last night I was able to take down 3 level 46-47 hyena at once in Tanaris with sword and shield and defensive, without need a potion).  <br />
<br />
If you stop by the official WoW whine-play warrior boards, you will not most of the complaints coming from arms and fury spec'd folks (and quite often them attacking the protection spec people who say they are doing ok).  <br />
<br />
In my opinion, spec'ing your charecter for solo play in this game is retarded.  You get level 60, then what?  The best gear comes from instances (usually raid instances), and your spec (and your skills as a player) will suck for these situations because you spent the last 60 levels playing with yourself.  PvP?  What PvP?  Blizzard has said from the beggining that they intend this game to have a team-PvP system that requires groups of folks working together (and in battlegrounds, raids of people working together).  I'm sorry, but how you do in a duel against a hunter is about as relevant in that situation as what color M&amp;M's taste the best.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if it fits your play style, stick with protection spec and enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said Gwe!<br />
<br />
What will you do when you hit 60 sums  it up!  Oooohh let's go raid some newbie towns because i'm a big bad ass arms/fury pvp warrior, tis sad if this is the only shit to get excited about everyday if you plan on SOLOING FOREVER AND EVER kermit.<br />
<br />
I'll say this again prot tank solo is surprisingly good, specially if you have TM, you can land the odd overpower here and there etc..  and ya switching to 2h or DW against lower lvl trash makes us kill faster but tends to be roughly same downtime i find due to taking more dmg.  It just rises from the fact we don't have the extra punch like MS or even improved Overpower etc... so i usually remain in defensive and switch from time to time to diff stance...<br />
<br />
I take offense to that comment kermit directed at haaas on how he's mooching a group to get his gear while he earns his stuff the hardway by soloing trash on the barrens hoping for a purple shit.  Have you ever tanked in the last 4 instances?? Sure gear helps a lot etc.. but there's a lot more then gear for prot tanks.  I am sick and fuking tired of these arms/fury solo geeks who think they are such badass in terms of skills.  I challenge anyone to name 1 fuking class that is more critical then a warrior in a end game instance.  Name me 1 fuking class that can dictate how your instance will be doing.  You may have the best healers, best dps crew, best CC people but if you have 1 shitty tank then you are ALL going to be FUBAR end of discussion.  So how does he 'mooch'??  I find it's the group who is mooching off a good tank as they would be sitting on their ass doing nothing otherwise or better yet go do some 'pvp' yay...<br />
<br />
I seriously think warrior takes the most amount of skill to play properly in an instanced, between holding aggro and stance switch during the fight etc the pace is insane and i love it.   So keep flexing your &quot;i solo 10 sec better then you&quot; muscles and let the real tanks get the job done in instances thx...</div></div><hr />

It's not that Prot is the suck, its that you can put 11 points into it and have 90%  of the tanking ability a fully prot specc'd warrior has without gimping your offense.  Does prot hold hate better?  Yes.  But if you're already holding hate fine, the upper parts of the tree are painful in the amount of your abilites that are resisted.</div></div><hr />

Dont think that is true at all. Please explain what you would spend 11 points on that would make you 90% as good as a full prot spec tank.</div></div><hr />

Sure 2-3 is good enough to get by but its not GOOD. I can tank every instance up to Zul Farrak with zero issues Holding Archaedeas + 2 Golems and a few small adds was laughable without even worrying about a shield. I've seen no evidence that before I raid in the 60+ content I'll need to go protection. So your comments concerning MS/Arms not being able to run instances is BS. Boss mobs hit like pansies it's the multiple trash mobs at once that is the hardest thing about instances. And dropping 2-3 lvl 42-46 elites at the same time that it takes pally01 with protection warrior01 to do it is more group friendly. Got bored the other day and ran a good 1/4 of Uldaman solo for shits and giggles... could I have done it full protection proabably but it would have taken all night and some of tommorrow.<br />
At lvl 48 without protection talents I'm approaching 4k AC I dish out 200+ dps on even cons with around 46% mitigation and fights last 10-25 seconds, and I tank in instances fucking great. Why should I increase my mitigation 15-20% but drop my dps by 120+ and extend regular trash fights longer then necessary. You think a cleric minds dropping one more heal or less a fight but finishing an instance run in much faster time. When I raid and I'm expected to tank lvl 59+ elites I'll gladly go Protection, but so far tanking lvl 50+ elites hasnt proved any more difficult and my AE aggro is much better. My build is NOT for everyone but your not gonna find any flaw other then at lvl 60 in Raids it's not gonna be feasible.... I've always said that.</div></div><hr />

5 in toughness<br />

You now have about 90% of the damage reduction abilities a full prot spec tank does.<br />

The funny thing is I have found the proc spec to be surprisingly offensive. Improved Revenge 3/3 gives a 40% chance to stun. Since the chance to get Revenge happens about 4 times in a battle and only cost 5 rage points, I &quot;almost&quot; always stun a target once every battle and commonly stun them twice. I don't even miss having Overpower with that rate. Then I discovered how great Improved Saunder Armor 3/3 is. And Improved Disarm is my new favorite skill. Although Disarm is more defensive, the other two are very offensive actions.<br />
<br />
I have lately been grinding the ogres (the non-elites) in the Alterac Mountain Region. Most of them are either my level or +1 or +2. I hardly go below a 2/3 of my health and am not afraid of an add. I will admit I am not confident of taking on two from the get-go though. I don't mind getting an add if I get the first one down to half HP or less. <br />
<br />
I also use my gun regularly. Get one pop off at max distance, when they start charging, I back up until its ready again and then pull off another pop. No need to charge and switch stances to defensive. I already got two decent pops off and it’s a great way to pull a mob were you want them.<br />
<br />
I do think Cruelty is a must though. I really want my DPS to improve, so I seen no reason not to have this talent maxed. I will likely max Deflection too.<br />
<br />
I'm sure things change in the upper levels. Please, if this enough information, rate my style of play. I came here for advice (not flaming) so lets have it. <br />
<br />
PS. Lets dedicate a thread for just Haass and KermeyKhazi to go back and forth. That was fun and helpful.</div></div><hr />

The stun is only 1 second tho.  The amount of damage mitigated by that stun seems to be next to none.<br />

Yeah, I guess if you think about 70 damage or so is better than starting off a fight with Rage, then I guess that works.  I'd much rather have rage.</div></div><hr />

The stuns are pretty effective at the lower levels, but I found more and more as I went on that bosses were totally immune, or god forbid you grouped with a stun rogue, you couldn't use them because of the dimishing effects.  Starting from about SM, the bosses are immune to shield bashes silence as well. :/  Bastages. <br />
<br />
The primary benefits over the other ones are improved hate keeping, particularly from an offensively used shield discipline. (The damage is decent after you rank out shield bash too)</div></div><hr />

Only one comment on your play stlye. When those ogres become even to -1 or -2 (Your aggro range should be significantly reduced by then) why give up 15+ rage from charge in exchange for minimal gun dmg. Most of the Alterac Ogres are spaced out well enough to solo with a charge and to hold them in place. At least charge and switch to defensive you get the stun time to set up and get a swing or two in plus the 15 rage to use for sunders. At your lvl 3 sunders makes them drop like cake and the initial charge rage will get those 3 out very early. <br />
<br />
I can see where improved revenge would be nice as I am sitting right around 12-15% dodge and Parry ie. its always up for me, I just have a hard time justifying giving up 1000-2000 dmg in a normal fight just from Mortal Strike. That and MS is a huge equilizer in PvP with any healer/caster type.</div></div><hr />

First off, dont underestimate imp shield block 3/3 + imp revenge 3/3 combo. And yes I did spend 3/3 on imp shield block based on the fact that it boosts my block ability to 88% giving a 22.5% chance that it wont block two straight attacks. If 1.5 more seconds gives a 3rd chance to block then I have a 2.7% chance of not using both blocks. With the imp revenge 3/3 I have a 40% chance to stun for 3 sec that I use every 5-6 seconds. As you said last stand is a life saver. Concussion blow adds another 5 sec of stun.  Perhaps your 11 points in prot spec does a lot but certainly not 90% of the damage reduction available in the prot tree.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that works on later is trash mobs, and thats assuming nobody else is there to stun.  Then you &quot;might&quot; get 3 off before dimishing returns kicks in. Thats only on one mob too, it dosen't lower damage on all of them.</div></div><hr />

The gun damage is more than 70, though. It is is over 100 if I get two shots off, and sometimes one off those shots is 100 in it self or higher. That may not be anything at the level you guys play at though. However, Haass, you have conviced me to invest some points in Charge and use it more. the Ogres are spaced out well. The gun-pull technique would probably work better in slightly more congested areas were i'm afraid of adds.<br />
<br />
One more question. Is Tactical Mastery really worth it? It just seems like a waste first glance. wouldn't it be better to just expend your rage in the stance your in and then switch? Thats what I've been doing. Sometimes I do charge, then expend all that rage, then  switch.</div></div><hr />

The hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
How much do you block?  What percentage of that is a 200 damage attack (which is an elite at 50)?<br />
<br />
Block is not like parry, it does not equate to a straight damage reduction by reducing melee hits.  Shield block is ass, even for the protection tree.  And each day I'm growing increasingly less impressed with the diminishing returns on stuns.  It's sure fucking fun to have Concussion blow land for 2 seconds.<br />

Imp shield block is pretty useful, I'm normally blocking 60ish now.  The main thing I use it for however, is bosses and holding out if the healers get low on mana from a bad fight.  All in all I'd say it usually amounts to 1/3 to 1/5th damage reduction if you can keep it up, on top of the shield passive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over 7K AC you start to see dimishing returns on your AC, making toughness not as cool as it is in lower levels/lesser gear.  I'm unsure if the top end gear puts you at or near 7k with toughness maxed.  If it does, there is little point to spending talents in it.<br />
<br />
Shield blocks only good for lighting up revenge when you want it and works great w/o the extra block talent.  The mitigation you get from a shield gets to be pretty worthless against mobs hitting 1500+ dmg.  Not completely worthless, just not as good.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the best bang for you buck talent wise from a tank point of view isnt even in the prot tree, its over in arms (Deflection).<br />
<br />
Tatical Mastery is definatly worth putting a few points in.  At the very least try it out to see what its like.  I think you'll quickly see why most warriors consider it a required talent.  I was doing fine with TM2, even better with TM3.  I had TM5/Anger Mgmt once and that was a LOT of fun, but I really was doing just fine at TM2.  All TM3 gives you is abilities costing 15 rage coming out of a stance switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ability to switch stances while retaining rage is amazingly useful.  For starters, it allows you to start the battle with 15-21 rage from charge, and immediately switch over to defensive and use it for hatekeeping purposes.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it allows you to switch stances and use moves on the fly, such as switching over for overpower, whirlwind, or hamstring to stop the mob the lazy bastards didn't snare.  It also allows you to swap back from a more offensive stance to a defensive and taunt + whatever to immediately regain aggro.  This is amazingly helpful once you get used to it, defensive is good, but it's not the place to be all the time.<br />
<br />
Lastly, it allows access to anger management, which in addition to the reduced rage loss, produces about 1 rage every 3 seconds in combat, no matter what you're doing.</div></div><hr />

I've seen no evidence that before I raid in the 60+ content I'll need to go protection. So your comments concerning MS/Arms not being able to run instances is BS. Boss mobs hit like pansies it's the multiple trash mobs at once that is the hardest thing about instances. And dropping 2-3 lvl 42-46 elites at the same time that it takes pally01 with protection warrior01 to do it is more group friendly<br />
<br />
There's a difference between tanking well and being able to passably tank, this point is moot however as it's all relative as to how many healers/what type of dps and CC u have etc...  If your telling me your owning low level trash instances with 1 healer then good for you, i assure you your not tanking better then a prot one.   Most Offensive warriors that DID MT in lower instances i saw always had 2 healers, a prot tank usually only needs 1 and doesn't even need to be a priest, shammy do fine.  Point is if you only have 1 healer then you can add a REAL dps class to the group and i assure you he'll do more then your differential dps towards a prot spec tank.<br />
<br />
Boss mob hit likes pansies?  Lvl up a bit more before you make comments like that or at least specify 'from my experiences in the 40's' before generalizing like that.  You do realize later on the amount of hp on the mobs become more retarded and all your little examples on how your pwning mid 40 elites becomes obsolete.<br />
<br />
The perfect plan of going all out arms/fury hit 60 then switching to prot is NOT as easy as you may think.  Micro becomes a PITA later on and you'll find that out sooner then later.<br />
<br />
WTF is with all this 'raiding' shit, as long as there's quest for it, then you should be concerned of doing it 5 man first before anything, lately all i see is bunch of gimpass people exploiting that fuking bug to raid the last instances and finishing their quests  I guess the challenge is a bit too much for those people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwaern</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Want to respond to a few points.<br />
<br />
First, you guys do not understand how diminishing returns works.  There is a 15 second timer on diminshing returns.  Quoting from the WoW website:<br />
<br />
Control types of spells such as Charm, Fear, and Stun are subject to diminishing returns. This means that if a second spell of the same type is used against the same player within 15 seconds of the first effect wearing off, the second spell's duration will be reduced by 50%, the third's duration will be reduced by 75%, and the player will be immune to the fourth casting. <br />
<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/pvpcombat.html<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that if my first stun of the fight is revenge (which is a 3 second stun, not a one second), and I revenge again 9 seconds later, my second revenge is only 1.5 seconds long.  However, if my 2nd revenge takes place 16 seconds later, it lasts for the full duration.  Granted, in a group or raid environment where everyone is stunning like crazy, this does seriously lower the value of the ability.  However, in solo circumstances, or in circumstances where others in the group are not stunning, diminishing returns hardly &quot;gimps&quot; our stun abilities.<br />
<br />
Also note that another great value of revenge is its agro generation and small damage for only 5 rage.  These attributes work regardless of whether a mob is stun immune or not.<br />
<br />
I also have to disagree with Haas on the mitigation value of revenge.  Try solo'ing an even con or better mob without using shield block skill + improved revenge, then with.  For me, at level 47, it results in a substantial increase in how many hit points I end a fight with (on the order of 10-20%).<br />
<br />
Second, the folks who think toughness and shield specialization are the best tanking skills in the protection tree are, frankly, clueless.  The biggest are improved revenge (3 second + some damage), concusive blow (6 second stun), last stand (an extra 30% of your hit points), and shield discipline.  Your argument is akin to saying that putting 10 points in improved rend and deep wounds gives you 90% of the benefit of arms spec.<br />
<br />
Again, some end game mobs are stun immune, and that does eleminate the mitigation value of revenge and concussive blow against them.  However, the agro generation works just fine.<br />
<br />
As far as boss mobs hitting like pansies, that isn't even true in Marudon, let alone end game instances.  And on the multiple yard trash, a protection spec warrior does great.  We can actually hold agro on 4 mobs at once (a point of frustration for me in Zul Farrak the other night after taking a back seat to an arms spec warrior 3 levels higher than me only to see him barely able to control agro on 2 mobs simultaneously, let alone 3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bit you are quoting has to do with PvP rules, not PvE.  Interestingly enough, I've found it to work the same in PvE with stuns.  While soloing, stuns are very very helpful.  They are also helpful when in CC mode in instances (its great to stop a healer for 5 seconds while you lock his buddies down).<br />
The biggest are improved revenge (3 second + some damage), concusive blow (6 second stun), last stand (an extra 30% of your hit points), and shield discipline.<br />
I used to feel the same way about imp revenge.  After a lot of respecing, I find the first point in it is worthwhile (to make it stun) but the 2nd and 3rd are only good for opening up Concussion Blow.  I havent seen evidence either way on the talent adding to the amout of hate revenge gives you.  I remeber tanking in instances w/o the revenge talent, using just revenge (no sunder), and holding aggro great!  I'm pretty sure revenge aggro remains wicked w/o the talent points.<br />
<br />
I like CB too, its very handy up until a stun immune mob shows up.  At that point its not completely worthless as it does weap dmg + X.  To me thats puts some oomph back into the talent that the dimishing returns of stun takes away.  Even though the diminishing returns cycle over 15 seconds, most fights are over in 30sec.  So the diminishing return still hurts pretty bad (esp if you open with charge).  CB against stun immune mobs ends up being a dps/aggro move.  There are much better talents to up your dps.<br />
<br />
Last stand really only helps if you are with a healing class.  Its a wicked talent, dont get me wrong, but not too terribly helpful soloing unless you can get the mob dead and yourself eating food or bandaging before it wears off.<br />
(a point of frustration for me in Zul Farrak the other night after taking a back seat to an arms spec warrior 3 levels higher than me only to see him barely able to control agro on 2 mobs simultaneously, let alone 3).<br />
that sounds more like an issue with the player behind the toon, not the build.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree totally on the stuns losing lots of value during a group environment.  Bear in mind that charge counts against this as well, so should you you happen to stun right after, it'll be under the diminishing returns.  Throw in a stun from a group member, and what you've got is useless for a while.<br />
<br />
The aggro generation of revenge is huge, and while I may not advocate taking the talent, the skill is bread and butter as far as keeping hate.  From what I've seen lately getting the last rank of it, it even far outaggro'd sunders.  While the skills do generate aggro, so do other skills like HS or MS without being resisted.<br />
<br />
The best skills for damage mitigation in the entire tree are toughness, shield spec and imp shield block.  I don't count stuns because the stuff you &quot;really&quot; want heavy damage migitation for are bosses (IE, Immune to stun.)  Anticipation, should you chose to sink points into it nexts a neat .8% avoidance, and .4% block to it (I have +44 def right now just from average gear, it's not too hard to net defense.)  The other other skill that can consistantly reduce damage is shield spec, and to be honest, the reduction from it isn't worth 31 points.   What IS worth it however, is the improved aggro from shield spec if you're in a situation that needs it.<br />
<br />
By the way, 11 points in arms tree will give you huge flexability from TM, Anger management and deflection.  It goes both ways as far is picking up useful abilites early.<br />
<br />
The main advantage I give protection warriors have a far better mentality of what a proper &quot;tank&quot; is supposed to do, IE, keep hate and be the guy getting hit.  Arms or fury warriors can also hold aggro and do it well on 4+ guys.  It's a function of knowing how and when to use your abilities.  Yes, full protection does a better job generating sticking hate (Which is what the main benefit of the upper tree does), but it's far from making arms or fury anywhere near obsolete.  <br />
<br />

Yes, I agree.  There seems to be an awful lot of raiding going on of upper end non-raid instances for the loot.  Strath and scholo may be difficult, buggy and tricky to complete,  but they are managable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off Im lvl 33 and a block usually reduces half the damage coming to me. I could give a crap less about 50 elites at the moment. And as for the diminishing returns argument, when I solo I usually use concussion blow first and then revenge every 5-6 seconds afterwards. Meaning I have roughly 36% chance that a revenge stun will do 1.5 sec stun instead of 3 and a 16% chance that it will stun for 0.75 sec. Even in that case I have landed 3 stuns in a row for 5.25 sec of total stun in a 15 sec timeframe. Finally stuns work great for me in instances because I usually am keeping agro on more then one target at once. So if I stun one I switch to the next one for my next stun. This stops diminishing returns from ever hitting the 3 stun 75% reduction and holds agro real well.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't actually. It does weapon damage with no bonus.<br />
<br />
Using it on a stun immune mob or player is stupid - it wastes rage, does the same damage it would have done anyway, and can be blocked to 0 damage.</div></div><hr />

This is because the fights take so much longer that they're much more vulnerable to adds. They also don't have efficient rage dumps like mortal strike to save up for.

<br />

I'm playing a protection warrior because that's the sort of character I wanted to play. But the baseline warrior DPS is so lousy that being somewhat jealous of arms or fury warriors is inevitable. But those talents are so high up the tree (MS or Enrage / Flurry) that you really have to choose one or the other.</div></div><hr />

That's a significant mischaracterisation that I see a lot - stance and talents are in no way linked. The pure DPS advantage of an arms build over a protection build, while significant, is not significant enough to warrant any particular alteration of tactics.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing as a protection warrior, do yourself a favor and solo in battle stance - trust me on this one ;p<br />
<br />
When soloing, at no time should you have excess rage regardless of build. If it isn't debuffed then shout, if it has a lot of health and/or armor then sunder, if it doesn't have dot up and has a decent amount of life left then rend, if it has no armor or is low on life then hstrike, if it is under 20% and you have decent time left on battleshout then execute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Velk is right, and it's too bad too, because it's a serious problem on this board at the moment. <br />
<br />
Everyone with Mortal strike tends to think that protection warriors take about half an hour to kill a mob, and only have a shitty 1h and a shield, and that's how they fucking kill everything.  Furthermore, there are a lot of protection warriors who buy into that shit and think that's what they have to do in order to solo, and it's complete fucking hogwash.<br />
<br />
Even if you've got concussion blow on your hotkey bar, it doesn't mean that you need to be using sword and board for the rest of your days.  Fuck, I soloed a lot in Berserker stance so that I could Pummel with my Whirlwind Axe, instead of using my improved shield bash.  The amount of damage you take, the amount of damage you do, and your kill rate depends FAR more upon your gear choices and how you choose to apply them than it does on your talent points.<br />
<br />
If you're in your high 30's, it doesn't matter what talents you have, you're going to solo an ungodly amount faster with your Whirlwind weapon than you will with anything else.  The amount of damage you're doing is going to offset the likely crap you would be using for 1h/shield by a tremendous amount.  It's not an arguable point either, as anyone who had their Whirlwind weapon will tell you.  Use the best setup you can find, regardless of your talent trees.  If you find yourself in a situation where you need to be saving the healer some mana, well then pull out the shield, but don't think you need to be tied to it.  I do big pulls in instances with my Ravager these days because of the proc and my DPS gimped group.  <br />
<br />
The bottom line is that there's a lot of &quot;My build is the best build&quot; going on, and 99% of the time, it's pretty much crap.  Mortal strike is fucking 30 goddamned rage for christs sake.  That's 2 sunders, which over the course of a fight will end up netting you about the same DPS increase...it's just not instant, so people who like to see big numbers get hung up on that shit.  Trust me, it's not that far out of balance.</div></div><hr />

Gonna have to go with Kermey on this one having used both builds.  MS/arms probably solos 20-25% faster assuming you don't get some crits in.  It's not purely a function of MS however, you also have the entire arms line boosting attack power, so it's really hard to say &quot;exactly&quot; how much MS does.   I would probably put it around 10-15% increase on it's own.</div></div><hr />

You choose prot, more power to you. That's probably what I would take if I were playing on a PvE server.

More correct to say you kill mobs 20-25% faster.  I've tried both builds, and counting downtime, my rate of experience gain is about the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not correct.  I generally solo in battle stance, using my pole arm, and charging to initiate each fight.  Most of the protection spec folks I know do the same (well, except for the pole arm).<br />
<br />
Also, we are actually a lot less vulnerable to adds, as we have the option (assuming you spent points in tactical mastery) of simply swapping to sword and shield and taking defensive stance and going &quot;turtle mode&quot;.  I have no problem killing 2 even level mobs, and 3 that are -1 or -2 below me, when I do this.   I worry a lot less about adds now than I did when I was arms spec.<br />
<br />
They also don't have efficient rage dumps like mortal strike to save up for. I tend to end fights with lots of rage and use anger management to carry some into the next fight. <br />
<br />
Also incorrect.  When using battle stance, when I have a ton of rage I will spend it on overpower and execute to finish the fight early.  If I have just oodles of rage, I'll even toss a few heroic strikes off to speed things up a bit.  When in berserker stance, I use whirlwind.  In defensive stance I'll use extra rage on keeping the shield block+revenge chain going, or when facing multiple mobs, cleave.  Warriors are never short on options for using rage.<br />
<br />
 But the baseline warrior DPS is so lousy that being somewhat jealous of arms or fury warriors is inevitable. But those talents are so high up the tree (MS or Enrage / Flurry) that you really have to choose one or the other.<br />

I agree with you here.  With the very best damage build, a warrior is still a poor substitute for the DPS of a true damage class, like a rogue.  I prefer to spend my points playing to the classes' strengths.</div></div><hr />

Thats intirely not true in WoW. In EQ it was beyond true. I have yet to see a rogue kill an elite faster then I can. I attack mob A hold aggro on B and C Sunder off 1800 AC and drop mob A before Rogue drops mob D and I'm holding aggro on 2 other mobs. Rogue DPS doesn't far out dmg a well geared Arms/MS warrior. Especially if I sunder off 1800+ ac in the first seconds of the fight and use MS/Overpower/WW's. You need to get out of the old EQ mind set that Warriors can't deal serious dmg. Was dueling a lvl 53 Rogue (5 lvls above me) the other day and dropped his health 50% in two hits the moment I was unstunned after the duel he was baffled that warriors could hit so hard. Lvl 50 MS/Arms warrior also dueled him and put a serious hurting on him with a well timed MS/Overpower. Think what you want but Warriors can dish out alot of dmg especially in extended fights where I get Sunder out of the way and have time to really generate rage and work MS/Overpowers. Most trash fights dont last long enough to get out sunders and really get my dmg going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I think the easy response is you need to get out of the solo mindset :)  How quickly I can kill a rogue in a duel is utterly irrelevant to me.  How quickly and efficiently the rogue and I working as a team can kill a hard mob, or an enemy player in PvP, is much more important.<br />
<br />
I play this game to group with friends and have fun taking on hard content.  To me solo'ing is the boring shit we have to do to get the levels needed to move on to the next instance (though XP in an instance group is at times just as fast).  My goal is to make my group as efficient as possible.  It is more efficient for my group to have lock-down agro control and easy tanking so that the rogue/mage/warlock/hunter/etc... can go about their business of doing DPS at full throttle, than it is for us to risk less effective agro control and weaker tanking in order to have a marginal increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
Finally, I really seriously doubt you are doing anything like the sustained DPS of a combat build rogue.  MS or execute with lucky crits are great, but sustained DPS is another thing altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At over 22% crit I don't get lucky crits I mostly miss or crit. Mortal Strike crits do 400-800 dmg 2h axe crits for 300-500 and Flurry crits in the 150-180 range. thats before I sunder off 1800 AC. Most groups like to see me dishing out alot of dmg along with having great mitigationg and aggro control.  Between  WW Sunders Demo Shout and Cleaves locking down aggro on 4-5 mobs isn't an issue. Pulls of more then that are risky for any warrior to lock aggro on. I group in instances enough and have never once heard a priest complain that I MT and Pull... only failed instance was in a pick-up Uldaman group that decided they wanted to bring along a lvl 30 Warrior little brother... made it farther then expected with him. So I guess your assumption that an Arms/MS warrior gimps an instance group is about as inaccurate as my assumption that a Protection Build solos much slower then MS/Arms.... although I still belive I'm right and you will still believe your right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do solo in battlestance. But I don't use execute if i'm winning the fight. I'd rather use that as a floating rage pool (thanks to anger management) for the next mob. That allows me to get my standard rend, demoralize, refresh, sunder battle-shout combo out earlier. This is mainly because heroic strike is such a pathetic aggro-dump I just don't see the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwaern</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never said  &quot;Arms/MS warrior gimps an instance group.&quot;  I can see situations where an arms or fury warrior would actually be superior (in a group without a heavy DPS class, for instance).   For most instances, as long as you have a decent healer, a dps-oriented warrior can tank fine.  It starts to get dicey on boss mob encounters around Marudon-level (Noxion and the Princess, for instance), but I'm sure it can still be done.<br />
<br />
However, from an efficiency standpoint, I do think that a well balanced group (meaning, a group with a healer, one or two DPS classes, and crowd control) is better served with a tank who can soak up damage better (thus making more efficient use of the healer's mana) and control agro more effectively (thus reducing the possibility of a wipe out) rather than by adding a marginal increase to overall group damage.<br />
<br />
Again, that doesn't mean I think an arms or fury spec warrior is a gimp tank... you'll likely tank just as well as a Paladin, with better agro control.  But you won't tank as well as a protection spec build.  <br />
<br />
And I'd actually agree with you on solo'ing...  I kill mobs much slower with protection spec than I did as arms.  I take less damage, but this is somewhat mooted by the fact that no matter where you hunt you have to run around a bit looking for the next mob anyway (which means a damage oriented warrior will regen health between fights enough to make up for the difference).  My point is that protection warriors solo quite well overall, and we have no problems grinding XP effectively.  My personal experience is that a protection spec warrior fares better in solo situations where multiple adds are likely, but if your smart you should be avoiding those situations anyway.<br />
<br />
As far as damage goes, heck, I'm protection spec and my crit rate in berserker stance is 13% (5% base, 5% cruelty, 3% for stance) without counting any agility gear, or the use of an axe.  But this means that 87% of my hits, on average, are for normal damage (as opposed to 78% of your hits).  Neither of us are going to beat the 200+ DPS sustained damage of a rogue.<br />
  <br />
My bias comes from playing with a group of friends every night.  We've done EQ together (from the days when Emperor Crush was a boss mob until we have 100+ AAs, DAoC with a kick ass PvP team, Anarchy Online, etc...)  We play to challenge ourselves on hard content, to explore, and give each other a hard time.  I know some folks really enjoy solo'ing, but if I had to solo more than 2-3 nights a week I'd quit playing WoW.  And in the end game, whether your into raiding or PvP, you will need to be part of a group or a raid to accomplish anything.  That's why I think protection spec makes more sense for a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite, I'm arms/protection build.  I kill about 25% faster, and since I usually hunt humanoids, when I feel the need to solo there is very little downtime due to bandages.  Don't throw the cost arguement in, because runecloth is worth less than linen right now on my server.<br />
<br />
As far as tanking fine, you're either holding aggro on the stuff you need to, or you're not.  If you're not, then either your talent/equip build, playstyle or group needs some re-tuning.  The only difference between holding hate and holding hate+ is the latter is better for heavy AE.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Btw, I'm not a hater on protection, but the upper tree needs more funcionality past about uldaman.  I realize they can't give prot a &quot;massive&quot; tanking advantage, because that would make them the only &quot;tanks&quot; in the game, but they do need to add to their bag of useable tricks, maybe via resists or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No cost argument from me, I used bandages to.  But I use them after every third or fourth fight now, and when I was arms spec I required them much more frequently.  A better argument in your favor is that simply finding the next mob to kill requires some amount of running around out of combat, which allows the arms or fury spec'd warrior to regen hit points and make up some of the difference.  My point is that my level'ing rate while solo hasn't been adversely affected by swapping from arms to protection, and that the claims some folks are making that protection spec warriors either can't solo effectively or solo so slowly that they can't gain XP at a reasonable rate are wrong.<br />
<br />
As far as tanking fine, you're either holding aggro on the stuff you need to, or you're not. <br />
<br />
I disagree.  Tanking is comprised of two things 1) grabbing agro quickly and holding it, and 2) soaking up damage efficiently.  <br />
<br />
Protection spec boosts agro control by allowing you to generate 15% more hate, and shortening the recycle time on taunt.  Neither are show-stopping skills (though from personal experience I'd say defiance has a far greater impact than the 15% number would lead you to think).  If this were all that protection spec did I'd likely still be using arms.<br />
<br />
The real value of protection spec is in soaking up damage.  Among other things, it gives you more armor, more defense, greater chance to block with a shield,  the ability to mitigate damage on most mobs through stuns, the ability to reduce incoming damage from spells through stuns and shield bash+ silence, a 30% boost in hit points, and increased power to our best debuff (sunder).<br />
<br />
None of those abilities really stand out in solo play, but they do in groups.  Especially when a group's downtime is largely dictated by how much mana the healer has.  It becomes even more valuable against bosses, where the determining factor in success is often being able to survive a couple rounds of combat while a healer gets a heal on you.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind some buffs to the protection tree, but I dont think we need much.  Really, the only really major change I'd like to see to protection is making taunt work in PvP (forcing an enemy player to target you for 6 seconds).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally disagree here.  The true added value of prot. spec comes from the added aggro abilities, most notably shield disc + bash for aggro.  If you group with stunning classes,  usually your stuns will be deflected off.  The silence is useful on standard mobs, but sadly most bosses are immune to it.  I don't consider it a tremedous factor because there is usually someone else interrupting for me.   I do however find my rage generation to be slightly more consistant with it as well while in defensive due to 1h spec.<br />
<br />
Again though, the question comes down to are you holding aggro effectively or not?  I can through arms.  I have no doubt protection would hold somewhat better, but again as I said that puts me from a hate situation to a hate+ situation.  Hate+ dosen't kill mobs faster, damage does.</div></div><hr />

And as noted before, I think you are overstating things just a wee bit here.  Shield discipline is great.  Anticipation is ok, so is toughness (even with diminishing returns, these skills allow you more flexibility in you gear sets to maintain high AC while adding on useful stats).  Improved revenge is awesome on non-stun immune mobs, and even on critters that are, the agro generation for almost no rage cost is pretty sweet.  Concussive blow is similarly nice for non-stun immune mobs, and very very nice for PvP, as is improved shield bash.  Last stand and defiance are both excellent abilities.<br />
<br />
More correct to say &quot;putting 11 points in protection gives you two the most useful damage mitigation abilities&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think going full protection spec is a very good idea (or going full out with any spec).  Better to adopt a 10 arms, 11 fury, 30 protection build (with piercing howl for PvP), or a 10/5/36 build for pure tanking.<br />
<br />
 Hate+ dosen't kill mobs faster, damage does.<br />
<br />
Improving mediocre warrior damage to decent helps kill an individual mob faster, hate+ and mitigation+ helps your group or raid clear an instance faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll agree there for damage mitgation abilities, I should've stated more clearly.<br />
<br />
Anticipation is utter trash for the returns it gives you.  You spend 5 talent points to get .4% parry/dodge, and .4% block for hard numbers, and some chance less to get critted.  While this is not bad, it's rediculously easy to get +defense items later, I currently have 44 just from easy to get gear.<br />
<br />
Toughness, last stand, Imp shield block (at least 1 point) and shield spec are all good abilities.  They're also very low point abilities on the tree.<br />
<br />
I'll give that imp. revenge and concussion blow are useable -if- you don't have  stunner in group.  I found the stun more useful from them for soloing rather than bouncing off an immune mob.  On bosses, they're useless.  They'd need to make the ability give added damage if it's stun immune or something to make me not feel gyped.  Revenge is the better of the 2 because if it stuns, its just a bonus. Everyone who's interested in keeping hate uses it as much as possible, you haven't wasted 20ish rage to just watch it deflect.  The main thing I've seen ISB really be good for is repositioning mobs, and the obvious value in Pvp.<br />
<br />
Defiance from what I've heard and experienced is melee damage hate only.  If the description reads right (and from what I've seen it does),  this ability is a an ok filler until you can get higher in the tree.<br />
<br />
Improving mediocre warrior damage to decent helps kill an individual mob faster, hate+ and mitigation+ helps your group or raid clear an instance faster.<br />
<br />
In my case, I still don't lose hate, and there is no noticeable mitigation difference outside of stuns (Which usually bounce off for me anyways)  I can also turn my rage into instant damage if I feel like it.  On major bosses,  MS's get to rain down after all the prerequisite sundering, etc is done.</div></div><hr />
