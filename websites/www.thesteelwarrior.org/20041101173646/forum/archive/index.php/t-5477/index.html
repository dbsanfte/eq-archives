complee spoilers are great, the strat we came up with is have all our tanks just all taunt him at once and celrics assist heal, then when adds pops rangers kite and wizards use strong root  dont waste strong root like that, it doesnt even last a minute and every newbie root kills it. <br />
<br />
Instead, have 12min snare cast on the adds and assign 2 paladins outside to chainstuns. they will leash back in and the next stun hits, reagros them fast enough. can do that nonstop till fight is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">VZ is 1 tankable, just takes some setup. And I would suggest staying with CC'ing the adds; attempting to kill them before the real VZ dies can get ugly.</div></div><hr />

Sir... you are a dirty rotten sploiter!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">snare aggro = gone..so he is very hard to single tank with everyone full offensive.  Engage with furious to help build aggro and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Oogagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Engage VZ, kill adds, kill VZ, loot. Usually with 1 tank, sometimes have to use 2nd. Sorry about complete spoiler :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How heck do you hold AGro with one tank? hes gona be FDed / Stuned like 90% of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Make them stand up as soon as they hit the mat. You will keep aggro as long as some dipwad isnt using a wep with aggro potential, and theres even ways around that. <br />
<br />
We one tank him consistently, its very possible, just takes some creative thinking to make it work.</div></div><hr />
