<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My friends and I have outgrown the 'normal' mode ldon's a long time ago, we refuse to do them, and I'm dead serious when I say they put me smooth asleep :)<br />
<br />
With that said, it's frustrating to me that if you win a normal ldon you get credit for one win towards upgrading your ldon charm aug.  And if you win a hard mode ldon, you get credit for ONE win.  Since my PoP charm will always be pure shit due to no raiding, I'd like to get that LDON charm augment maxxed out.  But my group cant knock out hard modes at anywhere near the pace that we can normal modes.<br />
<br />
If I choose to max out that aug, how come I am doomed to slum through normal modes if I want to max it out fastest?  Why doesnt hard mode count for two wins?  It's definitely more than twice as hard as normal mode (300 hitters vs 900, pacify basically doesnt work, etc).<br />
<br />
Food for thought.</div></div><hr />

On the plus side, you earn APs for armor at slightly more than twice the rate per success of people still doing normals.<br />
<br />
Hards are there to challenge the people ready for it. But like a game of chess or a soccer match or a football game you can only win once per contest, regardless of how hard it was to beat your opponent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amen. Easy LDoN's need to be nerfed into oblivion or hards need to be made more appealing. I think adding a few more points for hard wins would be appropriate too. After 100 easy ldon wins, the wayfairers should be tired of you not progressing and stop giving as many points / charm upgrades or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True enough.  I'm just impatient I guess.  I want to get that aug maxxed but I cant be falling asleep through the 300 more normal modes it would take to do it.<br />
<br />
51 points for normal mode, fair enough.<br />
105 points for hard mode, fair enough.<br />
1 credited win towards charm aug upgrade in normal mode, fair enough.<br />
1 credited win towards charm aug upgrade in hard mode, moruk throws a tantrum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this gets to me too.  Doing high risk adventures slows down your aug upgrade process.<br />
<br />
Looking at 52 wins in Tak for a total of 2814 points, then I see my Rujark at 2829 points total thinking &quot;Sweet, that one is getting up there too&quot;... &quot;Wait, no, only 29 wins, shit&quot;.  I've done a ton of Ruj high risk ones, but only 3 Tak high risks.<br />
<br />
Still though, getting armor quicker and the possibility of some nice drops is still a much better trade off than upgrading the aug quicker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS.not reccomended approach unless the monk ld's on zone in heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed, hards should be worth 2-3 &quot;wins&quot; each, from the perspective of adventurer stone stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">agreed it should be more points. we need a little more reason to take on a challenge. the main reason i have a hard time convincing my groups to take on hards is that they rightly say &quot;the risk/reward ratio isnt worth it&quot;. though its not as bad as it once was its a recurring theme in eq that the fastest exp in eq is usually blue cons not even cons.<br />
<br />
last night while recruiting a group for ldons i was too lazy to look for a slower so we went in with wiz wiz mag nec cler war and it was me pulling. /tangent .. why do the necros NEVER buy their mez spell?? ... anyway we still finished in 45 minutes. ldon normals are just insanely easy so boring as they are why wouldnt groups choose them over hards to get their charms maxed and their adv points up as fast as they can?<br />
<br />
and its been like this since day one. when i was level 3 before the days of twinkig i would pull level 4 mobs because it was obvious that i would be rewarded for taking on such challenges with uber experience! after much wasted time i learned that i was not rewarded for taking on yellows. the key to success then and now was deep blues. ... and normal level ldon.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's a point but I have another suggestion: Why don't remove the lockout timer ? Considering a normal adventure needs less attention and is faster done as a hard one, it would help to max charm augment faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really the only reasons to do hards are<br />
<br />
1. Better xp<br />
2. Better droppable and no-drop items<br />
3. More challenge<br />
<br />
If you are after making points as fast as possible the do the easy ones<br />
<br />
or if you want to max your charm<br />
<br />
718 wins</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's what I read somewhere:<br />
<br />
&quot;To max charm stats:<br />
<br />
Mininum wins needed to complete LDoN Stone: 366<br />
<br />
The Rujarkian Hills  - 76 wins<br />
Takish-Hiz - 78 wins<br />
Deepest Guk - 72 wins<br />
Miragul's Menagerie - 68 wins<br />
Mistmoore Catacombs - 76 wins<br />
<br />
Max stats are : 10ac, 10 to all stats and resists along  with 100hp and 100 mana&quot;<br />
<br />
Am i missing something?</div></div><hr />
