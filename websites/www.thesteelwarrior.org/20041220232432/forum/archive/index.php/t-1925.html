I will go try for myself but have to go out and eat with my family now, can anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FarlanderB</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it does add hate but so little it's practically nothing. Because of the nature of the skill, as your skill increases, it adds less and less hate. That and you have to turn your attack off to use it make it a pretty wortheless skill to use to gain aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont remember any npc attacking me for begging them :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you beg, one of 3 things happens.  1 - you succeed, get 1cp, and no aggro.  2 - you fail, but get no aggro.  3 - you critically fail, and get a tiny tiny amount of aggro.  Now, as someone mentioned, due to the nature of the skill, the more you use it, the less you critically fail.  Also, the chance to critically fail is small to begin with.  Another thing noted above, you have to turn off attack to beg, which removes any minor gain you would have gotten from a critical failure, assuming you were lucky enough to get one.  Basically, the skill is not worth using for aggro, and since I've seen people with 200 beg, who never got more than 1cp at a time, it's not worth using for anything imo.</div></div><hr />

Theory. when mobs get agro they radiate an agro based on the agro done to them. why you ask?<br />
<br />
Dain area in thurgb there is the hunter and scribe on each side. I go into the hunter area invis then bash/slam or attack or area agro and run out and I agro the royals then agro stuff on the way back down to the zone in. now if i take off invis and run up beg and run out. I can get the hunter or scribe to the zone without agroing any other mob (dain not included)<br />
<br />
monks well a monk tested this and he said that he was able agro less mobs with beg then with throwing stuff.<br />
<br />
beg causes like 1 point of agro or less so the mob that gets agro'd, radiates less agro to those mobs around him. <br />
<br />
least thats how I see it.<br />
<br />
slight problem. seems to only work in zones with vendors. however I did get a copper off of a charmed fire thingy at the efreeti area in solb Before the vendorin Nags lair was put in. so not sure how this works. but there are some zones where beg does nothing</div></div><hr />
