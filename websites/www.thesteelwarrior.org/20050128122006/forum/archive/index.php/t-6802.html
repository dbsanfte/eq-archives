Well in what order I need to upgrade anyway. <br />
<br />
Magelo Profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=997773) <br />
<br />
Bank is up to date. Have maybe 1k or so of stuff to sell aswell though.<br />
<br />
Got about 102 Adventure Points but also spent close to 1000. Mostly in MM with alot in Tak and some in Ruj but my Guk and Everfrost are appalling.<br />
<br />
Also on Stromm ie the Server of Price Gougers, so Baz prices are pretty crap.<br />
<br />
In a pretty good guild, new but we already raiding alot.<br />
<br />
Mostly Kunark Dungeons, Chardok, Sebilis, Howling Stones, Venril Sathir when ever he spawns and we get there first. Kael Drakkal is another ground but we moving on from that to the HoT and ToV area of Velious after 2 more raids or so to get CoV faction up. Be back later though for Vindi etc.<br />
<br />
Quite easy to get a group together though if you have any ideas for Campable gear.<br />
<br />
Another question where can I go to get out of this hell lvl called 55. 1st Tier planes have splattered for level exp,<br />
<br />
Edited to Add. Archtype AAs, does the cost for each rank double or just go up two?<br />
Cause I bought 1st lvl of Natural Durability and it nows says 4 for next rank.</div></div><hr />

Cost on those AA's is 2 4 6.<br />

As for &quot;server of price gougers&quot;... any server has people who will sell for the most plat that they can.  It's no different on any other server.  The only differences are amount of gear/plat in circulation, and the number of people looking for said gear.  You don't have it any worse than anyone else.<br />
<br />
As for your gear; work on upgrading the gear you currently have in slots where you have no HP.  The gothic gear you are currently using would be a good starting point.  Just keep an eye open in the bazaar, and when you do see something you could use and afford, buy it.  As well, I see you already have some thurg quest armour.  Keep hitting Kael, and get more.  If your guild is doing the kunark dragons, then you should also be able to do HoT, for the SS quest armour.  If not, keep going back to Kael and gearing up until you do have the gear to hit HoT.  Also, keep grinding out in LDoN.  Not only will you keep accumulating adventure points and charm stats, but you'll also get plat, and loot you can sell, in order to upgrade.  Veksar and Droga would also be good options for you, both in useable gear as well as saleable gear.  Bottom line is, with all the numerous in game options there are today, there is no shortage of ways to gear up to very nice levels.  All it takes is some time and effort on your part.<br />
<br />
As for places to exp; PoP planes are still far and away the best exp you will see for some time, imo.  While you may think the Tier 1 planes are slow now, they're actually still quite good.  At level 55, they're awesome.  Places such as BoT, HoH, PoTactics are very nice, but you'll need more gear and levels to go there.</div></div><hr />
