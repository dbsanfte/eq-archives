<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just  killed (with help) both &quot;Heratius Grolden&quot; and &quot;Valdanov Zevfeer&quot; in Tenebrous mountains, and looted both ashes.  It has been said elsewhere that the right ashes are now marked &quot;lore.&quot;  No, they are not marked lore.  Both ashes appear identical and only say &quot;Vampyre Volatillis Ashes. &quot;  Without using inspection, you cannot tell them apart.<br />
<br />
This makes buying the proper ashes difficult, since I know from personal experience that you can have multiple copies of the wrong ashes on you, so having on set of bad ashes on you to avoid buying another set does not work now.<br />
<br />
For those of you who are interested, I spent several months checking the bazaar several times a day and now do not know if any of those ashes I passed up were the right ones or wrong ones.<br />
<br />
To get the vampyre, I spent many evenings killing vamps in castle, and never saw Heratius.   I believe he is a purely random spawn with no trigger event.  I parked a level 1 rogut in the zone within sight of the balcony, and just checked it several times a day for about 4 weeks.  I saw him today, got guildies and killed him with 4 people, me 65 warrior, 65 chanter, 65 druid, and 65 wizard.   I did no damage, just held agro, while rest of party killed him. <br />
<br />
Side note, I still do not have my Loyalist Shield, I did whole quest 2 months ago, handed Phenic  all the items, but I had the wrong ashes at the time.  Tonight, I ran over to him after getting the right ashes, gave them to him, and received no shield.  He wants the other items, that I gave him two months ago.  I am very frustrated at the moment, filed a bug report.  I do not mind running through rest of qeust, but I am not camping that vampyre again.<br />

<br />
And congrats on at least finding him, I've yet to have him pop for me  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you are right that if you do hand ins at the different time, there is no gurantee it will work, I should of ran through rest of quest again,  kind of silly not too after spending so much effort looking for Valdonav's trigge mob, grolden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gummo</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I screwed up the final turn in on that quest also, not quite as bad as you did, but I thought for sure my ashes were lost at first.<br />
<br />
I had done the fed-ex portion of the quest (everything up to and including spawning the Vah Shir in Tenebrous) on a lvl 25 druid.  After I had finished the rest of the quest and had the ashes and the third item for the final turn in on my warrior, I handed in the medal of service (the third one that I got after handing the second one to the Vah Shir in TM) with my druid and got a response something to the effect of &quot;Thanks, but I don't have any more work for you right now.&quot;  I went ahead and handed in the 2 other pieces with my warrior, and got the standard &quot;I need all 3 items before I can give you your reward.&quot; response twice, and no reward.<br />
<br />
I re-did the whole fed-ex portion of the quest with my warrior, which includes handing several different items to the same npc as the final turn in.  Somewhere around 3 hours after I had handed in the ashes and the other piece, I finally handed him the medal of service again and got my shield.  Needless to say I was extremely relieved, and pretty surprised that it had worked.<br />
<br />
So anyway, if an npc has multiple quests, it looks like they keep track of them seperately, and completing one quest won't affect a different quest that's already been half-MQ'd.  I'm not sure if there's any kind of a timer, but I'd guess that there's not.<br />
<br />
If your server hasn't had any down-time since you handed in the ashes, the npc just might still remember that someone had turned them in.  In my opinion, it would be worth your effort to do the other parts of the quest again as quickly as you possibly can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I filed a petition to get my ashes back, and a GM responded quickly and said in the notes that my ashes were refunded to me.  I did an identify on them (and all the other ones in my posesion) and they were not the right ones.  Lol, even the GMs get messed up on them.  The trick in the above post, appears to work, it also identified them as the wrong ashes. <br />
<br />
I went through the whole quest again (had problems spawning kerzar Clawtore that I did not have the first time around, and actually backed up and did the first part a third time to get him to spawn.  I did quest up to end to get my token and badge.  I handed badge and token to Phenic and I got my shield.  Ashes not needed.  <br />
