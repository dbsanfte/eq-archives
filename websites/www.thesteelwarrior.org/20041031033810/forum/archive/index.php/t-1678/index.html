<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have run out of easily obtainable purchaseable upgrades for my warrior so I have decided to save up for a BoC. On my server they tend to sell for 400k or so, so it's a sizable investment to say the least.<br />
<br />
I figured a BoC and any other good ratio 1h weapon would be really good agro so I figured I would just pair it with a Horn of Hsagra or Shortblade of Lightning something similar. That is until I checked the bazaar today. A Sceptre of Destruction has come up for sale and I can get it for about 100k less than a BoC. The difference in price would allow me to get a considerably better second weapon, I would probably end up with a Split Blade of Destruction.<br />
<br />
So is the BoC agro a lot better than SoD agro? I am sure either combo will crank out similar DPS so it really comes down to the procs and the proc rates. Which is the better weapon?<br />
<br />
I could care less about the SoD not dropping any more and owning a rare item. I also am not concerned with which has better stats, I am solely concerned with the better agro set up.<br />
<br />
BoC + HoH or Shortblade of Lightning<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
SoD + Split Blade of Destruction</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say Get a GSoT ~!! muwhahhaa but you already have one =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My old warrior had a BoC and now I use SoD/sword of the bloodsworn and there's no question, I don't have as much aggro as I used to.  I have a lot more issues with monks etc stealing aggro, and slowers get beat on a lot more in my groups.  Also I can't use sit aggro to position mobs nearly as well as I could with my BoC because they just don't hate me as much.  <br />
<br />
I am only using 36% haste currently and my old warrior had 41%, but it's very clear to me that a BoC is far superior to an SoD in the aggro department.  I haven't parsed DPS but I'm guessing you're right that they are similar.  I like damage procs, but the stun doesn't stick on anything in PoP.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line is I'd happily trade my SoD for a BoC having used both pretty extensively :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BoodTheDorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, personally I would go with the BoC. It is more sure for aggro when it procs, and if you find yourself tanking in places such as BoT, you will notice that the stun effect on a SoD doesnt land on the mobs. So, i would say BoC + HoH.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balthizar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say SoD and Splitblade of Destruction. I know warriors on my server that use a splitblade of destruction and a BoC in offhand for DPS. The SoD with a greatblade of storms would really rock.</div></div><hr />

Yes, virtually everything in PoP that gives good experience at 65 will be immune to the stun on SoD. However, anarchy procs still seem to generate the same aggro (or close enough to not be able to tell) even if the mob is immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BoodTheDorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Either way, i dont think you will be disappointed with the combos. Both will be good aggro and dps for a long time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Blade of Carnage &gt; SoD for agro This is basically all I care about so looks like I will be saving for the BoC. I 3-box war/chanter/wiz so it is super important that my warrior hold agro without ping-pong so I can pay attention to the chanter for CC and slows. If I have to chase a mob around with the warrior, that leaves the chanter unattended - which is bad for everyone. Thanks for the input guys.</div></div><hr />
