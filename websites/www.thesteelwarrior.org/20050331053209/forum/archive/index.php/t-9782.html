<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xolerus</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well about 2 weeks ago I started making groups for the MPG single trials, my guild has farmed Time for looooooong time and now we are experiencing the good GoD zones (Qvic/Inkuta). IMO the group trials are relative easy. I did 4 of them so far, first time I did Arcana one we did with 2 warriors and 1 paladin (what kind of DPS is that???? lol) BUT we still have a lot of dificult in Weaponry trial.<br />
My question is:<br />
In the mob that is weaker to slashing weapons for example, does it matter if I use 2 hand slash or dual wield 1 hand slash weapons? <br />
I mean are they weak to slash type weapons only or sometimes its 2 hand slash and sometimes 1hand slash. Note that my question applies to blunt or piecing also. We almost beat it, maybe 2 more minutes and we could won that.<br />
As I could see when a mob is weak to slash weapons doesnt matter if it is 1 hand or 2 hand, but well, we never knows.<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
