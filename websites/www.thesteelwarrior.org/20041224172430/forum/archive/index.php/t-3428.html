LOL. You all complain about this or that being broken as a warrior. Aw, cry me a river. Try playing a class that until PoP wasn't wanted or needed. <br />
<br />
Arrogant SOB's. Too used to being part of the holy trinity? Get back to being useful at the one time you are. Tanking Boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Here's a thought. Instead of crying for nerfing knights. Look out for yourselves. We knights are doing just fine thank you.<br />

*once again thanks his Goddess he is a Paladin*:D</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry I joined the game to be the best tank ever. Not the best -boss tank- ever. I made a warrior because I wanted to drink ambrosia from the skulls of my slain foes.<br />
<br />
I don't have a guild currently because I got tired of being a level 65 warrior tanking epic mobs for level 45 clerics, mages, chanters, rogues. I got tired of handing over all my time to raids that I gain nothing from.<br />
<br />
So is this paladin trying to tell me to go solo a boss mob? I mean don't get me wrong, I'd love to raid, I'd love to go into the elemental planes and tank gods like my class was made for. But the situation I'm in doesn't allow that.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget to thank your godess when pure melee are fixed and your pala returns to its original 'intended' spot. Better hurry up and get level 65 before that happens.</div></div><hr />

Can any pally's come help kick the arse of this arrgogant bish? Regardless of the emnity between paladins or warriors, or any issues with class balancing that exist, there is still such a thing as being respectful when going to another classes boards.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are broken which we all know, and SoE really needs to address this as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
I came over here from the PoN boards, and most of us agree that what this troll did was unwarrented.  I as well would like to go to the CT server and knock this pally around a bit until he starts respecting other classes.<br />
<br />
Warriors really do need some more abilities mainly more to give you all aggro that you all want. <br />
<br />
If you wish to know I am Tanarak Dulinar and I reside on Innoruuk.  May SoE get to the class balancing soon, because things are not balanced.</div></div><hr />

You come into my home and insult my class and think your a hot shot?<br />
Boy go back to school and learn some manners.<br />
You dont come into Big Daddy's home and start giving shit to warriors. That shit dont fly, now you have made yourself a troll ooo scary. Wait till someone meaner then me, gets his hands on your young dipshit anime PR0NZ jerkin self. That'll be a fun read.<br />
<br />
Now go away go back to your gay paladin boards and kiss ass, cuz I got a steel boot It dosent fit, But I got 5 plat bet going with a few others that I can MAKE it fit.  Also I bet Shik or someone else that has MIGHTYTALK(tm) Powa's will prolly come along eventully and squish you , That'd prolly be fun to watch too.<br />

Gratz to pissing off warriors like you guys pissed off the clerics.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should now visit the other class boards and get them on the nerf wagon too.</div></div><hr />

Furor is a great flame read, When that guy gets pissed off its fun to sit back and watch. Kudo's to him, Me I am just a semi steroid induce raging bezerker for 3 minutes at a time (F defensive aggresive all the way baahbe)<br />
<br />
And hey Big Al, Anther troll isnt gonna put me into that camp, Im co leader of nerf the F outta paladins campaign, I have a dream,<br />
That dream is for all nights to have cloth defense mitigation, That dream is for them to be able to get aggro whenever they chose then die a painful horrid death because they have no mitigation,<br />
That whenever they see a green con, They will know true fear because that mofoawka goblin scout thats level ten will rape their 65 asses. <br />
Yes they will know the pain and anguish that warriors have known when seeing a DB con and wander, Can I take this solo, And have it be answered with a resounding NO. <br />
That when they see their Big Daddy warrior's come up they will bow down and RESPECT MY AUTHORITY. <br />
<br />
Gimp ass punk knights. Your nerf Bat is coming,  It will show up one day, Then even casters will mitigate better then you all. Thats my dream. <br />

<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Now that monks are linked to beastlords, and those races don't have robe graphics, monks don't get to wear their robes anymore. So it's high time ANOTHER melee class became a robe wearer!<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
&quot;Then even casters will mitigate better then you all. &quot;<br />
<br />
I believe the Dev Team has some Mathematical Models left over from the monk mitigation &quot;tweak&quot; days that would be AMAZING at accomplishing just that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if I went to the paladin board and posted what I do here, then you could call it a vicious cycle. However I have more respect for the legitmite people that are gracious enough not to troll and incite flame's on other classes board.<br />
<br />
Learn some manners before you come into a fourm that represents my class, And tell me I start a cycle or my posts incite other &quot;knights&quot; as I dont give two figs about knights, or there feelings when they start crap here. <br />
