<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">this is a pretty easy quest except for the last component, the ashes. takes real dedication to monitor the castle in TM and catch the dam vampire when it pops. after literally months of camping it off and on never to see VZ some guildies on a drive by caught him up and burned it down. go go guildies!<br />
<br />
also, when u turn in the note to the guard at the tm zone, dont panic when the mob doesnt pop right away, can take up to 30 minutes for it to pop and it wanders, bring a tracker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>icsdave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few more things,  you dont really need a tracker with Kenzar he ends up in front of the fort and parks there, spawn him with the letter and then kill vamps in front of fort.   VZ is a bit of a bitch to kill, he has around 100k hps, does a 1000hp life tap and requires vamp bane weapons.  We did him with 4, 65 BL, 65 war, 65 Shaman and a 58 cleric and took 24 mins with a total of 114k damage to him.   Looks like once hes poped he stays up for about 30 mins.  We killed him on sat and got him to pop again on sun but took to long to get help and he depop'd.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Folian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">also, you may see the ashes for sale in the bazaar...   they are dropable.<br />
<br />
problem is, another vampyre in the castle drops ashes that are exactly the same as the ones needed for the quest.<br />
<br />
difference? you have to ID them to make sure you have the right ones. So, unless someone will let you hold them and ID them to make sure... don't buy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this quest yesterday, guild shaman called out he was kiting Valdanov so I ran to help with a druid bot. No vamp bane but BoC+CHSD kept aggro just fine. We went oom with him at 85%, so got a mage to come over to add a bit of dps. Had a slight problem with him gating but managed to polish him off. Did the rest of the quest in about 4 hours, all 2-box with me and druid. Niec AC upgrade from the Hiero I've been wearing for nigh on 2 years :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For the ashes, you can buy a set of the cheap ones and bank it.  Then you can try to buy any you see in the bazaar since it won't let you buy another &quot;fake&quot; since they're lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">is the vampire on a spawn timer .... or is he like the commandars in ssra...just keep clearing and hope for a spawn....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Random Spawns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ebil camp!! I was there for a good days worth of time and he didnt spawn, but I was expecting that.. waiting to go back again.. 24 hours of that place is definatly boring :p made decent cash though! It is a random camp, though how much I wish it was a trigger.. or at least after every 100th vamp you kill they give you a cookie! you'd probly get a good 100 cookies before you saw him though :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I camped this myself.  In combination with my friend, we spent a total of 85 hours there (50 myself, 35 him).  We missed him twice.  Heratius Grolden will only stay up for like 30 minutes, so if he spawns while you're sleeping, you'll have to wait until the next time he spawns.  Yep, it bloody sucks, but the shield is argueably one of the absolute *BEST* back slots in the game for its sheer AC.  Add an LDoN 10ac aug to it and you have 60ac in one spot.<br />

Yeah, you can start changing your pants now. ;)</div></div><hr />
