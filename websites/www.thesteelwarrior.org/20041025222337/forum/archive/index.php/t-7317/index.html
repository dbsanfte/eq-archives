<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jerseth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow warriors. <br />
<br />
I'm putting up a thread because you all seem very knowledgable and pretty on the mark. I read as much as I can, and the advice in these forums has helped me really get a feel for our class.<br />
<br />
Anyway. On to what I need help with.<br />
<br />
Background info: ( magelo has some miscalculation that I'll fix later )<br />
<br />
Jerseth is a level 58 Dark elf. <br />
Unbuffed HP: 3693<br />
Unbuffed AC: 1174<br />
STR/STA: 183/213<br />
<br />
Thanks to our raiding Alliance, I have some good stuff, but I'm still considerably below the 1300 AC mark at 1174 ( 1210 if I use an AC 1 hander instead of OSoW ). Stamina is a little low too -- bridging, at most, at 213, and my hitpoints bridge just under 3700 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
The Problem:<br />
<br />
I'm torn between either concentrating on AA's or leveling to 65. I don't want to waste time inbetween because it's counterproductive.<br />
<br />
One side says that staying at 58 and just grinding out AA's is the way to go.<br />
They say that I should stay at 58 and grind out AA's until I get our Archtype basics maxed -- Natural Durability 3, Combat Stability 3, and Combat Agility 3 -- ( Natural Healing/ Combat Fury 3 are toys for later). After that, they want me to stay at 59 to grind out Class/PoP basic AA's, etc. So it'll be at least a month or so at the very least before I start leveling again.<br />
<br />
The other side says I should grind to 65 and THEN start picking up AA's because there are more options, more experiance in tougher mobs, and more group choice.<br />
<br />
The Questions:<br />
<br />
First Question: Is it easier and more efficient to get AA's at 58-59? ... or would I get AA's faster and easier if I leveled to 65 first, and THEN picked up all the AA's I want?<br />
<br />
Second Question: Where would I get the best AA experianced at 58-59? ... and at 65?<br />
<br />
Third Question: So, how and where should I go to first to handle my AA's leveling? Any particular zone(s) that are warrior friendly?<br />
<br />
Fourth, and final question: And, overall, how does my warrior statistically stack up for his level on a scale of one to ten ... and Why?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time. I appreciate it.<br />

The aa is nice, but levels &gt; aa, not to mention aa will come faster after you are 65. But grabbing run3 is still nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, look at it this way.<br />
<br />
/ooc 60 Warrior LFG<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
/ooc 65 Warrior LFG<br />
<br />
Now who do you think gets to grind first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Exactly. The hardest thing about being a 60-64 warrior is that you're not 65 yet, so you're less likely to be picked up for a high level group.  And you'd have to have a freakin ton of AA's to even approach the same level of ability that a 65 tank with 0 AA has.  Also, in the time it takes you to grind out all those AA's at 58-59, you could have leveled to 65 AND ground out some AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think every player goes through the same dilemma that you are dealing with now.  I know I did.  You hear it all the time when you ask this question and the reason is because it is true.  In general, level &gt; AA.  The innate enahncements you get from leveling outweigh the AAs.  Your increased hps, resists, etc, etc will benefit you more than the AAs.  I say this now, but depending on how fast you grind it may no longer be the case.....once you hit 65, you can then focus on AAs.  You will have access to better zones and better equiptment.  It is MUCH easier to get a pick up group at 65 than it is to get a lower level group.  In the good experience zones, many would not even give you a second look if they saw that you were not at least 65.<br />
<br />
I tried doing what you are doing now...grinding out AAs on the way to 65, then finally I just sucked it up and went full experience to 65.  I have not regretted it for a second.  So much more became available to me with the levels and the increased innate stuff, especially resists for raids far outweighed anything gained by AAs.  The only reason I might not do this is if all of my friends were lagging behind on levels to a point where I could not group with them any longer.<br />
<br />
Just this warrior's experience saying level to 65 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I do agree most of the time level&gt;AA there is the case hinted at and mentioned by Galdaen about passing friends. My wife and I play she is my cleric I am her tank and we pushed levels to hit 62. The friends we play with lagged behind for one reason of another and now we are 62 they are 58 or so and while we can group the mobs in the zones she and I get XP eat them for lunch. She and I talked about it quite a bit and decided that we would go AA till they catch up giving them some time to work thereselves up to us. I have gotten 5 AA so far and will continue to get some more till they catch up. <br />
<br />
So if you have a regular group and enjoy hanging out with them and you out  level them as I did then you may want to consider AA before level. As a Halfling (HOBBIT) and a Warrior I get a double XP bonus (1 for race and 1 class) so I level faster then my friends do heck I even level faster than my wife Hobbit Cleric as she only has one bonus. <br />
<br />
Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i agree with what already been stated, with the exception of getting run3 as soon as you can. the extra run speed over the mobs will save your life if you find your self in a bad situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your magelo says 1142ac.  Are you including the Kizrak click in your &quot;unbuffed AC&quot; number?<br />
<br />
If the Magelo is wrong and you're truely at 1172ac unbuffed, then you can definitely reach 1300ac buffed.  Just get Call of the Rathe from a Ranger, and click the bp and get Virtue or Nine/Kazad/Gallantry if available.  You'll be around 1325ac.  You'll be at 1294ac with full raid buffs on the other hand (unless you equip that AC 1hander).<br />
<br />
Or were you just wanting 1300 unbuffed?<br />
<br />
I agree with the others, except that when you ding 60 or 61, you need to stop and think &quot;is my equipment decent, or are there some terrible problem spots that are hurting me?&quot;.  Most of the time, you'll say yes (and I believe you're okay in this respect), but I've seen some terrible level 65 warriors that I avoid all the time now that decided to level but have equipment I wouldn't put on a level 50.  That hurts more than 65 helps, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tell everyone that asks-<br />
<br />
 Run 3, then run to 65.<br />
<br />
 Levels willl get you more HPs/AC, more groups, higher level mobs so higher level drops, etc etc<br />
 Also, remember AA exp is equal to level 51 experiance(I think?). So, the higher level mobs you kill, the more exp you get, the faster the AAs go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the only class i might possibly reccomend doing aas before levels are rangers.<br />
<br />
<br />
before i rolled my warrior, i played my ranger as my main.  when PoP came out i was 14 aas away from archery mastery3 ... i stuck it out, and it was well worth my time. <br />
<br />
even then, though, with new zones openned at 62, i would reccomend at least getting 62 before aaing.  BoT/HoH &gt;&gt;&gt; PoStorms/Valor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to say 65 first then AA's too. I just dinged 65 last night.  I have 6 AA's atm and 2 of those are from getting flags in POP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unless people you play with are level 50 or so there's no reason why you can't be at level 65 and group them.  You will be higher level and your group as a whole will be getting XP faster.<br />
<br />
The only reason to put off AAs for level 65 is if you plan to leech the fight higher con bonus from groups.  A level 62 in BoT gets more AA xp than a level 65 because mobs will be white to yellow as opposed to blue.  Problem is that, as stated before, it's harder for a lower level people to get a level at all, so it's not clear if you actaully come out ahead this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">lvls over *any* aa that we currently get...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">58 isn't the optimal level to get AA pre-65 if you go that route. Get to 62 and have BoT and HoH open to you. you don't specifically mention if you're in a guild or not. I got 62 and had 6 AA, over the course of getting 62 and 63, I also got all 3 levels of ND. I was usually in guild groups, because at the time I was easily the best geared tank in our small family non-raiding guild, having the benefit of nice Cultural armor. Over the course of 64 I picked up AE Taunt, CA1 and CS1. If I remember correctly, all that took me just about 4 weeks or so, but I was in no rush since I did not have high level raids waiting for me.Once 65 with that base I felt confident that I would leave a fairly good impression on pick-up groups that I was not a complete mana sponge<br />
<br />
A small correction to what someone posted earlier. from 60-65 you're not going to gain any AC strictly by leveling once you have capped your defense at 252 which I think you can do at 59<br />
<br />
Looking at your numbers, you're on the overall track of 4k/1200 at level 60, but they are a little deceiving because you have outstanding stats from your weapons and bow. Since you have a couple of PoP flags, add the Intricate wooden figure charm and adventurer stone if you have it to your profile, that will add some to your numbers. But as far as your gear goes, you have many slots with +0 HP on them, and the further you go, the more that will hurt you. Also you have really nice damage weapons, but with only the Obsidian Shatter AC debuff that could be considered an Aggro proc, I could see you running into trouble with holding agro, especially in pick-up situations where slowers want to slow ASAP<br />
<br />
Best AA exp at 58 from zones you do not need to be flagged to enter would be PoV/CoD, but mobs there will be yellow and red to you I think. Best Tier 1 exp I found was PoD Castle Courtyards on lightcrawlers and underbulks. These are 55-57 so your group will get the bonus of killing within 5 levels still. A non-PoP idea would be Veksar and Droga. Droga deep in mobs are 58-61 I believe, and there are named that will yield nice upgrades or sellables. Veksar has some nice Kylong armor pieces and Soulscream belt for haste.<br />
<br />
At 65, 2% per kill in BoT. Usually takes about hour and a half to ding an AA with a reasonable, but not powergaming group. I only flagged for Tactics last week, and have not had the chance to check the rate there, and HoH is a bit too laggy for me<br />
<br />
Now as Goradain so succintly put it:<br />
<br />
Well, look at it this way.<br />

/ooc 60 Warrior LFG<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
/ooc 65 Warrior LFG<br />
<br />
Now who do you think gets to grind first?<br />
<br />
<br />
He's absolutely right if you're going to be looking for pick-up groups a lot. In the LFG window level is indeed greater than all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Level to 65 so you can grind out LDoNs for those problem areas -- you will get more points in a level 65 group than you will in a 58 group, and the drops you can see from normal (and possibly hard, once you get a few AAs...or if you group with someone else to tank while you go dps) will be well worth it.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 65, even with zero AAs, you will be sitting in the 5khp range, my guess is.<br />
<br />
I know you didn't ask for gear advice, but I'd suggest swapping out some of your stat gear for ac/hp gear.  Neck, Face, and Boots are all spots that can easily be tweaked through the bazaar or through normal exp groups (ie LDoN, at least level 65 normals) for some decent upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slinki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At least get to 62 first before you do any AA.  Like the others said you get in BoT and HoH.  The xp there is the best you going to see for a while, in less your in a high raiding guild.  And think about 65 the points you earn from LDoN is a lot better and good upgrades that you can use. So basic Level &gt; AA is the best way to go IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I will give you an example.<br />
<br />
I had a level 51 cleric with zero AA.  I made a a 2 box level 1 ogre warrior (race penalty to exp.)<br />
<br />
I leveled the warrior to grouping range for the cleric.  Then I duo'd and grouped with friends.  I played together 99 percent of the time.<br />
<br />
I took the cleric to 65 and gained 102 AA.<br />
I left the warrior at 61 and 128 AA, then leveled to 65 with these around 50 group leader exp points (Health3, targets target, MA ring, spell awareness.)<br />
<br />
So, the cleric lost around 26 AA (or more due to group leader exp loss of 20 percent from warrior) compared to the lower level warrior.  In other words, I gained 28 more AA from being level 61 than what I would have had if I leveled to 65.<br />
<br />
Also, I can say at level 61 and with ND3/LR1/ID1/PE I could tank 95 percent of the mobs that level 65 groups tanked.  I even did hours of parsing against a level 65 with identical AA, identical ac (exactly the same value), and identical AGI to find no statistical difference between level 61 and level 65.<br />
<br />
What I believe it all comes down to is this:<br />
<br />
1) If you can get groups regardless of level, stay at 55 until you have the level 55 AA done (CA/CS/ND) then move to 60 and finish level 59 AA.<br />
<br />
2) If you depend on pick up groups there is not option, you will get exp FAST because you will be LFG less.<br />
<br />
Also, one factor may have been that at 55, I have roughly the same gear as I do today.  I am 9335 buffed (no tribute or group leader exp) with 1780 AC buffed.  I had around 8300 HP at 61, and 7500 ish at 55.  So the warrior was slightly twinked.<br />
<br />
At 65 I have to be in a really good group to manage an AA an hour now (or better; vxed is probably the best exp) and it has to be fast killing group.  When I was level 55, I could easily manage an AA an hour in PoV and Hobgoblins in PoN.<br />
<br />
Edit: of note, you want mobs to be within 5 levels up or down of the group members and the average group level.  If you kill a mob that any member of the group is more than 5 levels away from it, someone (maybe all) will get less exp than normal.  So, if you have a level 55 and a level 65, you can only kill level 60 mobs to have both gain their normal exp from killing a level 60 mob.  You also may want to consider the average group level, since in this case it was 60, but if you had several level 65's and one level 55, the level 55 would not gain as much exp as he &quot;could&quot; if you kill as a group a mob higher OR lower than level 60.<br />
<br />
In short, there is a whole lot of complicated parameters to this equation.  That leaves the path of least resistance of leveling to 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to say you did a great job explaining what I meant. I would change the above to go to 62 for BoT and HoH and Valor (easier) XP but then crank them out if you have a set groupage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Who got the leadership exp?  The warrior or the cleric?<br />

<br />
<br />
You fail to state where/what you were xp'ing on.  You were almost certainly xp'ing where the warrior was getting the 5 level range bonus and the cleric was not then you were not xp'ing evenly.  If you run the math there's no comparison, xp at 65 is far faster than xp at 61 as long as you are fighting mobs within 5 levels.</div></div><hr />

Haha, ok.  I didn't make it clear.<br />
<br />
You must kill mobs that are within 5 levels of ALL part members.<br />
The higher level person in the group gets the bonus priority.<br />
Both the higher level and the lower level can not gain the bonus at once UNLESS the mob is within 5 levels of BOTH.<br />
<br />
I have EXTENSIVELY tested the dynamics of grouping with characters of different levels (all set to AA exp.)<br />

Well he did say his twink (And that is hella more than slight twinkage) has been Elemental flagged since 51, so I'm pretty sure it's got gear that blows away even the best Bazaar gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yeah a level 61 with AAs tanks just as well as a level 65, like how a person with 100 AA functions as well as someone with 700 AAs.  Yeah right.  It doesn't even matter if mitigation has nothing to do with levels.  The HP edge you gain for being level 65 as well as being able to taunt the mobs easier (going from blue/white to yellow/red makes taunt significantly harder) makes up for any AA gains.<br />
<br />
You leeched your way for an extra 20ish AAs at the expense of your group.  Maybe you don't realize it, but had you been level 65, although you would've got less XP, your GROUP would have been getting more XP overall because you're able to do more damage and hence kill stuff faster.  It is excusable that some, out of ignorance, tried to get the AAs out of the way instead of getting level 65.  But I never group with anyone who purposely stays at a low level (62 would be ideal) to xp at my expense.<br />
<br />
You can hit level 65 first and be more useful in every way, or stay at level 62 and be a leech and slow your group down.  It's sad there are people who consciously choose the latter.</div></div><hr />

That is your problem.  A 65 will get bad xp in those zones...quite bad actually.  If you xp'd in zones appropriate for the toon's level you would get better xp.  My point stands.<br />
<br />
Edited to add:<br />
Its very simple math.  The xp cost of an aa is a fixed number, something like 24million xp regardless of level.  <br />
<br />
A group of 6 level 65's will put out more dps than a group of 6 61's (comprable gear, etc, etc).  Stats, level, everything is higher.  In other words a group of 65's will kill the same mobs faster than a group of 61's, this is fact.  <br />
<br />
So in other words if the mobs the groups are fighting are within the 5 level range the 61's will get more xp per kill and most likely get xp faster.  However, if the 65's are fighting mobs that are within 5 levels of them they will also get the bonus xp.  So you HAVE to compare apples to apples here.  Now if you also account for the fact that farther in pop zones have better xp mods and the 65's (the case example was without a guild to flag them) have access to these better xp zones there is no question that levelling to 65 and then aa'ing is faster than aa'ing before levelling as long as you pick your xp spots intelligently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Xorgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't think the &quot;within 5 levels&quot; rule is really a bonus, its more of an equivalence to the xp you would have got prior to them implementing a sliding scale on XP awarded on mobs with PoP.  Folks used to kill as many of the lowest dark blues they could find, but with the sliding scale folks find it more efficient to kill the lvl 60+ mobs when leveling up from 61-65 in PoV/BoT than the lvl 55+ dark blue to 65 cons in Tier1.  From what I recall, the sliding scale is such that if your killing dark blues, if its up to 5 levels below it you won't be nerfed compared to what it was before. There is a major penalty killing stuff below 5 levels even though they still con dark blue. The bonus (vs. pre-PoP standard) starts with even cons and killing yellow cons, red cons, deep red cons.<br />
<br />
If a lvl 60 cleric and a lvl 65 tank are grinding out AA's killing lvl 62 golems in PoV the cleric will gain AA's at a significantly faster rate than the tank.  It depends on the role of the class and the camp-- I wouldn't think a lvl 60 cleric would hold back their group there.  A heavily twinked tank could probably do fine there too, tanks main role is dmg taking, and if they do that without crimping their healer's style then the DPS difference between 60 and 65 is probably not a big deal in overall group DPS.  For damage dealers, crowd controllers etc. I would say get to 65 ASAP regardless of camp.<br />
<br />
There aren't a lot of pickup spots where folks at 65 can fight a steady diet of even/yellow/red cons for xp.  If you have NP getting a group at 60 fighting  even, yellow, red cons -- go for it.  I think the standard wisdom of the board is skewed by the pickup LFG factor and the fact we are tanks - a more glaring example would consider lvl 55 instead of lvl 60 -- a 55 cleric would probably do fine in PoV grinding out AA's at a PoV golem camp, and the XP would be awesome fighting deep red cons.  A 55 tank is probably going to get laughed at going LFG there though.<br />
<br />
I didn't step foot in PoP until I dinged 65 though (I just kept killing the lvl 55 skeletons in the mines of Chardok that I was AA'ing off of when PoP came out) -- so take this all with a grain of salt :P</div></div><hr />

Not only can you wear better equipment at 65, just from the &quot;lvl 65 required / recommended&quot; stuff, but you will be a greater benefit to your groups, your guild, and your raid force sooner that way. <br />
<br />
Even if you were to end up at level 65 and 111 AA (instead of say 131 AA and lvl 65), you'll be more utility and a better tank all along the way to those around you. <br />
<br />
Get 65 first.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jerseth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">After doing a bit of research, and after measuring and weighing each peice of information on this thread, I've come to a viable conclusion.<br />
<br />
For warriors with appropriate equipment and stats relative to their level and race, gaining level experiance to 65 takes precedence over gaining experiance in Alternate advancement.<br />
<br />
There are several reasons for this.<br />
<br />
Mostly, its accessibility. More access comes from 65. Better gear, more zones, more groups, and tougher creatures to kill.<br />
<br />
Secondarily, more access equals more experiance, which, in turn, directly means faster AAing.<br />
<br />
The advantages of staying low and climbing AA's along with levels has a disproportionate amount of benefits when compared to simply climbing to 65 and gaining AAs there. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, levels speak louder than AA's. It would take a great of better experiance and a large amount of AA&quot;s for a 61 Warrior to meet the same fighting ability as a comparable 65 warrior.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, damage mitigation boosts, HP/AC increases, and the raised skill caps all across the board simply can't be made up for with just AA's. <br />
<br />
And if they can, it'd take alot. <br />
<br />
So, I'm already on my way to 62. I hope to be 65 in a week or so. Armed only with Innate run/regen 3 and CS 2, I'm doing pretty well.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help, guys.</div></div><hr />

There is a fallacy in the arguments being made here...  there is more content accessible to a level 60 character than a level 65 Character. The content that is accessible to higher level characters can be &quot;keyed&quot; and thus is still accessible to a level 60-62 character. The content that is no longer practical for a level 65 character (diminishing xp returns) remains that way. The alliance we are in already has main tanks who are 65 and have a lot of AA's (Yethuy, Ayida) The mobs you are fighting will not change significantly by getting all the way to 65, but there is a difference in the number of XP's you get determined by your relative level to those mobs. The higher the mob is compared to you, the more XP you get. Since AA's are a fixed number of XP's, if you are killling the same mobs you get more XP  killing the same mob at a lower level. Since the group is not relying on you for DPS, and your buffed AC will exceed diminishing returns for most content, achieving a certain level (around 62) and knocking off your AA's will in the long run take less playing time than going straight to 65 first. <br />
<br />
I can see that my opinion is in the minority but the argument from many of the people here is that unless you get to 65 first you won't have anyone to group with. You and I know that on our server that is not the case. If you can't find a Guild group within a few minutes, you can find an AWNN group quickly and beyond that, I know that I cannot even put up my LFG with a tag that reads &quot;No group, I'm on a raid&quot; without getting two group invites in moments. <br />
<br />
Boy that red sure is tough to read...</div></div><hr />

If you want to spend the rest of your days in BoT, and HoH because you get shit for XP everywhere else in the world, then 65 is for you.  Or I guess if you have elemental access, then you get those zones too.<br />
<br />
However, at level 60 you will get insane XP with a good group in a ton of zones.  Sirens, Chardok, Seb, Droga, probably nurga still, Tier 1 PoP, Howling Stones, Velketor, Fungus grove, Akheva, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Man I loved the game when I was level 60.  I've hated it ever since I ran out of AA's to do at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I have moved to 63 but am slowly making my way to 65 for the exact reasons above. I have 2 groups that vie for my attention one group that is leveling to catch up to 60 a couple of the members decided to do aa while the rest of us leveled but are catching up and the other group I am with is all 62-65 and we do LDoN's is a blast. Will worry about 65 later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jamylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I'm currently 15% from 65% and I have to say for me it is the smarter choice. I find it easier to get groups to trust me as I get more levels. Being MT in BoT at 62 is a lot different than being MT in BoT at 64, people have a lot more confidence in me. They trust that I know what I'm doing and don't question my decision to say lets fight it out rather than fleeing and causing yet another train in BoT =/ .The stigma of seeing 62 as a MT will still haunt you even if you have a lot more AAs than I do, people who advertise 62 LFG w/defensive AAs don't nearly find a group as quickly as I do w/only 5 AAs right now. <br />
         Also a lot of my friends are in EP guilds, the sooner I hit 65 the sooner we can group together more effectively, hitting 65 means I am getting the most bang for my buck doing LDoNs with them (more LDoN points = sooner I can get upgrades for the same amount of time.)  However for someone who has friends at lower levels and wants to group with them, AAing may be the better choice.        <br />
         Personally I find the idea of being an overlord a lot more appealing than a warlord, because it sounds a lot more dominating, and what a female half elf warrior needs more than anything is to sound more commanding and to separate herself from every male ogre/barbarian warrior on the server (well that and good gear and lots of AC/HP).</div></div><hr />

So there's nothing stopping you from taking a group in your favorite dungeon and XP in a tier 1 or 2 plane instead.  And even at level 65, it's tolerable, and your group would benefit from having a higher level character.</div></div><hr />

This is quite literally not true.  Nothing could be farther from the truth actually.</div></div><hr />

According to the ZEM list that circulates on the web, it is true that all PoP zones have the same XP modifier (PoTime a/b not listed).
