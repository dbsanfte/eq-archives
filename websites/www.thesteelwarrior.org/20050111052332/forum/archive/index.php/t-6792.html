<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reyd</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 accounts one I keep in bazaar mode and the other at the log-in screen when I am done playing for the night. All night long the accounts do fine, when I wake up at 4am central time they are both still working properly. However when I get home in the evenings around 5pm they are both back to desktop or a frozen black screen. This has been going on about 2 weeks now. At first I suspected everquest but this last weekend I had just gotten up around 7am and *heard* both pc's crash from the other room - because I had accidently left the sound on. When I got to the pc room it seemed to me the modem had just reset. Now I believe its the cable company (ISP) doing some morning maintenance reset or some crap. I just wanted to check and see if anyone else has had a similar problem before I call and bitch out the cable company. Anyway... Anyone else having the same problem or any ideas on how to confirm/fix something?</div></div><hr />

That would disconnect your EQ session.</div></div><hr />
