<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Get a better UI. I use Cosmos myself. Having an extra 12 mouse clickable buttons avalible all the time (and Cosmos can be configured to have even more) means that I use more of my abilities. <br />
<br />
The stuff I use regularly are on the main, keyboard accessoable bar--attack, rend, suder armor, charge, thunder clap, hamstring, demoralizing shout, sheild bash (!@#$% casters), overwhelm, battle shout, gun and potions.<br />
<br />
Then on the extra bar I have my &quot;Oh Shit!&quot; buttons--cleave, taunting blow, shield wall, bandages, canabalize (which I never remembered to use before I got cosmos, it was a pain, and occasinally dangerous to use) etc. <br />
<br />
Heroic Strike and Slam have fallen off the tool bars...<br />
<br />
It also runs timers on buffs, so you can see, and plan for battle shout to fade. <br />
<br />
2) First Aid. stacks with poitions, is a Heal Over Time--so you can fire it very early in a fight. Also firsts aid requires NO materials other than bandages, so you can make more in the field, as you go. Also a stack of bandages is 20, not 5.<br />
<br />
A freebie for the undead: Eat your kills. The cool down on canabalize is a mere 2 minutes--so between every 2 and 3 fights you can munch down on your humaniod victims. I find that my cooking is 7 because I am always eating my kills. <br />
<br />
Beside what better fate can there be for the Scarlet Brotherhood?</div></div><hr />

And fun too, hehehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sucks shit when you're not fighting humanoids.<br />
<br />
I'll take 150 cooking over remembering to click cannabalize.</div></div><hr />

Did something change?  Last I checked, when you got hit while a bandage was going the healing dropped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Haass that is one of the things worring me a little bit. The other is that 100% bonus to health regen wont do the trick with warrior  HP at high level.<br />
<br />
I can see buying stacks of wolf meat just for the skill ups.<br />
<br />
And with Cosmos (or any of the other UIs afik) you don't have to remember as a button can be there, on your second bar.<br />
<br />
Kaesorn<br />
<br />
I had not noticed that it gets interrupted. It has an animation like drinking a poition, but I seem to recall seeing the healing red crosses even while having 2 yeti beat on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But first aid is a HUGE help in soloing, be sure to train in it asap!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go fishing.  Fishing and cooking go hand in hand.  Skilled up to 150 cooking in just a couple hours of fishing.  It's the easiest way should your cooking fall behind your level (IE : can only make charred wolf meat and not fighting wolves anymore).<br />
<br />
Oh, and cooking &gt; first aid.  Tho both are helpful.  Gotta have something to do with all the cloth your tailor doesn't need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooh good call! Thanks Haass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of today, it appears that first aid has changed.<br />
<br />
You used to have to channel the bandage, but I can bandage while running now, so that clearly is different.  Whether it's intended or not, I do not know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only linen bandages need to be channeled.  Everything else higher than that doesn't require channeling.<br />
<br />
Maybe it has something to do with your first aid skill too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cooking, fishing, and first aid are skills that every warrior should know.  The stat food from cooking is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, regardless of the channeling, any damage taken will still counteract the effects of the bandage.<br />
<br />
So no free HoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side note does anyone know where to train FA over 150?  Is it from a book or quest or something?  Can't find any trainers to do it.  Maybe level based?  I'm level 30 right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First aid only works out of combat, as soon as you get the crossed swords in your portrait, healing will stop. Different bandages work differently. I haven't bumped up to wool, but with linen, the regular linen bandages have to be channeled, but the heavy linen bandages don't. Not sure how it works with higher level fabrics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard that the First Aid book is avialable in Stormgaurde (NOT Stormwind). I have only been there once, and died horribly in doing so, so I can't give you any more details on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Expert First aid -- Under Wraps is a book.  Sold in --<br />
<br />
Stromguarde for Alliance.<br />
<br />
Duskwallow Marsh for Horde.<br />
<br />
Or so I'm told.  I only have the expert cookbook atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Haass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How the hell do you manage to channel bandaging through fighting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't.<br />
<br />
And it's not combat that breaks bandaging...well, it might be...but also taking any type of damage will stop the bandage.<br />
<br />
This includes poison, a real annoyance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Through a stun move most of the time as long as it's the only target that is hitting you.  For me it's either a revenge or concussion blow and quickly run away a bit while bandaging works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">12-19-2004, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Through a stun move most of the time as long as it's the only target that is hitting you.

<br />
Unfortunately it won't after next patch - note the &quot;fix&quot; to make all bandages require stationary channelling in the patch notes ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Expert First Aid book is in Stormgarde, and it's easy to get to it.  As a gnome, I slipped through a gap in the wall on my first visit, but you can also go in through the front door.  At the earliest opportunity after entering through the front gate, turn right - if you go straight onwards, you will meet with the Syndicate.  This meeting will likely be brief.  <br />
<br />
Keeping taking right turns (you should now be surrounded by Alliance and not Syndicate) until you see the Prince's house - the vendor with the book, Deneb Walker,  is on your right.  He may be a little obscured by the overgrowth that covers the little building he is in.  He also sells the Mageweave Bandage manual.  Be sure to pick that up.<br />
<br />
The bug fix to the channelling bar is annoying, but I still think the skill is worth the effort.  Hey, we're warriors - we should be used to being the finesse class. ;)<br />
