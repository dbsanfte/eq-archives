I've been lookin @ a Shortblade of Lightning &amp; I'm tempted to buy one (13/19). So would it increase my agro or no? WHat do you guys think? THanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ratio of 13/19 with no proc will not give you better aggro than your current weapons.<br />
<br />
For buyable weapons, all I can think of would be upgrade for you are Blade of Carnage and Scepter of Destruction.</div></div><hr />

People may slam me but if something works for you then do it. Either way you can pass it down to a young warrior friend if it isn't as expected.</div></div><hr />

No one would slam you for suggesting the best bang for the buck aggro weapon in the game. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1  If you are in a raiding guild go after dragon in PoI for CHSD, or other aggro weapon from ssra etc.<br />
<br />
#2  Buy a GSoT (2hb, around 200 - 300pp) and save your money till you can buy a BoC or some better combo.<br />
<br />
In short no a SBoL will totally suck for aggro, but it makes a decent DPS weapon combo.  If you are into LDoN you could work towards a 16/19 dagger with an aggro proc that would be good however around 3500 points it's not going to be quick or easy.  In the short term GSoT should tide you over till you can get a good 1hs option.  I would also go the sword in primary slot since it swings faster if you elect to keep what you have.  I use shadowheart (11/17 no proc) and SoBS for 1hs, and GSoT for aggro.  More often than not i just use the GSoT because it simply works better.  Maybe if I augment the shadowheart it would be a nice combo but for my buck i am sticking with the 2h option.  When your primary is swinging with a 17 delay before haste . . . enrages and DS can eat you up fast.<br />
<br />
i've also thought about getting a WMBS and augmenting it (prob not as good as a augmented GSoT but worth a thought).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*whistle* Just looked up Great Blade of Storms... frickin awesome. Too bad I'll never get it, lmao :) Thanks for all the advice guys, I'll have to tryout my GSoT again. &amp; BTW- which augment from LDoN is the best for agro? Should I just get Anger II &amp; stick it on that sucker ;)? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krorghar</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GBoS is an upgrade too if u got a guild who can do towers. Mine is working perfectly. also in towers it drops stormriders capparace that i must admit it gives more agro with the GBoS than the copper hammer i was using before on secondary. Ur dps suffers but who cares when u MT. That shield rocks (at least for me) boots my AC, resis and stats. The furious bash IV gives many agro, and reduces ripostes since u not dual wielding. Nice adquisition for a MT on the pre elemental lv.</div></div><hr />
