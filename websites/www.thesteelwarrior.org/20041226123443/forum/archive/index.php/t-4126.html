<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Playing a warrior just like most of you, I too have been baffled by their absolute lack of respect for some of their customers or their complaints. I work in marketing myself on a management level and SOE in my opinion probably has one of the worst functioning marketing departements I have ever seen.(I d fire the lot of em).<br />
<br />
Some facts and figures you may find interesting:<br />
<br />
1. When you complain, you are actually doing a company a big favor as this is free market research. You ignore complaints at your perril.<br />
<br />
2. SOE does very poor market research; the feeble excuse for a survey when you logged in a few months back is about all I ve seen; they are woefully out of touch with their customers.<br />
<br />
3. Only 5% of dissatisfied customers ever complain to a company; (seeing the huge number of angry posts all over the internet, this means a lot of people are upset) The rest grin and bear it, but 95% of those that don't complain opt for another product; aka, good luck keeping your player base for EQ 2. <br />
<br />
4. If you attempt to resolve a large portion of customers complaints, you have a chance of retaining about 75% of those customers if you handle it promptly. If you can t handle it promptly, communicating with your dissatisfied customers is very important; (they send Absor to do this, and frankly he has not been a lot of help lately).<br />
<br />
5. In extreme cases dissatisfaction can lead to legal complaints or public protests; this is more or less on the way with the Stand down on november the 18th; that s how bad it is now.<br />
<br />
So why is SOE so complacent? For the simple reason that a lot of their customers are effectively addicted to their product. Many will complain, but will not cancel their accounts due to the amount of time invested and emotional attachement to their character. I m guilty of that too; I still log on, but only to raid generally. <br />
<br />
What will happen is most likely one of two things:<br />
<br />
1) Many of the players who play EQ at the moment will not opt for another SOE product as soon as a good alternative can be found. They may get lucky and carry on generating income from new customers but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
2) If any of the players feel passionate enough about it to force them to take action now before EQ becomes obselete, you basically have only one option. Only by massively and publicly cancelling accounts will this have any significant effect. If this very-hard to organise campaign is successfull, warriors will be very few and far between, making raiding for many guilds very hard and most likely causing EQ to die or making them fix some issues pronto. If SOE is smart, they ll learn from this and try harder in EQ 2, but I doubt they ll fix EQ 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for making this a boring post, but I felt it warranted saying; Seeing people afraid of a ban sometimes makes me wonder too......You are a paying customer and if they have any sense they will try to make you enjoy their product as much as possible. Treating your customers like children is not a good way to keep them. And once I have seen most EQ has to offer (guild is allmost in Time), I will not purchase another SOE product again untill I see significant improvements in customer-oriented marketing; I will advise many to do the same.<br />

<br />
Every business or company in England has a Watchdog or a body to go to protect your customer rights, and to make sure these large companies don't take advantage of you. <br />
<br />
What's the one for Sony? If there is one should we contact them? Is it Trade Discrimination or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually if warriors quit their accounts that means they dont have to do anything, since knights can tank anyway.Just roll an alt and keep bugging them till they fix it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gazarion</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's that hard for a customer relationship point of view and company spokesman to actually give us some useful information of what they have been doing for the past 10 months...<br />
<br />
I mean Absor could easily tell us &quot;we started discussion of melee balancing on the 4th February 2003. Since then we have been discussing issue such as dps, mitigation, aggro, utility, etc.! We haven't come up with a complete set of potential fixes, but we are working hard to have a list of issue that will be addressed. We are not saying that pure melee will get a boost in all those aspect of the game, but we are definetely evaluating some potential fixes that will touch to one or few of those said issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absor is the company spokesman, and he can't even come up with a 1 page statement of any sort, 10 months after they started planning this... We are not asking he give us a detailed plan of what the fix will be, but he could at least discuss what they been doing for the past 10 months. They must have a grid of some sort that is used to compare class in order to keep the balance. It doens't mean they gonna patch the pure melee in all those aspects, it just mean they have evaluted the situation regarding pure melee in those aspects.<br />
<br />
Instead of telling us something like that, he give us the exact same cut and paste statement he has been for the past 4 to 10 months. He is the company spokesman, and he can't even do better than 2 sentence statement....<br />
<br />
So far the only thing we know, is that they consider pure melee dps subpar to caster dps.... well it's only 1 aspect of our problem, we don't even know if they have looked at our other problems based on aggro, mitigation, utility, etc... IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY TELL US WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN EVALUATING.<br />
<br />
Anyone with half a brain that has some basic knowledge of project management and customer support would know that if the only thing you bring to the table after 10 months is a big &quot;Hold on tight, these things take times, we will have a statement soon&quot; would know it would be immediate reason to get fired.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the basic minimum in a 10 month period, the developer should have reevaluated class description, can they at least tell us if Warrior are still suppose to be the king of tanking, or if they plan on having the tanking of boss mob be interchangeable among all the 3 tank class in the game... Absor, can you give us an updated class description page? Knowing that knights are planned to be interchangeable with warrior for everything tanking, would solve a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
What was the reaction of SoE in regards to a paladin and SK tanking quarm and the other phase 5 gods? Is it considered to be a problem or it's something they have planned and are happy about?<br />
<br />
<br />
List of EQ competitor present, coming out soon or in 2004.<br />
