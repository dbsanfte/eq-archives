<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, VI, we get the point. You hate people having an &quot;easy&quot; time of your Complex Zone projects.<br />
<br />
But, good God, this zone is 4 (yes, FOUR) expansions old! Do you think that people REALLY want to spend 7-8 hours on a single day, just to clear to the top of a zone with -mostly- crap quests anyway (most of which would require multiple clearings to get all the items for, anyway)??<br />
<br />
ON TOP of which, CotH is shut down in the zone... (we can't have you bypassing content, now!), all of your hard work &quot;poofs&quot; when you leave the zone (currently broken such that you keep your keys, but who wants to depend on a bug's survival?), and ZONE PATHING blocks advancement from island to island?<br />
<br />
I mean, C'MON! It's bad enough when one guild cockblocks another, but this is the damn zone cockblocking itself! How the hell are we supposed to kill the damn Protector of Sky (Island 2 - Azaracks) when the final flappy-bird is on the damn island with the drakes (Island 7 - Sphinxes)?<br />
<br />
Broken pathing, bugged spawns, and required for so many epics...<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether or not some players feel that the epics related to this zone (Necro, Warrior, Magician, Ranger, Monk...others?) are worthwhile, the question is a matter of the content of the game working like it should.<br />
<br />
Thanks for wasting days of planning, signups, and lots of pp in game as we purchased a grand number of components to support the raid, and logged everyone on extra early on a fucking weekend. I had to go out and kick some kittens to feel better afterwords, and blow a goat herd to get the bad taste out of my mouth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did a Plane of Sky raid with some friends this weekend.  It was a colossal PITA.  Interesting zone, but the fact that CoTH doesnt work makes it really tough for people who arrive late, or aren't able to make it until the second day of the event.  Pathing is a huge problem.  The worst if it, is that the items that drop there are, for the most part, crap by today's standards.  Thanks to my new guild, my gear is better than it's ever been, and it's still pretty junky by today's standards.   Even in my crappy gear, the only thing that comes from Sky that I was really interested in was the Spiroc wingblade.   The zone needs a revamp, plain and simple, it's a huge stumbling block on the way to getting several epics, and that's mainly because nobody wants to go there anymore because the risk/time involved vs. reward is so out of whack.<br />
<br />
PS:  Being forced to suck up that damned many death touches is just wrong too. (multiple spiroc lords, me and the pullers ate God knows how many DT's, and we only got 2 wingblades off the greedy bastard) :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I duno what you talking about but the things that piss me off is that. <br />
<br />
Lunatic assists fucking mobs on the islands and hits for 2k...<br />
Some islands like Keeper of Sorrows has build in timer which is totaly out of whack my raid of 7 ppl had to wait for the fucker to spawn because he is on 90 min timer... Ohhh ya and fucking DTing mobs with fast recycle.<br />
<br />
The items that drop here shouldnt be good anyways because the dificulty is totaly not there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The difficulty is there if you're doing this pre 60 with a small number of people.  (had about 19 people for the first islands, dwindled to about 13 by the end, and had so few for the last spiroc lord fight that he ended up killing everyone but the cleric who /q out of the game).  And aside from some half decent quests and the epics, the drops in sky suck mightily.  My gear is still pretty crappy, and I didn't see anything drop that I'd consider an upgrade, and after checking allakhazam I still didnt see anything in that zone I'd say justifies all the ridiculous amounts of clearing that went into it.  (and petitioning to get mobs with screwed up pathing back to the islands they are supposed to be on so we could kill them)  I'm not saying put 2nd tier PoP loot on the mobs there but honestly, the drops there need to be revamped a little to make it more attractive to people who don't need epic drops from there)<br />
<br />
And you are right, the Lunatic assisting mobs and being that damned powerful is just a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoS - is Kunark/Old World plane. The drops there are better then those from old Fear/Hate its toaly inline with dificulty. Cause the damn plane is very ez. Haste items from there are still very nice and ppl do still go there to do epic which are not that hard to do either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kitre Halfax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the whole fucking problem with this POshit zone, anyway, is that it takes so stupid long to do anything worthwhile, and that's BEFORE you figure in the 2-hour waiting periods (at BEST) for VERANT's lazy, shitty Customer Service to come down, and tell you that they can't fix the damn bird on the wrong island.<br />
<br />
That's a gigantic waste of my time.<br />
<br />
Revamp the zone, and be done with it. Make it something fun to be attempting. Not a pain. We don't play for pain. We suffer pain for marginal rewards for people we care for.<br />
<br />
Screw this crap, fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If it weren't for the epic bits I doubt I would ever go there again. Ever. Happily.<br />
<br />
Going up to island 7 tonight. Guild has a cleric and necro perma camped on 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Deathtouching, essence emeralds, crapy items shit like that happens.<br />
<br />
But I swear to god, if  I ever get my hands on the guy that thought it would be a good idea to have a giant bixie spawn from a wasps corpse and then rape people...<br />
<br />
Lets just say its not going to be fun~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, first time I met that Bixie I got to die 3 times the first fight, and 4 on the second when we managed to get CR done fast enough that she didnt despawn, and we still lost. After that I swore to never cross Kithicor again in the Daylight, give me the evil undead anytime.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I agree poS is a giant PITA but its also a lot of fun first learning the zone and all the tricks involved, when your all in the mid 50's range. Now its just boring aggravation. And worst part is the Alliance has a raid planned for tomorrow for mage crowns. We do have a bridge there now but I spent 4 days once clearing that Island, and getting 10 mage crowns. I really hoped that would be the end of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I hate this zone with a burning passion so deep that Innoruuk would be frightened of me.  My first big raid on this circle of hell (it HAS to be one of the circles of hell from Dante's Inferno!!) lasted 4 agonizing days...  <br />
<br />
The number of deathtouches that were taken was sickening.  (My guild was just learning the zone, there were a lot of them taken..)  The number of late comers or people pushed off the island meant that we had to fire up the twink wiz to port the peeps up and have them killed and corpse coth'd ground things to a very slow crawl...  I shiver at the thought of having to CR all the way up to bee island, thank Tunare I kept my bot cleric camped out on whatever island the raid was on at the moment...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried sky for some epic drops 2 days ago, got to second island but wow no mob in range so we could go on *growl* needed a silver disc for my nec epic but 2 trips up and i never got one :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">my first trip up, we started on Friday night, logged on pegasus Isle, started again late Saturday afternoon, went to Spirocs and killed the Lord enough for 7 Wingblades (23 deaths for me... was at the point that people were /randoming for the chance to take the DTs, and some were worried that with the deaths they took, even being clicked in, they were going to lose level 46), then we went to the elemental crown Isle on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Coffins, coffins, coffins. Thats the only way for more than 24 people or late comers to play. (heh heard about a guild that was trying to take some deaths for summons, so they attacked Sirran... and killed him :p)<br />
<br />
Everytime my guild goes, its for an extended trip and I hope to the Gods they never need me up there again...</div></div><hr />
