<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends.  It would have to be a pretty substantial HP/AC upgrade for me to ditch any shielding since I'm not capped.  Some folks around here are over the cap so they can afford to give up a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh im far from capped. <br />

i had planned out all my shielding upgrades so for most slots i dont plan to upgrade yet once i have them. the only thing which prompted me to think about this was the fact that i picked up by chance a +2% shielding earring to replace my time phase 1 one, although stats are about the same. at some time in future though that slot will probably be upgraded. i was looking at the frozen feratha eye as an option, 26ac 235 hps. but not sure if 11ac and 80 odd hps beats 2% shielding.<br />
<br />
(if say and completely off the top of my head 2% shielding is the equivalent of  about 50 ac worth of mitigation, at a formula of say 1ac = 5hps, thats about 250hp.  the 11ac 80 hps would be equivalent to 135 hps, so 2% shielding would still be viable).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Earhoop of the Eighteen Eyes (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68959) <br />
Silver Hoop of Speed (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7123) <br />
Prism of Dark Hues (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68847) <br />
Stud of Focused Aptitude (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47236)<br />
<br />
you're right, you would need a certain amount of ac/hp to replace the shielding with to justify it.  exact number wise, not sure, but a 20+ ac, 70-100hp raw upgrade would probably be enough.  Especially if you pick up earhoop or stud, which are far better with their avoidance figured in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I farmed it with a Dru/Shaman/Bst Tank.   the mobs a caster so odds are you dont even need a slow as a warrior.<br />
<br />
It can pop a Caster PH, or a Kyv PH though.  And those can be a bit dicier.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised to see this valued to highly.  None of the Tanks (War-Knights) ever bother putting a minor in on it ((similiar to a 1/2-1/3 normal dkp type)) when we get them on raids.<br />
<br />
Usually tends to go to new members/casters who have a crap ear to replace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shielding % = 40 HP is a low but reasonable estimation, reasoning being stuff that can really kill you tends to have DB in the 1000 range, and you should take 4 hits before you die (if not you shouldn't be tanking it in the first place), so you get 40 HPs for each shielding.  The actual savings of shielding is DB X % X # of hits you expected to take on the given mob before you die and it varies a lot depending on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunner</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have an actual &quot;Hits&quot; formula for how the mob damage is calculated?<br />
<br />
Seems to me if Shielding is a percent, then you cant assign it a hp number.  But i think shielding is not a percent its an actual number just taken from the mobs damage bonus or somthing.<br />
<br />
Im sure its a crazy formula because u have to account for ATK vs AC, as well as mitigation AA, and shielding.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I think its worth it to max out Shielding.  Mobs are only gonna hit harder and harder in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes &amp; No.<br />
<br />
No because, while most mobs have a different DI , overall you can see an tendency.<br />
Most bosses have a 1500+ Min hit, which makes shielding<br />
<br />
Yes because, Shielding is useless on XP for example with 200ish min hit<br />
Shielding isnt that great with bosses that min for under 600ish.<br />
<br />
So you give out  a 1000 min hit for your &quot;average raid boss&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
My goal is to stay around 30%, to go above i would have to sacrifice extra stats.<br />
As for HP vs Shielding vs AC its all on a case per case basis.<br />
<br />
100Hp will make you die less often (one or two-round)<br />
1% Shielding will make you take less DPS (thus require less total mana to heal)<br />
<br />
While the exact formula is indeed a nightmare, i'd say (at least for me in OOW)<br />
2 % Shielding &lt; 55hp &lt; 20 ac   (thats considering i'm at 25-30%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-21-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well basically to figure out what shielding is worth, you get:<br />
<br />
DB X shielding % X average number of hits you expect to take before you die.<br />
<br />
1000 and 4 is a reasonable estimate on most bosses.  Shielding is still useful on trash because although their DB is lower they also need a lot more hits to kill you.  However it's a lot harder to estimate how many hits you're expected to take when it's greater than 4.</div></div><hr />
