<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kjede</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is dual wielding a good idea as a warrior? I was sort of fooling around with the idea of doing this, but I'm not too sure if it would work. I don't plan to be a warrior with a shield and a one handed sword at all...as I have done that in many other games like this and it just isn't all that great being a blockbot at higher levels. (DAOC).....Anyway, being a two-handed axe user now, I find that my warrior works very well, and I have an idea of where I want to go with my talents. So, is dual wielding actually a good idea, or would it just not work out? If it would work, what weapons should be used? Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why wouldn't you want to pickup 2 good one handers and DW them? Its not like it actaully takes any talent points to dual wield. I DW when soloing (or not the main tank in an instance) because of the better DPS. Usually in Berzerker stance for the pummel. <br />
<br />
Its not like you get married to any particular style of combat--even if specced in 1h or 2h or what have you, you aren't locked out of any other style. <br />
<br />
I myself like DWing. Its handy when kill rate is more important than damage taken. Its another option avalible to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">because of the better DPS<br />
<br />
Are you certain duel wield is better DPS than 2handers?  I ask because if you follow the skill tree in arms, there is a specialization for 2handed weapons and then for a particular style, maces, axes, swords and so on.  It seems that the 2handers for DPS are a better choice once you combine the available enhancements and then factor in things like heroic blow.  And my reading over on the blizzard board seems to indicate this is also true.  But I'd like to know why duel wield is thought to be higher DPS, because so far I haven't seen it and I'd hate to miss something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on the dps level of your weaps.  For a while there I had 2 20+ dps weapons so I used dual wield a lot.  After I got my big Axe I'm 2h most of the time.  The offhand misses soooo much and hits for 1/2 dmg, thats the drawback.  It does not seem to build rage any faster than a 2h weap dishing out comperable dps.  What it does seem to do is make your rage gen more steady or predictable.<br />
<br />
It looks like they've made great efforts to make all 3 opitions viable.  A lot of folks hate DW just cause of the miss rate.  Frankly the miss rate is no worse than it was in EQ but it sure bothers some folks =\  I use all 3 weapon set ups depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
After all, we're the masters of melee [sic] so we should be comfy with any weapon we can get our hands on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you go the arms path, once you get sweeping strike, which causes your next four hits on your target to land on his nearest friend,  and combine that with cleave, it seems that you want the biggest hits you can get, rather than a lot of hits but for small amounts of damage.<br />
<br />
More than once I've lived when an add wandered up by firing off sweeping strike and following up with cleaves.  By the time the first mob is done, often times the second is down a significant amount as well.  I just don't think it would work as well using duel wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesnt Glat.  Duel wield is pretty decent now for MS build because it does build rage up pretty fast.  I am axe speced also so my crit % is up to around 13% atm.  Duel wielding axes will allow you to crit very often.  Since rage generation is based on damage, you get huge chunks of rage when you crit.<br />
<br />
I crit about 40% more when duel wield than when I use a 2 hander.  Against low lvl mobs, I jsut utterly destroy them.  Also duel wield pops overpower up a lot too.  Overpower pops up about 3 times MORE than when I use a 2 hander.  That is 5 rage for a 64% crit chance (with improved overpower), which adds up to a lot of damage fast.<br />
<br />
Everytime I crit, it is added with impale and deep wounds.  The only downside of duel wield is against mobs higher lvl than you.  Fighting mobs +2 to +4 makes it very hard to hit them.  A good side effect for duel wield against red mobs is that overpower lights up a LOT when you face them.  I would duel wield till overpower lit up, equip a slow 2 hander, and the overpower them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dual wield sucks a lot if your offhander is not excellent. if you're using a 20 DPS mainhand and expect good results by tacking on some random 11 DPS green weapon that drops off trash in the stockades, you probably won't be pleased. not only is the strength bonus for offhand weapons MUCH lower than mainhand, your accuracy overall drops when you dual wield. so it can be expensive to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience DW owns 2h dps. I've used 35.5 dps Hellslayer with +5 dmg enchant and DW'ed two 26.6 dps one handers of the same lvl required and the damage I output is much higher DW. Sure you miss alot more but you Crit much much more with the right Crit talents and gear you do way more dps and you get the added stats of the second weapon. I've also had more rage generation at critical times DW. I still keep Hellslayer for those times when I want to run around Ironforge with a big F-in axe and look uber :) I'm lvl 37 atm and I'm very much looking forward to my mount and plate armors at 40 I also have a 31.7 dps 1h Sword waiting at lvl 42 so.... WoW life is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xvenator</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally dual wield when tanking for a group because of the fast rage generation(also have Unbridled Wrath 5).   On 1-3 mobs pulls Sword and Shield just doesn't generate rage fast enough for me.    I swap in a shield for when pulls are 4 or more mobs(use a macro for quick switching) and for Boss Elite mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There shouldn't be any need for stuff like 'from my experience X has more DPS than Y...' because the DPS of DW and 2H are very clearly displayed ignoring attacks that ignore weapon speed (Slam/MS, and both would just favor 2H more).  You have to multiply the DW DPS by the DW miss penalty (heard people quote 24%) to get the accurate comparison, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That the same display that shows my offhand dps when I have a 2h or shield equip? The one in the char info screen i mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get Cosmos. It displays DPS if you want. You can get a very good feel for it.  Assuming you have a quality set up DW does significantly more damage. Between 30% and 50% more. DW + beserker + pummel owns caster mobs. <br />
<br />
IMHO, good warriors will use all 3 weapon set ups (1h + shield, 2h and dw) and all 3 stances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've added the beserker/pummel to my tool box against casters and I have to admit it does work very well.  However, since I've specialized in 2handed weapons from the arms path and added specialization in axes on top of that, combined with what is still a pretty respectable axe at level 48, I'm clearly seeing that 2handed weapons are doing more damage.  Particularly if there is two mobs involved and I start firing off sweeping strikes and cleaves.</div></div><hr />
