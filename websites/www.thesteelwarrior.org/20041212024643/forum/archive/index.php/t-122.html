<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leen Bloodsmith</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hi all i am leen 65 warrior with 69 aa points and one of the MA's for scarlet underground on terris thule server my current max hp is 7690 ac 1336 <br />
<br />
 can someone clarify the riposte dmg ratio a bit...seems every time i ask someone about it i get conflicting answers im no noob been playing warrior class since may of 99 (i hate black burrow)<br />
<br />
 seems to me unless you have a 2handed slasher with a hate proc its harder to get and maintain agro when i use my skybreaker and red epic in off hand i get and keep agro better but i do take a lot of riposte dmg and enrage damn near kills me if i look away from screen for just a sec (lol)<br />
<br />
 im not the best equipped warrior but i know my class well .takatok our guild leader brought up a interesting point about other people and there proximity to the current target and his ability to maintain agro and ive noticed that if im in x mobs face and x shammy cast his taunt (slow) on the mob if he isnt as close as i am he doesnt get &quot;as much&quot; agro and i can usually get agro back ...but then some SK decides to hit auto attack and head to the refrigerator and mob is pushed into his direction x mob decides he is next on the hate list............<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 tell me whatcha think ....flames are appreciated hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh as the guild MA it is your responsibility to keep and get agro... leave healing up to the healers.  If you are MAing with 7700hps, no offense, but I don't think you guys are taking down mobs that hit for 2k... the situations discussed with reposte are dealing with incredibly high dps mobs.  Do whatever works for you and your guild.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also, proximity definately has an effect on agro (sorry its 6:00 am, way too tired to be reading hehe)... so just have your melees stand at max melee range and you get as close as you can, similar to how you would treat a rooted mob in an exp group.  I cannot confirm that this has any effect, but it sure seems to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">seems to me like you guys could try xenamech and maybe get yourself a hammer with a nice taunt weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The amount of riposte damage you take is purely a function of how fast you can swing.  Generally speaking DW produces at least 3 times as much riposte compare to 2H, though some PoP 2H are pretty fast and thus the gain isn't as significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noomsy</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some 2handers that you can probably get that hold aggro fairly well. Vyemm's is one, and actually the Dain axe isnt bad for aggro either. Main thing is you need a proc that helps keep aggro since you are most likely defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FarlanderB</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer 2hand aggro over 1hand aggro in experience groups and my 2hander does not have a proc. Back after that patch that changed burst aggro, 2handers were GREAT aggro tools - getting 300+ crits at the start of the fight was equivalent to my hammer (hammer off Xenamec) going off. Since that's been fixed, though, I still like the 2handers for the lack of ripostes, though, especially in pick up groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">XP mobs don't enrage as much and they fixed the ripostes to tone them down a bit.<br />
<br />
Dual Wielding is certainly just as viable as it used to be now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since they toned down the riposte on PoP mobs, i cant stand 2 handers anymore, i dont take the rip damage i used to, and my dual weilders own my 2 hander for aggro, so its no question, if youve got the aggro 1 handers use em.  Rip damage isnt really a concern till your Teir3+, and then, sometimes, it still dont matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used it for the longest to Raid Tank, Exp Tank..<br />
<br />
Proc Rate is Nice, and the extra to just pure hate is really good too.<br />
<br />
Yes I could lose agro to stupidity a lot (casters Sitting, Rangers Snaring too early, Necro going Hey Watch this.)<br />
<br />
But more times than not I am very satisfied with the Jagged Blade of War.</div></div><hr />
