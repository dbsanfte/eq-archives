<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabon Ssteel</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoD sucks because <br />
<br />
GL aas are stupid just GL gets xps and if he has just if he is GL you get benefits ...while thoose aas are nice the system to get them is Bullshit <br />
<br />
Generally GoD aas have a high cost are totally unbalanced in the cost lvls they have and are mostly useless just a few good ones for Beastlords and so on (ie the already good classes)<br />
<br />
GoD design is Bullshit Mobs hit for insane ammounts of damage and have crap procs who add to dps / while having the chance to resist meele damage on some mobs (i didn find some yet) but some seem to have a higher evasion rate .<br />
<br />
Tribut system is another crap system to get your money ...but if your high lvl you gotta have thoose 150 hps ac and so on wich bothers me .<br />
<br />
Casino is a nice way for Money sink too and it has dimnishing returns (ie like nothing)<br />
<br />
the only good thing with this new expansion is the new loot introduced into the game (if you can get it) because everything kills you in a sec and if your a Warrior like me ... All in all for me i start as newbie again ...need a complet new set of weapons because theres meele resistances need like 5 k hps more because god needs you to ...and all in all its Feeling like a newbie again in GoD ...with all the unresistable 550 dds from the low lvl zones who fire like mad of mobs .<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ lost alot of his charm this expansion is the worst to me ever released.Because a bunch of Mongoloid Halfapes must have programmed the aas and the new stuff aviable ...EQ starts Feeling like work to keep up tribute and equipment and maybe being able to gain some GL xps too.<br />
<br />
Which lets me hope for WoW EQ is about to wear out to me after playing it for 5 years i wonder how long it will keep my attention if it continous like this.<br />
<br />
I Wonder if some feel like me about this expansion.</div></div><hr />

I haven't been this nervous going from one zone to another since Kunark. Last night I spent 2 hours doing a CR with the guild. I remembered how much I hated it, but it also went to show how spoiled we've become with PoP and LDoN. I've got no love for people who complain about GY timers and corpse dumping after adventures. The game is a challenge again. For alittle while anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL.<br />
<br />
Sorry, that just makes me chuckle. Not at you, but at the entire playerbase. Spoiled? By what? By the DESIGN decisions made by the people who created graveyards and PoK books?<br />
<br />
They put these things into the game.<br />
<br />
Now they're taking them away. Just you wait ... three months from now when you're on CR #5,617, you're going to LOATHE this expansion. Vex Thal? That was fun the first two times I cleared it. How you all like VT now? Backflagging? Yeah, that was ok the first five times I backflagged someone. How you digging going back to kill Keeper of Sorrows NOW?<br />
<br />
You'll hate not having a graveyard. Oh, yes, you all will. Mark my words.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm flagged through Kod'Taz,&quot;<br />
<br />
That means absolutely nothing to me right now. (Not being flip, being serious ... I have no clue what you just said). What's Kod'Taz? What flags are needed in this expansion? There's flags? What the?</div></div><hr />

I like it.  It means there's not a shitload of lag caused by 123523 AFK people standing around the expedition guy and the entrance like there is in the LDON camps.</div></div><hr />

i dont call this challenge, its still the same old boring mobs they just kill you in half the time. They drop some better loot if you can kill / find the nameds.And the Procs are gonna make you cry why you just got 1850 ac and not 500 to all resists too.The meele resistances and evasion rates makes you think if SoE got something vs Meele classes and if you should just make a Wizzard ..actually all meeles should make Casters since meeles get fucked all the time.Let thoose Chanters tank while the pallys keep the mobs perma stunned and its all good for xps .Btw did i mention my inability to taunt a mob in under 3 taunts each .on Low lvls now i know why we get 50% more procs actually i can just throw my taunt button outta window now it never works if you need it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I've only spent a little time on the first day there exploring.  Ive listened to guildies and watched over my GF's shoulder while she did an expedition.<br />
<br />
First impressions weren't great.  Boats were a cool idea in the original EQ, but now Im spoilt and just can't be bothered.  the 20mins of nostalgia I experienced because my GF was on the boat and it started moving when I was about halfway from the magus to the dock so I had to wait for the next one really took me back to the days of waiting 15mins for the boat then going for a piss and coming back and having missed it.  Just put a PoK book on the boat already.<br />
<br />
I don't mind running 3 zones to get to the expeditions and the expeditions themselves look really cool.  The thing I dont like about it is that the zones between become maidens-eye-esque train stations as high end people run to thier adventures and raids while other players sit in these zones trying to XP and getting squashed.<br />
<br />
Add to it that a warrior running through without invis or SoW is gonna get owned by those as fast as run 3 agro roamers that hit unpleasantly hard.  The run through CS and WW to get to ToV was fun - sucked that you needed to get a port first, but still a fun trip.  The run to Sebilis was good in a 'it keeps the retards out' sense, but otherwise nothing special.  Running through shit thats gonna own you if you invis drops and theres nothing you can do about it isnt so much fun, and the 'it keeps the retards out' aspect is kinda lost when you are heading to an instanced zone anyway.<br />
<br />
PoP introduced some cool things for raiding.  Central access to raid zones, graveyards so you didnt need coffins etc.  This expansion in contrast seems a step backwards to me.  Having a difficult run to get to your raid zone was something that made racing other guilds for a spawn fun, but kinda redundant when your heading to an instanced raid zone.<br />
<br />
Too early really for me to be decided whether I think its gonna be a good or bad expansion, and maybe we've all been spoilt by PoP, but I prefer the challenge to be knocking over the boss mob, not moving 50 people across 3 zones of agro shit and training the hell out of all the XPers for an hour while you do so.</div></div><hr />

They should have just made everyone neutral and just had people randomly die as they cross the zones.</div></div><hr />

A fast horse/Clicky invis item is enough to get you where you are going, allthough obviously mostly raid guild warriors have that kind of money to spend. <br />
<br />
I agree though that it would have been nice to add some reasonably easily accessible zones geared at people with lower end equipment, so that at least they get more out of the expansion than more AA and bazaar drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you know what invi potion are? Cobalt legs? Incarnadine BP?<br />
And btw, usually when you CR that's when you were with a group, ever thought about doing something like....working with your group to CR (you know like waiting at the zone line to invi etc...)? And if by bad luck you end dieing when you're alone, it's not really like the zone were deserted, it is easy to CR almost anywhere in the first few zones.<br />
<br />
No offense but you just sound like a pussy sir like many other people here bitching about GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well try running invis through Ferubi on a C/R to get your body.  Invis is seen by the roamers and they are unavoidable so potions and invis spells won't help there at all.  I even heard that they see through rogue sos but obviously I don't know first hand since I am a warrior.  Getting around in Natimbi and the next zone is pretty easy if you avoid the undead and archer things.<br />
<br />
That being said, I absolutely love how as you go deeper in the difficulty goes up.  I hated how easy PoP made travel and I think it seriously degraded the game when those books went in.  This expansion is high risk high reward fun IMO and so far I am happy with everything except the fact that 500 hp costs 60 AA points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and if you happen to die while traveling or whatever, you are now out of the loop.  All of your invis is now sitting on your corpse.  Oh but you can run back to one of the well known bankers and vendors and buy an invis potion but by the time you've done that people with inniate invis are back at the corspes.  Its faster to wait for people with invis do it than have you run around and do it yourself for an invis that is just likely to drop at a bad spot than anywhere else.<br />

Yeah...Discord is a challenge for sure.</div></div><hr />

I don't carry invis potion since I have incardine but it'd be very hard to reinvis yourself even if it was instant just because there's so much mobs around.  <br />
<br />
Is it a challenge to run through an area hoping your invis wouldn't drop?  I think not.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if there have a quest item for improved invis that only works in GoD (say after you rescue all the scouts, they give you some item to help you scout better!).  I see plenty of classes with far superior stealth abiltiies than a warrior die in GoD everyday and it's not because they all suck.  It is really quite difficult to get around in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to do it on my necro with the Circlet...you can redo invis on the fly no problem, even if you're getting up from FD if you're fast enough.  It just requires you to go back to fucking potions tho instead of Cobalt/Incarn/GVD, and that's fuckin lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, it just sounds like you suck then if you spend more time doing CR than actually doing trials or whatever, and btw, I never said there was any challange in going from point A to point B but don't bitch about having to run to your corpse from time to time, it's not THAT annoying. People who say GoD suck because of such trivial things just sickens me.<br />
<br />
Yeah...Discord is a challenge for sure. <br />

So, for you GoD is just a neverending CR? It sounds like you havn't even tried the actual content and you emit an opinion on what you don't even know?</div></div><hr />

<br />
some mobs might hit too hard really, but its not that much of a problem if you know what youre doing.<br />
The resists.. well, mobs that are resistant to certain spell types have been in game since beta, and you complain theres some stuff immune to some weapons? In many RPGs I know, stuff like all skeletons is completly immune to piercing and archery. It does make some sense and it isnt too bad really<br />
<br />
You'll hate not having a graveyard. Oh, yes, you all will. Mark my words. <br />
<br />
Some people really sound like they started with PoP.<br />
When I was a little 52 warrior, traveling to Sebilis w/o SoW for exp was a risk in itself already, and you cry about having to cross &quot;wall to wall&quot; kos mobs zones for a short distance with run3-5.</div></div><hr />

And some people like to forget how FREAKIN annoying it is to WIPEOUT in the Hole at 4 a.m., needing to track down a necromancer ... or forget how god awful it used to be to have to BUY ports ... or forget how annoying it can be to spend 45 minutes getting from point a to point b, because you JUST missed the boats.<br />
<br />
I didn't start with PoP. I just LOATHED those annoying things about the game that PoP FIXED.<br />
<br />
But all of you rose-colored glasses wearing FREAKS pined and pined and pined on the message boards about how you MISS those days. So the devs are bringing them back.<br />
<br />
But that's ok. Cause you WILL wipe out deep in Gates ... at 4 a.m. ... with your necro logged ... and it'll be 6 a.m. before you all recover. And THEN there'll be a DIFFERENT KIND of post on the Outhouse. It'll be about how much you hate the CRs and how you MISS the graveyards.<br />
<br />
Mark ... my ... words. You'll learn to hate those things you pined for. The devs, meanwhile, will get a chuckle out of this behavioral experiement.</div></div><hr />

...with all the unresistable 550 dds from the low lvl zones who fire like mad of mobs. <br />
<br />
Are you talking about Chaos Claw?  My resists are no where near fantisctic but I resisted over 1/2 the attepted proc of it while fighting from natimbi up to Bardiui(sp).  I like GoD so far.  I have been on any of the adventures or raids but it does keep you on your toes when you find that new mob.  I nearly crapped my self the first time I ran into an archer and he resisted snare and was on me in 0.4 seconds 8D.<br />
<br />
The thing I dont like is the level range of the mobs in Natimbi.  Green to DB at 65 is kind of umm..Ghey.  I plan on trying to see how deep I can get this next weekend after guild gets done raiding, and cant wait to see what I find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't expect to resist very many if any of the Chaos Claws proced by higher level mobs with low resists.  At 430 MR I only resist Trample (MR -150) about 80% of the time from the level 64-66+ horsies in Kod'taz, and it's much, much worse on Chaos Claws (Chromatic -150) since my lowest resist is only 231.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHA.... You've been to Kod'Taz yet? I hope you were talking about there and not the inital zones. Strolling through Barindu about as dangerous as POK compared to it. :D <br />

I would be the first to cheer if they put a bank and a potion vendor close to Natimbi or Nedaria but as I said, it's 5 minutes of running nothing that will kill you.</div></div><hr />

I didn't start with PoP. I just LOATHED those annoying things about the game that PoP FIXED.<br />
<br />
But all of you rose-colored glasses wearing FREAKS pined and pined and pined on the message boards about how you MISS those days. So the devs are bringing them back.<br />
<br />
But that's ok. Cause you WILL wipe out deep in Gates ... at 4 a.m. ... with your necro logged ... and it'll be 6 a.m. before you all recover. And THEN there'll be a DIFFERENT KIND of post on the Outhouse. It'll be about how much you hate the CRs and how you MISS the graveyards.<br />
<br />
Mark ... my ... words. You'll learn to hate those things you pined for. The devs, meanwhile, will get a chuckle out of this behavioral experiement.  <br />
<br />
I'm not marking your words, I never wiped in hole at 4 am or anything equally stupid that late at night, because we werent gimps to start with.<br />
<br />
You claim that GYs and Pok FIXED EQ? There's no need to say more about your opinion. it's gimp.<br />

To each his own.  I personally think the graveyards in PoP did more harm then good.  Natural selection should have kept people out of PoP zones until they were ready instead of flagging requirments .</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's bullshit Trondir. You've wiped in EQ. Maybe not at 4 a.m. but if you play the game, and LIKE a challenge (as you seem to imply with your stupid post), you've had to have FAILED at the challenge once or twice.<br />
<br />
So shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
OR ... you never tried anything challenging, and thus never had to worry about failure. Which, then, your point about graveyards and pok books wouldn't apply.<br />
<br />
&quot;You claim that GYs and Pok FIXED EQ? There's no need to say more about your opinion. it's gimp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please. Read what I say. I'm saying those things helped make the EQ playing experience better. Less walking, MORE PLAYING. Less time recovering bodies, more time PLAYING.<br />
<br />
That you dispute that just shows how arrogant you actually are. The simple fact of the matter is ... even back in the way and early days, the travel time wasn't as hard on people because the world was 10 times FUCKING SMALLER than it is today.<br />
<br />
PoK books cut travel time down and increase actual play time. That's all they do. The bad players can and will continue to play this game. That you think travel time separates them from anything is just plain blind stupidity on your part. <br />
<br />
Walk from Great Divide to Nedaria's Landing (backwards, while encumbered), or shut the fuck up about it all.</div></div><hr />

I have seen some amazing CR's in the brief time GoD has been out. Probably the best was last night when me, ranger and mage wiped. All that was left was cleric, druid and enchanter. We were fairly deep in vxed and the enchanter was mezzing and charming and clearing the way to corpses heh<br />
<br />
the 2nd was in the sewers when only the ench and mage survived and the enchanter was mezing/mem bluring mobs to a safe spot while the mage dragged and CoH'd the cleric for rez's<br />

While dying sucks, it happens and instead of just giving up for 30minutes, having your group try and salvage what's left is alot of fun. Plus, it keeps the momo's out of the zones that want the easy route.<br />

<br />
you call me arrogant? I am a fucking huge elitist prick. This expansion isnt for little boys, its for the big boys that killed quarm over and over and over again and got tired of LDoN and Time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So seriously, everything you say on this particular subject is tainted by the arrogance and bullshit that comes from you actually using the books, but then turning around and calling people who liked shortened travel times &quot;gimp.&quot;<br />
<br />
What made Everquest FUN and CHALLENGING, no matter WHAT EXPANSION you are playing never had anything to do with corpse recovery or travel time. <br />
<br />
It has ALWAYS been: Getting together with your friends and killing stuff.<br />
<br />
The long travel times and the corpse recovery times are obstacles that get in the way of the fun. They are annoyances, NOT CHALLENGES. That you think they're challenges demonstrates your inability to form coherent thought when someone bothers to disagree with you.<br />
<br />
&quot;if you are too weak for GoD and follow raid progression properly. Clear Time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking of WEAK ... that's what that argument is. A couple of months ago, it was &quot;You're not even elemental flagged yet. So shut the fuck up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it's &quot;Clear time or shut the fuck up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grow up and get a new insult. Your PROGRESSION insults only last SO LONG. I've been through original eq. The planes. Kunark. Velious. Luclin. And now I'm getting close to being done PoP. Get over it.

<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
Oh right, you're a hypocrite.<br />
<br />
Here, I leave you with these words from Mobhunter:<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a big discussion on corpse recovery tools in GoD, something that seems to be lacking. While some painful pompous clerics (me) are making a lot of noise asking for more graveyards in old world zones as well as GoD, some still feel that a game without pain is no game at all. Challenge shouldn't be based on a two hour corpse recovery. Challenge should be based on the direct difficulty of an encounter. To say there is no challenge in Planes of Power or Lost Dungeons of Norrath is a lie. <br />
<br />
There is already a new GoD map pack available for the Gates of Discord zones from our friends at EQ Toolbox. Though they are spoilers, these maps are especially useful for those hideous two hour corpse recoveries caused from a lack of graveyards (hint hint). <br />
<br />
The difficulty level of GoD has been scaled very high. Mobs in the instanced dungeons are giving people a hard time, hitting for over 1k and attacking in packs. There are reports of a wandering Queen beast in the first hostile zone of the new expansion. Naked adventures run towards her with arms wide, embracing the thought of being struck down so violently by so mighty a beast like some strange Hale Bop cult. <br />
<br />
The new city has everything a body needs. There are new trade vendors, a bank, and even someone selling invis potions for three plat each. This makes those painful two hour non-graveyard corpse recoveries a bit easier (hint hint). Unfortunately the only way to get to the city is by shuttle even though you can get to the rest of the world with a Wayfarer Magus port. I have a feeling the city will empty pretty quick when people find out it is still faster to do business in Plane of Knowledge and use the Wayfarers to transport to Natimbi.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, I'm sure you'll find more ways to crack on me, my gear, or my progression (which is beyond RZ, asshat, so if you're going to crack on me at least get your shit correct).</div></div><hr />

I don't miss GYs (and I am writing this while CRing in Vxed) because their absence will keep people like YOU out of GoD. <br />

You obviously didnt play the original game.  Everyone was gimp back then...and everyone wiped late at night somewhere at somepoint.  My personal favorite was Inny version 1.0 at 4am on a weeknight. Or split paw v2.0 circa lvl 30 wiping to snakes &amp; crap deep as hell and begging necro for summons.  The old world wasnt all the fun it was cracked out to be.  However, people DID know how to play their class back then.  And not everything was about massive egos.<br />
<br />
I like GoD though.   Kinda fun having stuff hit you hard as hell.  Also kinda nice that people dont screw around in a group (I have always been a fan of good class mechnics).  PoP exp just lets people get away with so many bad habits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can walk to places much safer than Trondir ever could. And do so NAKED. So it's not that I feel like I don't have ACCESS to this crap. It's just an annoyance. Something that doesn't accentuate the gameplay. It hinders the gameplay.<br />
<br />
Coming from the people that give level 1 newbies a BAG, 20 muffins, 20 milk, 20 bandages, start you off right in front of your guildmaster, let you keep your gear on death until level 10, and start you off with 5 skill points in your primary weapon ... JUST ON CHARACTER CREATION ...<br />
<br />
Yeah, I find it stupid that they'd REGRESS their design intent with this expansion.<br />
<br />
Bluster all you want about how &quot;challenging&quot; the content is. That has nothing to do with having to walk from place to place. That has nothing to do with corpse recoveries. And since this content is challenging, even SUPER-men like Trondir are going to die. And die frequently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't spent a lot of time in GoD yet, just a couple hrs but I do confess I like the idea of places that a_random_retard can't get to or will die hard and fast before they can mess with someone else's play. I actually liked POP's flags for that reason, until they made places like BoT, CoD, and HoHoA free for alls of stupidity.<br />
<br />
EQ in other expansions HAS been trivialized in the painlessness of CRs: people don't pay for not paying attention and screwing up. You don't have to play smart and hard to get a_good_item, just do enough mindnumbing adventures.<br />
<br />
Mobs/events/quests that are challenging is what the game needs. I fully realize that I am not ready to do all of it (at this point) but I am encouraged when I see people from various uberguilds describe it as &quot;rapage&quot; at the same time they talk about how fun it is: that gives me hope that it won't be a 90 day till solved expansion like PoP where the guilds outpaced the dev teams and led to the log jam of top end guilds who have nothing to do so they go and kill older &quot;progression&quot; content out of boredom.<br />

But really you don't have to do a CR, and I don't mean by not sucking.  Unless you have to coffin (sometimes a necessity), there are usually much safer ways to grab your corpse back.  So far out of the zones I've seen, Barindu is the only one that's dangerous to run through naked, and that can be solved by having a cleric bot camped.  Ferubi you have to coffin but it's a really short run to there, and Kod'taz appears to be the same (haven't had any rogues flagged so not sure about sos but almost everything sees through regular invis).</div></div><hr />

What an arrogrant, insufferable, elitest moron you're acting like Trondir.<br />
<br />
You are spending time on another class message board doing two things:<br />
<br />
1- Insulting me for no apparent reason other than I simply chose to disagree with you. <br />
<br />
2- Stating that because YOU CAN PORT, you don't really have a problem that Gates creates more travel time for WARRIORS.<br />
<br />
You're a teleportation class, and you're cracking on warriors or monks who don't like to walk and take boats.<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAH. Who's the fool now?<br />
<br />
Added travel time and corpse recovery time is NOT a challenge. It's just added travel time and corpse recovery time. And has nothing to do with the encounters or monsters in gates of discord.<br />
<br />
&quot;My exploring of GoD involved soloing a few blue cons in deeper zones to check for their hitpoints. you? &quot;<br />
<br />
Mine? Pulling them for groups. <br />
<br />
&quot;oh yeah I couldnt cut it as a caster. &quot;<br />
<br />
You retired from your warrior. You gave up. You couldn't hack it as a melee. So STFU about calling people gimps or babies.<br />
<br />
&quot;you think you are 1,5 steps behind me? Let's count then&quot;<br />
<br />
Lets count. Step 0.5: Finishing Killing the Elemental Gods, get access to Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
Step 1.5: Clear Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
We're not talking baby steps. We're talking actual levels of progression. That's 1.5 steps to catch up to you, in the next expansion, which you'll eventually hit a roadblock in. Tick tock, tick tock. You're progression insults won't last because eventually, over the course of time, PEOPLE CATCH UP.<br />
<br />
Your kung-fu is weak Trondir.<br />
<br />
You're a porting class mocking melees who don't like to walk from place to place. And when they call you on your bullshit, you have the gall to crack on their progression, when eventually even the gimpiest of gimp monks (me) will catch you because time is against you.<br />

Trondir, nothing you've done is special. No accomplishment merits you being a rude, arrogant prick.<br />

Not to mention, you're wrong on the whole travel time issue. It's NOT a challenge. It WON'T reduce the trains. It WON'T keep the retards out of Gates zones.<br />

<br />
Original EQ, Kunark, and Velious were therefore broken.<br />
<br />
Mobs saw Invis in Sirens Grotto, West Wastes, ON THE WAY to ToV, for CR!<br />
<br />
Velious was broken!<br />
<br />
My all time favorite utterances about PoP, used by people in the same rant.<br />
<br />
&quot;The loot is too good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The mobs are too hard!&quot;<br />
<br />
What the fuck, people?<br />
<br />
Tier 1 PoP was 'impossible', for everyone except the guilds tired of clearing VT. Now, guilds who never set foot there are in the Elemental planes. <br />
<br />
GoD is 'impossible', for everyone except the guilds tired of clearing Time. Well, not really, its actually more accessable than PoP was for raiding. Its just not as 'convenient'. GoD has events for everyone from VT-level to Time++++...  Its a culmination of all that SoE has learned over the past few years. I bitch and moan with the rest of you guys about SoE and such, because of server stability, but really, we're getting a bargain price on some premo entertainment. How many zones does EQ have now? Over 200? 6 continents? A moon? 20 or more planes? They're taken all they've learned and made a nice expansion for the high end, with a little bit for everyone else.<br />
<br />
GoD is a huge throwback to an earlier time of EverQuest. I'm not knocking graveyards, I far prefer them to corpse summon. But people who have been raised on PoP and are saying that as a result, GoD is broken, are positively sickening, snivering, useless fools.<br />
<br />
Spell damage... Its always meant to be a contributing factor. In my opinion, its in its least damaged form ever. I'll refer to spell damage in general as 'AE's' from hereon in.<br />
<br />
In original EQ, Dragon raids usually involved not resisting a hell of a lot, no matter how well you were set up. It was russian roulette.<br />
<br />
In Kunark, the only AE in the expansion worth mentioning was essentially unresistable.. BTW, your gonna like the new Trakanon in Inktu'Ta.<br />
<br />
In Velious, all AE's were either a total non issue, hideable, or something that slowly whittled down your raid. They were an annoyance... Not a threat.<br />
<br />
In Luclin, AE's were all essentially Unresistable. They were as such normally just an irritation, or something you hide from.<br />
<br />
Ahh, PoP. The advent of AE's being on your side and total non-issue of any spell based damage from any expansion other than itself. As such, spell damage is as spell damage is. You've got two types. A: Resistable, but so close to it as to make it not really count.. Example: Terris / Saryrn / Tallon Zek in time, most Plane of Fire mobs. B: Needs to be resisted, and is pretty easily handled if need be. Example: Plane of Water.<br />
<br />
Very little was Chromatic, or Prismatic. The only thing that comes to mind was those annoying Golems in the caves of PoEarth. Thats all changing. A tank needs good resists, across the board, AND the usual stats / AC / hp. They're broadening our horizons... And people are offended, because they're set up for the old game, not the new.<br />
<br />
In closing... People who think GoD sucks are entitled to their opinion. But most of the people complaining are used to the world on their platter which they received in PoP. They're unaware this is how it always was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GoD represents a reversal of the PoP/LDoN design paradigm, which was to provide content as the challenge, as opposed to getting to the content as the challenge.  That makes very little sense to a lot of people (I won't make up a percentage).  One can only wonder what the devs were thinking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So yeah, its all my fault that SOE planted wall to wall KOS NPCs that don't see through invis and are not content and have zero reason to kill.  ZERO!  None.  They are just there to look pretty and be anoying.  I must suck because I don't see the purpose of anoying players to /q-ing out.<br />
<br />
So you guys who think POP made things to was easy clearly were playing a different game than I was.  Things like mass remote CR, waiting for 30 minute automatic transport, sneaking around KOS zones were all anoying and no more a test of skill than flipping a coin.  Especially in zones like Qinimi.

<br />
Anyways, back to the actual topic:<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not really, its actually more accessable than PoP was for raiding. Its just not as 'convenient'.&quot;<br />
<br />
PoP raiding, with graveyards isn't all THAT convenient. You camp a cleric/necro/paladin/whatever, you need to recover fast or you start losing people, which in some zones can be bad. You have a complete wipeout and recovery time is about the same as it'd be with corpse summoning. This &quot;convenience&quot; was mostly done to save the annoyance factor of going through 60 or so coffins. The &quot;easiness&quot; of having graveyards gets overblown a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;But people who have been raised on PoP and are saying that as a result, GoD is broken, are positively sickening, snivering, useless fools.&quot;<br />
<br />
What about people who don't think it's broken, but just think it's a POOR DESIGN DECISION? <br />
<br />
Even people who LIKE this expansion are starting to complain about it. The trials and their makeup smacks of Plane of Justice, executioner trial on crack. The bugged artifact thing. I think there's going to be far more complaining about this expansion than even planes of power. It was rushed. It wasn't tested that well. And the feedback from the testers was ignored. You've got a lot of content there that I bet you is going to be broken/bugged.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your new car. It smells like a lemon to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should be noted that POP Graveyards are more of a function of the POP events than a convience for players.<br />
<br />
Once you start an event there is often no way to restart or reopen.  For instance you clear all of the monsters in one area that unlocks a door or portal to move into the next area.  If you wipe out in the second area there no hope of you clearing the first area again (naked) to open the second area to recover corpses.<br />
<br />
Stuff like this is scattered all over POP events since they were made to go forward not backwards.  Anyone not using the events just got a nice bonus of not calling a Necro out to summon their corpse from Timbuktuu.  Graveyards were a necessity for making POP work.  Don't think for a moment that SOE did it just make players sluff off CR.</div></div><hr />

Ever try to CR a Coir or Rathe?  There is no way you can sneak people down to the corpses to res.  One has doors that only opens when you clear the right monsters.  The other one is at the bottom of a lot of water.  Or how about something simple like the Nightmare Maze.  Oh wait!  Once it starts you can't loop back through so if something goes wrong you can't bring in new people to help out.  Or how about Agnrr where even if you can get back to the sparking phallus you can't go any higher than that first room because the portal shuts as you climb.  Not to mention that little place called Time...<br />
<br />
Or maybe you value your time and money wasted on Necro summons?   It is a time consuming and money wasting venture.  I suppose in your mind that is fun and a challenge!</div></div><hr />

I suppose if you're a class that CRs people you'd need to do this more, but this is supposed to be a Warrior board.  Warriors don't really CR people, and if you can grab someone's corpse so can anyone else.  Unless they died like 10 feet from the entrance of an instance entrance there's really no reason for you to be running around in GoD unless it's to get from one zone to another.</div></div><hr />

Your seriously acting like I have never done this? I guess its true, my guild is capable of pulling off a full recovery in almost any condition without a GY, so I'm more immune to your insanity.<br />
<br />
Your trying to play the 'you goddamn newbie' card, which is exactly what you ARE. I don't 'value' it. I'm telling you this is how the game worked before you got coddled into this game..<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm sorry, its not. Back then, Warriors had no self invis without burning their entire bank account, and corpse summon? Give me a break! Maybe three necros on your server had the spell? And they were so high level, why would they care about your dinky ass?<br />
<br />
Seriously, comparing all these events with a brand new expansion which hasn't been halfway explored is useless. There is so much we do not know. All the instanced zones CAN be 'graveyarded', in the same sense you are referring to in PoP. The event can be abandoned, but you get your corpses back in a different, accessable place. Thats all your argument requires.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I have little wish in arguing this with you, I'm just bored today. We used to have almost no method of invis, sneak/hide was no better than Invis, and everything saw invis. To coffin out was only an option if you were on a raid with a rather special necro who happened to not need to log. We have it EASY by comparison today.<br />
<br />
By the way, agro radius is not terribly humongous in these zones. Various times, my invis has started to wear off, and within a few seconds I could spot a place thats far enough away from mobs to not get agro. At which time I would move there before it pops, and re-do my BP click.<br />
<br />
You should be thankful the things that were in Beta did not make it here. Imagine Barindu, Riwwi, and the hallways of Qinimi being exactly like Ferubi. Every roamer sees invis.</div></div><hr />

Whatever.  You can have your hoop jumping idea of fun.  Give me trials, encounters and quests to sink my teeth into.  The rest of it is just distracting noise.  There is no challenge in CR-ing people.  It is just time lost for them and time lost for me.  Is that fun or what?<br />
<br />
As for why I find myself running around helping people catch up?  I suppose I am a little nice.  It also might have something to do about the fact I have Resurrection.  If I don't do it then they will have to wait for a Cleric to get free which at that point since they have about as many invis options as I do they will be just as successful as I would be.</div></div><hr />

Discord looks to be a fun challenge, it's something different (yet nostalgic). I doubt I would want to do pickup groups there. Ferubi was a friggin blast, even at the zone in.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of folks hate LDoN and simply don't play it. It's fun for a bit, but gets old fast. I think this expansion is giving us some needed variety. <br />
<br />
And I expect to be seeing Time folks on more often now, instead of once or twice a week.   I'll be in Time in a few weeks most likely, but not alone. It will happen with a great big group of friends.  And once we are burnt out there, I know we have other fun things to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, and it sucks.  <br />
<br />
If you go with an exp group, die a ways into Ferubi (it's bound to happen sometime), and don't have a handy necro/sk around (L60+, so your lower level alt can't zone in and do it), you're fucked.  Wow, that's fun.  Isn't that a wonderful challenge?  Praise be to GoD for giving us 2 hour CRs again!  Huzzah!  <br />
<br />
Long CRs have always sucked.  Always.  They were bad design from day 1.  They are mindnumbingly boring.  I want to actually play the game.  Penalize people for dying.  Absolutely.  But that penalty shouldn't be, &quot;hah! you died!  Now you must sit on your ass doing nothing for 2 hours unless you happen to have the right class handy!&quot; (hello SK tanks for exp groups).  Penalize experience more heavily if necessary, but don't make it so someone can't play the game.  Downtime sucks ass.<br />
<br />
EQ obviously takes some inspiration from old RPGs.  Okay, if your party wipes in D&amp;D, does that mean most party members then sit on their asses for 2 hours doing nothing?  Oh, occasionally one player dies while the others move on and it's awhile before they can get a rez.  But it's in person and they can have fun anyway.  Party wipes are expressed to a matter of minutes.  If the party is recovered, they pay their exp penalty and start playing again.  Long travels through trivial areas are expressed into a matter of minutes.   Still no one WANTS to die or blows it off as nothing.  The penalty is more than severe enough to make it something you want to avoid without causing a ton of boring as watching the grass grow downtime. <br />
<br />
Trondir, you're an elitist, egomaniacal prick.  Congrats.  Has ranting in this thread managed to 'Add 3-4 inches!' for you yet?<br />
<br />
You kind of said it all when you stated that this expansion is made only for people who are tired of clearing Plane of Time over and over and over.  It IS a high level expansion.  It should NOT be considered only for the Time geared though.  Many areas are quite doable by people with lesser gear.  The CRs are just stupidly long.  Not to mention the fact that it would be completely idiotic of Sony to design an entire expansion just for the tiny percent of their playerbase that's killed Quarm X number of times.  They've gone too far with the pain in the ass CRs and the stupidly overpriced AAs, but they're not designing the whole thing for plane of time people yet.  To think it's all for you and your Time buddies and all the lower people should just STFU only shows how much of an elitist prick you really are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would you trade 96% Ress for GYs Callon ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gamewide?  I don't know.  Some areas are very easy to CR without a GY.   Then there are these horrible CR GoD zones like Ferubi.  I'd take more exp loss in a heartbeat to get a GY there.  Maybe it's not fair to divide it up based on zones like that, but for areas where CRs are very time consuming, I'd absolutely take a much larger exp loss than the 96% rez costs you so that I could keep playing.   Does that mean a 0% rez?  Eh, I don't know.  I haven't paid attention to the effects of no rez at L65 because I always get a rez, so I don't know how long it takes to make it back up in my typical exp groups.  <br />
<br />
Hypothetically, suppose it takes me on average an hour longer if I have to CR without a graveyard in a given zone.  That's conservative for Ferubi if you don't have a necro/sk handy. Suppose making up a bigger exp loss instead takes an extra hour of grinding.  I'd absolutely take the exp loss because I'd much rather be playing the game.  Now if it takes 5 extra hours of grinding or one extra hour of CR... maybe not.  I don't know exactly where the cutoff is.    2 hours of grinding or one hour of sitting around?  Yeah, I'd probably take the exp loss there too.<br />
<br />
The point is the penalty (risk) should be there for failing, but it shouldn't effectively make it so you can't play like it can now for many classes.  Exactly what am I as a tank going to do in a hard CR zone where my group was pushing our capabilities when I go back in there with gimp CR gear as some have suggested?  Not much.  If it's doable with my gimp gear, it wasn't a hard enough zone when fully geared.  Am I supposed to keep 2 or more very solid full sets of gear around?  I hope not.  <br />
<br />
Besides, I cleaned out some of that old gimp gear and gave it to tribute masters so the points could get nerfed on it today.  :P <br />
<br />
Hopefully future MMORPGs will take note.  Risk is good.  Downtime is bad.<br />
<br />
edit: I guess I'll throw out an idea if you want a high risk upper end zone that still has the GY option available.  This will seem artificial, but then so is running around nekkid getting your own corpse after you died.  You go to this nasty GoD zone.  If you die, you have an option.  Recover your corpse where it fell through whatever means you and your group or raid can come up with OR click a box yes to send the corpse to some safe graveyard.  However, if you send it to the GY, you cannot get an exp rez.  Or maybe the rez only restores 50% of the exp instead of 96.  maybe it's 50% or 30% or 0%... whatever is deemed a balanced risk.  If it's a significant exp loss, your guild could have a GY available and still not be too eager to make a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th attempt in the same night.   How much exp are they willing to lose?  They also might be willing to attempt CRing without the GY depending on the situation.  It would keep SK and Necro corpse summoning, if they can reach the zone and the nekkid people can, extremely valuable.  But some zones may simply be very hard for the nekkid ones to get to anyway.  <br />
<br />
There may be better solutions for new MMORPGs, but I'm trying to work within the existing framework of EQ.  Any major problems with this idea?  One drawback might be that it further separates the have and the havenots.  High end players who might be able to grind out an AA in 30 minutes will be more willing to risk the exp loss as will certain classes that can gain exp faster.  I don't know the answer for the class issue, but for high end players it's fairly simple.  The zones where this GY &quot;option&quot; exists would at least initially be only in high end zones anyway and the exp loss would be balanced for them.  If it were put into a lower end zone, the potential exp loss is adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
Ack. Message too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is CR a risk?  CR is post mortum (pardon the pun).  You've already blown it by the time you have to pull CR.  Is there some magic reward for doing CR?

GYs on a 4-5 hour timer would be acceptable really but then I so like that fact that people might need to talk to others again and maybe make some new friends or just plain start to pay attention and not goof around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree.  I think GoD is good step in this direction.<br />
<br />
Note: if folks don't like it they can still do PoP and LDoN regular.  There IS content both ways.  I like that folks have to play tight and not do stupid crap like snare/slow right at the begining of fights now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry, but there is no &quot;risk&quot; at all in EQ, especially with GYs.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;risk&quot; we currently have is not getting our corpse for 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Not getting your corpse for 2 hours is annoying as hell.  To me that's a big risk.  My game time that evening is ruined.  I end up with a nekkid warrior sitting on his ass for 2 hours.  FUN!  I don't know why that wouldn't be a deterrant to people.  It sure is to me.  Sure if you play 6 hours a day every day, maybe it's less so, but most of us don't.  Also my suggestion of a bigger exp penalty if you use the GY is a risk.  <br />
<br />
Again, penalties in a well designed game should not equate to huge downtime.  That's where EQ was flawed for a long time and they insist on putting it back in GoD.  They should hurt enough to keep people from being stupid.  They should not make it so you can't play.  <br />
<br />
As far as the lack of GYs go, mostly what I see in these discussions on various boards is a few uber guilders that claim to love the &quot;increased risk&quot; and &quot;keeping out the fuckups&quot; or whatever.  Everyone else hates that shit and most seem annoyed enough with failing that they don't like to just throw themselves at a mob 5 times in a row whether there's a GY or not.  <br />
<br />
EQ is a huge freaking time sink already.  Long CRs amount to just another stupid time sink that's intolerable to the person who plays maybe 3 hrs in a stretch.   For most activities 3 hrs in a stretch is a long time.  I'm sorry if you typically log in for 5-6 hrs at a time and a 2 hr CR isn't enough risk.  That's not the experience for most of us.</div></div><hr />

Its something different for a lot of people.  For me I got bored of just waiting at a GY.  Atleast I have to go find my corpse.  Its more difficult, but its a good challenge to not die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I've been on my fair share of 6 to 9 hour corpse recoveries in planes of fear and sky. Those weren't what I'd call common, typical corpse recoveries.<br />
<br />
I DO commonly play at the hours of 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. a lot though. And have been on many CR's in places like Chardok and the Hole that late at night. They seemed more typical for me to point out because even GOOD players have trouble playing well at 5 a.m. (What good is a cleric, if he's asleep at the keyboard, for example?)<br />
<br />
So I used that as my example and not the 9 hour nightmares I had in plane of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What it all gets back to, is you guys were babied in PoP, and thats gone away. Deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Babied in PoP? By graveyards? Hah. You jest. <br />
<br />
&quot;None of you bitched about CR in LoY!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh definitely you're being sarcastic. LoY? hahahahahahahah. Yeah, if any of you ever played in LoY, you'd have thought CR's sucked in there too. I've had long ass CR's in Torigran's Mines and Crypt of Nadox and that stupid ship. But I get the feeling that 90 percent of the posters here have never really set foot in those zones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Atleast I have to go find my corpse. Its more difficult, but its a good challenge to not die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warriors running back through GoD to get their corpse? I thought this was about keeping the trainers OUT of these zones?<br />
<br />
lol<br />

&quot;As far as the lack of GYs go, mostly what I see in these discussions on various boards is a few uber guilders that claim to love the &quot;increased risk&quot; and &quot;keeping out the fuckups&quot; or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's EXACTLY what this thread is all about. Each person patting themself on the back for being such a good player that they don't have to CR too much. HOWEVER, that's like saying &quot;Yeah, we rock, we had no problems with Terris Thule&quot; back when PoP got launched ... not even realizing what was waiting for you later on in the game.<br />
<br />
When you all hit your first MAJOR roadblock or stumbling block ... and you finally do face long, coffin-burning corpse recoveries ... and spend an entire night of doing nothing but failing against content that is obviously &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;bugged&quot; (hey, Rathe Council 2.0!) ... then the tone of the masses on THIS SUBJECT will change.<br />
<br />
Then the CR's won't be welcome.<br />
<br />
Then they'll be an annoyance for you all too.<br />
<br />
I welcome that first rant. It will be fun to read the irony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not hard to run back without training. If you're alert, a warrior can get anywhere. Even naked. Just hit the bank and nab an invis potion or three.<br />
<br />
Heck, there's even been places where most invis classes trained horribly (pre GoD) but I can get through without invis and without aggro. It's all about travelling smart. Warriors don't train. Sloppy people train.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example: I've wiped out doing some very challenging things (taking an ill-equipped group deep in the hole in the wee hours of the morning back in the day when it was empty and still challenging content). I get called a newb or a gimp.<br />
<br />
Aakla points out 7 hour or longer corpse recoveries in plane of fear, but no one steps up to wave the gimp flag at him.<br />
<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
Hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
People who played in LoY zones, and found them challenging to crawl through and go on long, dangerous dungeon crawls which do indeed have long CR times, are obviously gimp, and should be scoffed at.<br />
<br />
People who do the same thing in Gates of Discord are challenge-seeking players of high caliber.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
Warriors or monks who don't like taking boats and don't like being dependent on necromancers for corpse summons are lazy, whiny crybabies.<br />
<br />
Warriors who haven't faced the full challenge of Gates of Discord and are busy scoffing at those who find the earlier content in the expansion a bit taxing, are challenge seeking players of high caliber.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
You guessed it. Hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
ALL levels of this game can be challenging. Take some time off from patting yourself on the backs to remember that. To remember things like a group of level 50's in Torigran's Mines face the same dangers and penalties you face in Gates of Discord. To remember that it's very easy to foget how challenging Chardok once was, and that ADVENTURE SEEKING players used to actually seek out that challenge. To remember that taking boats, no matter what expansion you're in, isn't challenging ... just time consuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadah</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a diffrence tho Super.<br />
<br />
Having a 8 hour hate CR when max level was 50 is one of them. <br />
Having to get a cleric up to island 6 in Sky because you wiped when the max level was 60 is completely diffrent then GoD.<br />
<br />
Aeka, the holy trinity is back where it belongs, Warrior + Cleric + Enchanter = teh win. Im sorry knights had 2 years of having it their way, Well GoD = the Kunark nerf bat. Welcome back we missed you Kunark nerf stick !<br />
<br />
Anyway back to the point.<br />
Corpse recovery is easy as pie  even in GoD, Unless all your buddies have loged or you dont have access to a summoner, <br />
SK's can summon corpses for recovery, Paladins can DA pull bodies. Rogues can SoS etc. It just has reinvented the CR.<br />
<br />
Anyone that does bitch about a 2 hour CR has nothing to complain about being elitest? <br />
No Not elitest just telling you how it is. People have been babied by content in PoP. Its just the way it is, Not by just graveyards, but by how easy it is generally to take a book to a zone to recover your body. <br />
<br />
Pop made corpse recovery a non exsistint issue Because you had access to almost any zone within 1 to 2 zone loads. Gates now requires people to do what old timers used to have to do back in the day. Run naked through mobs that will kill your naked ass, and hope your faster then them till you get your body.<br />
<br />
And you know what? GOOD FOR Gates! EQ has constinitly made it easier to get access to high level playgrounds, and unfortunitely not everyone will expirance every zone in EQ, thats a bummer but its the truth, G.o.D advertised at having raid content and they delivered, It wasnt mean for lower then 50 characters and even then thats pushing it. <br />
<br />
Anyway my point is, Deal with it. At least this isnt oldworld with you bound in kaladim and your body somewhere in lower guk because you forgot to hit /loc right before the train ate you. <br />
Now thats a CR you should try old world style without having more then 4k max buff at 50.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">-Corpse recovery has always been easy. Just time consuming. Gets back to the point about how it's not a challenge. It's just a time sink.<br />
<br />
- I obviously disagree with this assessment Planes of Power babied people. PoK books and graveyards didn't make Sol Ro or Bertox any easier to beat. The content was far more challenging than anything anyone had ever faced in previous expansions. The books and the graveyards had nothing to do with that.  <br />
<br />
- Also, something being overlooked by many people here is how graveyards made recovery a TIMING issue. You have to CR fast or your bodies go back to graveyard. This isn't an issue in Vex Thal, for instance. You can take all the time you want to recover and keep going. In PoP if you take longer than 15 minutes or 30 minutes you're back to square one. That's, technically, MORE of a challenge.<br />
<br />
- I also disagree with the assessment that EQ keeps getting EASIER when it comes to accessing the higher level zones. VP key is easier to get than Sleeper's key which is easier to get than Vex Thal key which is easier to get than elemental flags which are easier to get than time flags which are easier to get than ... whatever comes up in later Gates zones. The game doesn't get easier to access. It gets harder. As people who are now struggling with Gates &quot;trials&quot; are learning. They're more bottlenecked than PoP ever was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One key idea everyone forgets is that you are supposed to learn about how to do new trials.  You learn by doing.  Rarely do you figure it out by sitting on your butt waiting.  Give me twice as many trials before you give me one night of Necro summons and sneaking around zones.</div></div><hr />

It isnt trolling on your own class board sir. I dislike paladins coming here and crying about how unfair a trail is when its 10 days old, That sir is spoiled. and you know what F them if they dont like my opinion, This isnt PoN sir. This is the Steel Warrior fourm. <br />
<br />
Aeka,<br />
Being a knight, and coming to the board, I dont try and give you crap,but its all fuzzy goodness for warriors when we have a trial that we are the best pick at doing. Trials in a expansion mind you that has been out for a week. And already has knights crying nerf. So yes Im calling nerf back on knights and laughing all the way.<br />
<br />
I have advocated elarning the trials, but since it dosent seem to be the idea then yes, Call the new expansion Gates of Diskunark as I have seen on the paladin boards.  However for me, I enjoy the holy trinity that used to be good in old world game. <br />
<br />
Never once did I say that I wouldnt take anther class, but having the holy-esque (Warrior/Cleric/Chanter) Is what they balance most encounters around. At least it isnt a holy foursome yet.<br />
<br />
What I find the most amusing though,. Is that you look at it as a sad narrow game, Yet being a paladin how often does it come into your mind to bring a warrior along? I take paladins along when I do things, they are great for groups.<br />
<br />
Its too bad you say im naughty when you prolly refuse to allow a warrior into your groups Aeka, Because you can do the job just as good . <br />

Right now there are far too many classes for the designers to go back to forcing constraints of that nature into the game. Pare the class selection back down to something reasonable, like 12 perhaps, and then the holy trinity style can exist far less painfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SC is right.  You have too many classes to make the holy trinity sane.  If groups or the trials were twice as big or there were 1/3 as many classes it could work but now its too freaking late (anyone figure out why they added another class?!).<br />
<br />
If that gives you warm fuzzies come out and say you like to see other classes suffer.  Otherwise don't try to hide behind an idiot way to balance classes.  Please point out where my much vaunted utility is.  Which of my spells are useful?  Too many monsters don't stun.  Too many monsters are untankable unless you blast heal.  And to make it a double ouchie, I can't heal anyone because of the same DPS damage.  So unless you want roots, Brell's or an extra Resurrection don't bother inviting a Paladin at all to Discord trials.<br />

 This is brand new territory. When you first go exploring brand new territory, do you just grab 6 random people and run off into it? No. It's pretty well known that people look for what gives them the best margin of survival, and at the beginnings of expansions, the best margin is and has always been CLR/ENC/WAR - Especially with raid level mobs.<br />

 Let the expansion mature a few months and I'm willing to bet a $50 donation to the board of your choice that Knights will still be viable in GoD.</div></div><hr />

These are raid mobs, at least for now. Give it six months and players might be soloing in these zones.<br />

If you really want to be upset about something, be upset that these mobs may be the weakest of all the mobs that lie beyond. Yep, some groups/guilds may well sneak past these trials and discover they are not worthy 8).<br />

I surely was a bit surprised when I got flagged for BoT rather early on and my group ran into a named. I seriously doubted if the mob was group killable after we wiped in record time. It was but it took quite awhile to get there.<br />

So far I have found no challenges in Discord. Only anoying and painful ways to waste time. Nothing like spending 4 hours running an expedition to: <br />

yeah, lets make another expansion with 350~ hitting mob when all tanks have over 8k hp (24 full hits to kill you, probably mobs die before their 24th attack)<br />
<br />
lets make another expansion for players who will never see anything past BoT<br />
<br />
i WANTED an expansion like this. im an elemental tank with 9k hp, and my cleric has an hard time healing me when those fucking men-dogs procs 3 Chaos Claw on me<br />
<br />
this expansion brought back the tension i had while fighting my way to efreti lord in the good old lv50 days<br />
<br />
everyone know 1 error means tons of time lost. not just sitting at zone, or call your local necro/sk<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ wasnt always like you know it, some time ago a fuckup couldnt reach level 50 because sooner or later he'd die too often to exp and lost more than he gained. Now every moron can reach 65. That's EQ how you like it, eh?<br />
<br />
you call me arrogant? I am a fucking huge elitist prick. This expansion isnt for little boys, its for the big boys that killed quarm over and over and over again and got tired of LDoN and Time.<br />
 <br />
<br />
amen.....im tired of little-powerlevelled-kids who cry because now they have to think while playing and cant restart to kill after 5 mins from their death<br />
<br />
GoD is too hard for you ? get the hell out of there and go back to your nice and safe PoValor<br />
<br />
the worse day of PoP was when most tier 3 flags were removed. at least zones like HoH or BoT werent full of idiots who doesnt know what /assist or CC is<br />
<br />
now try to do the same in GoD. you wont go past Barindu</div></div><hr />

and how exactly does old world content loot help you progress through GoD? Not at all, and knights farming old world is also a huge lie you pulled out of your ass. I have NEVER seen a knight farming in Droga Veksar or CT, it always were Shams enchs necros druids.<br />

<br />
SKs solo HoH, SKs and Paladins solo WW dragons, it may not help them in GoD, but your the liar, it helps you get plat in the game YOU BADLY need. Soloing DOES matter as much as grouping in my book. Just nerf it or have it not able to be done (aka the current Mage bitch) and see how much it matters! I am SICK of soloing classes saying &quot;it doesn't matter I can solo&quot; LOL, now thats a BIG lie! Yep and it IS balanced EQ works that way, or give up ANY ability to solo, and you won't!<br />
This is NEW content, it is NOTHING new that Knights can't tank it! If you can't accept that, give up all soloing abilities, any utility, and become a Warrior. But Knights won't do that, the ones bitching, are the lazy, selfish SOBs riddling this game now. IT IS NEW CONTENT, YOU CAN NOT TANK IT YET! Got it now?!</div></div><hr />

Just because your newbie punk ass needs plat to buy more ornate it doesnt mean other people need it.<br />
It doesnt matter what you call a liar, I  call you a selfish asshole, however, you are still like 3k HP in gear, 4 levels and 300 AA away from playing the content we are talking about anyways.<br />
Who fucking cares about 3 year old dragons that drop junk loot? nobody! Sorry, Yeldema and his consorts drop jack shit for loot, they drop the 2 lowest qualities of &quot;dragonhide&quot; armor, which is basically junk. or do paladins solo Sontalak or Klandicar? THEY drop the pieces that go pricy.<br />
<br />
All you are saying is &quot;they can solo, its ok they are useless&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is NEW content, it is NOTHING new that Knights can't tank it yes it is very new, you noob dipshit. Knights had no problem tanking Exe trial,  tanking PoS giants for BoT access, tanking various stuff required to progress through PoP in general. Now Knights can tank vxed / tipt as the last point in GoD. Knights cannot tank ikkinz, warriors require 2 clerics to keep them up already. How incredibly stupid it is having to form a 6 player trial group with 2(!) clerics isnt even worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
IT IS NEW CONTENT, YOU CAN NOT TANK IT YET!<br />
<br />
This &quot;yet&quot; is such a gem. You think knights will ever be able to tank it? No, they wont. No loot superior to old content drops before Ikkinz, and SKs loaded with PoTime gear get their asses handed to them in Ikkinz.<br />

I can't recall a single thing in any expansion prior to GoD that paladins could not tank, it was just more efficient to use a warrior.  Now we have an expansion that basically makes it impossible to tank anything past 2nd trials and a lot of you warriors are dancing in the street.  It's amazing how egotistical self centered a lot of you idiots are.  When warriors had agro issues most paladins agreed that it needed to be fixed.  But when you are the *only* option for some early god content most of you are content and happy.  What a bunch of greedy mofo's you guys sound like.  An 11k 2200 ac tank being destroyed by a named in god is not what I'd call a challenge.. I'd call it absurd.  I came here hoping a lot of you would recognize the fact that all 3 tank classes should be able to tank this stuff, that knights should be a viable option.  Knights *NEVER* were the only option for any mob in the game, but you're suddently happy that warriors *ARE* the *ONLY* option for GoD content.  Selfish selfish mofos.  Zynth I definately expected better of you bro.  I guess you guys are all gonna be *really* happy extatic and excited backflagging everyone in your guild and even the &quot;useless&quot; knights over and over and over again because you're the *only* option in GoD.</div></div><hr />

At the place I am at 90% of the people are also at. We Warriors do NOT have these &quot;Uber&quot; weapons you keep talking about. I can BUY a BoC, but for 500k pp I won't afford one for 3 more years of play time. I can not get Knights to raid, they have spells, the Casters don't raid they have spells. So I am not getting a EB weapon, its simple.<br />
My friend two boxes with his SK/Shaman combo stuff I can't, should I start bitching about that? I have the same raid level equipment, same Shaman class, but gimp Warrior has no single mob pulling abilities or self healing or on demand Uber DPS (HT), so I should start whining for all that? You would tell me it is unimportant, well, your problem is unimportant to me. Big whoop, one raid content can't be Knight tanked, I have MANY spawns I WANT that I can't tank, because I don't have a spell book.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure furor would love to see us back to kunark days. doesnt really have alot of reason to speak up.<br />
<br />
I pretty much agree with the general consens over in the overlord sanc &quot;knights and GoD&quot; Thread.<br />
<br />
As far as my first impression of GoD is, there is NO exp content there. Nobody interest in AAs tonight will go to GoD, he'll head over to PoE of PoF and exp there for alot better exp with no downtime for whatever reason. <br />
Knights and Warriors should be equal for exp content, and they are. When you bring 2 healers, you wasting so much possible DPS that calling it &quot;Exp content&quot; is hypocrisy. <br />
<br />
Sadly enough for you, GoD is exclusivly raid Content as of now. Warriors should be preferred Raid Content tanks. <br />
I'm almost sorry GoD ended the god-mode days for knights. Almost. <br />

Please atleast dont group both classes abilities together like it is some sort of super class.  Yeah FD is nice when it works, but there have been tons of times for me that it hasnt.  And unlike Supurchum's monk I have to rely on not getting interrupted, and failing that waiting for the spell gem to refresh and hoping I have the hps to live that long.<br />
<br />
While not ALL Sk's and Pallys were for getting taunt fixed a few of us were.  Did I enjoy getting into groups and getting nice exp?  Sure thing I did, but I personally dont prefer to tank, and would rather have that nice beefy war standing there taking the hits for me.  Take a look at how I spent my AA's and you'll see that I would rather sit back and deal out dmg then take any hits.</div></div><hr />

Correct. However, notice the difference between what you are saying and what I was quoting ...<br />
<br />
&quot;When warriors had agro issues most paladins agreed that it needed to be fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously ... make special note of the two words that create the gap in interpretation between what you are saying and what Ashrem said. FEW ... and MOST.<br />
<br />
You are saying a few knights were indeed supporting warriors. And you are correct. The archives here and at the old board which still exists can prove that. There are a few vocal knight supporters.<br />
<br />
But ... &quot;most paladins&quot; did NOT agree that it needed to be fixed. No, no. MOST paladins would not be the quantity of paladins I would use. I've read one too many threads from Paladins of Norrath to do anything but SCOFF at that statement.<br />

It is not half green, understating yet again! My Shaman at 57 can solo REDS and YELLOWS. If the Knights don't like the fact they can't tank ONE trial let them reroll as warriors, right back at you! Your opinion is TRIVIAL to me as mine is to you!<br />

I'm not sure how you meant that, but seeing as he spent 75% of his waking hours working with devs testing the content of GoD, combined with his raving and ranting how wonderful GoD would be in the last parts of Beta, I'd say he's probably pretty happy with it.<br />
<br />
But he's just one among many. I, too, enjoy the challenge of GoD.<br />
<br />
Everyone wants to hurry up and beat it. Whats the rush? I like there being content thats so hard I shouldn't even bother with it right now, it gives me something to look forward to.<br />
<br />
Thats what this all boils down to.<br />
<br />
WHATS THE FUCKING HURRY?<br />
<br />
Oh, and xp content. Theres not much in the way of pure 'xp farm' style xp, no. It just happens as you go along. I like it, its more along the old style of RPGs, you don't get your experience from plopping your ass in one spot and killing, you get it as you advance in the world.</div></div><hr />

ho.. like, which? I think someone is exaggarating here a bit, I have a hard time believing this :P<br />

You can take your pro-Knight attitude to their boards! Maybe you will receive a warmer welcome than the WARRIOR board<br />
I think you are having a very hard time understanding my postings.</div></div><hr />

There are things in the game a knight can NOT do, there are things in the game a warrior can NOT do, things are pretty balanced now. You can make stupid claims because ONE set of trials is not tankable by Knights the game is broken. You are the one being silly. GoD was meant to be hard as hell, that means Knights can not tank as they lack defensive, unless they have two healers dedicated to just keeping them up. That means if a warrior gets unlucky with one healer, he will die. You don't like the challenge? Don't do the trials! You do NOT have to do every bit of content in every expansion. I have flags in PoP to Planes I will NOT go to, and flags I want but will never get. Get over it, I have.<br />
Yes, I helped drag every member through the PoJ trials, and it wasn't the warrior that was required, it was our Enchanter who was the only Enchanter we had who could hack it. He went through the PoJ trails a LOT of times, who cares? And before you go, scoff PoJ trials? Dumb asses, that was CUTTING edge when it came out too! We failed 5 times in a row, till we got it down. Now the GoD trails are cutting edge, and people will laugh how easy they were in a few expansions from now too!</div></div><hr />

PoJ Trials a cutting edge, hehe :-)</div></div><hr />

Coming from the same person whining about a Gates trial in the early stages of THIS expansion ... the hilarity never ends!</div></div><hr />

That is TYPICAL in guilds now, not an exception.<br />
Quit whining about some silly trials at the beginning of an expansion. Give it time, they will be trivial soon enough and then become BORING. Lets not rush to the boring part just yet!</div></div><hr />
