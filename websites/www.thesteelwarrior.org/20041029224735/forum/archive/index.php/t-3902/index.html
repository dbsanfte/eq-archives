<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vegnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to have Ykesha Proc on my BoW since before they patched it Anger was 1h only , and just recently got Anger3 on my BoW and I swear to God it feels like it's broken  because I'm hardly procing EB's now.<br />
<br />
Are other warriors with BoW and Anger3 seeing the same thing? I mean I was avg'ing 3-4 Yak procs + EB procs, soon as I added Anger3  I went to POI to solo some mobs to see how many times I procced and  I'm not getting more than 1-2 EB procs per fight now and what's worse I have no idea what's procing since Anger and EB have the same message.<br />
<br />
<br />
MY dex is at 305 btw.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go with it a few days and see if it doesn't average out.  I DO wish that anger3 had a different message than EB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to broken or not ... &quot;Working as Intended&quot; is my guess<br />
<br />
I've had 30 secs fights with 3 BoW procs , 2 3 SoP Procs, 2 Procs <br />
(no proc message for Anger3 on Sebilis just the character animation)<br />
And i've spend 10 mob streaks without.<br />
<br />
I had BoW+Ykesha now i have BoW+Anger3 .<br />
Overall proc rate seems about the same (RNG is totally gay too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not broken.  I will have to agree with brotha thepp though about initial hate being capped.<br />
<br />
On a LDON hard adventure yesterday, I procced<br />
Round 1: double rage<br />
Round 2: rage<br />
Round 3: no proc<br />
Round 4: rage<br />
Round 5: rage<br />
<br />
Over 4 seconds I procced 5X, and I didnt have pull aggro off the monk who had pulled with a dagger.<br />
<br />
Im guessing they limit hate to maybe 2X actual damage, so you can't just cast hate spells over and over to create massive aggro without actually doing damage.</div></div><hr />
