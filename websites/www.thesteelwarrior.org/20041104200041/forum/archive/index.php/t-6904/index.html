<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I don't think you'll find anything better til elemental gods or time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDON bought or Droped ideas are appreciated.  Think im looking something with a proc so i can augment it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you lookin for 1handers or a 2hander?<br />
<br />
GSoFW will outdamage it ... especially if you have trained your 2hander aa's.<br />
<br />
1handers pre-elementals i can think of are agnarrs sword and the rotting fist ... maybe gold-runed mithril dagger?<br />
<br />
SEM from Earth would do you well for 1hander dps.....<br />
<br />
in the end 2handers will be the better of your available options for dps until time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2handers are my dps preference. Go for the grat ole' mezz breaker. Err Ornate Greatblade. If you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2handers are my dps preference. Go for the grat ole' mezz breaker. Err Ornate Greatblade. If you can.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could re-augment my ornate greatblade for DPS but i'll need to look into agnarr's sword or something so i can throw an anger 3 on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">agnarrs blade is nice, but if youre looking for straight aggro you'd be better off anger augging a droga weapon.<br />
<br />
an aggro aug on a naked (aggrowise) weapon is a waste imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDON bought <br />
<br />
The best you will do from ldon (fully aug'd) are:<br />
<br />
17/20 club of mad researcher<br />
16/19 curse smelt blade (sp?)<br />
<br />
Both witll cost 1150*2= 2300 pts for this config with 1 type 4 open.  Not sure I'd consider either an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think you're going to find a 1-handed upgrade to the Sparkling Shortsword until you reach the next tier of weapons (elemental gods or Time).  There are a few 2-handers that will outdamage the Sparkling Shortsword, the three obvious ones are Ornate Greatblade, Stone Etched Warsword and Blade of War.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be an offhand weapon i'm using a jagged blade of frozen flame in main hand.  And I'm thinking CHOS wouldn't compare in stats as i can't rely on offhand for damage output or agro procs (no ambi, WA2) or am i wrong? However, a naked weapon with anger 2 aug is pretty useless for agro as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm kinda in the same boat myself.  <br />
<br />
My best dps weapon is my tanking weapon - the Blade of War (auged).  In trash clearing where mobs are dying in 5-10 seconds of the MA calling assist, it's fine.  Even despite my guild using Knights primarily on trash clearing, I still often pull agro with it, so I usually have to bag it 90% of the time.  On boss mobs, no fucking way.  I'll pull agro in 30 seconds every time on all but one other of my guild's warriors.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, my guild has had no luck on the earth rings.  Every time we clear them, it's a PH, and even if a SEWS dropped, it would probably go to a Knight,  So, SEWS is probably out of the question.  That basically leaves me the Ornate Greatblade.  Since my guild is rather necro heavy, however, I'm hesitant on taking any potential debuff slots from them.  Are there any 1handers that can match an OGB?<br />
<br />
My current &quot;dps&quot; weapon is the GSo4W.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got an Ornate Greatblade tonight, so my parsing sample isn't too big yet, but from what I saw so far, it does the same DPS as the GSO4W.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got an Ornate Greatblade tonight, so my parsing sample isn't too big yet, but from what I saw so far, it does the same DPS as the GSO4W.<br />
<br />
I'm averaging between 98-115dps with OGB.  I have PB1 and Fero2 and im not counting dot damage.<br />
<br />
From what i've seen the dot proc stacks with whatever spells most necro's / sk's use do to the way dot stacking works now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think what I might do in the end is try a CHOS and aug it with yak.  Off hand that with the Jagged shard of frozen flame (anger3).  I'll post what I find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think you will find that the Anger 3'd Jagged Shard of Frozen Flame is better overall aggro in the mainhand than CHOS+Yak due to its huge DPS advantage.  Try both ways for extended periods of time to evaluate for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I meant.<br />
<br />
JSFF+A3 Main<br />
CHOS+yak Off<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />
