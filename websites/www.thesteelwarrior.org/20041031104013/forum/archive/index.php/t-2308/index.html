Could any one take a peek and tell me if i'm doing okey, shure i lack haste but will try to get some haste item(which should i get?) my funds are rather limited with 1 main and 7 alts to keep equiped :) but say i can gather 1-1.5k, the weapons from droga looks nice but not shure if they proc at my level.<br />
<br />
Any slots you see i should upgrade asap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best combo at your level and pp is a jade mace and centi longsword.  I'd sell the 1hbs and some of the stuff in your bag and grab these two.  Plus they'll max out your 1hs/1hb skill while you're at it.  They prolly could be had for 3k total.  Don't forget to work on 2hb/2hs also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1hb and 1hs is maxed, just not entirely updated since magelo has been down, planning on working on 2hb now for a while.<br />
<br />
3k hmm loads of money but i will check on those, might find em cheap, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would you say a jade mace and a centi longsword was a better combo than 2 honed blade of ykesha?  (thats what I have)<br />
<br />
Would you suggest I moved to those?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
HELL NO!!!<br />
not just no, but HELL NO!!!<br />
<br />
the 2 HBoYs will by far out perform the JM/CLS in all aspects of the game, be it aggro, damage, ect.  <br />
<br />
They HBoYs will hold you till your epic or better level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I kinda figured as much, but haven't ever looked at the stats on either one.<br />
<br />
So what would be a good 1hb replacement for one of my yaks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So these honed blades are buyable / &quot;easy&quot; to camp for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Honed Blades of Ykesha are not campable. They're player made, and they seem pretty rare, mainly because in the early days of cultural smithing, some races got shafted pretty badly.  Trolls, who make the yaks, are one of those races.  There don't seem to be a whole lot of troll GM smiths, but that seems to be slowly changing now that they get better rewards for all the time and cash dumped into reaching GM skill level.  Also, regular ssoy's, which these are made from, don't proc until level 37, so if you're below that, they're not going to be nearly as good as they will after, but the ratio on them is damn good either way.  They'll last you well into your 50's, maybe longer.<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Honed blades proc @ 35.  And they're hella high dollar.  I hate to admit it, but my cousin made em for me and dropped them into my lap.  <br />
<br />
I only want to replace one of them with something else, I just don't know what yet.  Preferablyl something with stats and at least as much DPS.<br />
<br />
Damn, had a tooth pulled today, I feel like shit.  Maybe I should go fill my perscription.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't know many trolls at all, and no GM smiths.<br />
<br />
So the yaks are probably not easy to get for me unless someone sells em cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've heard the Yaks go for about 6k a pice.  I dunno about you, but thats a lot of money to me. :D<br />
