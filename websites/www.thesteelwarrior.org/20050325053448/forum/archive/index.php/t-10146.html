<br />
Phase 2 is 3 trials...  Have 1 hour<br />
<br />
Phase 3 is a little differnt, there will be around 20ish naemd mobs up, all of differnt types, only 2 will be targetable, and they will have some other guard mobs up, after you clear all the guard mobs, and the 2 named, another 2 named will become targetable and spawn there own set of guard mobs, do this over and over until all the named are dead, and 2 big golems will spawn, they are pretty easy, kill them and get to phase 4..... Have one hour, and 15ish min<br />
<br />
Phase 4 is 4 gods.. For TT you need MR, for Sayran, u need DR, For tallon and vallon u dont need resists. Have a hour<br />
<br />
Phase 5 is another 4 gods, For Bert your need PR/DR, for CT need PR/MR, for Inno need FR, for RZ need FR, have a hour.<br />
<br />
Phase 6 is quarm, his melee is hella weak once slow'd, his ae's are the only hard part... Every 25% of his life he will lose a head, and completly debuff himself, so u have to reslow... He does NOT responce to taunt like normal mobs, so tank switches are a pain in the arse... Have a hour...<br />
<br />
its not very detailed, if i have time tomorrow ill post a full writeup of each phase, but i am sure there is one on this board somewhere alrdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phase1: 1 hour to complete all five trials<br />
<br />
Fire trial (Longer Trial)- 3 big fire mephits at the start, none of which are mezzable.  When one of those big mephits dies, two more spawn, one of which is mezzable and one of which is not.  Continue this process (2 smaller mephits spawn after one large intial mephit dies) and the named, Kazrok of Fire, will spawn.  Kazrok spawns 3x waves of two mephit adds (randomly mezzable) at various percentages of his health.  Don't burn him.  Kazrok has a strong DS, so he needs to be cleric DS debuffed just like you do Solusek Ro.  Need Fire resists.<br />
<br />
Water trial (Shorter Trial) - Named spawns at the beginning with 2 adds.  Kill adds (one is mezzable, one isn't).  At 90% and 45% of Anar of Water's health, he spawns 2 more adds (6 adds total in the fight).  Just kill them as they pop.  You need cold or magic resists, I think.<br />
<br />
Earth Trial (longer trial) - 3 rockfiends spawn at the beginning.  Similar to the Fire trial, when one of the rockfiends dies, anywhere from two to four (random) rock assassins spawn, all of which are mezzable.  After 8 rock assassins are dead, the named pops (Terlok of Earth).  He's a wimp in comparison to the other bosses.  No resists required.<br />
<br />
Undead Trial (Longer trial) - 3 undead dudes.  4 undead dudes.  3 undead dudes.  2 undead dues + named.  Trial finished.  I think that's how it goes... not entirely sure.  =P<br />
<br />
Air Trial (Shorter trial) - Four birds spawn intially, randomly mezzable I think.  As one bird dies, you will see them repop (but no agro) beside the named up front.  Once all four are dead, the next wave of four birds + named rush you.  The outer birds need to be tanked.  The inner birds closest to the named can be mezzed.  Burn named, then deal with the adds.<br />
<br />
Phase2: 1 hour to complete all<br />
<br />
Think of P1 through P3 working as a tournament organization.  Fire and Water connect together in P2 (36 people max).  Earth and Air also connect together in P2 (36 people max).  Undead again goes off and does its own thing (18 people max).  You really can't screw up the Fire/Water and Earth/Air parts of Phase2.  Generally what kills you here is either a lack of dps, or accidently pulling too many and having them all mow you down.  =P  The undead portion is a little tricky, but you just pull mobs until the named spawns.  The named spawns adds on a percentage basis, so don't burn him if you feel like getting overwhelmed.  I don't believe the adds are mezzable (2 at a time), but don't quote me that one.  <br />
<br />
All &quot;add&quot; spawners in Time do it based on health percentage btw, not time based.  It's generally just easier to kill them as they spawn unless you're packing some serious,and I mean SERIOUS firepower.<br />
<br />
Phase3: 1 hour and 20 minutes I think<br />
<br />
The raid meets together finally, thank god.  8 waves of adds based on different themes (Saryrn theme, TT theme, Rallos theme, Inny theme, etc etc etc).  The named have quite a few hp (300k?) and everything does a shitton of dps until slowed (all fully slowable).  The faster you get mobs tanked and slowed, the easier going you will have in P3.  At the end of the 8 waves, the two golems spawn right on top of each other pretty much.  Both Supernatural Guardian and Avatar of the Elements have approximately the same amount of hp (~600k), but the Supernatural Guardian is unslowable and flurries, so his dps is much higher (~800-1100dps depending on AAs).  Avatar of the Elements only does 300 to 400dps or so.  Once those are dead, you can go to Phase4.<br />
<br />
Phase4:<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek - Level 71, ~1 million HP, Quads 1000 to 3000 @ 14 delay, Rampages, but no Flurry.  Has a fuckton of badass AEs for which you need a bard playing Veeshan in Puretone if you're just starting out in Time.  The tanks are gonna need an absolute minimum amount of buffs on TZ cause he's going to fill your buffslots with all his detrimental shit.  Tallon also puts an agro debuff on the MT, so this is NOT a burn fight.  You raid is seriously gonna have to watch their agro.  Start off with an 8-10 cleric CH chain cause Tallon pumps out some spectacular dps (2nd most in Time).<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek - Level 71, ~1 million hp.  Spam heal fight.  Rampages.  Agro debuff on MT.  Spam heal fight.  Melee is identical to Tallon Zek just about, except now you have to deal with switch tanks.  Vallon has an evil timed proc that causes them to be stunned for like 20-30 seconds and go FD.  Just face it, you're not gonna single tank him unless your tank has a Darkblade and a shitton of Stun Resist.  If your clerics are on the ball, you really shouldn't have too many problems with him, but Vallon will weed out all but your top two or three tanks.  The stronger your tanks are and the faster your clerics are, the easier Vallon will be.  Vallon spawns two adds at 50% health.  These are insanely resistant, but can be dealt with pretty well with a wizard Strong root while you focus on Vallon.  You can also kill them, but we never do (really depends on your raid's dps... ours is huge).<br />
<br />
Terris Thule - Level 71 and has 2x AEs.  ~1 million hp.  Quads 800 to 1800 I think and rampages.  You need max MR for this fight (470+ to resist reliably).  If your clerics get hit by the AEs, then their mana is gonna go kapoof.  Pull her to the far left corner and corner her there.  Just have your tank at normal size rather than shrinking him to death.  I don't know if they changed it, but if your tank is in the water, you can't heal him.  The corner works fine though.  Terris spawns two waves of adds at various points in her health bar.  The mobs to the right of her (as if you were looking at her before you engage) are mezzable while the adds on the left are not.  Best advice is to just kill them as they spawn.<br />
<br />
Saryrn - Level 71, ~1 million hp, quads very similarly to TT and rampages.  For Saryrn, there are three sets of adds that various points in her health.  The right side is mezzable.  The left side is not.  They're not very strong, but they can easily kill clerics if left unattended.  You need max PR and DR resists for Saryrn's AEs, or otherwise she's gonna suck you dry.  You can use the beastlord Ferocity for this fight, but you cannot with TT.  <br />
<br />
Phase5:<br />
<br />
Cazic-Thule - Level 75, ~1.6 million HP, has the weakest melee output out of all the gods (rampages).  Spam heal fight.  He's designed for a Knight to tank, but a level 70 Warrior with 525mr+ shouldn't be feared at all.  You need max MR and PR for this fight.  CT silences and fears.  A good trick is to simply pull him into the port up room.  No adds. <br />
<br />
Bertox - Level 75, ~1.6 million HP, melee output is pretty high + he rampages.  His hitbx is huge, so don't pull him in the port up area.  We actually pull Bertox to CT's area.  No adds for this fight.  For Bertox, you need absolute max DR and PR (500 in each).  His AEs are hella nasty, and they're gonna rip your weakest links to shreads.  Like CT, I honestly think he's way easier than VZ/TZ are though, but he's still no slouch.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek - Level 75, ~1.6 million HP.  Huge AE rampage range (but you can still melee him at max distance just fine).  Melee output is the highest in Time by far and it intensifies even further as Rallos gets lower in health.  At 50% health to 25%, he flurries (though not very often).  The amount of dps Rallos puts on a tank is absolutely fucking crazy though, so expect to lose tanks with a 10 cleric perfect rotation when Defensive fades.  We use a 7 cleric rotation, but we lose the tank after Defensive fades usually.  I'm still the only one who has single tanked him all the way through.  =P  You'll often see Rallos turn around and hit people with like a 4k dd + stun.  It's random.  Just make sure your MR and FR are high for this fight and you should be fine.  Rallos spawns a wave of gimp ass adds every 15% of his health, so just kill them as they spawn.<br />
<br />
Inny - Level 75, ~1.6 million hp, and has about the same melee output as Bertox.  He also rampages (all Time gods rampage... just get used to it).  Pull him to the left corner so he's standing on top of the sarcophagus and start working him down.  Have your raid save an offensive disc for 20%.  You'll understand why - At 80%, he spawns a wave of adds that are pretty strong.  My guild simply root parks them and continues working on Inny.  At 20%, he spawns a second set of adds that have some pretty badass melee output.  For a new guild, I would suggest killing the first wave of adds and then root parking or kiting the second wave while the raid burns Inny down.  Inny fears, and he can fear you INTO Rallos Zek, so you're gonna need to kill RZ first (duh).  For this fight, you're going to need max FR and MR.<br />
<br />
Phase6:<br />
<br />
Quarm - Level 80, has ~1.8 to 2.2 million hp.  Quads 1000 to 3800, but is fully slowable.  His actual dps is very, very weak, but he's designed to one-round you (he's a rogue).  Use a steady 4 cleric rotation the tank and have the rest of the raid focus on keeping everyone else alive.  The corners/walls block the DoTs, but they don't block the AE-DDs... and he has 8 AEs (DDs + DoTS) total.  At 74, 49, and 24% of his health, he loses a head and completely debuffs himself, so he MUST be reslowed immediately.  He doesn't wipe agro though.  Every time he loses a head, he loses an AE, but I'm pretty sure his DoTs remain in tact.  In essense, Quarm gets a little easier as he gets lower in health, but don't underestimate him.  He also AE rampages, but only for 500 tops... very weak.<br />
<br />
Once you beat Quarm, don't go rushing off to the god damn orb thingy, haha.  Stay at the corpse until the loot is awarded, otherwise the script will start and Druzzil Ro will port your raid out to Knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-31-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Final tips for Time:<br />
<br />
1)  Do your epic 1.5's.   <br />
<br />
Time weaponry is by no means common.  In fact, you're likely to go months between seeing anything.  The new epics are better items than the Time class weapons anyways cept maybe a few (Warrior epic doesn't replace Darkblade, but it does make a magnificent complementary weapon ;))<br />
<br />
Fatesealer &gt; JTB<br />
Redemption &gt; GoC<br />
Innoruuk's Voice &gt; GoC<br />
Berserker Epic &gt; GoC (I had to say it cause some guilds have a Zerker =P)<br />
Heartwood Blade &gt; Timespinner<br />
Fistwraps of Celestial Discipline &gt; Shinai<br />
<br />
See the trend here?  Epic 1.5s are better items, period.  Except for the Time's Antithesis, Cleric hammer (cause cleric epic is a shield), Serpent of Vindication, and Darkblade, you can pretty much kiss the Time weapons good-bye. <br />
<br />
2)  Get into Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
You will still get FAR, far more loot over in raiding PoTime, but Ikkinz1/2 loot make for excellent supplementary sources.  Ikkinz2 is really where the money is, and you can farm it every 3 days.  Jagged Onyx Staves are ugly motherfuckers, but they add shittons of dps to your raid.  Jointed Scale Greaves.... yeah, holy shit.  Shale Shoulderpads aren't quite as good as Pauldrons of Devastation, but they are All/All and a lot more common (can't argue 225hp shoulders anyways and the focus effect is hella nice).  The bard horn is meh, but it is a very, very strong brass instrument (200atk from War March, anyone?).  Deathwrap of Rites pretty much says it all.  Ikkinz is not hard.   Graphically, it's pretty boring, but overall it's fun and well rewarding.  Get into it, and start working on it quickly.  The loot ouf of there will help you with the time gods tremendously. <br />
<br />
3)  Super size your tanks.  =P  <br />
<br />
No explanation needed.  When you see just how much dps the gods put out, you'll understand why. <br />
<br />
4)  See #1</div></div><hr />
