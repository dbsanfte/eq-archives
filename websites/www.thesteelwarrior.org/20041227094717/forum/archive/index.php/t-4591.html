<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice skill.  <br />
<br />
This is not aggro lock by any means.  Not even close.  According to Lucy it is 165 instant hate and then some sort of effect that lasts for one minute.  Not sure what this is.  Some have speculated that it is a hate dot of some sort.  When you cast it on yourself, it doesn't put an icon in your buff box, but you do get a &quot;wore off&quot; message after one minute.<br />
<br />
This is just awesome for pulling or tagging mobs off of the puller.  150 range is enough to not bother with your bow in most places.  Using it some 2-boxing my cleric last night it was also very handy for aggroing adds that came to camp, or tanking multiples without leaving your current target for more than a second.  It's also no damage, so you could presumeably use it to build some hate on mezzed mobs by switching targets for just long enough to hit the provoke button.  Didn't try this, but I'm almost sure it wouldn't break mez.<br />
<br />
Someone I was talking to in tells mentioned that it would be nice for splitting multipulls on mobs on raids as well.  <br />
<br />
This skill has a ton of possiblities, and is easily as good as all the other abilities put together.</div></div><hr />

The skill took 8% of my endurance at level 25 and my endurance was back up to 100% by the time it refreshed also. I think it will work wonders, pulling a mob off the puller, or an over agroing casters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the unknown effect that lasts for a minute is to avoid another warrior to use it on the same mob? Or for you to use it again when it refreshes?<br />
If Provoke refreshes after 30sec and the effect fades after 1 min, maybe it just blocks Provoke from working 2 times in a row on the same mob.</div></div><hr />

Terrors do, unless I'm smoking more crack that I remember, and there's little reason for this to be different. For all intents and purposes, that mob think you have just arrowed/hit it for whatever amount of damage is equal to 165 aggro.</div></div><hr />

Just a bad thing : it seems to be on the timer openings are using.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's going to pull mobs off of a overnuking wizard or allow shamans to slow on inc or anything, at least not at high levels, but it is definitely a nice little head start, and a way to get some instant aggro from a distance.  <br />
<br />
I agree, by itself, provoke won't pull a mob off a quick slow or overagroing caster but its a good headstart.<br />
<br />
One thing I noticed last night, only one time did I see it happen, not sure if it was a bug or a fluke, but I had provoke running, and if you're looking at the alt-c screen, the effect bar is counting down, I got an opening and my other three openings popped up but I didnt see the one I used take effect. I'll have to do a lot more testing to see if it was just a one time occourance or if you have one ability running, you can't use another. I believe it was just a fluke because I only saw it happen one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer some questions:<br />
<br />
1. Grongl and I tested the &quot;competing provokes&quot; issue last night in Kael.  Partially because I wanted to test if the Raex BP I was wearing would give me a greater &quot;provoke&quot; value than him who wasnt' wearing one.   Well, provoke lands from both warriors, and in the first instance he got it off right before I did, and the mob went for him, which could be attributed to the &quot;first come, first serve&quot; theory of initial aggro giving a bonus.   The second time, we got it off about the same time, and he got hit first, but the second I started meleeing it came to me.<br />
<br />
2. Yes, provoke does indeed trigger social aggro.    I pulled all 3 PoZ's in the building in Kael arena by provoking the middle one.<br />
<br />
3. Provoke is not affected by Furious Bash shields (no glowing red).<br />
<br />
4. Provoke cannot be used while sitting<br />
<br />
5. Provoke from max distance WILL pull a mob from a pet that has damaged the mob 70%.   I was with an Enchanter who DC'd a giant and killed down a mob to 30%, one provoke at max range brought the mob to me.  I can't wait to see if this happens on raids with 20 pets, half of them giant tigers and a mob in a crappy place.<br />
<br />
6. Provoke seems at this time to, for the first 10 seconds after it's used, disable the ability to press other openings skills.   The opening comes but the buttons dont come up.   I feel this is a bug which will be worked out before the 16th.<br />
<br />
7. PvP doesn't seem to have any ability to use openings and when provoke is used against an opponent in PvP, it messes up your own provoke timer.<br />
<br />
I'm still doing pretty extensive testing on this, as some unanswered questions that linger in my mind are:<br />
<br />
- Do the stun attacks generate aggro?   I am leaning toward no, since they use existing attack types (Kick/Slam).<br />
<br />
- Missing on special attacks:  I don't like waiting for openings and then missing on the special attack.<br />
<br />
- Opening duration is pretty good right now, it's long enough to give you a chance, without being stupid long.<br />
<br />
- Opening *frequency* is still way too low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was stated that the frequency would be low, because they didnt want to make melee into button mashers.  One to two a fight, in most cases will be all you get, and with decent specials, you wont need more than that, to be honest.  If the specials are weak, then yea, will need more than just a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So wait, do you  need to wait for one of these &quot;openings&quot; to use Provoke or not?  Are only some of the new skills like that?</div></div><hr />

Abilites and discplines will make a very nice combo when used with AA abilities.</div></div><hr />

yes im smoking crack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a direct hate ranged taunt + a 1 minute Hate over Time (Hate Dot). Basically, all of our openings could be total fluff and this would more than make up for them being useless (though they are not and some are actually quite useful). <br />
<br />
What's also cool about Provoke and other abilities is that they can put 'foci' of sorts on them, and I've been told that we'll be seeing exactly that come the next expansion. <br />
<br />
Finally, WAR PAL SHD items will drop and the Paladins will be the ones saying, &quot;what the fuck is this shit?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The only Openings that generate aggro are the ones designed to generate aggro (Infuriate, Slice, et al). The rest are coded like Divine Stun so very little aggro is generated if any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fascinating.<br />
<br />
Seriously, that's pretty damn cool, especially if it turns out like you say and you can reposition mob on a raid like that when pets are &quot;out of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No opening is required for this. Just a small endurance cost.&quot;<br />
<br />
On that note ... isn't it kind of odd that the best stuff being tested and used and talked about thus far are the non-opening based changes?<br />
<br />
Provoke has a lot of positive talk behind it.<br />
<br />
The mitigation change has a lot of positive talk behind it.<br />
<br />
Not much positive talk behind nerve spasm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Furor are you sure the lasting effect from Provoke isn't simply a marker to prevent use from repeatedly Provoking?  Knowing SOE I'm betting its a countdown marker that prevents us from multi-provoking.  One provoke per warrior every X ticks.  I know SOE is very leery of Warriors having aggro-lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darkoan, a few people have already confirmed that you can use provoke on a mob while it still has the old provoke on it (it wouldn't stack, but just start it over again), and a second warrior can use provoke while yours is still on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A shame they have already begun nerfing provoke before we even get it. I was on test the other day and the 150 range was perfect. Now its down to 100, which severely limits its use as &quot;picking&quot; tool on LDON raids and such(not enough safety range imo). <br />
<br />
I guess I wont be retiring my bow after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they &quot;nerfed&quot; it to give us a provoke line of abilities instead of a single ability that never scales. I believe the two bellows will be superior provokes.</div></div><hr />

That means is gained one more point of aggro every level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lvl 65 hitting provoke then the 2 bellows in a row, if you don't have to wait to use the other two, you just secured aggro at the start of the fight, 2 EB procs later, oh look, you're not losing aggro again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No need to test it.  Provoke isn't even 1/10 of the aggro a SK can put out, even without chain casting.  It's 1/7 of an EB proc every 30 seconds.  I am 4 adventures from buying Anger III for my Bloodfrenzy and BoC and there is no doubt in my mind that it will still be worth the points after the new system goes in.</div></div><hr />
