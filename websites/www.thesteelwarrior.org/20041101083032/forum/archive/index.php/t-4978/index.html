<br />
is my mag.  Can't remember the name of my arm (needed upgraded) and one wrist (crusty),  I am trying to get my guild to grow up a little and made this to tank when other tanks weren't available.  We are about to push into HoT finally and I am looking for a few upgrades.  Either Bazaarable to 2 groupable.<br />
<br />
Thanks.  Yall are great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bowedup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Please.  I have a farmer so small cash is not a problem.  I can't afford more that 10 on a peice though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jarrae Halliwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looks pretty good.  I'd start with those earrings though.  Lots of good ones out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree jarrae about the earings. they would probably be my first upgrade also. <br />
you look 3 times better then I did at that lvl.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For earrings for 10k each or so you should be able to get an Iron Scream Earring and a Blood Earring of Rage.  Bloodmetal earrings are a bit better but are higher in price.  I'd also replace the platinum fire wedding ring with another Valorium ring.  I'd also upgrade your BP to a Fine Heraldic or something with higher AC or wait for Champions or other Velious quest BP.  Copper Hammer of Striking would be nice for a mainhand weapon and then offhand your SotB but you may want to wait until you can camp it as hammer is pretty expensive.  When you get in that level range you can also camp the 31% haste belt in Droga or hit Veksar for the Soulscream Belt for a haste upgrade, although you have a real nice stat belt right now so you may want to keep the handwraps until you can get a CoF or CoCW or something better.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also Blood Earring of Rage and Iron Scream will up your dex a ton which will help your procs and you will also makes gains in your other stats as well without losing anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bowedup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks.  I am waiting on the rings and earring to go down in price (11-20k on Zeb), and people to start buying my bazaar stuff again.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of a decent questable or nodrop arm peice with Hp.<br />
<br />
On the BP. I am agnos so cultural is out.  (Back in the day it was cool to not hated.)  Holding out for the Vindi BP atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bowedup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do need to hit up Veskar abit.  On weapons, I was thinking of swapping to the 5pp staff at 55, so not planning to upgrade unless it is a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=893697<br />
<br />
Thats my magelo for comparison, need to upgrade one ring and get some anger procs added to weapons.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't hold out on hoping the prices dropping.<br />
<br />
If anything, the prices seem to be rising more than dropping.<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry: 12 - 15k (used to be 6 - 7k)<br />
Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement: 22 - 25k (used to be 18 - 20k)<br />
<br />
At least that's the situation on Rodcet Nife.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that as players move to higher content, places like Plane of Valor gets more empty, and the components get scarce, pushing prices up. Plane of Torment (where Bloodmetal components drop), have never been a crowded place anyway.<br />
<br />
Higher-end Rings like the Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience are most likely recycled back within the guild itself, and a few are sold in the Bazaar, so don't expect prices on that to drop anytime soon. (btw, Steel Rings are running at 70 - 80k per ring atm here).<br />
<br />
Just a heads up.</div></div><hr />
