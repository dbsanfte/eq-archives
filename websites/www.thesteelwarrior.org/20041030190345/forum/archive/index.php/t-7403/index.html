<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, what do ya'll think it's going to be like? Similar to the DBotW, a 1 handed weapon with a high damage, high delay or similar to a BoW, a 2 handed weapon? Perhaps a DW setup AND 2 handed weapon, like the first epic? How many and what augment slots? What kind of effects/procs? Will it be soul bound? Will there be prefered weapons in OoW?<br />
<br />
  I personally hope it's like the first epic, for those who prefer DW or 2 handed. I'd also be very impressed if it had multiple augment slots in it... A proc and 2 additional procs would be very cool. I'd like to see it have a clicky SK aggro buff, self only, in addition to a proc. I'd also love for it to stay in your hands when you die; a truly epic sword should never be parted from its warrior. And I hope, hope, HOPE it doesn't have a replacement for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take a good FUCKING look at the Dain Ring10 , Dain Shawl8. <br />
<br />
You turn the item to get another version as you progress.<br />
Doing the same with a weapon is a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
Step 1 :   20/20 200hp 10ac  0% Proc Mod<br />
Step 2 : 24/23 220hp 20ac    5% Proc Mod<br />
Step 3 : 25/23 220hp  30ac  10% Proc Mod<br />
Step 4 : 30/25 250hp 30ac 15% Proc Mod<br />
Step 5 : 32/30 280hp 40ac  20% Proc Mod<br />
Step 6 : 35/30 300hp 50ac 25% Proc Mod<br />
Final Step : 40/30 350hp 50ac 40% Proc Mod<br />
<br />
Next Epansion ?<br />
<br />
Step 8 : ...<br />
Step 9 : ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Simple, Easy, Efficient. And no &quot;clicky buff, dual procs&quot; etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
Give the &quot;Augmented Epic&quot; to a NPC , get back &quot;Un Augmented Epic &amp; Augment&quot;<br />
Give &quot;Un Augmented Epic&quot; + &quot;Step 4 component&quot; get back &quot;Step 5 Epic&quot;<br />
<br />
You dont have to be a rocket scientist to make good interesting rewarding loots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
simple logic is so difficult sometimes ( /wink soe ). that scalable epic idea is nice !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I love that scalable epic. (I love the Coldain Ring quests and am currently working on the 9th ring off and on.)<br />
<br />
I'd guess the chances are very low that Epic 2.0 will look anything like that, though. Didn't I read something about there being 16 different quests that you can choose from in order to get the thing? I wonder if the quest path you follow will have an impact on the resulting item.<br />

<br />
16 quests, one for each class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apokolipse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Has it been officially mentioned whether or not you need your first epic in order to obtain the second?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey maybe bring up the idea of scalable epic in the summit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You dont need the first epic to do any quest / subquest of the Epic 2.0.<br />
<br />
But hey, I always thought that to get to 2.0 you had to go thru 1.0 first!<br />
No wait, they never really used logic behind anything, let alone names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe they can call this one the &quot;Jagged Blade of Work&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You will NOT need epic1 to get epic2. However, having epic1.0 will allow you to skip some steps of 2.0. This has been verified on the official forums.</div></div><hr />
