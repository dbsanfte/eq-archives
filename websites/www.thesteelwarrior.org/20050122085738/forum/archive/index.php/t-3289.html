I am lvl 64, and have never been on a raid...gear in the Maeglo....  <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, with the new LDoN stuffs, it seems that the 'uber' folks who usually spend their time in the elemental planes are...well...slummin' it on thier down time and playin' in the dungeons.   Am I really that low that I have cleric's bitching cuz they hafta actually HEAL me, or are these part-time pickup folks just lazy.  There is no real NEED for 10k hits in these little 90 minute adventures...<br />

<br />
There you have it in a nutshell. It's nothing to do with laziness, it's because the cleric is used to 'little 90 minute adventures' being '35 minutes of fighting and 10 minutes afk adventures' where the wizards have 7khps. Would you cringe about joining a group of L50s who could manage but would have to med after each pull?<br />
<br />
I've got a ykesha auged BoWar and heal agro is still an 'issue' at times, especially on multiple pulls, or if a gater or runner gets away.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, to an elemental cleric who is used to doing this stuff in 30 minutes on Normal setting, you prolly made him cry cause he isn't used to our level of gear. Elemental+ people are playing EQ on a different level than many of us, its just a fact. Though they have certainly been at our level at some point, they leveled together and knew what to expect then. It is easy to get out of touch like that when they are healing 10k tanks.<br />
<br />
On the other hand you are lacking in a few spots. Cobalt boots have a fine buff and sometimes I wish i still had a pair, but really you maybe should look into something else. I see you have several slots of Cultural and those are quality pieces that will hold you a good while. Glimmering Mithril Torque needs to go bye bye for a Clattering Bone or something equivalent. Perhaps a different haste, something affordable with good stats such as Soulscream Belt. It is easily campable and a quality item.<br />
<br />
 You have 3 AA and are level 64. I dinged 60 during PoP and stayed that way till I have 30 aa so I would have ND3 and AE taunt plus some defensive. I can promise you that you will indeed feel a difference. I know when you ding 65 AA will be your concern, but in truth it does have an effect and your regular group members will notice when you get some more and upgrade a few slots. <br />
<br />
Please please take this as friendly criticizm from a fellow non-uber warrior. I am certainly no elitist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know as a ogre war I have cultural armour available that's good, but seriously, naked at 59 I have like 2k something, virtue makes it 3.something   so you really need to get out of LDoN or anywhere else and get some freaking armour.</div></div><hr />

I have a 61sk that has 4200hp so i can see the shock but as long as the cleric didnt leave the adventure and kept you all alive i wouldnt call it lazy but as mentioned just kinda sheltered in our own little &quot;uber world&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very surprised you've never raided in 64 levels, whether or not you enjoy it, it's going to (and has) hurt you.<br />
<br />
I'm 65 now (just dinged Thursday) and I have 4270 hp unbuffed, my only AAs are Run3 Regen3 and ND1. At 64 at I had 4219 hp (had ND1 then too), that's 968 more HP than you, that's like you being a Knight, except without the benefits.<br />
<br />
By the way, I have very slightly above average gear.</div></div><hr />

1.  Electrum Black Sapphire Earring<br />
2.  Clattering Bone Necklace was a good call<br />
3.  Valorium Rings of Gallantry x2!  Camp the stuff in Valor, much easier<br />
<br />
Go ahead and get 65, then spend some time in PoP and get to ND3.  Those are just a couple things I see which you can pretty easily do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When your gear is lacking, you really need to grind out the AAs to make up for it. Having outleveled your gear puts your entire group in a difficult situation, but AAs can really help mitigate it.</div></div><hr />

Admittedly I've got some decent items, but nothing that an Elementals guild couldn't upgrade.<br />
<br />
I play a cleric too -- if you told me you can't get past 5K with Virtue, I'd be shitting bricks. Yeah, most of the time it won't matter, but sometimes it will, and at the worst possible time. For instance, as a cleric I kinda hope you can tank a bit without heals while I heal the chanter/slower/etc on a 3 or 4 pull. If I have to heal the tank like he's a chanter, it's gonna hurt the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be shocked and somewhat unhappy with a tank that at level 64 has only 600 more HPs than I do.  I'm far from uber - the uber clerics have 2k HPs more than you do and probably better AC as well.  I don't think it is laziness to expect a tank to have decent gear by the time they get to 65.  Rather I might say that it could be considered lazy to not improve your gear as you level.  Raid level gear not everyone can get but anyone can get some of the more common drops to improve - either by camping them or by saving money and buying them in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure that I'm not unreasonable and I'm risking upsetting some people here (and I really really like this board) but I'll be honest and say that I'd expect a 65 tank to get to at least 6k HPs with buffs.  Anything under that and I would worry a bit - if his gear is that bad I would wonder if he could hold agro (which in your case may not be a problem but in most cases bad gear will have bad weapon as well).<br />
<br />
EDIT cause I thought of something that might help instead of just being critical... You might want to hit Veksar.  XP isn't great there but it isn't horrible either and you could probably duo the haste belt camp with a shaman although a group would be more fun.  Several drops in veksar would be upgrades for you including Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21731), Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21133), Shadowbone Ring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22394), and Soulscream Belt (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21436)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're not being unreasonable.  There are plenty of people who need to stop leveling, and let their gear catch up so they're not a liability in the groups they are forced to get at 65.  You should be able to tell if you're doing good or not...if you're getting your ass kicked, then it's time to do some plat farming and go shopping.</div></div><hr />

Gonna stop leveling at 62 and cram defensive AA till ND3 and maybe a few others.... ill never see elemental planes so ill prolly do LDoN with friends till i have the needed AA (ill never be MT because i will be grouping with a 65sk who can buff to over 11k hp and im there to leech AA exp and maybe offtank an add)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would still say level &gt; AA but gear is something completely different.  Take some time off the xp camps to camp a few upgrades and the levels and AA will be less frustrating for you and the people who group with you (you-generic not you-poster since you-poster already said you were doing this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But isn't it funny how you get a large group of people that say Levels &gt; all, then when people follow that advice they are told that they are severely underpowered? <br />
<br />
Yes, which is why the question of levels or stopping and working on AA needs to be adressed by the individual rather than a cookie cutter response.<br />
<br />
It is still the most efficient path to level 60 first, then do AA's...there is no doubt at all whatsoever, like if you see those Veteran 55's...ya, they're wasting time.  At 60 however, it's time to stop and assess your situation.  Who you're grouping with, where you're hunting, what gear you have, what gear you can get should all play a major role in deciding whether or not you should climb to 65 or stay at 60 and work on some AA's WHILE IMPROVING YOUR GEAR.  Things get no better at 65 for XP if you can't take the assbeating that comes with it.  I'm sure we'll get some elemental geared guys in here talking about how fast they get AA's at 65 and how it's way more efficient to be 65 in any situation, but they're wrong.  You slap Joe 3khp in a BoT group and you ain't gonna be getting dick for XP.  You're gonna get a reputation as an underequipped warrior and you're not gonna get any groups, which is gonna cause you to make a post in the tavern about how you're retiring and your class is underpowered because you can't get a group.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the gear to tank things that level 65's need to tank to get XP, then you need to stop and get some AA's to make up the gap while you're still marginally effective doing level 60 content, and improve your gear while you're at it.  A level 65 in full crusty is gonna get his ass kicked, and being level 65 isn't gonna save you from that fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are in a tough situation but there are some things you can do that can easily help a bit. First, look at your gear and anything that does not have hps you need to trash. Arms, neck, and boots being the most obvious. You need hps and stamina badly. It may even be a good idea to spend some aa points on innate stamina (You should be able to get 2aa in 4 hours time easily). <br />
<br />
Also, the stamina augments seem to drop frequently for me in Ruj Hills in LDoN. A few of those for you could go a long way. <br />
<br />
Since you are 64, I would get to 65 then grind out the aa's. They will make a huge difference in your hps and damage taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loredena</div><div class="date">09-28-2003, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, you need to focus on gear with stamina and hitpoints.  I know that at 52 I have 3200 hitpoints before buffs.  With a 52 cleric's buffs (NOT virtue) I have 4400.   You really need to work on gear if I can beat you on hitpoints, and clerics ARE going to cringe.   At 65,  you're going to get the same reaction I have when my cleric has a paper ranger as the tank.....</div></div><hr />

Quite honetsly we are not exactly well suited to farming to make cash, even at high lvls. But seeing as you can wear Brell armor, you are in a far better situation than agnostic warriors. <br />
<br />
You can farm Hill giants to make some money if you really want, but I personally made most cash from buying and reselling at a profit in the bazaar. Keep a lookout for rare items and people who are oocing who sound like they are desperate to sell. <br />
<br />
One example of something I did (which won t make you a lot these days as the cat is out of the bag) was to get the bundle of super conductive wires from poI and then buy the other drops for the Cloak of pernicity. If you kept your eyes open, it used to be possible to make 6-8k on that alone. As said, this won t work anymore as there are too many cloaks now, but you can look for something similar. <br />
<br />
If your guild is mostly 60 plus, join some HoT raids. If they can t raid HoT.......you are in the wrong guild most likely.<br />
<br />
Cheap hp earring would be an earring of the solstice. Draconic Pauldrons is another easy to abtain quest item. And if you can t get the drop, try and buy the MQ for Myrmidons Gauntlets; they plain rock and are very hard to beat.<br />

And he has no hp AA's yet.<br />
I didnt look at your profile, your best bet for hp upgrades will probably be a mix of mq for SS armor, some ornate which you can camp in BoT, and maybe cultural.<br />
I have healed SK's with 4200 hp buffed (back then with aego) in PoV and its more work than fun.<br />
LDoN mobs dont hit that hard but hard enough that considered your on limited time in some adventures it will hit your healers mana regen especially if you have no chanter or bard.<br />
And even if you have a bard, most of them are pulling in LDoN and dont play manabattery for the casters convenience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a 65 warrior and a 65 cleric... and, honestly, if my cleric ended up grouping with a tank whose hp was that low in pov or up, and a warrior to boot (doesn't bring agro lock to the group to make up for the low hp) - he'd develop a sudden LD problem.<br />
<br />
It's just not worth the hassle when the warrior has less hp than the ranger/rogue/shaman/cleric in the group. I would suggest camping plat or grouping with friends only before you try to get pickup groups. It's easy to reach 6k buffed with bazaar gear and not a ton of plat, no need to be in elemental guilds for that.<br />
<br />
Like Haas mentioned, it's not worth developing a reputation as an under-geared warrior. It's bad enough people aren't that hot to group with warriors, when they start to remember your name as one to avoid on top of that - you may as well retire.</div></div><hr />

At 64??  *blink... blinks some more*  Yes, that cleric should have woken up and adjusted himself to his tank, but, there's things on your end you can do.  (I've been thru the &quot;4200 hp with virtue&quot; SK/Pally tanks thing as a cleric.  It is not fun, but I do my best to make it work, provided the tank is not braindead.)  <br />
I'm only 63 with 45aa, yet I hit 4625 unbuffed.  I'm about as far from uber as ya can get.  The most difficult things I've tanked to date are along the lines of Vindi/Halls of Testing/Trakanon.  <br />
Forget that stupid mantra of 65 &gt; all.  You need to take at little time to work up ND3 and farm/quest/buy some more hp gear.  <br />
At 61, I took stock of how much of a beating I was taking in exp groups.  I was not happy with my performance, so I decided to get some aa at each level as I went.  <br />
<br />
A few suggestions I'd offer, in addition to grinding out that aa, these will take time:<br />
<br />
Ears: quest up an earring of the solstice, hunt or buy mosquito leg earings, or save for bloodmetals, all 3 are very decent earrings.<br />
<br />
Neck: camp/buy clattering bone, or pick up a brellium collar (I'm content with my cultural neck til I can find a quest for something better.)<br />
<br />
Arms/feet/hands: Pick up some brellium, or camp some thurg or possibly get some friends together and give halls of testing a try.  (I normally do HoT with 12 people or less.)  <br />
<br />
Belt: I am not 100% sure on this, but I seem to recall taunt mods not being as effective once you have capped your taunt skill.  I could be wrong. /shrugs   I'd hit veksar and camp a soulscream belt, which would upgrade your haste as well.  If you want to keep your haste in a different slot, a brellium girdle will be decent, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a legit target for you will be around 4k unbuffed...folks have given all sorts of equip advice...I'd suggest chokidai spauldors for your shoulders if you can swing it...it would be a nice bump in HP/sta.<br />
<br />
The other thing is to get your ND/PE/PP AAs up.  Those will add a good chunk of HPs as well.  <br />
<br />
Some context: generally you should be lookin at around 6k buffed as a &quot;casual&quot; 65 warr.  A non VT warr is usually around 7-7.6k buffed.  A VT-ellie is in the 8-10k+ range buffed.  So the Cleric you were dealing with had under half the usual HP pool to deal with, substantially less AC and a heck of alot less AA mitigation in play (CS/CA/LR/ID).  So in short it wasnt so much he was lazy as he had a good challenge on his hands ;-)<br />
<br />
Persevere....the accumulation of gear is many yeared process.  Stick with your friends though...IMHO that is more valuable than uber guild-uber loot any day.</div></div><hr />

Nothing better than that in the game for me.... and look at my gear... not shabby for a guild with only 11 peeps (friends only guild).</div></div><hr />

<br />
An agnostic warrior in that same 11 person guild would have a much harder time.</div></div><hr />

Still some possble upgrades just by looking over your profile.<br />
Cloak of the maelstrom.<br />
Earring of solstice over that either earring.<br />
Belt is a bit harder, heavy rubicite probably still expensive but get some friends and go to Cazic Thule to camp it yourself.<br />
And as other said there are some nice upgrades coming from LDoN via augments or armor drops.<br />
Getting them shouldnt be an issue with guild groups.<br />
AC 54 bp from NRo camp bejeweled architect or something like that, greaves of the orc master from ec camp and some ac 27 boots (more for a bard but way better than cobalt).<br />
Not to mention you will have an easier time tanking LDoN adventures than PoV or BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FH armor is nice, but even comparing a full suit of FH vs a full suit of Brellium, the difference is like 400hp. It is significant, but non-RZ or Tribunal (which actually has better stats) isn't exactly worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, 3400 hits and under 1200 AC unbuffed looks very low for a level 64 guy.  I'm level 60 with a full set of growth armor, my defensive AAs aren't maxed, and still I have over 4000 hits and about 1175 AC.  At those numbers I can tank most things ok in Tier 2, but if I had 600 less hits it'd be really rough going.  Now I don't know how hard the stuff in level 64-65 adventures hits, but if it's anything like Tier 2 monsters or higher you might be sucking up quite a lot of mana on healing.  I'm also unguilded and got all the equipment on my own from public raids and the bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is that you should consider upgrading your equipment/AAs a bit and get closer to 4000+ hits.  If you're a lot less than that you're going to have a really hard time tanking stuff like tier 2+ mobs, and you can forget about tanking things in BoT or HoH groups.  With only 3400 hits they'd kill you before the cleric even got a complete heal off.   You don't need 7000 unbuffed hit points to tank in these places, but for sure 3400 is too low.</div></div><hr />

You're right, not exactly worthless.</div></div><hr />
