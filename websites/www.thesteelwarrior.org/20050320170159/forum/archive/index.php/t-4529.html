<br />
I've been learning a lot from some of the very experienced warriors here, for which you have my gratitude, but I have come to find that this bboard focuses a great deal on stats, numbers, character level, etc.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I am interested in those topics and would like to learn more about them... however my primary interest is in roleplaying, and in creative biography of characters.  I write fanfic about my character, one of the biggest reasons I enjoy playing.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if any of you recommend some good bboards where players discuss roleplaying, where fanfic is posted and discussed.  I have found a few, but would also like to know what recommendations some of you might have.<br />
<br />
Please, have another round on me.<br />
<br />

Ealsur, I checked out the sites (thanks) and looks like the Firiona Vie bboard is a nice place to hang.  If I can ever get my ez-boards account working there, I may eventually post something.  <br />

He's me to the core.  (being a big savage in RL helps that immensely) :)  Recently I&quot;ve seen a revival in RP interest, and I really like that.  Breaking the game down into nothing but min/maxing stats just gets tedious.</div></div><hr />

And the best of all, go Anon to your home town, and buy loads of stacks of booze, give away booze and cookies to newbies, chat a bit with em, and watch em run around drunk :D</div></div><hr />

Thank the goddess someone here speaks my language.  RP is what gives depth to the game and makes it worthwhile.  If you're ever on Firiona Vie, please feel free to send me a tell.<br />
