<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious since I cant find any guild websites mentioning it, but I have heard that it supposedly have been killed.<br />
<br />
(and for those who dont know tacvi, its the first named of the north wing there, the south wing have already been cleared).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I heard, it hasn't been killed yet. ( was yesterday ).<br />
So if it has been killed it was within the last 12h ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WTB: archoverseers website update plzkkthxla~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont ya just love watching those snakes march around the room ~~..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>foglor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I get the feeling from what happens on this fight around 50% that she's not going to be killed any time to soon.  I like the concept of the encounter though. Just hoping they'll tune it to be actually possible to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">imo its not killable presently, which is kind of weird to me...usually by the time the release a new expansion, the end zone of the previous one has been farmed for several months...it looks like when oow comes out, the end zone of the previous expansion still wont even be tuned... makes me want to run out &amp; purchase more content right now, lemme tell you!<br />
<br />
tacvi mobs should drop 3 loots each too imo !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The sad thing is, there's really no new mod's or must have items in Tacvi that would help you in the next expansion.  You can pretty much skip it all, most of the stuff is just Time clones with a little extra tacked on here and there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We tried this mob again a few times. That 4K AE every 22 secs once you hit 50% really needs to get fixed, and fast.<br />
<br />
I realize the devs all probably have been moved to work on the OoW expansion, but how hard would it be to make the AE hit every 45 sec instead? Or make it at least somewhat resistable.<br />
<br />
This unfinished business crap is not really making one want to push very hard in OoW, since its not hard to figure out that there probably are similar artificial roadblocks/unfinished content at the OoW just like Tacvi is STILL unfinished to this day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it could be worse, they could make you farm bane weapons for tunat ala emp and have parts only drop in oow zones, then make all the parts no drop and the smithing trivial 330 on top of that ala original seru~.</div></div><hr />

Hasn't been beaten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hasn't been beaten. <br />
<br />
What makes you so sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Probably because all the guilds stuck at that point keep bitching about the impossibility of the encounter in its current state =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">http://www.lavanet.no/rf/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Does Kretv have to be dead to kill Tunat Muram?  I haven't heard of any progress on Tunat either and I thought people have cleared to him via the south path?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">4000 damage every 22 seconds?  Now, I have no clue as to what pertains to the encounter, but the only *remote* way of keeping up with that kind of healing power is to place a cleric in every group who's sole purpose is casting Word of Replenishment (a massive group heal + cure).  While the base heal is 2500hp (1100mana and a SHITTON of agro), healing focuses and AAs should put it at or above the 4000 hp mark.<br />
<br />
Ok, with that said and done, the above is COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE unless you have 17 of the 54 people in your raid playing a cleric class.  That sounds pretty freakin' stupid to me.  =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If everyone has 35% spellshield it'd cut the damage to 2600.<br />
<br />
But it's probably not reasonable to expect an entire raid to be able to come up with 35% spellshield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That's a lot of SS items :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>issu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">seems test server changed the AE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rampagious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sources say its still untuned even at 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yup, still untuned/bugged/impossible.<br />
<br />
We suspect a bug in the listed resists, because we should be resisting a lot more than we are with maxed L70 resists. Don't think anyone has gotten past the 3rd round.<br />
<br />
We also found another bug which resulted in the doors becoming perma-locked if you wiped at the wrong time. Fun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Either Lucy lies, or the AE is bugged, should be easily resistable with 550MR...is not.  And yes, we've gotten past the third wave.  This event is not impossible, but clearly is out of whack.<br />
<br />
Sort of reminds me of that one Primal in Yxxta that AE'd every 5 seconds or so, when GoD first released...we killed it with a SR chain and ranged dps, but it clearly wasn't designed to be done that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The resist mods do not tell the whole story.  I remember in Time, Cazic's PR -150 AE would land way more often than Bertox's PR -300 AEs.  Druid swarm lines save at a measly -100 MR and they routinely land on 500 MR.  I suspect some spells or perhaps NPCs just have an automatic chance to land spells, like how Enchanter NPCs used to have a chance to land anything regardless of resists just because they're Enchanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Would be nice if the muramite trials we're fixed so we can actually keep the reward as well...<br />
<br />
As a warning, when you train aa after a trial win, you lose the trial in your aa window.  It's completely bugged out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Would be nice if the muramite trials we're fixed so we can actually keep the reward as well....<br />
<br />
Rashere made a post on eq live regarding this (sorry, it's off topic).  No word on when it will be fixed on that thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're aware of the issue with the Trials of Mata Muram reward and are looking into what is going on.  Your progress through the trials is tracked on your character, so once we have a fix in place, the designer behind the trials will add a mechanism to the trials to grant you all of the ones you should have gotten up to that point if you don't have them any more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sort of reminds me of that one Primal in Yxxta that AE'd every 5 seconds or so<br />
<br />
lol, what where they thinking when they did this, I'm happy they changed it but it was fun as hell trying to figure out how to kill it with that ae!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rampagious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Defeated late last night....finally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Tied it again last night, nothing had changed expect possibly slightly lower hp on the adds. Did you beat him via the same 'creativity' as elsewhere? Don't care either way, just interested if it's actually beatable 'as intended'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Triton beat it on the 27th straight up, no /dzswapping in healers or anything gay like that.<br />
<br />
Its crazy hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rokkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">yeah, that snake is a bitch for real.  i hope they retune it a bit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">There seem to be a new change to Ikaavs Venom on test:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=751&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Although I have no idea what unknown191 is :)<br />
<br />
But one could hope it was something to make the AE a little bit more resistable, even lvl 70s with mata muram trials and resistance AAs seems to get hit by it alot more than they should, given the &quot;only&quot; -300 resist mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">nm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">FINALLY beat him on Zeb. Straight up, no 'creative' strats either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Was nice to see this come togethor, part of me is psyched, part of me is sorta pissed it took this long, but im not gonna bitch about it hehe.</div></div><hr />
