<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello I am confused about what weapons I should use to get the best performance. I usually use Copper Hammer and Horn of Hsagra (&lt;3 old school). I recently bought a Split Blade of Destruction. I'm not sure what weapon combo to use to get the best results. Here is my Magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=698294. Just tell me what I need to do and i'll get it. BoC is out of my reach and I would have to lose cowl+boots for a SoD but that would bring me down. Please tell me what to do!<br />

Thank you for helping<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well...I'm not sure which one too go with. I know warriors arn't supposted to be damage but thats what I like. What ever is the best is what Im going to go for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ditch the HoH and SBoD and buy a Sword of the Bloodsworn, which is 12/19 75dd + 0.0 stun.  Use the extra plat to buy some sort of upgrades for your range, arms, or bracer of fortitude, as all lack alot of ac and raw hp.  You could probably buy a piece of ornate or two with the money, which will more than cover the ac/hp loss from the HoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What range, arms, bracer should I upgrade to? And what other pieces of my gear should I upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how about this for a compromise? sell the split blade and buy a copper hammer of striking and a sword of the bloodsworn. ALSO buy a velium gemmed ... what is it a longsword? or a battlehammer. if i got the names wrong im refering to the 2hb and 2hs versions in the velium gemmed series. they each go for about 25k on veeshan and if im remembering right are 34/28 weapons .. a nice little GoD upgrade to the war marshal blade. it will do more damage than the split blade with hsagra and give you more eye candy too. so you win in terms of damage when you dont need agro and agro when you dont need damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On the Velium Gemmed, will it beat my windblade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At your level no, once it hits full ratio at 65 yes by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I sold my split blade and now I have 200k in the bank. I want a nice weapon, more high end then a sword of the bloodsworn to go along with my copper hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kodoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For 200k you won't be able to get a better agro weapon than SoTB to go with your Copper Hammer...  So just get a SoTB, and have a nice 195k to spend on other upgrades like Ornate Vambraces, Ornate Bracer, and/or an Elemental Bow for later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Balkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">53 troll warrior with all that equipment and 200k ... .... ... he has better stuff then my level 65 :(((((((((( /cry irl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well thank you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">haha =) just sold another thing, up to 245k now<br />
<br />
Keep giving me more ideas what pieces of my gear i can upgrade. I want the best out of my warrior. I was thinking of getting 55 and get some ornate arms and gaunts. im not sure what to do on my combo with my weapons. dont be shy, tell me where I suck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well lets see .. the shoulders have only 5ac. i notice the high stamina and hitpoints but its still something worth looking at upgrading. many use the formula that 1ac is worth 5hp for selecting gear. and hp from sta is often wasted if you have good group buffs that cap your stamina.<br />
<br />
i think one upgrade you might actually enjoy a little would be the ornate gaunts. the self haste buff is useful surprisingly often. even on raids im occasionally glad i have it. more so on single group encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Reyden Stormchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, Im focusing now just to get 55 so I can get some ornate.<br />
