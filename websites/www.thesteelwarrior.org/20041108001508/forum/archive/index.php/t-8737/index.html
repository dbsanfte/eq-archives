<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warhead42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I'm on the Torvonnilous server, and I'm curious as to how many time flagged guilds there are on other servers.  On my server, I know of the following guilds that are time flagged:<br />
<br />
Blades of Wrath<br />
Immortals Rising<br />
Blood &amp; Guts<br />
Voices Within<br />
New Dawn Rising<br />
Nexxus of Faith<br />
<br />
I think there's 1 other that I just can't remember the names to, which is a total of 7 guilds that are time flagged.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  Is this a roughly average number?  Are we top heavy?  Are we slow in progressing?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is that I'm a level 57 warrior, and I love being a warrior, but I don't want to be so far down the totem pole for progression that I'll never have a legitimate shot at zoning into time.  My guild is small and casual, which is fine for me for now, but when I reach level 70 (no way in hell I'll get to 65 before OoW) and have my critical AAs done, I'll want to get into progresson and have a legitimate shot at MTing.<br />
<br />
Are there any servers out there without ANY time flagged guilds?  I don't intend to spend the money to transfer my character to another server, but I would like to have a better chance at progression.  I think that I can easily rebuild a character to where I'm at now on Torvonnilous in a month.<br />
<br />
Info would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

A list of Time guilds on every server; its not totally accurate, since it isnt updated anymore, but itll give you a good idea of how you compare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warhead42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Phenomenal, that's EXACTLY what I was looking for.  Thank you very much for posting that link!<br />
<br />
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Stromm (the newest server) only has 1 time flagged guild.  There's definitely some room for progression there.<br />
<br />
Fizzle Dings!  I knew there were 7, I just couldn't come up with that one.  Thanks again for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tholuxe Paells as far as I know has 5:<br />
<br />
Malus Imperium<br />
Tod und Teufel<br />
Altered State<br />
Eternal Sovereign<br />
Crusaders Valorous<br />
<br />
There was a 6th guild, Crystal dawn, who folded a few months back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Three time guilds on Stromm now.Realm of Insanity,Haven's Edge and my guild Final Door.<br />
<br />
There are about 6 or 7 guilds in EP's a couple of which need Rathe and Coirinav.I expect OOW to see a few of these guilds in time quickly hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keepers of the Faith has folded on Prexus; some old active members joint raid with Unity, but they are not a force of their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually for bertoxx is kinda accurate although its missing 2 guilds and 1 of the alliances still up on that list hasnt existed for like 6 months, but it has the time phases for the time guilds right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Povar:<br />
<br />
Blades of Law<br />
Firestormers<br />
Forces Unknown<br />
