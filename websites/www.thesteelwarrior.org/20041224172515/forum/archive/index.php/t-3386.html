I can't argue with that. I certainly understand the frustration. We put those things up there to let you know what we want to work on, but there are always a lot of other things to work on, and priorities are what they are. It's far easier to identify simple issues with mana to damage ratios for spells and things like that than it is to review an entire set of classes. And, while this won't make anyone happy, keep in mind that we are not saying that we'll make dramatic changes here. Classes are not that out of balance.<br />

since you said this crap i have seen newbie troll and erud quests, new focus items and some zone revamps, this all takes a priorty over class balance? i mean NEWBIE QUESTS for a 10 ac TUNIC?!<br />
<br />
someone beer me fast please i think im gona go be sick in the corner for a bit<br />
<br />
honestly sorry for the outburst but i feel sick now, and i see absor doesnt like cursing so i will try to watch it in the hopes he will talk to us</div></div><hr />

I remember the old sony boards, Abashi was the one who would basically post and tell people to shut the fuck up, eat their peas, go to bed and like it. The man was a total asshole.<br />
<br />
Then they hire absor. Now here's someone who's actually said not nice things about sony on the site he used to write for. And at first things were good but then sony through money at him and he sold out and became a whore putting whatever spin his pimps asked him to. I only like to watch his posts now to see what new load of shit he'll spew.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how far some people will sell out and how fast, for a little cash.</div></div><hr />

While it might be ok to challange something he wrote in a post or two, a month of seeing that sig and reading gratuitous ridicule just might make him disinclined to post when it's not absolutely required.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So he never post here anyway. In the words of the shadowknights we whine more then any other class out there. Oh yeah all we do is mash taunt button aswell.</div></div><hr />

And that affects us how?  He ignores any real issues and only visits to promote a new product.  Personally I'd rather not see him on any of the boards, as he is deceptive and completely out of touch with EQs playerbase.  Its funny to read that thread again, and as soon as you see someone challenge his &quot;classes are not that out of balance&quot; remark, he runs and hides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Terrorus<br />
<br />
Do a search on this board for posts from 'AbsorEQ'. It's really kind of funny to expect him to come here and discuss anything here. For all the customer service he does at this board, he could be replaced with a Pet Rock.<br />
<br />
 Edit: Basic grammar is my friend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't remember which. It was one I'd never read at that point. I do remember shortly after he showed up alot of people being happy because he wasn't a Verant kiss ass. If I remember correctly his biggest attack on Verant was regarding the first EQ &quot;strategy guide&quot; which his review shredded.<br />
<br />
This would be the same guide that placed such importance on Cha throughout the game so I blew 5 points in it~<br />
<br />
I keep wanting to say it was stratics but I don't think it was, I think the site was pretty much dead even back then.<br />
<br />
I do find it amussing that the boards became heavily modded after he took over tho. You used to just type and hit post and there it was. After he took over they changed it to send the post to us we'll review it and decide if it's worthy. Yes that cut down on the amount of flame wars and whining a bitching (much of it done by warriors) but it also allowed sony to only post those posts that they &quot;approved&quot; of. <br />
<br />
They also killed all the old threads, Faves such as abashi telling us to go fuck ourselves there never will be an npc in cities to bind melee classes.<br />
<br />
The thing that pissed me off most about the Censoring of the boards tho was that they had been running the Class threads for some time. Warriors being the last to get a thread. Every other class for the most part had been taken care of but the warrior threads were still going strong and all of a sudden wham no more. Course I think there ended up being like 7 warrior class discussion threads and the max any of the others hit was like 3 (cept necros they went to 5 I think).<br />
<br />
I honestly preferred Abashi as much as I despise the man he was at least honest. He never did spin. He told you straight out fuck you give us your money kiss our asses and like it. He had no problem telling that to anyone. Abswhore just picks and chooses where he'll post his spin and pretends the rest don't exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah crap I just forgot what it was!<br />
<br />
<br />
But this isn't the guy that wrote for MobHunter. That's Moorgard...and like Absor, he's changed for the worse....</div></div><hr />
