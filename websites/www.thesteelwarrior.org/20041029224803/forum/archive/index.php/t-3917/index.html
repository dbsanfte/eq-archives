<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question for you:<br />
<br />
I want to pick up the type 3 augment (miraguls, 760 points) that gives +8% dodge.  However, I have nowhere to put it.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a slot that wont be replaced by elemental (see magelo if youre interested in really analyzing the best spot for this aug).  I am thinking earring or ring would be nice, but so far I have not seen any.  And my @#$% LDoN vendor database link wont work.<br />
<br />
So - any suggestions for an item that meets the following criteria:<br />
<br />
1.  has a type 3 slot<br />
2.  is in a non-elemental armor slot<br />
3.  can be augmented to at least 80 hp or more<br />
<br />
thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mir 1492  <br />
Earring of Silent Screams<br />
Lore, AC:5, Cha:5, HP:75, Mana:75, FR:5, DR:5, CR:5, MR:5<br />
type1, type2, type3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know this is going to sound silly but: upgrade your BP to Royal Attendant from Vindi?  I'm not sure how far away you are from Raex but that would seem to be a good spot for the moment.  You have a nice magelo profile...not alot of soft spots to work with.<br />
<br />
Another idea: is Silver Face Mask of the Steelslaves: AC: 12 HP: +75 MANA: +75 SV All: +7 Rec type1, type2, type3	(1492 Tak)<br />
<br />
could make ac 22 115hp dodge?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At work now so I cannot click on your magelo but the charm birds in fire drop Drape of the Agile which usually rots after a your first few clearings. Not sure what you have now but that would save you a ton of points to be spent elsewhere on more valuable augs imo.<br />

<br />
I would worry about your anger procs and augmenting your elemental Helm/boot/legs/arms with the 40hp aug personally over a dodge mod you can get very easy in the elementals.<br />
<br />
Unless I have been misinformed about dodge mods stacking in which case having more might be of some value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">we kill those damn birds every time they pop, give or take.<br />
<br />
theyve never dropped a *melee* item for us, period, let alone that nice cloak.  I hate those birds.  Fun effect (the charm thing) but the friggin z axis of the bouncy bouncy model makes taunting a pain sometimes.<br />
<br />
youve just given me a reason to whine less when PoF raids are announced, cool :)<br />
<br />
(ANd yeah, anger 3 and +40 hp augs are first on my list fo sure).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You guys are going to be mighty surprised when you try to put 40hp aug on a ring, or better yet 40hp AND 10ac aug on a mask.   Please be careful and fully understand the augmentation system before giving others advice.<br />
<br />
10 AC augs will go on mask/neck/shoulder/belt/back<br />
<br />
40 HP type 2 will go on all visible armor slots only.<br />
<br />
40 HP type 7 will go on all visible armor slots only, except for wrist.<br />
<br />
Personally, I made a takish 110hp bracer with 8% dodge and 7charisma.  The breastplate slot may be the best for you to go with though, it sounds like.<br />
<br />
Oh, if you want to add hps to a ring or mask or whatever, you can buy 20hp/20mana augments for the same cost of the 40hp one that i *think* will go into those slots.  I personally am not gonna spend 500+ points for mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lol what don't I understand about the augment system again?<br />
<br />
My quote:<br />
I would worry about your anger procs and augmenting your elemental Helm/boot/legs/arms with the 40hp aug.<br />
<br />
you can aug all of those slots with the 40hp aug from Ruj. He asked about the dodge mod which I explained he can get thru easier means than spending AP.<br />
<br />
Oh and the 40hp type 7 aug cannot go on gloves either, not just wrist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wasn't speaking to you Brudal, sorry if you assumed that.  Specifically, I was referring to Flair and Aldarion who suggested augmentation scenarios that do not currently exist.  Thanks for the tip about the gloves.  Personally, I think that cloak has pretty crappy AC and barely the hp worthy of an elemental drop.  I wouldn't go in on it, and I have a cloak from NToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">np Draga. You are right about the cloak but as I said it rots pretty much now and its from pretty easy mobs so not too bad. I only bid on it because we had 2 drop back to back that night and nobody wanted either, was more hp than what I had and a dodge mod so will do for now.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't spend suggest spending points on it really unless its rotting though. Leaf-jointed Cloak from earth and Ensorcelled Metalcloth Cape  from Air both better elemental cloaks but more competed for to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For Type 2 on rings and earrings, you pretty much are stuck getting cha / Sta / Agil or whatever stat you are short on.  Same for type 1.<br />
<br />
the type 2 &gt; Type 1 nerf really really hammered the future viabiliy of the armor for raiders, imo.</div></div><hr />
