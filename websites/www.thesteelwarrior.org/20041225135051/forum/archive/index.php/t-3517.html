<br />
Tank1 stops attacking, backs off to max melee range, while tank2 closes in to min melee range, starts taunting and attacking ? (or hits AE taunt..) meanwhile cleric rotation starts on new tank, with one healer keeping old tank up till he's safely off aggro list ?<br />
<br />
Or are you referring to the switch our cleric flips when she needs us to mindlessly slaughter all in front of us ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Think the prior poster covered planned switches clearly enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
How to prepare for that unforeseen tank switch, the conservative approach:<br />
1 - Have an MT order<br />
2 - Next tank should not be the next person on the agro list. The CHO needs time to switch. <br />
3 - Its good to have someone high on the agro list as a sacrifice. someone like a rogue or ranger who can disc invul, not mandatory.<br />
4 - Next tank should be called in channel and move into spot but refrain from using AE taunt immediately. Can go defensive/evasive but not ae taunt. Wait until the CHO/spam healers are on you and then go full force on grabbing agro. In certain circumstances you may have to have people refrain from attacking. You may need to have the next MT lev'ed because of the alleged virtical ae taunt issue.<br />
<br />
Clerics can set target keys in advance to facilitate the switch to the next tank.<br />
<br />
After a while, the MT knows what to expect from the CHO and can be a bit more aggressive on switches when necessary.<br />
<br />
Train your rangers and rogues to nimble/weaponshield tank the mobs so that you can bridge MT's.<br />
<br />
Always make your MT rotation 1 person deeper than you think you will need. Always watch deaths in case you have to adjust MT order. <br />
<br />
Last of all, switches should be done calmly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Real tank switches work like this:<br />
<br />
All warriors (or tanks if you use something other than warriors) run well outside of the mob's melee range as soon as MT dies, sometimes before if you're playing cautious.<br />
<br />
It can take anywhere bewteen 2 to about 20 seconds before clerics figure out what's going on.  During this time, it is encouraged that you have your raid do stuff they normally won't do so they can die in place of more important people (clerics, tanks, possibly enchanter/bards depending on the encounter).  It is crucial that you have people there to die while the tank switch is going because the mob's damage has to go somewhere.  Rangers, monks, and wizards are good candidates for this.  If you have spare warriors, warriors are, ironically, the best for this. <br />
<br />
Once you have heals, run in AE taunt and disc.  If that doesn't work just let more people die.  It doesn't matter as long as they're not one of the aforementioned classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a warning: one of the common mistakes people that arent normally MT's often make is that they engage/ae taunt before hitting defensive.....  You can't afford to do that with a hard hitting mob and a ch chain that isnt optimized on you yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What REALLY happens on a tank switch:<br />
<br />
1. set MT order, many times on planned tank switches it is prudent to group the warriors and have 1 person in the group that the healers will assist to get the next tank on target.<br />
<br />
2. just before defensive wears off or right when a tank dies forcing a switch the mob will turn on who ever is #2 on the list. This is often and over ethusiastic rogue who will try to use their invul disc to escape death or they might try to use their escape AA to wipe agro.<br />
<br />
3. At this time the mob will summon the wizard with the highest agro and pummel him to death.<br />
<br />
4. Since the time on summoning is 8 seconds, the mob now has 7.75 seconds before it can summon again so he will be forced to attack the next person on the agro list.<br />
<br />
5. The mob now runs across the room and slaughters the first 2 clerics in the CH rotation. The melees will give chase except for the ones who turned on attack and went AFK to go to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
6. Since the mob still has another 6 seconds before it can summon, it will now turn and run back to the area the fight started at and kill the AFK monk who was next on the agro list. He will then immediately turn to the SK that is mashing the taunt key and start to work him over. The SK will wisely FD to avoid an untimely death.<br />
<br />
7. At this point, the summon timer is up and the next wizard on the agro list will get summoned and summarily pasted into the dirt.<br />
<br />
8. By now, the remaining clerics in the CH order has established their rotation on the next tank in the rotation so the tank will hit AE taunt. Simultaneous to this the melees that where chasing the mob around will manage to push the mob up on to a torch on the wall, putting the mob out of AR taunt range.<br />
<br />
9. The mob, still ignoring the taunts of the warriors will now work his way through monks and rogues who will all FD/escape/invul until he gets lucky and one rounds one of them into low HP agro at which time he will finish the job and kill that monk/rogue.<br />
<br />
10. With .5 seconds left on the summon timer the mob will look in the direction of the rangers who have been plinking arrows at him, 3 of them will die spontaneously.<br />
<br />
11. The mob will now summon the next wizard on the agro list and make a blood paste out of them.<br />
<br />
12. At this point, slow will wear off the mob and the shaman on the raid will have to reslow him. Since no one bothered to refresh debuffs, each slow will be resisted and the mob will now turn and beat down the shaman 1 at a time at a decellerated rate due to the insane regen and HoT the shaman cast on himself just before he tried to slow. The next warrior in the rotation will of course be taunting madly and spitting in the mobs eye trying to get his attention. When the mob gets to the last shaman, slow will land.<br />
<br />
13. The next wizard on the agro list will now be summoned and killed.<br />
<br />
14. The madly taunting warrior will now proc his EB weapon. The mob will stop attacking and look around to see why he is suddenly very pissed at the warrior. The mob will pause while he tries to logically figure out just how a warrior has gotten agro then proceed to pummel the warrior for the remaining 1:30 left on his defensive disc.<br />
<br />
15. About 1 minute later the warrior will warn that his disc is running out and to tighten up heals. 30 seconds later when his disc wears off, the mob will kill the warrior and start back at step 1. With any luck, you will have enough DPS to get him dead before he chews up too many people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Planned :<br />
MT1 disc going down, Backup heal the MT1<br />
Rotation goes on MT2<br />
Once rotation is on MT2, MT2 AE taunts, let MT1 Die<br />
<br />
Zerg Style :<br />
MT1 goes down. MT2 says HEAL ME<br />
Rotation &amp; Backup heal go on MT2<br />
M2 lets people die. Once the 1st heal lands, AE taunt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warram</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor you forgot the part somewhere between 10 &amp; 11 where the warriors actually does get aggro but the clerics are so busy spot healing that the CH cycle is broken and the warrior dies instanly...thus requiring a new tank switch. <br />
<br />
PS...in PoP, anything that takes longer that 3 minutes to kill should be able to be tanked w/out defensive anyway. So I wouldn't call it &quot;Zerg&quot; style to switch when the MT dies. <br />
<br />
I have a hotkey that gives the clerics 10 seconds to start CH cycle on me before I AE taunt. I do recommend that other Warriors throw themselves at the mob w/ furious + ae taunt to buy time.</div></div><hr />
