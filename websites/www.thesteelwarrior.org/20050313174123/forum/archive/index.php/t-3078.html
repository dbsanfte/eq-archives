The more you have, the harder the raid. Our guild has tried 2, can anyone say greasy spot on the highway?? The top guild on our server had pretty much the same results... <br />
<br />
Is anyone having success with these at all?</div></div><hr />

I would like SOE to explain things,  why are their 2 raid leaders at each camp?  Does one give harder raids than the other?  Can I bring 24 people to a raid and have difficulty adjusted properly?  Can I go with 18 people on hard setting and have a shot in hell of finishing it?  Lots of questions and gathering people and starting a raid to waste 2 to 3 hours of everyone's time on mission impossible isn't fun.  <br />
<br />
Would be very nice to have the raids doable with 18 because for many guilds Its probably easier to make 3x18 than 2x36 or (1x18 )+(1x36).<br />

<br />
1. Raids dont scale to numbers. Same number of mobs that hit the same amount whether you bring 18 or 36.<br />
<br />
2.  I have been told (but not actually verified) you can only do each raid pass or fail once every X days (5 i think).  The 2 raid givers are there to offer you 2 different raids per camp, rather than just having 1.  We did one MM raid with 36 one day, and the other one the next day with 18.</div></div><hr />
