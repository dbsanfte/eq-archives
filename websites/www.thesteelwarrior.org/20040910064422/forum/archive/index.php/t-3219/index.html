<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3219">Moving Forward on Warrior Improvements</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bunnie Burner solicited ideas for improving the Warrior class, catagorized them, and put into place a method to select some to bring to the attention of SoE.<br />
<br />
Separately, I started a thread about Knight/Warrior Class Balance that uses SoE's Class Descriptions to make a case for ugrading Warrior aggro abilites.<br />
<br />
I would like to see us finish determining community sentiment and support for these suggestions and put together a rough draft for review by the community.<br />
<br />
I am particulary interested not only in achieving a concencious, but in obtaining feedback/analysis to produce a Suggested Warrior Improvements document to be put before SoE.<br />
<br />
This document (IMO) should focus on what we believe are the most practical solutions to correct class balance issues and improve the Warrior Class in general.<br />
<br />
I haven't asked for, nor will I accept, any role in this process. I do think it's important to continue and and to produce not a Christmas list but a solid proposal. Else eveything written here is just jibber jabbar.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the three areas we have all agreed on in some way that need addressed to restore class balance are:<br />
<br />
1) Modification of Taunting abilites to better obtain initial aggro and some form of modification to the warrior class to better maintain aggro throughout the fight......maybe not go so far as Aggro Lock ... but something needs done.<br />
<br />
2) Restoring the gap atleast somewhat in regards to Warrior AC/HP/ Mitigation when compared to Knight AC/HP/Mitigation.<br />
<br />
3) Itemization.  We need gear to help us restore the balance....infact addressing THIS issue could help in regards to issue number 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I missing anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya. Roughly its altered functionality like separate offensive and defensive discipline timers, increased dps for all melee, changing repostes on DW and maybe shield usage.<br />
<br />
Like I said, sentiment needs to be determined, stuff needs to be ordered by urgent need/nice to have so that triage can be performed. IMO no more than a half dozen ideas should make the cut and they'll need to be refined.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The problem is that there has been 100's if not 1,000's of threads made on this topic with just as many or more e-mails and in game feedback being sent to the Devs.<br />
<br />
They have had ample time to make a decision and act upon it, and their unwillingness to do so has proven that they more than likely never will. <br />
<br />
The fact that yet another expansion has been released with more items that interfere with balance and add even more proc aggro type effects show me that they are happy as it stands right now.<br />
<br />
Ohh, and I like ideas 1-3 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1.  Agreed, taunt does need modified so warriors get better initial aggro.  Not to meet or excede knight aggro however.<br />
<br />
2.  Agreed, there does need to be a bit more seperation, especially in the higher ends of the game.  <br />
<br />
3.  Disagree, don't see it happening.  Gear is pretty much the way it is.  It would take an enormous amount of time to go thru and redo all the warrior gear that is problematic.  Best solution is to give warriors innate boosts to their hp/ac/mitigation based on level.  <br />
<br />
4.  Disciplines need to be seperated and given offensive/defensive classifications.  The timers need to be cut down on most of the offensive disc's to allow more regular use.  Defensive disciplines need to maintain the current timer system.  All melee and hybrids need disciplines looked into in fact.  Even knights need some work done to make their disciplines something that get used.  Hybrid disc's are more about fun the functionality and right now they are very little of either.<br />
<br />
5.  Pure melee classes need innate dps boost.  Not alot, but enough to push them closer to casters.<br />
<br />
6.  Ripostes on dual wield need to be reduced by some method.  <br />
<br />
7.  Shields need to be given a purpose and a reason for use.  If nothing else put 150-200ac, 200hp on the lower end shields.  Best method would be block that adds into avoidance.  It needs to be a tangible amount of avoidance too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is about all I can think of now.  Some of these affect more then just warriors, but so be it.  It will help warriors at the same time helping all the other melee classes, even knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only thing i can see helping is equalising knight/warrior tanking to a first come first served basis and ensuring that all plate tanks have secondary abilities that can be called on to make tank stacking in a group less of a joke concept. the likelyhood of SOE totally redesigning the warrior class is a little unlikely though given the attitudes expressed so far.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mahalito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;&quot; 3. Disagree, don't see it happening. Gear is pretty much the way it is.

<br />
<br />
They could change it by having the gear appear different on different classes<br />

<br />
ex bracer ac 12 hp 20 mana 20 str 4 wis 4 int 4 would appear as <br />
<br />
<br />
Cleric ac 12 hp 10 mana 30 str 2 wis 6<br />
Warr ac 14 hp 35 str 6 <br />
pally /sk as shown above<br />
<br />
not sure on what exactly the numbers here should be, but ya get the idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a feeling the engine is unable to code like that.  Atleast I have yet to see any items in that fashion.  Look at all the armor turn in quests.  Instead of taking one generic item and turning it in to one person and getting back your class armor, you have to get a special type of armor and turn it in to a special person to get your specific class armor back.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do think adjusting itemization is the better solution, but I also think it's not likely to happen.  Since I doubt it will happen I'd rather see something done to help offset that problem then nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Placed my feedback in a new thread.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chavr, the engine already does what you say it wont, it just does it with level restrictions instead of class restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>OlavSkulcrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like that idea. If it is possible to code, the simple itemization solution would be to check for MNK/ROG/WAR and if =TRUE, then x mana = +y hps. This could be no less difficult than the level recommendation, since it checks your level vs. the recommendation and applies a nerf formula to the stats if less than the recommended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, if they can code it so armor scales by class/level then that would be the better route to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maelissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would disagree with the notion that itemization is really a problem.  Class-specific itemization was not really a part of the initial game, it was added in for a while and now itemization trends are leaning back towards their original status.  (Ok, a full set of PoT gear is a lot more uber than a full set of Bronze or even Rubicite, but you get the idea).  I personally agree with the trend.  Classes should not be dependant on itemization for balance.  If it's a bad way to handle Warrior agro issues, it's probably an equally bad way to handle hit point / mitigation issues.  (It's certainly a bad way to handle melee DPS, but I think we're stuck with that one).  <br />
<br />
That said, having melee gain a straight HP bonus from Mana on an item might not be a bad way of handling the imbalance.  However, would such a solution be easier to code as a modification to the itemization engine or as an innate ability of the classes affected?  (I'm inclined to say the latter).  I suspect though that current item design would make such a solution too unpredictable and too potentially unbalancing in the other direction.  Just increasing Hit Points thorugh class abilities or AA would be a more stable solution and much more easy to predict.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What we need is something that we can click and be assured we have aggro.<br />
<br />
example, paladin clicks his stuns, and he/she is 99% assured to have aggro.<br />
<br />
example2, warrior clicks autoattack and hopes that proc goes off.<br />
<br />
it's been a problem for quite a while now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont' think warriors should ever be assured to get agro by clicking something.  However they shoudl have a reasonable assurance they will get agro.  Yeah, it's not much of a difference, but I think its enough of one to count.<br />
<br />
If a paladin is 99% sure to get agro (number is too high btw, but will use it for example) then a warrior should be at 75-80% surety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warriors can already click Swollen Fungusbeast Glands and Crystalline Silk Net to get aggro. Your arguement is moot Chavr. Warrior clicking to get aggro already exists.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's not sustainable though.  Nets are two charge, glands are 10 charge and cost a hefty penny to recharge.<br />
<br />
He's talking about an innate ability added to warriors that has no charge limit or cost associated with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dont' think warriors should ever be assured to get agro by clicking something.Of course not, you're a knight.<br />
<br />
He's talking about an innate ability added to warriors that has no charge limit or cost associated with it.As opposed to the vendor-bought spells that knights use (with the added expense of mana, an easily renewable resource).<br />
<br />
While I thoroughly disagree with your motives, chavr, I do agree that giving warriors clickie aggro may (note the word may) not be the way to go. Clickie aggro seems to me like it would give warriors the feel of playing a knight, and if I wanted to play a knight, I'd play one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well I happen to believe our goal should be at least parity in both aggro ability and survivability. These are Warrior traits. After all, a 65 Warrior can hardly compete with a 65 Paladin if he's essentially a 63 Warrior and 40 Cleric rolled up in one.<br />
<br />
Let's remember, some Paladins are likely to want to preserve as many advantages in tanking as possible. After all if we are the prefered MT, they either have to convince groups that offtanks are great in groups or they have a problem. Much easier for them if they remain the prefered MT and the prefered offtank too.<br />
<br />
We have to insist on at least parity in tanking. No matter what we ask for it's a modification of functionality. Not having clickable aggro has not served us well.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Parity should be achieved thru greater mitigation/hp/ac (tanking) and with lesser agro.  Currently the tanking aspect is too close and the agro aspect too far.  The agro gap needs to close some, but not completely.  The tanking aspect needs to widen, but not by too much.  Otherwise we are just gonna flip flop the situation and the net gain for classes overall will be nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I still think that snap-aggro should be done away with.<br />
<br />
Give warriors more HP per sta, maybe lvl/7.5 or something, upping it to 9 hp per sta.<br />
<br />
And if this will displease knights, they can have lvl/10, like warriors have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Any Warrior AC/HP and Mitigation advantage is meaningless in experiance groups. Aggro abilities should be equal with Warriors prefered on those ocassions where the group chooses to fight harder hitting mobs and Knights prefered where their utilities (SU3, CC, Res, Root, etc.) makes them more attractive.<br />
<br />
Survivability and aggro abilities are core tanking skills. Since they (and DPS, but that hardly counts) are the only thing things a Warrior does, we can't accept inferiority in them. Knights have other things that they do.<br />
<br />
SoE will not do away with snap aggro at range. It is the major reason why Knights are enjoying preference as exp group MT's. Since they aren't about to lose it, we must acquire it.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Marshall Earp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Warriors need NO upgrades.  The whole game is practically balanced around them, and changing anything about warriors would mess the entire game up.  Knights just need their ability to get aggro-on-demand-indefinately tuned down a tiny bit.  Let knights have slightly better aggro, that is fine.  We tank better, let slightly worse aggro management be our tradeoff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I respectfully disagree. Warriors had the &quot;whole game balanced around them.&quot; Then multi-class armor, huge mana pools, FT, KEI, spell, spells, spells, made Knights the prefered exp MT's with 40% of LDoN's content  conferring even more advantage.<br />
<br />
The whole game is no longer balanced around Warriors. The whole game has moved forward dramatically for over a year with Warriors getting more HP's and AC and little else.<br />
<br />
Perhaps at the stage of the game you are in a Golden Age for Knights is not noticable or even significant.<br />
<br />
However, Warriors aggro deficiency has been a topic on numerous class boards. Even on Paladins of Norrath the need to upgrade Warriors is acknowledged.<br />
<br />
You are entitled to suggest Knights be nerfed instead of improving Warrior aggro abilities, that's your privilege. But in any case the disparity in aggro abilitites it too wide.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">What it looks like your wanting battleblade is for warriors to be changed so they have precedence in PoP/LDoN hard setting and for paladins to have precedence in LDoN on normal adventures.<br />
<br />
That is all that the utility you mentioned is good for... ldon on normal setting.  That is why paladins should have higher agro for the trade off of lesser tanking.  If your group is worried about agro bouncing then take the paladin and heal more.  If your worried about your healing get the warrior and watch your agro a bit better.  It should be a question of group composition and situation your fighting in that determines who you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">To rephrase what you said Chavr...<br />
<br />
I see groups prefering Warriors ONLY in those situations where mobs hit especially hard and Knights being prefered ONLY in those situations where there are a lot of undead or other special circumstances. For most of the game, (including normal LDoN) it shouldn't make a dimes worth of difference who tanks.<br />
<br />
People will not alter their play style to accomodate a tank that can not meet the current standards in aggro control - they will select a tank that can (and you absolutely know this to be true).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sounds good on paper chavr.......if warriors advantage in tanking = a Knights advantage in aggro control, I'd say give your Idea a shot....however Aggro Lock vs not having to lay an extra CH gives little situations other than a defensive Disc fight for a warrior to be chosen to tank.....we are NOT DPS classes, so we don't get chosen for THAT spot, we have no utility, that leaves tanking.....and we are no longer the best tanks under any situation cept 1....VERY little reason for warriors in todays EQ.</div></div><hr />

There is a strange masocistic idea that you must make everyone suffer for Warriors to function.  You click a skill (assuming you've done the appropriate &quot;training&quot;) it should semi-reliably do what is expected.<br />
<br />
Get a skill that when it works generates the appropriate hate.  You can do your job plus do something handy for the group.  That is why SKs and Paladins can control.  It isn't a gimme since it can fail but certainly works better than just only relying on Taunt.<br />
<br />
SKs and Paladins use Taunt as a fall back because of how it works.  Why is it fair that Warriors have to use the same skill as a primary?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part and parcel of any warrior upgrade would be added dps.  This won't make them a dps class, but it will add more to the plate.<br />
<br />
<br />
 see groups prefering Warriors ONLY in those situations where mobs hit especially hard and Knights being prefered ONLY in those situations where there are a lot of undead or other special circumstances. For most of the game, (including normal LDoN) it shouldn't make a dimes worth of difference who tanks.<br />
<br />
People will not alter their play style to accomodate a tank that can not meet the current standards in aggro control - they will select a tank that can (and you absolutely know this to be true).<br />
<br />
<br />
We all know that mobs only hit extremely hard in PoP or in the new ldon difficult setting adventures.  Luclin is pretty much about low caliber damage applied for long periods of time due to mobs ac/hps.  Kunark/old world mobs still hit according to the level cap being 60.  The amount of tanking power since then has increased nearly double.  <br />
<br />
PoP is still the best exp in the game.  LDoN is more fun sometimes, but part of that is because it's still new.  Once that newness wears off people will be going back to PoP for loot and exp.<br />
<br />
Your wanting warriors to be the ONLY (your word) choice for tanking those mobs.<br />
<br />
You are also said &quot;other cirucmstance&quot; for knights... but what other circumstances?  The game isn't designed with other circumstances and that is a huge portion of the problem.  Knights are unable to do their primary design so they must compete with the warrior spot or else knights will have no spot at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
A caster heavy group should want a knight to tank for them.  Their added dps will help offset the extra damage a paladin would take.<br />
<br />
A melee heavy group should want a warrior to tank for them.  They don't have the high amounts of agro casters do and therefore shouldn't need snap agro.  Note, this is not current but considered after warriors get an agro upgrade like the one I've been suggesting.<br />
<br />
If you fight some of the harder PoP mobs then you'd want a warrior for the greater tanking power.  If your fighting the standard PoP fair then you'd want a knight or warrior depending on the group makeup.  If your fighting a high undead area then you'd probably want the paladin.  If you have a druid as healer then you'd probably want the warrior.<br />
<br />
That is parity.  Warriors would be the best at tanking and good at agro.  Knights would be the best at agro and good at tanking.  As long as warriors can offset the agro from slow they would have enough agro to be desired in groups.  The key factor here is slow.  Currently warriors can't offset it and that is causing problems.   A melee centric group, with a warrior that can offset slow, has no need of knight agro.  They can do just fine with a warrior.  A caster centric group will want a knights high agro so they can nuke without worry of pinging.  If a group is a mix of both then the choice will be whoever is lfg first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Marshall Earp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">How'd you come up with this conclusion? If you read the boards, and play the game you will know that we DO NOT tank better. Hell I'd venture to say we tank worse.....It is perception.  Play a healer class and you'll know what I mean.  All things being absolutely equal (calibur of loot and AAs), a warrior has many more HPs and higher AC than a Knight.  And on top of that, they have a different damage mitigation table that makes them better tanks.  The only problem is that against mobs that don't hit very hard (LDoN normal) the difference doesn't matter at all.  This is why Knights are prefered tanks in group settings (not many exp mobs hit hard enough to matter) and Warriors are prefered (read: required) for raids.  In a group you'll tradeoff a bit of tanking ability because clerics are overpowered right now also, and aggro control (increases DPS of casters) is more important than healer mana.</div></div><hr />

Pally self buffs and sk taps easily overcome any marginal advantage warriors have.<br />
And on top of that, they have a different damage mitigation table that makes them better tanks.Not anymore we don't. Knights have been on the same mitigation table as warriors since around the time of the Luclin launch. Might you have meant that we have a slightly higher defense skill cap? You know, the thing that's surpassed by far by those darn pally self buffs and sk taps again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">No, absor stated in a post on one of the class boards that warriors are indeed on a different mitigation table.  <br />
<br />
Warrior hp/ac difference is only closed after a paladin self buffs.  If a paladin is standing next to a warrior with the same exact buffs the warrior will have a noticeable hp/ac advantage. It's only after you factor in aura of the crusader that the hp gap closes.  This is on similarily equipped people btw.  Also, this doesn't apply as much when you get into the highest end loots because of the all/all gear that paladins have access to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Warrior hp/ac difference is only closed after a paladin self buffs.Nonsense. At 60, I stood next to a pally of the same level and equivalent gear and had 50 more ac and 100 more hp. How is that a difference that justifies all of the extras that paladins enjoy in any way?<br />
<br />
No, absor stated in a post on one of the class boards that warriors are indeed on a different mitigation table.Show me. The burden of proof is on you, but remember that Absor has been dead wrong before (even on this board) so I wouldn't exactly trust the PR man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Actually, there was a fairly good parse done recently by a monk on MB that showed that warriors seem to have an approximately 10% mitigation advantage.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Please do, Gimmel. According to Sony, the plate tank classes (which for some unfathomable reason included bards at the time)are all supposed to be on the same table.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">At 60 standing there next to our warriors I was running something like 1k HP and 100-200ac behind them.  After self buffs I was still 700hp behind them.<br />
<br />
That was with us all being at the same level of the game and having similar gear.  I've done some comparisons and that same numbers pretty much holds true for awhile.  It's not till you start factoring in VT all/all and elemental all/all gear that the gap closes to the point where a paladin using buffs will only be about 200hp behind a warrior.<br />
<br />
In the end there is always a difference, but it closes from being 1kish to being 300ish after all/all gear.</div></div><hr />

Oh, look here.  The post Gimmel was talking about that says Warriors and Knights are on a different data table:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hey, Sparky, did you see where he said &quot;seem&quot; ? It's speculation. Likely speculation, but speculation nonetheless.<br />
<br />
However, in the interest of moving forward, I'll concede the mitigation point. I will not relent on the warrior hp &quot;advantage,&quot; though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The only problem is that against mobs that don't hit very hard (LDoN normal) the difference doesn't matter at all. This is why Knights are prefered tanks in group settings (not many exp mobs hit hard enough to matter) ....<br />
For those of us that still want to obtain experiance and loot outside of raids, this is exactly what we are trying to get SoE to fix. Glad to see that despite your apparent initial post you do agree.<br />
....and Warriors are prefered (read: required) for raids.<br />
You say this as if it was an equal tradeoff. Knight have a raid role. They go on raids. They loot things acquired on raids.<br />
In a group you'll tradeoff a bit of tanking ability because clerics are overpowered right now also, and aggro control (increases DPS of casters) is more important than healer mana. <br />
I note the use of the phrase &quot;overpowered right now also&quot;. I believe this is a concession that Knights are overpowered right now - you just don't care.<br />
<br />
You finish by stating &quot;aggro control (increases DPS of casters) is more important than healer mana.&quot; Exactly. You state the problem very clearly, however you essentially shrug your shoulders and say &quot;So what.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was curious, is the Warrior your main? You the original owner? I'm not intending to be insulting, but it's difficult to reconcile what you admit to be true and total lack of concern. Besides, with a Magelo created on Sept 24th., 8 posts (all today) on TSW, and my inability to find ya on Stormhammer it looks like yer sheeps clothing may still have price tags on em hehe. I'm sure it's just me <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>chavr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">1k hp difference is actually rather significant.  The problem as I see it is that the 1k difference doesn't stay fixed, it closes with higher level gear.  What I feel should happen is that a warrior in elemental class armor, and a paladin in elemental class armor should be compared.  SOE has the ability to see what is the average gear worn by characters at this stage of the game.  Equipe both in the average gear and see what the difference is.  Then adjust the warrior hp modifier on the elemental armor so that they reach about 1300 hp more then the paladin.  Now do the same for ornate and do the same for HoT.  If you can't add enough hp to the armor then add as much as you can and then adjust the innate class modifier to finish filling in the gap.<br />
<br />
What this does is gives warriors a 1k hp advantage after you factor in the paladin's self buff.  Yes, for some pop mobs that isn't gonna be much of a difference if that mob hits you for max damage, but I really can't see a 2k hp gap.  That would be pushing warriors up past 10k, 11k hps easily.  I think that would be overdoing it really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">SKs don't get the paladin self hp buff, so we'd be even further behind... like 1600hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'm amused that some members of other classes don't hesitate at all in suggesting Warriors need more AC/HP/mitigation or DPS. It's only when you get down to the reason that they are the prefered MT's in experaince groups that they suddenly get real nervous.<br />
<br />
If SoE makes the Taunt button operate as I've suggested - having a modest range, increased success rate to place you on the top of the aggro list, and the ability to build aggro by adding a modest amount of Hate - Knights can use this functionality if they wish and free up spells gems for other uses or still have greater aggro control than Warriors. This preserves a reasonable advantage in aggro control for Knights.<br />
<br />
The truth is some players don't want a reasonable advantage in aggro control. They want Warriors to continue at a major disadvantage in this area and are trying hard to justify it by proposing unneeded improvements to Warrior in other areas.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of the player base has already gone on record as saying the #1 Warrior need is improved aggro abilities. You've already explained that you believe Knights should continue to have a monopoly on snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro (we can see how that's working out, can't we?).<br />
<br />
Instead, let's talk about how you feel that Clerics should nuke but not melee so they don't compete with Paladins.<br />
<br />
I say let Clerics do 100 DPS with a mace that procs unresistable stuns. In fact I think all Warriors should suggest that in feedback. What say you? For or against? Don't spare the details, it's important to us to know how ya feel about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Viriatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I see many good sugestions on this board concerning upgrading warriors, however I see many of them are complicated to code and has such I don’t think we can get them in.<br />
Here are some sugestions that after much thought I think they are perfectly viable and easy to implement.<br />
<br />
Agro issues in exp groups.<br />
Make the taunt skill fail less and reduce the reuse timer, this wont effect much the raiding game and affects all classes that have the taunt skill.<br />
<br />
Damage Upgrade.<br />
The easiest way in my mind to upgrade melee damage is upping the damage bonus atributed to weaps.<br />
Like adding a percentage modifier to the bonus.<br />
And while at it up the damage of 1handers to make dual weild balanced against the use of 2handers. <br />
Like doubling the percentage modifier given to 2handers.<br />
<br />
Doing this will fix (hopefully) the issues concerning melee vs caster dps and dual weild vs 2 handers dps and even to some extent the use of a shield.<br />
 <br />
Upgrading only PoP weaps or even worst only elemental and time weaps will only solve the problem to a minority of people. Also, lots of 65 level warriors without access to elemental/time planes are still using non-pop weaps for agro.<br />
<br />
Touching offensive disciplines seams much more complicated to change.<br />
<br />
Also by doing this it will solve the problem at all levels and theres no need to create more Aas or changing/creating disciplines or even changing existing items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I think they suggest that because of the myopic view of EQ.  The little box that Warriors are in is &quot;only melee&quot;.  Warriors can't do too much damage (I wonder &quot;why not?&quot;) so the only thing left in their minds is more mitigation.<br />
<br />
One question I keep asking is &quot;How much more mitigation will help?&quot;  I keep getting vauge answers but the question is never answered.  Unless you are thinking about double or quadrupling current exp Warrior mitigation, more will not help.  Just like the idea on nerfing Knights, more mitigation does not address the functional problem.<br />
<br />
If you guys are talking about double/quadrupling current Warrior mitigation, then what happened to the cries about making the game too trivial? I highly doubt anyone seriously considers this. ^_^<br />
<br />
Warriors tank fine.  Exp groups however are not looking for bigger tanks.  They are looking for functional ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Viriatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">More mitigation is not gonna help warriors in exp groups.<br />
Plus you bet any sugestion concerning only Warriors (or any other class for that matter) will be rejected.<br />
Thats why we should look for overall upgrades that can effect more then just warriors (in a positive way), but at the same time make warriors equal to knights in terms of groups chosing a tank.<br />
I dont want to have the same agro lock has knights, i want to have enouph agro lock so groups looking for tanks actually look at warriors has a viable choice. All tank classes are pretty much balanced in terms of receiving damage, what they are not balanced is on the hability of letting the other members of the group unleash hell (and at this point this is what makes a group chose a knight over a warrior). Like someone said its not the healer mana that is important now, its the damage a group can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>arlakisd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Pushing warriors damage up just kills the one thing a Monk offers over a non tanking knight. (Assuming a non pulling monk) DPS. &quot;Fix&quot; one class and finish breaking another. That's a great idea.. <br />
<br />
I do think warrior can use a small DPS adjustment So could all the melee. But Warriors do need a realistic ability to get aggro that doesn't involve me going well He's engaged  10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Attack. FD's nice and all but It's not perfect. There's been many times I've had to have ATK off for half a battle. Because a Warrior was MT. That's just stupid. Half the time I just suck it up and MT.<br />
 <br />
Not many are asking for 100% reliable but 60% or whatever it currently is isn't a reasonable total at this stage when knights offer 95% Bump warrior to 80-85%. You still have the edge but not a blindsiding edge.   <br />

I shouldn't have classes walking away from a group do to the warrior as MT. They shouldn't prefer a Monk to be MT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I have 3 main points to address:<br />
<br />
1.  Warriors and knights are all pretty close when it comes to AC/HP/avoidance/mitigation.  I think it needs to stay that way since we're all tanks.<br />
<br />
2.  Warrior vs knight aggro control needs to be roughly proportional to the difference in tanking efficiency between them, preferably through upgrading warrior aggro control.<br />
<br />
3.  Warriors need more utility.  They need to unlink our discipline timers, tweak some of them if that makes some of them too powerful, and add some new higher level disciplines to match up with the added utility that knights get through spells.<br />
<br />
Examples of the types of things I'd like to see added as disciplines:<br />
<br />
Aura of the General:  60 second song buff that adds 15% to both melee damage and spell effects (nukes and heals) for everyone in the group (warrior barks orders out increasing the tactical position of everyone in the group)<br />
<br />
Force of Will:  Warrior is 100% immune to detrimental movement affecting spells such as snare, slow, charm, root for 60 seconds<br />
<br />
Force of Endurance:  Warrior mitigates all non melee damage by 50% for 60 seconds.</div></div><hr />
