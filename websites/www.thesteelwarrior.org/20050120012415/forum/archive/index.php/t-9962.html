+4, ally <br />
+3, warmly <br />
+2, kindly <br />
+1, amiably <br />
0, indifferently <br />
-1, apprehensively <br />
-2, dubiously <br />
-3, threateningly <br />
-4, ready to attack <br />
<br />
Does anyone know a good guide for approximately how many faction hits it takes to move through each level start to finish? I realize any such guide would be vague at best but I want a reference while im grinding loyalist faction. Any advice would be appriciated</div></div><hr />

Taken from the old chardok boards.  Its not entirely correct, (max kos has been speculated to be -2800ish), but as we don't start maxkos to dranik loyalist it's probably close enough.<br />
<br />
The greens in dranik scar are definitely 1 point per hit, whoknows about pg, it seems to go faster, but whether its due to more points per kill or a higher mata mob density is unknown.  The turnins (kyv hearts, murkglider somethings) hopefully are worth multiple points, but it didn't seem to be anything significantly large either.</div></div><hr />
