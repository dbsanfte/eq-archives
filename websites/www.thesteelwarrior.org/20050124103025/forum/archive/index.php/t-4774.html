I think it was something Furor posted about but I couldn't find the original thread.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, if Sony does this, what will happen to all the warriors (like me) that use force shock and other low level stun weapons because they don't have access to a BoC etc.?  I think this could be terrible for us and I would hope that Sony would change the procs on swords like GBoS and CHoS and others to EB or TB or something similar.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know more about this?</div></div><hr />

I just recently got a CHoS and a SotB.  I love these weapons and the agro they generate for me.  These items took me a long time to finally obtain (I am not uber by any means) and it would be heartbreaking to be back at Square-1.  <br />
<br />
Well, I guess I will just have to have faith that the new agro system will work properly, or that there will be compensation of some sort so that these weapons are not monetarily or functionally useless.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile my friend twinked a 13SK with BoC.  He certainly has my agro.  grrr......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the SotB covers you up to level 65 MOBs, you wouldn't be back at Square 1, exactly ;).  I'ma Anger aug mine, if I can ever get the points.  I don't have the hammer - too spendy and I haven't got a group yet that can camp it.  It's on the list!  But with my SotB and Sarnak Warhammer, I have not lost aggro to the guild tank with SotB and CHoS.  It seems wrong to me it should be the case, but there it is.  (Although I taunt and so I leapfrog the slow/debuff aggro, and he doesn't.  Which could well be why.)<br />
<br />
I am for tweaking aggro from immunity spells, done rightly.  Including ditching my stuffs if I have too.  If the up the aggro for non-immunity and zilch it for immune, or cut immunity aggro in half, or whatever as long as as its viable and sound.  For me, the issue is 95% about game aesthetics.<br />
<br />
I don't know the paladin stun line, and if the line needs some level tweaks for viability in one of these models, so be it.  I'm not one who wants to see paladin's incapable of holding aggro, any more than I want to see warriors that way.<br />
<br />
This won't happen before the melee changes go live (if it happens).  Wherever we are then, we won't be at Square 1 ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don;t want pali's nerfed, I want them fixed.  It is not that their stun produces aggro, it's that it produces WAY TOO MUCH at WAY TO SMALL A COST.  Many warriors and myself included think there needs to be an adjustment on how much hate a stun spell generates, especially if the mob resists it every single time.  Lets just say even the developers hardly meant aggro lock to cost 15 mana a cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone can spend the time required to get the anger augs in a decent amount of time.<br />
<br />
Sure, level 65s get like 50 points an adventure and even a casual player can have it in less than a month, but thats not a solution for those of us that aren't level 65 yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mebbe so, but I agree that part of the design intent of the Anger augs was to make an aggro taunt available.  And at sub-65, there are still a number of options (and they're the cheap ones!) ... GSoT, SotB have been mentioned.  Frostbringer used to be a premier aggro weapon, and my Silken Whip does a decent job for aggro too.  We're not crippled at any level if the spells our weapons proc get tweaked.  If that happens, I don't foresee any direct compensation in the game for having those weapons; I exepect that our comepnsation will include things such as the Provoke series.</div></div><hr />

It's a joke that a level 9 spell can out taunt a 65 war...<br />

I think they should add this to stuns for 55+ mobs on spells that have no affect on them.</div></div><hr />

Warriors just need to be fixed. Besides I spent a crap load of points on my gloves from Aten Ha Ra for their agro inducing ability. That would suck for it to be useless apart from a lame DD. That would also affect Symbol of the Planemasters and that other Call of the Sky orb in VT too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'll just have to use level appropriate spells.<br />
<br />
MANY paladins visited this board telling you warriors that they never use cease and desist ... that they use their higher level stuns ANYWAYS ... so a change like this really isn't going to affect them that much.<br />
<br />
All this proposed change does, is make the mana investment for the aggro being generated more appropriate.<br />
<br />
It's a fix, not a nerf.<br />
<br />
And warrior aggro generating weapons won't be affected much at all.<br />
<br />
Besides, with provoke, you won't need the stun generating proc weapon crutch as much.<br />
<br />
Warriors will be fine. Paladins will be fine. Shadowknights will be fine.<br />
<br />
Everything's gonna be ok.</div></div><hr />

Sound familiar, Wubao? <br />
<br />
Tons of number-crunching by the devs needs to get done before you can really make decisions on what to do with stun aggro. Hell, I'll bet the enchanters would love being able to freely hurl their nukes. Warriors, if provoke's done right, shouldn't need the stun procs, and the paladins can replace them.. maybe. What defines a proper mana cost for aggro? Your sensibility? Unfortunately, categorical changes need to be very deeply evalutated, for god only knows what tweaking may bring. How will stun immunity-aggro correlate to mez-immunity aggro? Mezzes have altered stun code at the core. How will this effect an enchanter trying to determine the most effecient mes in a particular spot? What will it mean for bards?</div></div><hr />

The PoP enchanter nuke doesn't have a stun component (only a very small knockback component), and does not generate much agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arathena, if the provoke line is used to replace procs as our primary source of agro *as I think you infer by mentioning we won't need stun-proc agro if provoke is implemented properly*, then warriors will be left in almost the same boat as before, albeit not quite as badly.  Giving us provoke is not a case of &quot;We're giving you B, so we can now take away A, to keep you even&quot;.  Right now, pre-provoke, warriors are so far behind in agro that for provoke to replace procs *I would say for the majority of warriors, stun procs on weapons such as CHoS and SotBs are their only reliable means of agro*, it would have to be implemented a LOT differently than it has been running on test server, such as by having the hate DoT part of it running for the duration of the encounter.  Right now, with procs, it is possible for a tank to ghetto mez tank a few mobs at once.  Remove procs, and you would somehow have to find a way to have that once again possible.  As for the LDoN procs, yes they are great, and I can't wait to get them.  However, at this time, over 3 months after LDoN came out, I have a grand total of 900 adventure points, and the vast majority of those are in Mistmoore.  My playtime is fairly limited between work and school, and it seems that the evenings I am on, most of my time is devoted to guild events.  While I think I'm in the minority here probably, I also feel that there are a fair number of people in the same situation as me.  <br />
<br />
I personally think that Sony will leave the proc stuns alone.  I'm sure that a stun proc can quite easily be coded differently than a cast stun spell, if they aren't already *just going by the spells cast by the mobs in HoT, which are already classed as procs, and so are immune to casting interruptions, etc... just shows that procs can be coded differently, imo*.  One reason I think supports this, is the fact that the majority of stun proc weapons are late additions to the game, and have been made readily available.  While I suppose Sony could have implemented that as a temporary band-aid cure, for some reason I don't think they did.<br />
<br />
One possible idea is to have Sony scale up the mana requirements of the spell, based on the caster's level.  For example, if a level 60 is casting a level 9 spell, have it cost almost the same amount of mana as the level 60 *or closest to* version of that spell.  Combine that with the spell having no effect on the mob for virtually the same amount of mana, and I think that would fix the problem.  Not sure if this is doable or not though.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Monk mitigation was a fix, not a nerf. Everything's gonna be fine. After all, monks don't tank.<br />
<br />
Sound familiar, Wubao? &quot;<br />
<br />
You obviously need a TAUNT upgrade, if that's the best you can do. <br />
<br />
As a monk, I don't tank. As a monk I didn't tank. As a monk, I never really sought to tank.<br />
<br />
If I ever tanked (and I have) it was out of complete necessity (tanks were either all dead, or in other groups).<br />
<br />
Losing the ability to tank didn't piss me off as it did many other monks.<br />
<br />
What pissed me off about the monk mitigation changes was the fact that they ruined my ability to PULL.<br />
<br />
After the changes, I got hit for max far more often.<br />
<br />
I don't AVOID from behind. So when pulling a mob back to camp, my BACK was open to attack far more often. Where I would take max hits because of poor &quot;rear&quot; AC, and poor MITIGATION.<br />
<br />
These max hits meant I would get STUNNED a lot more than I ever used to.<br />
<br />
Which completely screwed my ability to pull.<br />
<br />
That was Wubao's gripe with those changes.<br />
<br />
When Wubao wanted to tank, Wubao made a warrior.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
<br />
If you look at the changes to monks that are in the works, however, you'll find that many of them are addressing that very issue.<br />
<br />
- A targetable lull skill to improve pulling.<br />
<br />
- Dodge from behind, to improve pulling.<br />
<br />
- An upgrade to stonestance, which carries with it STUN IMMUNITY. It's on a fast refresh timer, too. It, also, improves pulling.<br />
<br />
The intent of these changes makes me happy. The effect obviously remains to be seen. But improving monk pulling capabilities ... that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What defines a proper mana cost for aggro? Your sensibility? &quot;<br />
<br />
As many many people have stated, level 9 and level 15 spells that have no chance of landing on a target are probably NOT proper mana investment for the aggro generating results they produce.<br />
<br />
Cease, Desist, Fear ... that's not what you should be using on level 60+ mobs to keep your aggro high.<br />
<br />
Use level 60+ spells.<br />
<br />
It's a problem ... a bug ... it needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
It's not my sensibility here. It's COMMON sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will it mean for bards?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ask any bard around about how much aggro their songs generate. I've been down that road before, and been told in quite extensive detail about how bard slows, mezzes, and stuns do NOT generate significant aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't get your point at all.<br />
<br />
You want to taunt me with the monk mitigation nerf? Please. I've been through that a million times already. It's water under the bridge.<br />
<br />
If the new melee enhancements improve my ability to pull, and let me find my niche in EQ again, I could care less about my ability to absorb damage when compared to a warrior.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with the devs seeking to FIX the problem of people using level 9 and level 15 spells to maintain aggro on mobs level 60+. Those spells should have been abandoned long before level 65. You don't see level 65 wizards busting out Flame Shock do you? Or level 65 clerics tossing lesser healing on you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warcry</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple solution:<br />
<br />
Adjust the pally line of stuns so that only stuns actually<br />
land on a 55/65 mob for stuned (X) amound of time will generate agro, period.<br />
<br />
General Weapon Procs with Stun: Leave them alone<br />
since warriors are the only ones who DEPEND on them to maintain agro,and most weapon stuns are not Paladin <br />
based stuns anyways.  Problem fixed.</div></div><hr />
