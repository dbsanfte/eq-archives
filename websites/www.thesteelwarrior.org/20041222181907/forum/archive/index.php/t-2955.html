<br />
But, exactly how?<br />
<br />
Here is what I know:<br />
A1&gt; If a non-charmed pet has the most aggro, and there is no PC in melee range, the mob will attack the non-charmed pet.<br />
<br />
A2&gt; If a non-charmed pet has the most aggro, and a PC is in melee range, the mob will attack the highest aggro PC in melee range.<br />
<br />
A3&gt; Uncertain: If a PC successfully uses /taunt on an NPC, where there is an uncharmed pet that has the most aggro, the PC will gain the pets aggro.<br />
<br />
A4&gt; Uncertain: If a Pet successfully uses /taunt on an NPC, where there is a PC or another Pet that has the most aggro, the pet gains the PC's aggro.<br />
<br />
B1&gt; If there are fewer than 5 things (1 to 4) on a mobs aggro list, charmed pets behave like non-charmed pets aggro wise.<br />
<br />
B1 Clarification&gt; Both PCs and Pets (and maybe NPCs) count towards this limit. So, if a PC makes their pet attack a mob, that is 2 things (both the pet and PC have aggro). The charmed pet and the PC controlling the pet count as 2 of the 4 things, leaving at most 2 other aggro sources before things get wierd.<br />
<br />
B2&gt; If a charmed pet has the most aggro, and there are more than 4 things on the mobs aggro list, the mob will attack the most aggro PC, ignoring proximity.<br />
<br />
B3&gt; Uncertain: If a PC successfully uses /taunt on an NPC, where there is a charmed pet that has the most aggro, the PC will gain the pets aggro.<br />
<br />
B4&gt; Uncertain: Charmed pets /taunt ability.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering about is how much do charmed pets and uncharmed pets aid in holding aggro.<br />
<br />
I do know how it worked before the charmed pet changes:<br />
<br />
X1&gt; If a Charmed pet has the most hate, then the highest aggro PC in melee range would be attacked. Failing that, the pet would be attacked.<br />
<br />
X2&gt; If a PC used /taunt, they would gain all the aggro of the charmed pet.<br />
<br />
X2 was empirically tested in taking out BoT tower bosses. A single charmed pet was used for initial engagement, tanks ran up periodically and tapped /taunt. Wizards chain nuked without drawing aggro. When charm broke, the tanks where summoned (not the wizards or the enchanter), stuns/mez where used to control the insane pet, and recovery was executed.<br />
<br />
I think if I'm right, the use of charmed pets on bosses should allow a warrior to bootstrap their aggro as fast as a SK or Paladin could.<br />
<br />
To a lesser extent, mage air pets might also help -- they proc stuns rapidly, and attempt to /taunt themselves above the warrior.  However, the high end warriors DPS and procs could make air pets insufficient.</div></div><hr />

But only if pc's are in melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pets cannot hold top agro list if a PC is in range (actually they can be on top, but mob will always choose a PC over a pet).  I use my pet to help a warrior hold agro through slows.<br />
<br />
Also, if the pet is highest on agro list, and the pets owner comes into range...the pet's owner is considered to be on top of the agro list (meaning they get smacked).<br />
<br />
I love bst pets after 53 for this tactic.  We get a proc named Spirit of the Storm...the effect is a 1.5 sec stun, 200 hate increase, and a 122 DD on fire resist.  Holds agro through most slows after two procs (and I tell shaman and enchanters this).  Even if you're not the one holding agro, it still stays on you because the pet is holding it.  If it's true you CAN taunt off the pet and gain it's agro, then my claim that &quot;pet classes are your friends&quot; must be repeated. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to use this trick a lot because my old alt is a magician.  I would sometimes play him out of group and use the pet to keep the mob from bouncing around.  Over time I found it really useful, but once you start getting your hands on some high damage 2handers or EB/TB weapons, your agro will far exceed that of the pets.  Mind you though, they still taunt and will keep up with you because of it, hence the reason pets aren't always your best friend when you try and position. :D</div></div><hr />
