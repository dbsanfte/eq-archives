Pick up group...Low AA bard puller, I was MT. Cleric, shaman, rogue and ranger to round out group.<br />
<br />
DId it in about 45 minutes. Hardly broke a sweat. <br />
<br />
1400 AC unbuffed is more than enough to tank a hard--at least in EC. Don't let the hype get to you.<br />
<br />
Had fun...wish I did not have to wait for 148 normals first.</div></div><hr />

Your set-up seems more than enough to get hard wins, very cool.  Be cool if more people didn't buy into the hard setting hype and were more willing to do em, hehe.<br />
<br />
/agree Kend...good puller just makes hard LDoN really nice.  Having a good puller makes these adventures accessible/winable to a group that might feel they are undergeared for it. And it doesn't have to be just bards. Have had great monk pullers for hard setting, and just behid them good chanter and cleric pullers. Though resists on hards for cleric or chanters can cause serious problems, and depending on group it is sometimes not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats Kailyn.  I remember it was a few months ago that you first asked about hard LDONs.  Glad you had a good first experience.  Once you can think in terms of 105-point adventures, the LDON gear costs don't look nearly so bad - and it's really damn satisfying to get a piece of loot in hard LDON, since it's almost always an upgrade for someone.  To top it off, the XP is as good as POP tier 3.</div></div><hr />

Group was tank(me), mnk, rng, enc, shm and clr. 1st thing that happens, is that monk goes ld when zoning in. After a few 2-mob pulls from me, which get mezzed easily, the cleric is lom.<br />
<br />
Pull 5 - I die due to a CH landing on the shaman pet, after waiting 20 seconds for CH and THEN using furious.<br />
<br />
Pull 6 - Monk is back, and we're killing a mob that leaves me at 40% hp, and shaman pet again getting his ubah CH (mustv'e been a special puppy). Shaman then suggests that he can help out a bit on heals if there seems to be any trouble, &quot;I have memmed a heal now, my best one blabla&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is where I left the LDoN, and swore to never do pickup shit again...<br />
<br />
(sorry for derailing the post some, but needed to bitch about this)</div></div><hr />

I had the most fun I have ever had in ldon in this one.  Pally (pulled), myself,cleric,shaman,bst, and wizard.   We had a couple pulls with 3 mobs but the shaman just rooted them and went on their way.<br />
<br />
I would never avoid anything because someone thinks it to hard. IMO just go at it and try it, if you die then you get rezzed ooh well. :)<br />
<br />
Congrats on your first hard ldon win.  Hope you continue to do some as they drop some nice items.  One of my earrings and rings are from ldon's and they look like the would be upgrades for you.  Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />

O bah, make that enchanter work!!!  Nothing more fun then pulling Tak with all those friggin doors and the huge agro ranges.  Just get a heal over time first.<br />
<br />
Pre target is &gt; good puller imho.<br />
<br />
And gratz, hope you do some more.  The exp and the intensity and drops are what makes ldons so much fun.<br />

Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratz Kailyn, wish I could say my experience had been the same.<br />
<br />
If I had been with a guild group on the 2 hards I've attempted so far I would probably have 2 successes, unfortunately I was not.<br />
<br />
Last night was almost comical, after 25 minutes of the 5 people in the group waiting for our enchanter to get there, he finally arrives, we get adventure and set out toward the entrance.  Everyone gets there, except the enchanter, after about 5 minutes, no chanter.  5 more minutes of asking chanter wru, no chanter at zone in, 5 more minutes chanter ld's.  Should have known here to just log and forget it.<br />
<br />
But I didn't, and to make a long post short, at 37 minutes to go in the adventure we had killed ... 3 mobs.  Yes, 3, not 30, not 13 but 3.  <br />
<br />
Not doing any more pickup group hards, unless I know for a fact the group knows wtf they are doing.  I'm not a beefy enough tank yet to make up for shortfalls in the group makeup and it's not worth wasting an hour and a half of our time to realize there is no possible way we are going to make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say you are beefy enough...about the same as me. Yes you do have to get lucky. I did a second hard with a much less powerful pick up group. And we were behind in time, but at least I was having fun. (Far less boring that normals.) Then the enchanters wife went into labor. Needless to say that killed the group. Since she was not supposed to go into labor yet, I hope she is ok.<br />
<br />
Family &gt;&gt; EQ, even Hard LDoNs.<br />
<br />
I am just wondering how 66th will effect hards.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the beer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoth</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience in hard LDoN's are from a cleric's perspective.  <br />
<br />
Not an uber cleric, pre-elemental.  Some hard's I've won had a very good bard pulling, we always got single pulls, and bard had it slowed before war even started tanking.  We won that in about 40 min.  <br />
<br />
Another hard, lost at literally 2 minutes to go for last collection, looted it literally about 20 seconds after we lost.   Had plenty of tanking, just not enough dps.  Another few.. well we just lost, bad combo, whatever the reason was. <br />
<br />
In the end it depended mostly on makeup of group and teamwork more than anything else.  Play with competent players, it's fairly easy, play with people who aren't used to it, and things can go bad real quick.  But exp in it is awesome, point reward is great and you can pick up some nice phat lewts as well.  First time as a cleric healing for LDoN hard I was on the edge of my seat, bugging out, but things turned out ok in the end (yeah I died a couple times, no big deal :) )<br />
<br />
To me the biggest factor was the puller.  Having a bad puller or even a mediocre puller can be deadly, as soon as you get 3 pulls you have a fair chance of dying unless you have a good chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow I just re-read my post and I sounded really bitter lol.  I only meant to say that if I had a few more hp and aa's I would be beefy enough to make up for maybe a little less dps or a cleric that isn't top notch, and that it currently isn't worth it to accept a pickup group hard LDoN knowing that I could contribute to it being virtually impossible.  However, if any friends or guildies want to tackle one I'm all for it.<br />
<br />
The first attempt sounds a lot like the one Shoth described, we missed it by less than a minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did my first ldon with my warrior during the weekend, had a monk for puller which worked okey, had bards before and they have been doing a nice job with 90% single pulls.<br />
<br />
Question i have is as a warrior in ldon is a puller(like monk/sk/bard) a &quot;must&quot;,<br />
can't see how i can single out mobs in some spots since there rather close to each other, and at my level mages do not have CoH and at least my chanter suffered from resists on mezz/slow in the mmc theme so pulling 4 might be nasty for the chanter, so does a warrior just shoot an arrow on mob closest and hope for the best or is there some trick to pulling(i'm sure there is :D )<br />
<br />
Ohh and grats on the hard one, haven't dared trying one yet since people seem obsessed with winning..</div></div><hr />

Ohh and grats on the hard one, haven't dared trying one yet since people seem obsessed with winning..Unfortunately there is no secret, you just have to shoot an arrow and hope for the best - taking into account pathing, your position and how the mobs will move when you aggro them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pinged and bought the last of my archetype defensive AA's and, of course, bragged about this on group. That led to speculation over whether we could survive the GoD trials. Being an intrepid bunch, we gave the first one a shot and succeeded! At that point, we were feelin' all UBAH! so we took our group to BB and swaggered through that with no problems, too.<br />
<br />
I feel like a burst through a milestone. <br />
<br />
Kailyn, break open the Overlord Stout!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Cracks open the Overlord Stout*<br />
<br />
I would love to see that in game. ;).<br />
<br />
Dacke--since you are talking about being a LDoN noob, I assume you are talking about both easies and hards.  For the easies, most of the time you can get 3 or less, which for almost all all 65 groups should not even break a sweat. <br />
<br />
For hards, non-time warrior's don't pull.<br />
<br />
Also big pulls can easily be handled by AET + furious and then stonewall. By the time furious is down 1-2 should ahve been peeled off, mezed, what have you, and stonewall will insure that the cleric is not blicked when they land the CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite work great to pull as well!  That is what I use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only disc i have is resistant so out of luck on that one :)<br />
<br />
Mobs don't seem to hit that hard but the casters are evil, had the other warrior in the adv last night get charmed and started slashing away on our healer :) amazing how mobs can succeed in casting when a hasted ogre stand slashing and bashing them :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulic</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For hards, non-time warrior's don't pull.<br />
<br />
If you are able to tank singles in hards, then you can pull. It takes some time to learn the layout and how adds work, but this is what I do.<br />
<br />
- Pre-target the mob you want mezzed. Tell your enchanter to assist for mezz target, and make sure they stand behind you when mezzing ( otherwise they'll get assist aggro on the lot of them ).<br />
<br />
- Get a heal over time when pulling. Once your group gets used to this the cleric will do it automatically and not cause delays. This will buy you some time until that first heal gets off.<br />
<br />
- Use your discs. If you get more than you can handle, don't hesitate to use a disc. You don't need to disc on named in LDoN, and defensive/stonewall has such a short refresh you can use it and have it ready for the next bad pull, assuming you don't do two in a short period.<br />
<br />
- When all else fails use furious/fortitude. Save this for emergencies as you will probably only be able to do it once or twice per adventure.<br />
<br />
- East Commonlands adventures are by far the easiest for a warrior to pull. Do them until you get used to the mechanics of a hard risk LDoN.</div></div><hr />
