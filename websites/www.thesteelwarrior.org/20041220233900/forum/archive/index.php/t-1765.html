<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ultimus</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about a command that is used like /shield. The refresh rate would be approximately the same as shield and it would not be hooked to anything.<br />
<br />
This is how this ability would work. A mob uses the /command on their current NPC target.  The warrior then begins to agro more the lower the hp the person on top of that mobs shitlist. One main benefit would be the lower hp the warrior got the better agro he gets. Ultimately, if someone other then the warrior is on top of the shit list, the warrior's agro will scale as their hp declines. <br />
<br />
This ability could even work as a lifesaver. Perhaps if a warrior uses the /command on a mob and the mob's current target is in low health agro the mob will automatically attack the warrior as long as the person on top of the list is low on health.<br />
<br />
<br />
This ability would last one to two minutes. <br />
<br />
It might help make warriors more desirable in groups because they can use this ability to save lives. If someone begins to take a beatin from a mob /command it (still can't think of a good name so just saying /command) if they reach low on health agro you gain agro for the duration of the ability.<br />
<br />
This ability would not stack with other warriors but it would benefit groups by having multiple warriors because multiple mobs could be /commanded and no one would die.<br />
<br />
It might even be nice if warriors could gain a chance to block incoming hits when using this ability in conjunction with a shield. <br />
<br />
I was also thought that this ability and /shield should be able to be used at same time.<br />
<br />
Well, if you have any questions post them here. It is kinda difficult explain it but I'll post a few scenarios real fast.<br />
<br />
Scenario one: Mob is incoming, warrior is tanking it. The warrior is currently on top of the mob's hate list. The warrior then uses this ability on the mob. As the warrior's hp decreases his agro builds up and he gains a chance to block if he has a shield equipped.<br />
<br />
Scenario two: Mob is incoming slower slows mob and gains agro and is now on top of the hate list. Warrior uses this ability on mob. As the slower's hp decreases the Warrior's agro builds up. Once the warrior reaches the top of the shit list again the Warrior's agro is now based off his own hp for the duration of the ability.<br />
<br />
Scenario three: Mob is incoming Enchanter slows and proceeds to get owned by named_mob00. Warrior uses this ability on the mob. The enchanter falls to 25% health and gains low on health agro. Warrior automatically gains agro for the rest of the duration of the ability or until the enchanter is healed. Once the enchanter is healed the warrior stays on top of the shit list. To further balance this. If a person nukes while in low health state (after the warrior gained agro as stated above) it would break the link and they would gain aggro. This would be to prevent someone from getting low health then chain nuking.<br />
<br />
Edit: In Scenario three it looks as if someone could perma nuke without fear of agro. However, I intend for the ability to be like divine aura when the person on top of the shit list reaches low health they lose agro as if they were Divine Auraed. Thus, even though the warrior is then put on top of the shit list again, if someone were to chain nuke they'd out agro the warrior.<br />
<br />
One more Edit: Scenario Four: Two mobs are pulled. The enchanter once again reaches low health agro. The warrior uses his new ability on mob A. Mob a proceeds to attack the warrior. Mob B proceeds to own the enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is... when you want the aggro, it means you don't have it.<br />
And if you don't have the aggro, it means you're not being hit on,<br />
which in turn means that you'll never get the low health required to aggro the mob :/</div></div><hr />
