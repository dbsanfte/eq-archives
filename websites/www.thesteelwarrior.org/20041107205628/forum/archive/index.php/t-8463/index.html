<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rukekak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, <br />
<br />
Just would like a little advice on the AA's I should start first...<br />
<br />
I sit at 7511 HP's and 1401 AC with Raid buffs.  We are doing High end Velious, Ssra Temple, Tier 1 pop type raiding.  I am our guilds MT for these raids.  <br />
<br />
So, should I get ND to get over 8K HP's or should I work on getting missed more often to begin with?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I bet you will see as many responce on either solution.<br />
But my personnal view is go for as much mitigation/avoidance as you can so I would go for CA1 -&gt; CS1 -&gt; ND1 -&gt; roll two times.<br />
But since you don't fight deep in PoP your AC right now is good so maybe, in your particular case I would advise you to go for ND 2 then CA/CS1 then ND3 then CA/CS3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stay Puft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming that you get xp relatively fast, it shouldn't make a big difference.  <br />
<br />
In you case I would do HP &gt; Mitagation, because your AC is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IMHO all three are important.  That being said, people tend to focus in on how many hps you have more so then your mitigation ablitly.  Therefore I say realisticaly either 3 will help, but since ND will boost your hps and potentialy make you more attractive to a group I would go with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Curdlex. If you group with people that won't ask for your hp, CA is probably the strongest of the 3, but given that people rate your ability solely on the number of HP 50% of the time, ND3 will get your groups that the other two won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ibiudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree Curdlex.

<br />
 my war isn't high enough for aa's atm, however my sister is a 65 pally so looking on her aa list. and going with the fact that she is in the tank line up for tier 2/3 PoP flag mobs at times.<br />
  ND= hps,, but would it hurt not to be MT all the time? let someone else learn<br />
  CS= mitigatoin,, not take as much dmg,, nice but not as good as simply not getting hit at all.<br />
   CA= not getting hit,, i'd rather not get hit so my hp &amp; mitagation don't even matter.<br />
 <br />
 but for 2 aa's each,, take 1 lvl of each and see which one seems to be the largest improvment for YOU, not some one else. also look at stat aa's,, innate dex, agi, sta improves those as well. planer power raise's max stat's by 5/lvl, planer durablity raise's max hp's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mitigation &gt; hps<br />
<br />
Period.<br />
<br />
Having &quot;x&quot; number of hps rarely matters unless you're fighting truely nasty shit.  It gives your cleric a bit more to work with, but your dmg intake rate is far more important from a clerical and rational viewpoint.<br />
<br />
DPS doesnt kill tanks ... dmg spikes kill tanks.   Avoidance/Mitigation drastically reduces dmg intake and chops the peaks off of nasty spikes.  Honestly unless you literally don't have enough hps for the content you are trying to do ... get LR5 and ID5 before even touching ND2+.<br />
<br />
I'd reccomend getting 1 of each and then buying PE, however.  PE is probably the best buy out there.  2% mitigation, avoidance, and hp increase for 5aa ... only problem is you need to train cs1, ca1 and nd1 to make it work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ND before CS/CA because the latter two won't do a thing against spells/procs, whereas ND allows you a better chance of living through it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get them all asap.  The order you do them in isn't important but you need them all maxed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ND first if you are your guilds MT.  Healing on raids is worst case scenario usually.  While your HPs and AC are good for your stage of the game IMO, the extra HPs will be more useful to your clerics  on raids.  I have the AA's you are asking about and I do see improvements from the avoidance and mitigation ones on 95% (guessing on that number btw) of the combat rounds that mobs hit me on.  However, on the remainder of them, where I take near full damage on every hit they dont do squat and the HPs serve me better.<br />
<br />
Brutal is correct though, you need them all asap.  Only do offensive ones when you cannot maintain aggro through the debuffing of the mobs.  If other melee are taking aggro it is their fault on a raid and should be taught how to manage their aggro.<br />
<br />
Now if you were an exp group tank I would suggest just the opposite as mitigation and avoidance usually play more into exp group healing efficiency than your hps.<br />

Just my 2 cps worth,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i was in the exact same situation a year ago as you are now. i'm ganna have to say that at your progressions lvl your HP are above all else and i would get ND first as alot of mobs in ToV and ssra and most of the tier1 and 2 pop bosses have AEs and procs that effect you no matter how much avoidance or mitigation you have. yes, avoidance can help against procs, but in reality you're ganna get hit by them eventually and having the most HP possible will help alot. <br />
<br />
your AC is already pretty good. more or less the same i had when i was tanking ToV and ssra. <br />
<br />
<br />
i know everyone is ganna say get CA before CS, but i'm ganna play devils advocate and say get CS first. my reasoning, at least in my opinion, is that CS will save you from taking spike damage more so then CA. every other tank in my guild at the time did CA first and sooner or later they would all take a critical round where they got hit by every attack and died shortly after. the theory i adapted (again MY oppinion) is that eventually the RNG will catch up with you and the mob will land a quad. CS/ID/defensive will, more or less, work on every hit, where as CA/LR/evasive will eventually fail and you'll get stuck taking a full round, sometimes 2 (streeky RNG), and usually it's just enough to finish you off. it's the differance between hoping you dont take a full round of melee and being ready to take a full round. i choose to be ready and capable of dealing with it. <br />
i do realize that i mentioned above that avoidance helps agains procs, but 90% of the damage from the mobs you'll be facing will come from melee.<br />
<br />
i agree with everyone on the point that you'll need to get all those AAs as soon as possible and that eventually it wont matter what order you get these AAS in as long as you get them all. <br />
<br />
just as a side note tho, make sure you get all the arch type AAs (ND CS CA) before you get the PoP AAs (ID LR).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">CS/ID/defensive will, more or less, work on every hit, where as CA/LR/evasive will eventually fail and you'll get stuck taking a full round,.<br />
<br />
This is false.  You can take a full round with CS and ID as well, and it's exactly the same chance as taking a full round with CA.<br />
<br />
CS does not reduce the maximum hit of a mob, it merely increases your mitigation level slightly.  You can still take maximum hits, and you WILL still take max hits, so there is no difference between the 2.<br />
<br />
Some people attribute this to streakyness or &quot;Spike Damage,&quot; but lets be fucking serious here.  Everyone in a raid guild knows a tank with full defensive AA's who just gets trashed in one round because he isn't lucky enough to mitigate all the hits down far enough to survive.  It's gonna happen no matter what AA's you have, you just have a smaller chance with each added defensive AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Very true Haass, this is why at the stage of the game that the poster is at I suggested ND first.  Giving the clerics 10% more hps to play with is the ONLY thing that isnt subject to the RNG.  If your guild is raiding, your clerics overheal you all the time to make sure when you take that full damage round you will get healed before you die.<br />
<br />
Fried</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">yes, avoidance can help against procs <br />
<br />
Well in fact procs land even if you don't hit, they are separate, but I think the same way, begin with ND3 for HP against mélée/spell, after that maybe PE to get a small boost in the 3, and then do CS for static mitigation, after that do CA, because CA is quite random as CS is static.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pretty sure it's been shown that innate procs require a hit to proc, whereas weapon procs do not.  Thankfully, most mean mob procs are innate. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well in fact procs land even if you don't hit<br />
<br />
Wrong. NPC's cannot proc unless they successfully hit you. If they are wielding a weapon that procs (very rare does this happen) then they can proc on a miss.<br />
<br />
CA is quite random as CS is static<br />
<br />
Wrong again. CS is not a fixed dmg reduction ability. It reduces the amount of damage taken by making the mob hit for max less often.<br />
<br />
If you read back through all of these posts you will see where this has been posted already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Tanking like a sack of paper made me feel like a dress wearer... cough.Get your mitigation and avoidance aa followed by hp stuff.That doesn't mean do lr &amp; Id before nd3 ,bear in mind relative cost effectiveness.I thought I saw parses on the old board showing ca being more valuable than cs fractionally and lr better than id somewhat...may have just been  an  agreed upon perception tho.<br />
<br />
PS.I liked to finish each aa before moving on to the next.A lot of aa's seem to show a decent return only when maxed pre GOD stuff.I was in champ,crafted and pog with some fh at the time I did this and my hp/ac were pretty crap by an old server standard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This has been my policy, so figure i'll throw a word in edgewise.<br />
<br />
1. Point in Each<br />
2. Physical Enhancement<br />
3. CA<br />
4. ND<br />
5. CS<br />
<br />
I did it that way for multiple reasons. I started off with a point in each because the return was the greatest % increase in tankability to aa cost. Same for Physical enhancement.<br />
<br />
Now as for the 3, here's my breakdown.<br />
<br />
CA - I really do believe avoidance is near godly. It's streaky, but so is combat stability. Combat stability definitely ISN'T a fixed amount, it sometimes goes off and sometimes doesnt, the difference between the two is that with CA you avoid contact procs. Now I think damage reduced is usually more efficient than hp, because you require less healing, and it makes every spot heal on you that much more efficient. Remember that complete heal isn't the only heal thats ever going to land on you. With CA and LR maxed I was able to tank hard LDoN's with 6500hp, where as a friend with 8100hp was too taxing manawise. Less healing = good.<br />
<br />
ND - I chose hp before mitigation because of AE damage and proc damage. Mitigation doesn't do anything for either, though I was tempted to go mitigation first just to make those spot heals more efficient.<br />
<br />
CS - CS and ID seem to be doing more for me now that i'm finishing them up and have higher ac, it's an increase in your mitigation, and when you're already getting good mitigation from AC i think it really helps to level it out. I think people who tell you mitigation aa are better for you when you have low AC, aren't really crunching the numbers and are assuming the mitigation aa will make up for your AC, when in fact I think they do a better job of complimenting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This is how I know CS/ID to work.<br />
<br />
A mob incoming hit does 1000 damage.<br />
<br />
You mitigate 100 points of that damage.<br />
<br />
I don't know the #'s, but lets say CS/ID adds to 10percent of that.<br />
<br />
You have now mitigated 110 damage, and will now be hit for 890 instead of 900.<br />
<br />
PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're wrong.<br />
<br />
Mobs can only hit for 20 discreet values.  All CS/ID does is slide your distribution of hits chart slightly to the left, meaning that OVERALL, you will be hit for lower values than a tank without said skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Just a little tidbit I had remembered seeing back on the AC vs. Shields thread thats stickied at the top of this forum...<br />
<br />
[qoute=&quot;Kavhok&quot;]You folks do a great job of parsing and figuring out the mechanics of the game. I don't want to leave you with no mysteries at all =) I will say this:<br />
<br />
3) Yes, the mitigation AAs will not do anything for you if your AC isn't high enough. However, the median level 65 warrior is over the cap even with both Luclin and PoP mitigation AAs maxed, so you can safely assume you're getting the full benefit out of them.<br />
<br />

<br />
Just throwing it out there so its in the same place as the rest of this great info ya'll are throwing out here :)  And just from a ranger perspective, I've played MH in a number of LDoN and Earth groups, and as far as heals other than CH are concerned, in a group setting keep in mind, I think that mitigation and avoidance are much more important than total HPs.  I'd take a 7k fully LR/ID warrior over a 8.5k w/o those AAs any day of the week, unless we are fighting mobs that are just nuts, then I'll find a warrior with 8.5k and  the AAs hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">you know what you just said made me think about something.<br />
<br />
the curve of hits makes alot more sense in that statement.<br />
<br />
we all know that ac regardless of how high or low has some impact, but if CS doesn't make a difference with ac that's too low (read mob attack responds to a ac range of say 1k-3k) nothing will take effect, not that it doesn't have a effect but a 10% of .1 will do nothing....<br />
<br />
what if the mitigation is a % and the CS modifies it by 10% ish?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to think of a good way to describe what I'm thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">This is false.  You can take a full round with CS and ID as well, and it's exactly the same chance as taking a full round with CA.<br />

CS does not reduce the maximum hit of a mob, it merely increases your mitigation level slightly.  You can still take maximum hits, and you WILL still take max hits, so there is no difference between the 2.<br />
<br />
i was refering more toward defensive vs evasive, but i guess i probably shouldnt of lumped them together since this thread is about CS and CA. <br />
<br />
my asumption was based more around using defensive vs evasive. defensive always runs smoother against nasty mobs until you've hit the AC mark for that mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jumbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">personally i went with nd3 before anything else... then i hit Area taunt and physical enhancement for the nd3 boost. then i went back for ca and cs. i did this because my AC was pretty good and i was advised that HP &gt; all ... since then i have some to the conclusion that in my personal case that i should have staggered nd ca and cs instead of going all out hp.  not saying wich way would be best for everyone just saying that i found this to probably have been the best way to go for me. But then again i am not the mt for my guild. hope this helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Pretty sure it's been shown that innate procs require a hit to proc, whereas weapon procs do not. Thankfully, most mean mob procs are innate.  <br />
<br />
I just noticed it while rampage tanking hand of the maestro, no lifetap proc if it doesn't land ;)<br />
<br />
And for my thought on the CA/CS AA, no need throw me stones, that was said but that didn't mean it was true, I have no proof if fact but I may trust peoples that did parses, anyhow i didn't know about khavok's quote, wich do the change, in fact CA may be more profitable in every situation than CS because of the AC.</div></div><hr />
