With all we know about EQII with its graphics,  instance group fights,  small raid size. more casual gamer appeal to the whole game, and so forth.  Would you buy or play the game if SOE had nothing to do with it?<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that with all the players of EQ, EQII is getting a bad rep already just because SOE is developing it.  We all have concerns that it will be full of bugs, broken content and in general will havea bad release.  Only because SOE is developing it.   If SOE wasn't at the helm for the game would you all think that EQII will have less bugs (no games is bug free), all content and quests are done, and will have a smooth release?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that SOE is giving EQII a bad name even before beta starts, the game sounds great in theory but I am skeptical that they can pull it off in time for release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, being an achiver/powergamer (take your pick--if powergamer, a slow leveling one) the new crop of &quot;casual games&quot; are making me nervous. CoH, while fun, does not give me the sence of achivement that EQ did on realease. <br />
<br />
The more I play (and older I get) the more I think I like the idea of a game being a challege (at leas when you want it to be). I would love to be able to choose harder missions in CoH.</div></div><hr />

As things are at the moment, I have no intention of touching it.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind a challenge ( myself being a socializer/achiever ); but SoE/Verant's version of ' a challenge' since '01 leaves a taste in one's mouth reminiscent of fecal material.<br />
<br />
CoH isn't bad; but i think people's idea of ' a challenge' has been horribly misconstrued by EQ and people expect the same stupidity when gaming. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-23-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, i'm going to go hang out at Best Buy or something on release date and fucking laugh at everyone who buys this game.  Even if you like EQ, you've got to know that if it wasn't for your friends, you wouldn't be playing that piece of shit anymore.<br />
<br />
You've also seen the horrible failure that SWG was even tho all the EQ fans jumped on that bandwagon too. Anyone who buys EQ2 deserves what they get as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />

EQ was a good game when they first brought it out, went up hill... then down hill... then hit a cliff... Its Sony thats totally fucked up, not the game itself. Unless they're doing everything they SHOULDN'T be doing on EQ, just so they know what to do and what not to do, I think Sony is just gonna screw up EQ2 too, maybe dx10 will come out during EQ2 yay! More collisions anyone?</div></div><hr />

- I remember the joy of killing wisps with a summoned dagger for lightstones and later buying a combine weapon, yay!<br />
- I remeber exploring Kurark as an non-iksar without the aid of magical spires and books. All the iksars in FoB went like wtf, when they saw me.<br />
<br />
For some reason, my fun has declined with each expansion after Kunark. Kunark was challanging and exotic, but that has since been ruined by silly magical books. Now, everyone level their low level alts in kurns.<br />
<br />
So now we have EQ2 - Made by the same company, that spits out a crappy expansion every 6 months or so. Sure it looks neat, but I fear it will hollow and dull...more egomongering, more grinding, more camping and most of all....easy!<br />
<br />
Naa, I'm putting my faith in WoW, since Blizzard is behind. May or may not be good, but I'll certainly buy it when it goes gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think that SOE is the worst, or even near the bottom in bad decisions, then you have not played many online games.<br />
<br />
In the past 5 years I have seen hype for probably 20-30 games that were the &quot;next EQ killer&quot;. The vast majority of those pretty much sucked, about half are gone, and the rest have about 1/20th as many subscribers as EQ does.<br />
<br />
So, while SOE may have problems, if you think the grass is any greener in any other game, lottsa luck.</div></div><hr />
