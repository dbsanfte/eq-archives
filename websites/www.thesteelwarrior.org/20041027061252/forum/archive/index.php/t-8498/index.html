<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corefighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellas,<br />
<br />
                 Basically the guild I am is not far off entering time and I have horeded plenty of dkp to puchase any time gear I need. I visted alakazam                            (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=178)<br />
<br />
and made a magelo and looked at every item to find which items I want from each.  <br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1088187<br />
<br />
I came accross items that I would probably replace the raex boots and leggings. What are your thoughts on this, am I just not looking at this the wrong way or what?<br />
<br />
Also if you guys feel there are any other items I should look at in replace of any of that gear I'd really apreciate any help avalible.<br />
<br />
I apreciate any help you guys can give me. Please understand I am just worried about time not what upgrades I can get from god.<br />
<br />
Thanks fellas =)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Also all my judgements where made on hp/ac if you know of any items with better then each slot. I'd apreciate the name =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If ur guild is going to do ikkinz soon(get leggings and offhand) I would say DBotW, RZ shoulders, RZ ring, Quarm bracer should be on ur primary list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Corefighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We wont be worrying about god for a long while. So I just wanna sought a full set of time gear out.  Looking into bracer now also =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Corefighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks mate. Made some adjustements. I'd apreciate if you knew of any other better gear mate. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Saryn or VZ ranged instead of Bow, RZ or Quarm cloak instead of Phase3 cloak, TZ ring or CT ring(since RZ ring effect doesn't stack with Quarm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Herzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make Dbow your number 1 target in time ithink, most guilds dont get real lucky w/ them (my guild is current at 30ish kills with 4 drops). As for Eoe I was not impessed with it personally dont even bother asking for this until you have a dbow if you really even want it (Jagged Onyx Staff, in Ikkinz Glorified raid is better imo). BP might be contested i know it was for my guild at the start. <br />
<br />
Shoulders, Back, Legs, Feet, Ring, Bracer, Neck, Both Earings and Bracer are all good you if can manage to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DBoTW drop rate is very very random. We are like 3/8. Then some other guilds go 0/20. I would pick that up asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Four Quarm loots (Cloak, Ring, Earring, and Bracer).  Hope you got a lot of DKP to spend.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm pretty sure the click effects from the two rings you selected (RZ's and Quarms) don't stack, so that's a bit of a waste.<br />
<br />
Definately put Saryrn's ranged item symbol of planemasters on your list. . .it's clicky adds a stun proc to your weapon.<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly sure how to compare shielding with AC and hps, but shielding seems to be a very significant effect.<br />
<br />
I don't care if you're not interested in GoD now, you'll have Ikkiniz legs alot sooner than others with all the loot on your shopping list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The biggest thing to remember about PoTime is don't get excited and bid on every little thing that drops. It's a good idea to start at the big items (don't wait for a DBotW to drop before you bid on anything else, but..) and not get overly excited about P1-2 loot. (even though at the time it'll look like pretty major upgrades)<br />
<br />
Stick to your plan, and good luck on Quarm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I waited for the select items I felt would serve me the longest in Time, and I am almost finished because of this (I still lack Darkblade, RZ shoulders and ring, and Quarm bracer and Earring). Everything else is easily replaced not too far into GoD.<br />
<br />
Take a good look at what you want to be when you leave Time, and dont waste loots on stuff that doesnt place you in that area.</div></div><hr />
