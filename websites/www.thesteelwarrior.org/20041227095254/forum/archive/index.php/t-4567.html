<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uh, yes sir, it would. I use Evasive quite frequently on mobs that are 'elemental and above'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what he is saying is this does not ONLY effect overlords so it may not be a topic that qualifies for this forum as it is suppose to be regulated to End game specific issues.<br />
<br />
It does effect us and I use evasive as well but it doesnt ONLY effect us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much every war I know still uses defensive 100% of the time, not realizing there is another disc, it's not untill, well realyl guakr (his little proc is a pita), but mostly past that that people start using evasive.<br />
<br />
So technically, this does effect mostly overlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No disciplines of any kind are working at all on Test right now, so I wouldn't panic yet.  <br />
<br />
Welcome to the Arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myst clarified exactly what i meant.  Believe it or not, there are non-elmental warriors know that /disc evasive exists *and* use it.  <br />
<br />
This forum just got a very broad name, to mean something very narrow.  Confusion abounds! /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use defensive on 2 mobs in time, tallon and vallon the rest are purely evasive.  As for elemental gods they are all evasive mobs.  Minis in fire water ect are defensive but i havent done those in months.  Time is purely an avoidance based zone for the most part since the majority of mobs, especially tier 5 have a large min hit and relatively low max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to keep in mind is that Evasive and Defensive have the same refresh time when you get them, but since they scale with level evasive has a quicker refresh at higher level.   No reason to think that evasive and defensive would not have the same refresh time when they are put into Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">defensive is 630 second refresh on test and evasive is 630 second refresh on test.  Defensive at 65 on live server is 630 second refresh, evasive however is 450 second refresh.  It doesnt effect how they scale based upon levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I mean is, at the level you get them, evasive and defensive are both 15 minute refresh, or 15:30, whatever, they both start out with the same refresh, the only reason they are different at 60 is because evasive is lower level, and they both go down by a minute or so per level up to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it may be it may not be.  They are now spells so im not sure how they are going to work ect or have any effect on faster refresh with level.  Will be fun once they fix shit to see how it works, although most is working atm.  You also have to realize the refresh on resistance and fearless is 1800 seconds now or 30 minutes.  If your theory is correct they will have 5 and 15 min refresh times for a 35 and 45 disc, which they dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would appear that the new refresh times in Lucy are *NOT* meant to scale down with level, as discs currently do. Almost all of them are shorter than *BASE* re-use currently is on live. Only a few are longer than the level 60+ re-use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Confirmed, Defensive and Evasive are on the same timer now, both are 10 min 30 sec refresh at level 65.<br />
<br />
Small nerf on Evasive, but it's a pretty rare situation where I have wanted to use evasive twice in less than 10 minutes.  Overall the disciplines are much improved by this change, but I'm not sure why they would increase the refresh on Evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaruk</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think because Evasive will be on the same timer as Defensive.  And these will be on a separate timer from the other melee abilities avialiable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the cheif reasons evasive was great was because of its short refresh timer.  Sure its just a tad longer now but I dunno if its going to be as worth it anymore.  Rathe council tanking is a good example of where evasive is great to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">half of the attractiveness of evasive is its shorter refresh time, now that that is gone there really is little use for it anymore since you will never get a second disc in.  This is really gonna hurt on a mob like time rz where hes throwing 1800-2200 dps on you nondisc.  I personally would rather have evasive left at 7 30 and give up all this upgrade shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pass the crack pipe please.<br />
<br />
Evasive is still worth using on a lot of mobs.   I don't know how it is on Time stuff, but evasive beat the hell out of defensive on the Fennin Ro parses on high-AC warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer evasive with the 10min30 timer if I can chain it with fortitude and aggressive.<br />
<br />
Evasive is still more useful with some proc based mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edone</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">are the timers on test seperated now,as in mins 1-3 you can be def,and 4-6 you can be evas? <br />
or fort/furious/def to begin each mob you tank? would be awful nice! <br />
<br />
alot fights where you need time to posiiton people between time when boss aggro's and when people need to be setup and already healing, 18secs of null on MT would be godly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not quite.  Evasive and Defensive can't be used together.  Fortitude and (I'm guessing) furious can't either, but you can use fortitude and then defensive/evasive immediately after.  Any two disciplines that are not listed as being on the same timer in my post above can be chained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can you turn off a disc?  Or begin a new one while you are still in the middle of an old one?  For instance, being aggressive, then having to switch on defensive to tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep. Just hit the disc again to turn it off. Hit another disc and it stops the current disc and starts the new one. Only problem I found was hitting some other disc that was unusable also caused the current disc to stop. For example I tried to check the recycle duration on aggressive which I had just used, while defensive was running and it stopped defensive. I reported it, lets see if they fix it or leave it as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cool, and sorry, just read the other thread. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can now link disciplines, then this may actually be a major boon: Fire up defensive and as it drops hit evasive; Sure, one may be better than the other in some cases, but it certainly beats fighting discless after the first disc drops on long fights. Sounds interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read Brutuls post above: you can only chain disciplines that do not share the same timer. You cannot chain defensive and evasive. <br />
<br />
So for extremely long fights like Xegony, this is a (mild) nerf. I am guessing its probably unintentional too.. because as noted defensive and evasive have same base reuse time when we first get it(15 mins) but reuse goes lower at 65.<br />
<br />
The programmer implenting the changes probably assumed defensive and evasive had the same reuse times at 65. So I would /bug this on test-server. Would be nice to have it fixed.</div></div><hr />
