<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious, and search results didnt bring up any help:<br />
<br />
How rare is the Spiroc Lord's piece for epic? I'm gonna be doin him soon to finish epic, I hope :) How good of a chance would it drop since after this one chance, it may be a while before I get to do it again. Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can respawn the lord an infinite number of times...check out pretty much any plane of sky guide for info on how to do this.  Usually what we did back in the day was go up and spawn him as many times as needed for all warriors there to get the blade.<br />
<br />
Ex:<br />
http://www.rpgexpert.com/index.php?art/id:624</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In order to &quot;perma spawn&quot; him, you need to keep one of the mobs on the island alive.<br />
<br />
So when you go to the island, think you get instant agro .. start killing the birds .. if they all agro, will have to train / memblur 1 bird.<br />
<br />
Hopeflully you get one of the birds that are pathing near the back of the island.<br />
<br />
When you kill the Lord, will have to pull him from his spawn point, once he dies, he will repop, so don't want to kill on spawn.<br />
<br />
He does Death touch, so expect to die alot.  Been awhile since I did mine, but had no problem with 20something (average was around 60-62 I think), got 2 deaths a pull (me and puller), and I had no problems tanking him with rez effects and no buffs.<br />
<br />
Took a good 2 hours to get 3 drops .. last 2 droped back to back.<br />
<br />
When he spawns, you can tell if he has blade, since he is wielding it.<br />
<br />
I HOPE this is correct, been a few years since I went (right after PoP came out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cool, thanks :) Least I know what to expect, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shrink everyone before keying to the Spiroc Island, Seemed to have no problems with aggroing on port up this way.</div></div><hr />

We kept them &quot;perma spawned&quot; also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, I must have had bad luck.<br />
<br />
Not sure how long it took for 3 .. memory says 1.5-2 hours, but probably less )).<br />
<br />
I was dying with rez effects on the whole time (from death touch), roatated the puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only mob you need to keep up is the Spiroc Guardian, he's on one side of the island, it's not too hard to pull the island without agroing.  He hits like a gimp slowed, just stick a pally or even a cleric to tank slowed to keep themselves alive.  Make sure not to hang around him when Sirran pops.<br />
<br />
Lord repops instantly every time he dies if you leave this guy up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks so much for info! :)<br />
<br />
It'll be mine soon! wewt! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Come back and update us when you achieve the epic, Quincent. I've got the big 3 (Sky, Fear, and Chardok) left on mine, so I'll be interested to hear your story.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Been a while also, <br />
<br />
 But think nothing on spiroks can see inv. Just inv , click up, turn left, follow edge. Park between the spot you clicked up at, and the dish for the next island. Nothing ever agrod us there. Well,,, till we pulled......<br />
<br />
 Still one of my favorate fights. 9 mobs no waiting :) &lt;Monks, we don`t need no stinking monks!&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, since we're talking about Sky and have some folks here who've spanked the Spiroc Lord ---<br />
<br />
How many people do you need to have with you to do this? I can probably scrape together a 2 group raid with an average level of 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Killing the Lord is a matter of having 1 cleric with a click stick, ppl that zone fast, and a lot of DPS :p<br />
<br />
Really, just click ppl as they die, make them tank even naked, and make the nukers burn him down. The faster you kill him, the less ppl will die and the less chances you have of failing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Llador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As noone has mentioned it...<br />
<br />
As the Spiroc Lord is the boss when he dies, Sirran the Lunatic will spawn over the corpse. You will probably know he is the NPC you need to get the keys from. Once up he remains for 20mins unless you hail him to keep him up (for players awaiting rezzes etc). If you fight near him he will aggro, As he doubles for 2k that is not advisable :p<br />
<br />
My advice would be, assuming the Isle is clear except for the Guardian (a static mob to the right of where you port  up) and Lord, as follows:<br />
<br />
From the port up go clockwise around the edge until you are on the straight to the Lord.  Pull the Lord to that corner so Sirran will be some distance away when he pops. Once the Lord is dead then all move through the middle of the Isle to near the Lords spawn point and pull him away to fight out of aggro range from his repop and Sirran. If he is wielding a sword then he drops the epic piece.<br />
<br />
If you have a bard with the Fading Memories skill then there is no problem keep pulling the Lord to the same spot and the bard can pull Sirran away out of range and use Fading Memories. Just watch the 20min timer.<br />
<br />
If you are on AB server I will be taking my guild to this plane several times in the coming weeks. Send me a tell in game and there may be an opportunity for you to tag along :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, here's the update:<br />
<br />
I did Sky with a guy from my server (was an open raid) to get Warrior epic drops, and anything else for others.<br />
<br />
We got there at 6pm and ended at 2am. Took us about 5 hours from keying to isle 4 killing stuff then off to isle 5 (cleared and ready for farmage). We farmed for 1 hour and 30 minutes or so and got 2 blades.<br />
<br />
Now, before the raid began.. the raid leader was defaulted 1 blade for his epic (no problems there). Later, when we got to the spiroc isle the guy said that the 2nd would be defaulted to the guy that always was willing to take inc (first) DT before taking out Lord. I thought that was a bad idea but didnt care really since I was hoping to get the drop eventually and be on my merry way. Now I'm somewhat unhappy I didnt speak up since I dont have a blade to show for it.<br />
<br />
To cut a lot of drama and back to the point: I was there for 7 hours roughly and was basically screwed out of a fair chance for a drop since we only got 2 blades (1 for raid leader, and other for DT taker). That's like defaulting a blade to a cleric's warrior alt just cuz he was there helping... kinda.<br />
<br />
The strat we did was not so pretty since we only had roughly 14 people (avg level 61) after about 10 rangers leaving once we moved up from isles 4 - 5 and things got hairy on the spiroc isle. What happened was we got up there, started pulls and got lots to begin with (maybe 5). The Guardian agroed as well so we got a mage pet to off-tank and it happened to be killing the guardian considerably fast so we had to get our pally to keep him busy with stuns and hitting him with H2H every now and again; even then he was dying a noticeable amount somehow. Once we got down to the final Vanquisher that basically paths next to the Lord, and 2 other spirocs, we had trouble splitting them from the Lord. Lord came after about 15 attempts at splitting. We killed him mezzing the adds.. then once the Lunatic spawned he noticed that the spiroc adds were beating on us -- wipe immediately following. We rezzed back up.. free of guardian (now at full health thank god since he was almost dead before) and other adds. So we started our farm on the Lord. Mind you, we didnt have any kind of bard/rogue to pull the Lunatic and escape a safe distance away to farm til timer ran out on him for a new one so we had to wait the full 20 minutes for despawn.. THEN kill Lord - rinse and repeat :(. <br />
<br />
It was the most boring 20 minute x4 wait I've sat through in a while.. so that explains how the raid ended so fast. We only were able to get 4 Lords in before the night was called and only 2 epics were finished.<br />
<br />
Now, since I may be buying (with raid points) a BoC with my guild soon and all this happening.. I'm totally bummed.. and may just quit the thought of getting the epic (as much as I'd love to complete a quest I've spent so much time on in the last year). But I may get it if I see another open raid happening again.<br />
<br />
I dunno.. there's the update if anyone was curious, hehe. A not too fun first experience with that piece :(<br />
<br />
So, how was y'alls day?? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Honestly ... I know the weapon looks cool and would feel great to finish, but in this age of Droga weapons and the like, there is no reason to have such bellyaches over the warrior epic.  Don't lose sleep over this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah don't fret so much over it man, do Xanamech/Icestorm pick ups, they're very fun to do... the first 2x.  But either way they drop much better weapons, or like Sass said you can head over to bazaar and pick up a CHoS and Bloodsworn.  The epic now days are just for the.. &quot;I did my epic&quot; check box in magelo.  Granted theres a few epics that are still unreplacable, and to some, their high end weapon.  As far as warrior epic goes, its trash, it looks cool, but its trash, you can buy better for 100x easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ya, that's only really why I want it.. to flash it around every now and again, hehe. The red blade wouldnt be too bad to have tho, I think, hehe. I know that I could buy better weapons for both hands at around 20k, but I had them (and still use the SotBS) but EVERY warrior/ranger has that set-up :P I wanna be different :P Granted I use a SoD right now, but that's only temporary from my G/F til I A) get red blade/GBoS/BoC/SBoD/CHSD or B) she wants it back for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Oh and I'm not losing sleep over that last raid, lol.. but it still sux to think about how it went and things were handled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Doomdweomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Quincent,<br />
<br />
 Cant wait to try it with you again. He and Dworion were up there (May 29) and we gottn the Spiroc Lord down 6 times if i remember correctly. He only dropped the blade twice. It was pretty late after that and the raid Disbanded. When we started out we had 26 members ,level 58 average, ported (death rez necro ported) or ran upto isle 4(pegasi and griffons) with invis and keys. After clearing that isle (easily) the raid shrank to 20ish. ( couple rangers and friends split when they got what they needed ..i.. )<br />
 Then came them Spirocs ... they have this tiny agro range and a wide assist, so we  Key'ed upto there and ran to the west edge and they didnt agro. One ranger that stayed , and a Pally were trying to pull and had an easy job up until we got the Island down to the Lord, Guardian, And two others (neither was a Vanquisher((the one's you kill first))) the guardian was agroing the pally(as mentioned in above post) close to where he spawns. We couldnt pull the last 2 Spirocs without getting the SL to agro. When we pull all three, everyone went after the Spiroc Lord. Sirran the Lunatic appeared and assisted the Guardian, and the two adds we couldnt split. Sirran hits very hard and fast.<br />
 After we wiped however, the Guardian regened and walked home, we eventually split the two adds away from the Lord and began killin the Lord in earnest. After the wipe we had 11 people stay and farm (average level 61) We dropped him several more times, waiting each time 20 minutes for Sirran to De-pop before pulling the SL again. Sirran's appearance gave pause to the raid and dragged the whole thing out. <br />
 Q and I didnt get our Blade in the end, 2 other warriors did, so it wasnt a loss. After some of the 11 in the raid started get tired, we realized we simply didnt have the numbers.<br />
<br />
 GL Q, and hope to see you in the next group goin up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My guild will be going to the Plane of Sky shortly. I'll post our experiences here once we've had a go.<br />
<br />
I did a great deal of prowling around the web to get info on these encounters. Some of the best was right here on The Steel Warrior. Here is the plan I've developed based on those posts. If anybody sees any glaring mistakes, please do speak up!<br />
<br />
The Mobs:<br />
1) There are three groups of &quot;trash&quot; spirocs on the island that need to be cleared. In each group, there will be a mob called &quot;the Spiroc Vanquisher&quot;. This mob must be killed first. If he is still up while you're killing the other mobs in his group, they will respawn immediately. <br />
<br />
2) There is a mob called &quot;the Spiroc Guardian&quot; that you have to deal with in some way. You can perma-spawn the boss of the island (&quot;the Spiroc Lord&quot;) by keeping the Guardian alive. You would do this if you wanted to farm the warrior epic drop. If we decide to do this, one method is to pull the Guardian aside and keep him more or less perma-mezzed. <br />
<br />
3) The boss of the island is &quot;the Spiroc Lord&quot;. He is the mob who drops the Spiroc Wingblade for the warrior epic. If he has the drop, you will see the weapon equipped on him. He death-touches every 45 seconds, so he will probably kill at least 2 people every fight. In addition to the death touch, he has an AoE lightning strike for 300 or so. When he dies two things can/will happen: <br />
a) &quot;Sirran the Lunatic&quot; will spawn over the Lord's corpse. This NPC will instantly join into any fight that is underway, and since he hits for 2k, this is a bad thing. No other fights should be going on when the Lord dies. <br />
b) if the Guardian is alive, a new instance of the Spiroc Lord will pop at the original spawn point. <br />
<br />
The Plan:<br />
So, if we intend to spawn the Spiroc Lord more than once, here is what the various gurus recommend: <br />
1) Clear the &quot;trash&quot; groups making sure you kill each group's vanquisher first. <br />
2) Split the guardian away from any mobs around him and park him with a mez. Assign an enchanter to be his little friend, re-mezzing him as necessary. <br />
3) Pull the Spiroc Lord off his spawn point and kill him as fast as you can. Rez people back into the fight as quickly as possible. <br />
4) When he dies, loot quickly and silently and move as far away from Sirran the Lunatic as you can. <br />
5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have all the drops you need/want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Is this blade MQ'able??? I have herd it was and then i herd it was not. Anybody know for shure? My guild is busy in SSRA and working our way to Emp&gt;VT. I know I have better wepons. But I will never be as good or have that feeling of acomplishment(SP) This is the only quest I have started and got this far. I would like to finish this. All i need is that stupid blade and im finished. grrr I have needed this blade since i was lvl 55. Now as you can see im 65 with 86AA's. So I know it wont ever get this probably but it would be great to be able to finish this. Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It should still be MQ'able, Conanix. <br />
<br />
You would have your friend give the wingblade to the NPC, and then you give the Note, and Bingo --&gt; you get the Red Scabbard.<br />
<br />
At least, that's what Korby's walk-through says. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">All I can say I tried doing SKy with 1 group of lvl 60+ pl is np at till you get to first DT mob :) Think we whiped on the KoS - horsey boss geting him to like 20%. I was there helping my bro with pally epic at the time. <br />
<br />
So I'd say you need at least 3 groups because people will ditch you before you get to spiroc island and for DTing pos mobs you still need around 2 groups. I hate PoSky. One of the most horid zones ever. I mean having things spawn at certain timer sucks. Like KoS spawns 90min after death of first reg mob on island. With just my group there we cleared island in like 20 min and then an hour of picking nose. Bleh. DT is one of the worst abilities this game has ever know(at least on mobs you are suppose to fight) and PoS is full of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">2 things:<br />
<br />
1. isle 4: if you have people with keys kill 1 mob on thisn island first before back keying...the boss spawns 80 mins after the fist mob dies (^&amp;*&amp; stupid design)<br />
<br />
2. You dont need to kill all the mobs to get the next island to spawn...a common myth.<br />
<br />
3. isle 5: Spiroc is straight forward.  Just dont kill the guardian.  Just go up invis<br />
<br />
4. There are horrible z axis issues in Sky...if Sirran gets stuck a billion miles in the air you can agro him to get him in a more reasonable position.<br />
<br />
bah that was 4 things</div></div><hr />
