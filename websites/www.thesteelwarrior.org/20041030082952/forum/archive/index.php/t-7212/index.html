2 blood metal earing of engagement + amulet of mummy wrapping will last you till 50s for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For a warrior just starting out, that would actually be the worst combo you could get, as they are not only recommended level 60, but the bloodmetal earring is required 46.</div></div><hr />

You could always go with cougar claws.  They only cost a few hundred plat and have decent stats.  There may be something better thats more recent, but almost everything from luclin + has a rec level on it now that will penalize you for putting it on a twink.  Other than that i really cant think of anything else decent and cheap for a twink, then again im kindof old school and havent leveled a char since velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Uh, the rest of your gear is so good that I am quite certain that you could level to 46 with those slots empty and no one would know.<br />
Mithral torque for the neck?<br />
Player-made earrings for ears?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Griffon fang earrings are pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NhuakofBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Neck   get a  Velium Black Sapphire necklace  65 hp  65 mana 65 Endurance no  ac  but  still a  nice item.   For ears I would do Orc Fang, cougar claw, Vah shir claw, or Griffon Eye earrings .</div></div><hr />

Wolf Fang and Sonic Wolf Claw earrings are also decent and cheap. I used a Spider Fur Gorget for quite a while. Any of the racial crafted collars are fairly nice too.</div></div><hr />

iron cog earring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Souldier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thx for all the suggestions, I ended up going with a couple Cougar Claws for now and a FH Collar to complete my set.  Figure those will hold me until I get high enough to use something more suited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tynaeya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">have to second the wolf fang earrings. I wore those until I was 55 (heh)</div></div><hr />
