<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Avatar of Uselessness shouts &quot;Taiil!&quot;<br />
You have been hit for 32000 points of non-melee damage.<br />
You have been slain by The Avatar of Uselessness!<br />
The Avatar of Uselessness says &quot;Let that be a lesson to you. You were a fool mortal to think that one as unbalanced and unimproved as you could defeat me. Tho I weep for you warrior I must go, for there will be a hybrid tank here soon and I fear for my life.&quot;<br />
Loading... Please Wait...<br />
<br />
Long story short, Taiil my 60 Halfling warrior is officially retired. I no longer have the will, patience, whatever to keep playing him in a game that no longer needs him. My guild has far more well equiped warriors than he. My rogue gets groups easier than he. And my rogue prefers a hybrid tank in XP groups. I know its a shitty thing to say but as things are in the game right now, having a warrior tank is more frustrating than anything.<br />
<br />
I will still be around because I love this board, the community, and the mods here but I will be playing my rogue exclusivly until somthing is done.</div></div><hr />
