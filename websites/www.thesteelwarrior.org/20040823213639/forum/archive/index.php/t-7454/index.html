<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Find out my guild is basically a shell, with my friends having gone to various uber guild and that some old frineds from the guild before (Unleashe) are back in game. <br />
<br />
Group up a bit and then was told about Flag Raids...Povar's reletively (as I understand) new open flagging/raiding association. While I am doing a pick up LDoN normal (with a SK who was originally lower level guildie of mine, now uberfied with 7500 HP and 1600 AC) they call an AD raid in PoV. Well finish the LDoN...getting a AA in the process. <br />
<br />
Then surry off to the raid, which as you might think, takes hours. But we are succesful. Get a flag, free upgrade to my Figureine, and a second AA. So by the end of the day I have found a way into the EPs, tooled around GoD a wee little bit, got about 30 HP in upgrades and gotten ID 2. Only 7 more levels of ID/LR to go (at ID2/LR1).</div></div><hr />
