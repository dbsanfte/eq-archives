For one thing, I did not fucking know that there's a water fall in EK. The fact I've spent a good bit of time in EK and never knew that bothers me. Now I've gotta go find it. Thanks, Shikarii, that just cost me an hour of play time.<br />
<br />
Guildmate01: Whatcha doin in EK?<br />
Me: Looking for a waterfall.<br />
Guildmate01: Uh, okay. Why?<br />
Me: 4 Uber l3wts d00d.<br />
Guildmate01: Ah. Mobs been hitting you in the head a lot lately?<br />

Yeah, i'm a sentimental fool and spent a lot of time talking to friends in those zones..and after those friends left EQ ( and when i left bertoxx server to go to terris ) i would still go there and just stare at the sky or the water.</div></div><hr />

I logged out in the arena, the pit of doom, in front of the SteelWarrior trainers.  It was actually harder than I expected and it chocked me up a little.  Hell of a thing to admit, but true.  He'll be there, waiting for me, if I ever decide that SoE has gotten it's act together and it's worth coming back.  But I don't have much hope in that regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D<br />
<br />
I have this feeling that I'm in PoK ... I didn't so much *log out for the last time*, as I did have a week or two of the house dr00d asking *Are you logging in?* and me saying *Do I have to?* and re-playing the Thief games, until I plunked down a few bucks to see if CoH would be worth spending a few weeks in.<br />
<br />
Prolly PoK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I most likely will log out in ToV. Where Shirion,Shirion, and Shiriana can all log out at the same time together. Either that or in lake rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Okay, found the waterfall in EK. Luckily I'd not looked at Shikarii's directions before I poked around; was fun finding it, mostly because I'd been there before a couple of times. Somehow I'd just never looked up to see the thing, which is huge, lol.<br />
I'd been there before when I walked across Antonica. My fishing pole broke and I thought maybe they'd sell one at the Barb Fishing village. They don't, though I believe there's another place in the zone where poles are sold.<br />
The last time I was there was before LDoN and before the melee changes. I was trying to decide whether to keep playing my warrior. Level 30 druids could farm stuff that wiped me out (only slight hyperbole there), gear was expensive and hard to get, groups were hard to get except with friends and I'd begun to think that they'd be better off if they didn't have to invite a warrior out of pity. I picked a warrior because I like to group and because I figured there would be lots of times when a warrior would make or break a group. And that wasn't how things were working out.<br />
Yet there's nothing like tanking.<br />
So I swam from the Barb village in EK to the Barb village in WK while I thought it over. Decided to keep playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hmm, a few ideas.<br />
1) next to Tunare in PoGrowth<br />
2) That little druid circle in Ocean of Tears<br />
3) Twilight Sea, in the hidden area by the river.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">someone told me once that if you *care* where you log out for the last time, then you aren't really  --  you'll be back. <br />
<br />
It'll be nothing short of a miracle of me ever playing EQ again. Hell; it'll be a miracle for me to play anything by SoE ever again.</div></div><hr />

I spent so much time there it isn't even funny. Lvl 25 thru 34 I believe. Yes, old Cazic or Crazic as some us used to call it. I will probably take a group in and clear to the Tae area where I spent most my time and would like to yell one last time &quot; Tae, get your monkey!&quot;.<br />

<br />
if i wanted to be evil and sell account i would camp infront of BoT Tower Boss/Agnarr or perhaps Avatar of War :) even better i would camp in some GoD zone lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I still play but I've given the matter some thought also.  Sleepers Tomb would be a nice choice but Tigole used it once already and frankly, I'm no Tigole.  Home?  Well, Qeynos was where I started but as a Half Elf I don't really call it &quot;home&quot;.  I would have liked to use the throne in the old Plane of Hate but that's long gone.  Ditto old PoM.<br />
<br />
I'll probably end up in Blackburrow or in Dragon Necropolis or something.  One thing I'm fairly sure about though, it won't be in Tacvi.</div></div><hr />

More original than Shikarii!<br />
<br />
Or should I say<br />
<br />
Shikari?<br />
<br />
http://www.the-chosen.com/unknown/shikari.jpg<br />
<br />
 The Shikari is a pure predator, extremely intelligent, with excellent senses, tracking abilities. They are also extremely fast and agile. Shikari prefer to hunt in packs, so they have rarely been seen alone. If a lone Shikari is encountered approach with extreme caution, as they are known to use a variety of tactics including luring and ambushing targets. Another ability they exhibit is an extremely acute sense of threat assessment. They will often hold off from attacking more powerful creatures until the creature shows weakness, like a pack of wolves out-pacing a victim. If being pursued by a Shikari it is important to remember that they are extremely adept at navigating environments. Their hooked limbs give them the ability to walk on walls or ceilings, and they are just as fast and effective in water as out. The Shikari attacks using its long, razor-sharp claws, but it is thought to have other means of attack.</div></div><hr />
