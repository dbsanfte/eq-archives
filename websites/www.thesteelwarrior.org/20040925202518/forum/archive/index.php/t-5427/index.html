Loralciriclight.com/links Is a good place for a lot of questions you may have at that level.. check it out<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for your help Rough im trying the quests you mentioned not exactly sure what to do with link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That link is just a compilation of a bunch of other links that lead to... more links. But it really helps when you want a question answered about a quest or item or zone but you really dont need to make a new thread about it etc.<br />
<br />
Allakhazams is a great place for some quest info as long as you have popup blockers.. they get kindof annoying :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roorni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hello,  I am kinda new to eq and am wondering about the Twilight armor.  I am lvl 52 with very little cash to spend.  Would this be a good set of armor for me, or should I just stick with what I have until I can try for the Skyshire or Kael armor?<br />
<br />
Any help or advice would be appreciated.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gabriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Roorni<br />

  The best place to get that question answered is in The Bunker.  People use this area for questions about Quests.  That being said, at 52 your gear is a little lacking.  I would start to hunt Kael and do the Thurg quests.  Or even hit the planes and get gear there if you can't farm cash.  A couple good groups of friends around your lvl can do the bank area and if you get a few higher lvls, the arena would be great exps and hopefully some plate drops.  Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roorni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks, I wasn't sure if this was the right spot or not.  But since Twilight armor is quested thought I would try it here.  Will go to teh bunker next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Honestly at those levels the best stuff is semi-quested via LDoN adventures good middleground armor as well as high end armor can be had.  Not only will you be getting your armor you'll be getting exp along the way.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I wasn't sure if this was the right spot or not.  But since Twilight armor is quested thought I would try it here.  Will go to teh bunker next time.  This is the right place to ask about the Twilight armor, but IMO it's targeted at the 30-40 crowd. Unless there is some specific piece you'd like to get, it's probably not worth your effort as there are a lot of pieces to collect and, in my experience, the time/risk/reward just isn't there. <br />
<br />

I think the original idea for the Twilight Armor was to accomplish a couple of goals:<br />
<br />
1) get mid levels up to Luclin for Phat Lewt - the stuff is arguably  better than Sol Ro for the classes that get them, leading to <br />
<br />
2) give &gt;&gt;all&lt;&lt; the classes at the Sol Ro Armor levels (30-40) some armor quests (monks and druids didn't get Sol Ro armor at all, and even the Rogue armor of the line was dropped not quested.) Oh, and have armor for all slots - Sol Ro is mostly visible pieces and a weapon or two.<br />
<br />
3) get mid levels working together - the drops are all over the place and most servers started a &quot;Looking for Twilight Armor...&quot; forum on their server boards. <br />
<br />
Bottom line tho, it's a couple of expansions later, better is LDoN era available from player smiths or AP purchase (4 sets from Adventure merchants - top end rivalling Elemental I believe) and no one really does them so you'll literally spend weeks getting the drops. <br />
<br />
Unless you're a total quest junkie, and have friends who you like to group with in odd zones of Luclin no one goes to (well, mostly) and want to fight never ending greens - have at the Twilight Armor. Great idea, good (but not great) at the time but showing it's age lately. <br />
<br />
I'd go for Thurg/Kunark armor if your guild is going that route, and work towards Skyshrine.  If your more of a loner like me, might be best to keep on those LDoN's and get some points. <br />
<br />
And definitely ask in the Gear forums, wiser heads than mine frequent there - Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you can start the Loyalist's Shield of Honor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21640)  quest.  You will need to get your pottery skill up too, and prolly wont be able to do the fighting part til your late 40s and early 50s unless you have some friends around that level.</div></div><hr />
