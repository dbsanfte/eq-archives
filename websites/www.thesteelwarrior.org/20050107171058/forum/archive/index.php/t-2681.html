<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as I’ve stated before on other posts I am in a very very small  guild, in fact we are composed of the following:<br />
<br />
65 Cleric (Has Radiance/HP increasing AA and Crit Heals<br />
62 Mage<br />
62 Enchanter<br />
60 Necromancer<br />
60 Shadow Knight<br />
58 Paladin<br />
56 Warrior (Me)<br />
<br />
<br />
In about 4 weeks time we are going to try to take on Talendor simply because we want to try and see what happens.  By that time I am hoping we will be higher level and or have more AA’s.  I have done very little research (just used alakazams) on Talendor and figured that I have a strategy but would like to run it by some of you fine tanks that have already dealt with this.<br />
<br />
First I found that Talendor has the following skills:<br />
<br />
AoE Fear<br />
AoE DD/DoT  DD being for 500 and 100 points per tick for dot.<br />
<br />
My plan to deal with fear is Bark Potions and Resist Gear.<br />
My plan to deal with DD/DoT was RC but RC has 3 min recast so not sure about this one.<br />
<br />
I know that he has 32kish hp’s which in my mind would make it a long fight but not that bad.<br />
<br />
In my mind it would go something like this.  Talendor is pulled via arrows by me or whoever is going to tank ( I say me cause I plan to be 60 by then) when I get him in a good enuff spot I’ll do the following, bark potion, /defensive, have a tash stick equipped and either a copper hammer or bloodsworn for more agro, pray tash procs, have enchanter slow after deagro spelling himself, fight till its death.  <br />
<br />
Problems with this approach?  I’ll be doted by then so how do I get rid of that dot aside from anull magic or some dispel?  I know RC can be used but I think Talendor casts that AoE DD/DoT more than once every 3 mins.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I am taking as many suggestions as possible on this so I can refine it for my people before we head in there…. Would like it to be a real attempt instead of suicide.  Trying to work hard to have AoE Taunt by then to perhaps do some sort of tank switching if we needed to.  Any help would be appreciated including correcting me on somethings I might have wrong or don’t really understand about the encounter/spells/ etc…</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiras</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His AEs are:<br />
Immolating Breath (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=843&amp;source=Live)<br />
Dragon Roar (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=981&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Neither of them have a resist adjustment.  Get your FR and MR up around 300 and you should resist the fear and the fire AE most if not all times.  That would be a big help.  Bring a bard friend or something with Psalm of Veeshan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tally should be unslowable.  Think all Kunark Dragons are pretty damned MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming that both you and the pally are 60+ by the time you do this, I would really not worry about the AE Fear. Get a Guard of Druzzil before the fight and you should resist all of them.<br />
<br />
As for the DoT, 100hp/tick is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Make sure you get regen and spiritual dominion. With those 2 buffs, not including natural and worn regen, the DoT is only doing 76hp/tick. Make sure the SK casts Zevfeer's bite and that number is reduced further to 56 hp/tick. Even the wussy casters should have over 3500hp with buffs (make sure to get good buffs in PoK before you go). So if the fight lasts 3 minutes you are only talking 1680 damage if you don't resist it.<br />
<br />
The rest of the fight is cake. He doesn't even hit as hard as a lot of PoP exp mobs, I seem to remember him hitting in the 600-700 range. I think you will be surprised at how easy this fight really is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also, you might wanna consider getting a druid to PoS ya'll before you try...<br />
<br />
only things i can reccoment doing is having a tracker pull, or at least and inviser<br />
<br />
best spot i've killed him at is a bit north of the OT zone along the wall...<br />
<br />
it'll be tough, but with the paly group healing, you might be able to do it...if your cleric donest run OOM first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim AB</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to recall that Talendor dispell one buff per AE Fear, so use a instant clickers and crap buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't mess with bark potions, just get your MR up and get as many levels as you can.  Nothing makes a bigger difference on dragon fear than levels.  <br />
<br />
And be sure to dispell after he's dead hehe, although it is pretty funny to watch your whole raid fall over dead after you kill the dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took down Talen about 2 weeks ago with this force<br />
<br />
65 ranger - hunter<br />
65 sk<br />
65 chanter<br />
63 BL<br />
65 Bard<br />
60 cleric<br />
<br />
Now the force was pretty good but how we killed it was amazing.<br />
<br />
Keeping the story short skipping allot of leading up details.<br />
<br />
Cleric was 25m when Talen ended up in camp.<br />
<br />
Cleric only got one CH off the entire fight, no other heals were cast by anyone during fight.<br />
<br />
Sk, BL, Cleric died<br />
<br />
<br />
Talen dead.<br />
<br />
Dropped 3 orbs, 2 hunter spells for druid, Aegis, red scale, and a bracelet.<br />
<br />
<br />
This mob really is a joke if you got people who remotely know what they are doing with half decent ressit gear.<br />
<br />
That is why it is always dead within 1 hour of spawning.</div></div><hr />

My magelo is on my sig and to the left also if it helps... thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I trioed Talendor with a cleric and a bard back when I had about 4.5k hp unbuffed.  Bard was probably the key: helped a ton with resists, only got feared briefly two or three times during the fight (which was rather long).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ragefire is *far* easier than Talendor.  Ragefire can't hit the broad side of a barn.  I had far worse equipment and AA the last time I did him, and I did not need a heal, and we had 8 people and only partial buffs.  Ragefire like Faydedar is a cinch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunrack, you will walk all over Ragefire Backwards and forwards with that clan.<br />
<br />
We killed Fay the other day with a family guild 7 people no cleric. No one got below 50% health, shaman healing the whole way.<br />
<br />
I think our bard was level 55 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ragefire down.. .must say.. barely touched me.. not a single spell landed.. well maybe one of the nukes it does but besides that.. not feared once..</div></div><hr />
