<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aesus Iceheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I have recently become interested in playing an Iksar warrior<br />
<br />
Thing is.. Ive never really played any form of tank, even paladin, ranger, or shadow knight. So I really dont know what items to twink my warrior out with. I want to get some really uber stuff for what PP I have.<br />
<br />
I have about 23k PP on hand, a fungi tunic, a spiked seahorse hide belt (36% haste im told), bracelet of strength/fortitude, grey flesh sleeves, water logged breeches, blood earring of rage, entwood mace, tranquil staff, coldain skin gloves, shiney pantaloons, ring of dark intellect, Shissar scale headband, 2x Valorium rings, ribbon choker, Phase spider carapace, stave of shielding, 3x leatherfoot harver sacks, Obulus death shroud, bone spur mantle, cloak of greater pernicity, Idol of the wavecrasher, Firestorm stone, and some other stuff i forget...<br />
<br />
Im just rejoining EQ after a break so im just listing equipment i have on previous characters i can sell/trade to make profits to twink my warrior. My best character is a 65 beastlord for camping things.  Any advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, as a fellow iksar warrior, I can tell you that we have some issues in regards to armour. I'm currently wearing Steel Wrapped armour which have decent ac and stats, but the recommended level is 45 - 50, so it won't be of value to you. My best advice is to save the money on armour for now and put togeather a &quot;scrap&quot; armour and grind xp until 35 - 40 (you wont notice much difference anyway before this). While you level, stop by the bazaar now and then and get a feeling of what's up for sale. Good mid range armour would be Steel Wrapped, Barbed Ringmail, Crystal Chitin armour (no recommended level), etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, the good news is, you already have the best 2 twink items for any melee class: Fungi and good haste. Some of the armor you have already will do fine on a twink warrior, like the bracers and the arms, which have good ac/hp and dont have a recommended/required level. <br />
<br />
Basically; put everything you listed on to your warrior. Equip everything you can, that gives you full stats at level 1. To me, it looks like you should keep the Fungi, the haste belt, both bracers, grey flesh sleeves, coldain skin gloves, shissar scale headband, and the cloak of greater pernicity. Even though you could wear the Ob death shroud, they are worth alot because of the mana pres 3, so you can sell it and buy something else that will serve you better. Also, the fungi will serve you much better than the PSC at lower levels, so you could either sell or bank the psc for now.<br />
<br />
Everything else that you listed is either unwearable by an iks war, or has a rec level of 40+, so sell it if you want, or keep them for another char.<br />
<br />
Now, once you hit the bazaar, you'll be looking slot by slot with the bazaar window, looking for ears, neck, face, shoulders, legs, feet, range, and weapons. Just check each slot, and look for items that have high AC and/or raw HP for the most benefit. With the kind of gear/budget you have, I'd say you could get your warrior up near 500hp at level one. Some good pieces of armor to look for are Black Sapphire Electrum ears, clattering bone necklace, grimling contraption or crystal spider eyes, tattered mantle or better, and goranga idol. I'm not quite sure what legs/boots would be good, because of the iksar not being able to wear plate.<br />
<br />
As for weapons, any 1hb, 1hs, or piercer that has a dmg/dly ratio of 1:2 or better should be good. Guard captain's mallet, frostbringer, wavecrasher, etc are all good twink weapons. <br />
<br />
All in all, even if you don't sell your extra items, you should have a twink that doesn't need new gear (except for a good 2hs/2hb/2hp once you get 20+) until your 40's. Once you reach 40+, there's tons and tons of new items to look for, because you will be high enough that the rec. level on many items will give you almost full stats for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can also ignore the recomended lvl on wepons for damage. it only affect the stats ac hp mana resist the 1 in red on weapon damage means nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Really? Doesnt recommended lvl affect weapon damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">with what you ahve you can make a really good warrior, like stated before the important items for just about any melee is the fungi and the haste. aside from that, just work on sta str and dex items. at lower lvls you'll want str to carry all your stuff and dex to make those offensive skills go up faster. you can just scrap together stuff you have floating around in your bank and that should be fine until lvl 30. after around 40 you'll want to start getting more specific gear, stuff with hp sta and AC. being an iksar warrior i can say that this is where it gets tough with the restrictions, but i doubt you'll have much trouble with all the good gear out now. <br />
holding agro wont really be a big concern until about lvl 50+, until then you can just get some good dps weapons, or at least some fast weapons or if you want to get it out of the way you can try a frostbringer or wave crasher. those should be pretty cheap, but if you can get the cash, i recomend a swiftblade of zek, guard capt. mallet and the horn of hasgra. all are fast as well as have over 10damage and dont have min lvl requirements.</div></div><hr />
