<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering how much AC/HP I would need to tank each boss mob up to ele planes access.  Obviously more is better...but can a tank really take care of say RZtWL for the first time in Tak plate unauged?  I'm really interested in what's a reasonable amount; how much is enough to have a shot at killing the mob successfully?  Some rough estimates or HP/AC from tanks that have completed these encounters would be most appreciated.  I really want to know how much tanks have had the FIRST time they were successful and how much more AC/HP you attained till these encounters became more comfortable and eventually trivial.  Note I have completed all my defense AA.<br />
<br />
If you esteemed experts could provide estimates on the following:<br />
<br />
Agnarr/Bert/LMM/Saryn/SolRo/Zeks<br />
<br />
and even some higher end Luclin stuff like AHR/Emp/Seru/Cursed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say its far more important who's supporting you in those fights....<br />
<br />
I.e how many healers, DI or not, spellshields, CH rot interval, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Without knowing that, the ac and hp of the 'tank' that did the encounter means not much......<br />
<br />
A tank could take care of RZtWL clad in cloth armour painted with 'Hit me Here' signs all over it, *if* there was a battalion clerics blasting away at him )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd shoot for over 6000-7000 unbuffed hitpoints for those targets.  <br />
<br />
When i started working on those targets I was at 6800 hitpoints and augments were not available.  With augments and a bit of dedication I would think a warrior could break 7k unbuffed without steping foot in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it's important for everyone on a raid to know what's going on and have those particulars worked out, what my stats/gear are for that encounter is my responsiblity to those who are behind me.  It's my job to know what to have so I don't let down all that support.  It's what I have most control over.<br />
<br />
Check out my magelo.<br />
<br />
The thing I'm most concerned over is AC...I'm very deficient there and really can't find any quick solutions there--the type 2 hp's don't work with type AC augs that all seem to be type 2 in vendors or only work in certain slots(everything but legs for example).  HP is generally easy to upgrade right now ldon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It also depends on your def aas...max them and everything goes farther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">id agree that anything in the 6-7k range should see you ok, although you may want a bit more on the AC side that 1200 imo.  ive tanked blazzax and some of the other ele raid mobs with about 6500 unbuffed without any real problems (although most of the credit must be given to my guilds damn fine clerics).<br />
<br />
do see if you can put some work on your CHA though and get a bard to CHA song when ur MTing, that will go a long way to saving your ass.<br />
<br />
dont forget Bulwark of vie too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I&quot;d be shooting for 6500 hp and 1450 ac if at all possible for rztw.  I tanked him start to finish with 6650/1550, max defensive/offensive aa. Fight lasted about 4:20 as I recall.<br />
<br />
There are several factors in rztw fight though; raid dps, ch chain and crowd control being the major ones.  The better your raid is at those, the less hp/ac you can get by with, if your raid stumbles on those you're gonna wish you had a lot more ac/hp :)<br />
<br />
I'd say you should be able to handle Saryn and the Zeks without too much problem now.. Bertoxx, Agnarr and LMM are gonna be tougher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the bare minimum you'd want is<br />
5500+HP/1100AC<br />
but as been stated pop fights are not all about MA's stats and Verant has my thanks for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8.4k hp and 1400 AC full buffed works fine for me.  I have been MT on many of those mobs and I was tanking them easy with a good chain and people that know what they are doing.  I even tank dual wielding fast weapons!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree with Ygnir, we started on this path to ele plans 3 months ago and only have RZ left to do.  When we started I was 5200hp &amp; 1300ac,  I was not the MT but was SA and Cleanup more then I  can count.   I cant say that I remember one fight where my hp and ac was what cost the raid,  every failure was the result of a mistake.   Two weeks ago on Agnarr the MT went down so  I get the ball, tanked him for 6-7 mins till I moved him to close to the clerics, some died so  I died.<br />
<br />
There is NO doubt that more AC and HP help but in my exp when things go wrong its so very worng that no matter what ac and hp you have your still dead.<br />
<br />
The hard part of all the fights was knowing what to do for everyone in the raid, once you know that its clockwork.  The number ONE thing to wining is TEAM WORK above all else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a good 8k buffed and around 1400ac is the norm for the typical pre elemental raid tank. a guild MT at that lvl would probably be just under 9k and around 1500-1600ac. the AA are important also, they should shave off about 30% of the incoming damage and greatly reduce the risk of spike damage. <br />
<br />
breaking it down by mob, the typical guild at that lvl of progression would need about 4 warrior for the agnarr script, most of them can be around 7-8k fully buffed, but you'll need at least 1 tank with well over 8k for emmerick due to his 3k AE nuke and agnarr that hits for 1400s. more importantly is having 4 wizards with the disintagrate spell.<br />
2 warriors for TT with a min of 7k, or 1 warrior with close to 9k. <br />
tallon is just a DPS zerg fight, so tanks arent really that important since you cant really hold his attention for very long. <br />
vallon anyone can tank, its more of having 5 healers and 5 slowers, or using some very cleaver kiting tricks.<br />
saryrn a ranger could tank, getting to her is harder/longer than actually killing her. <br />
LMM you'll need a really good tank with close to all the defensives. i'd say 2 or 3 warriors with well over 8k to be safe, but he'll rarely get past a 9k warrior with all the AAs. LMM by him self is rather easy if you've done AoW enough, the timing on the adds and controling them makes it tough.<br />
the bert event will need about 3-5 warriors with over 8k to keep up with the 12 kings, mostly for a defensive/evasive chain. 12 kings in 2 hours (120 mins) mean you need a defensive warrior every 10 mins, and since reality doesnt work out that evenly, you could end up with 2 kings back to back. at least one of those warrior should have close to 9k, bert can almost hit for 2k. <br />
most of the actual gods are endurance fights, as opposed to AD RD and behemoth where the those mobs do so much damage you need to burn them down ASAP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ThrokRock, looking at your magelo, you have nothing to fear as far as tanking all boss mobs up to the elementals.  Your guild's success is really in the hands of your healing squad at this point.  They will find it challenging to keep any tank alive through a whole Mith Marr fight for example, whether it's you or a 12k tank.  But once they can do it, then you will coast into the elementals.  The POP progression is more about evolving healing tactics and execution than about tank gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 warrior for the agnarr script <br />
<br />
2 warriors is fine, the adds are waaaaaaay easy and don't pop all at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Sassinak -  looking at your magelo I don't think you'll have any trouble tanking any pre-elemental bosses.  Your HP and AC, combined with all defensive AAs should be enough to get you through the first encounters.  RZtW will take a little more I would think, but you'll most likely pick up an upgrade or two before you get to him.<br />
<br />
This is a bit off topic, but I would be concerned about aggro.  Is the unaugged CHSD and shield holding solid aggro for you?  <br />
<br />
One big difference with the mobs you have listed and mobs that come before them is that keeping aggro solid is very important.  And you'll have to get early/fast heals, so you won't have a lot of solo time to get a head start - and with these mobs that can and do one-round your healers (or dps types) losing aggro even for just a couple rounds can potentially be raid breaking, especially in the opening rounds of the fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You already have plenty of HP to tank anything up to the elems. I would recommend working on your AC, but buffed you should have sufficient AC for the task. Don't be afraid to weild your GBoS+CHSD to insure you get good agro. Slap some A3 augs on both and you should be golden. Your success will hinge on your ability to keep agro and the rest of your guilds ability to handle the healing/CC chores.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenelan</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1350-1400AC and 5500ish HPs unbuffed...with all defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
I know that works...because I've tanked all those with around the above stats :)<br />
<br />
Then again...no VT raids to really get better AC/HP than I have *shrugs*<br />
<br />
Most deaths on any of those mobs come from a problem outside of being hit hard in any given round (except Bertox who seems to like max hitting me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Payn, I think he's more concerned about having tanks for the spawns in the lower parts of the Agnarr script: The ones that are pre-spawned on top of the portals where you fight Emmerik and the lava guy. However, these adds aren't so formidable as to need extra-beefy warrior tanks, anything with plate will do, even a bard. Well, maybe not a bard, but a cleric could probably tank one with a bard slow. You should have enough slowers to hit every mob simultaneously, as long as you aren't horrified about someone tanking with Sha's or Consonant Chain or whatever the bards are using these days over Turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use my chsd and GBoS...the shield is to doctor up the magelo--chances are we may get XTC and/or Cursed to drop the goods long before we take these tier 2 guys on...but it's coming.  I'm thinking we may be Sol Ro flagged before we ever get to VT...and am wondering what kind of options I'll have there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;&lt; 2 warriors is fine, the adds are waaaaaaay easy and don't pop all at once. &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
well, the way i see it, 2 tanks on agnarr, and another 2 alternating defensive/evasive for the adds every 25%. for a guild that was learning the encounter, i doubt 2 warriors would be safe. emmerick and that firestorm guy only really need 1 warrior and alot of croud control.</div></div><hr />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10440  - belt or dain belt.<br />
<br />
legs drop from rizlona real common in solro, also from BoT but not so common.<br />
<br />
ring of destruction from aow.<br />
<br />
neck from arch liche<br />
<br />
there is a good mask from eashen too, dunno if you can get ppl to go back to ntov though.<br />
<br />
i dont think our tanks had too much from VT before doing RZ, saved all our points for elementals = p<br />
<br />
other than the ring off jiva and those legs, not much in solro for you. decent 2her i suppose off dresolik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks 1ludor.  That helps alot.<br />
<br />
In response to auging the Chsd/GBoS I really don't want to put points into them.  I'd like to aug those with utility procs like guard ...switching out from an EB after i get aggro.  I guess I'm holding out to aug better stuff.  I have almost 4k AP and really want to save it for ele stuff or EB weps when I get them/there.  Alot of my guildies think I'm nuts.  Or still having that nasty 40hp belt instead of a Heavy Rubicite(the thing is 40k in the baz...the flood of ebay plat/sploits is down right sickening on E'ci).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i doubt CT is worth much xp anymore, i got mine before the new 65 lvl limit.  that being said, you can camp the ft3 boots and belt in ct at the same time. the PH spawns in the last ooze pit before the avatar of fear ring. anyway, u could kill the pit hes in with just a cleric or shaman im sure if you couldnt get a group down there.<br />
<br />
dain use to be perma killed on most servers and now is easy farm mob for twinks unfortuately since most EP guilds can kill him with 1 or 2 groups. i would think most guilds could get him with 3 or 4 groups though, other than his belt though, not worth doing, but if nothing else is up to do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny how things go.  Tonight I had a warrior tanking in BoT, at level 56.<br />
<br />
I'll be the first to admit he was not the best tank I've ever had but he was up to the task at hand and was at least honest about it.  Sure, twinked up pretty hard but I was still a little shocked that he could tank even a mid-end mob like a Kriger without folding like a wet blanket.</div></div><hr />
