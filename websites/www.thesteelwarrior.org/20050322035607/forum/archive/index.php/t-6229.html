Read it, you'll thank me.<br />

Edit, found real link to graffes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 This seems self-evident, but there were a lot of DAoC players in the alpha test who couldn't get over that the game is going to feature consensual Player Versus Player combat, and not full-on PVP or have PVP as its endgame. PVP may well factor into it, but there's no indication that the endgame won't be PVE – Player Versus Enemy. <br />
<br />
Didn't they say there was going to be a PvP server?</div></div><hr />

I don't want to start another MMORPG, but WoW is really tempting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you don't want to play one yourself, they're hilarious to have around, like technologically savvy killer rabbits. And, in keeping with the way EQ players have portrayed gnomes, to the vague horror of everyone else, they're a lewd bunch with a funky &quot;booty dance&quot; /dance emote that makes some folks crack up and outrages others.</div></div><hr />

If I could still hit penny-arcade from work this would be where I'd post the link to the cartoon they made about attacking a little white bunny in FFXI.</div></div><hr />

I read what was posted and it does seem to be a good game.  I am not going to comment any further until 6/11/04</div></div><hr />

<br />
With PoP planar progression requiring what it requires.<br />
<br />
With LDON's being so freekin boring and repetative.<br />
<br />
EQ will be decimated.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am ok with that.</div></div><hr />
