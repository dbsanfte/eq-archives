We have a couple level 65 tanks who are around 6.5k hp buffed and 1350-1400ish AC, I think just one 65 well equipped cleric and several others in their mid-upper 50's, a couple 65 shamans, a 65 enchanter, and a mix of other various classes level 55-65, average level 58-60.<br />
<br />
We have been farming arena, tried a joint raid with another guild and got Vindi to 20%.  We've been raiding Umbral Plains mobs like Radir, Zelnithak.  We are really casual and don't raid more than a few times per week, so I'd like to see us hit targets that are within our reach rather than wasting an attempt on something too difficult for us.  Better to build up I think.<br />
<br />
I am thinking we could take targets like Vhaksiz in PoN and the gator there, possibly PoS named giants, maybe some CoD targets?  I'm wondering if mobs like Inny in Nadox or the dragon in Veksar are a bit out of our reach.  Any ideas, thoughts, suggestions?<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

ROFL.  I know it's coming...  Search is your friend.  Ok, I was having trouble with the search function  for some reason.  Stupidity perhaps?  I see a post just down from here...  sigh, I'll go check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, I know I've seen recent posts along this lines also so I highly advise doing some searches here  ;) <br />
<br />
My guild is in a similar situation numbers wise, although are average level is about 63 and most people are 65 with at least 50 AA's.  Our 3 tanks range in hp from 7500 to about 8300 fully buffed and I think we all have full mitigation/avoidance AA's.<br />
<br />
Here are some recent targets we've taken down:<br />
PoI Dragon - last night with 18 (took him out on the first try with no deaths...very sweet!)<br />
<br />
Nadox Inny - done him with as few as 14 I think...just gotta have a solid tank that can keep him cornered.  Also, if you have to bring him outside his room, be prepared to deal with him gating - have the MA immediately run back to the raid after he is summoned...he may die, but this prevents adds from his room.  (and be ready for a tank switch if this happens)<br />
<br />
IV in Ahkeva - I forget what IV stands for, but he's a fun one and he drops nice caster upgrades.  You need a couple people with RGC (we only have 1 and it works, but 2 would be nice) and a decent tank, aside from that it's just patience - one time I it lasted long enough for me to go defensive twice  :p .  I think we did him with 12 once, and definitely with 14.  By the way, defensive isn't needed on this guy...he doesn't hit hard at all.  What is needed is good discipline and a patience.  If you get the wrong person on rampage or get impatient with the pulls when clearing the room, things will go very badly very quickly.  Also, before we got our tactics down, we failed twice with 24...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Itraer Vius.  I've killed him 5 or so times now and never seen this DoT that he supposedly has.  Last time my guild killed him they said he now Ramped (this ability was also added to Cazic Thule in Fear, to our surprise).  It is not necessary to cure anything during this fight and if done correctly you should not have to deal with any adds.  He hits like a little girl.  The key to IV is summon.  Have an SK or Pally chain cast aggro spells at him for a while before engaging.  Then when they get knocked back they will just get summoned again.  Easy fight.<br />
<br />
While you are in Akheva, stop by the Va'Dyn and drop him.  He's cake.  He can probably be Duoed by a solid Warrior and Shaman.  Hits in the 800s and flurrys, but fully slowable.  He just has a crap ton of HPs.  He sometimes procs snare or a small DD on you, which means he is wielding one of the weapons he drops.  To pull him, set up in the boxed in corner in the room before his.  Have an SK/Monk aggro him and his guards and run through the room towards IV.  FD, (CoH if mage is there) and Va'Dyn will come back alone ahead of his guards.  His guards are slow.  Then just tag him and he's alone.  He has some crap drops, but he also has quite a few nice drops.</div></div><hr />

We've done him a bunch recently...  <br />
He has a curse dot - but you don't need to worry much about it.  I know it does more damage than my sitting troll regen, but it's not bad and it usually runs to completion by the time the loot distribution is done.  Also, I don't think he casts/procs this very often.<br />
<br />
The reason for RGC is to cure the blindness that he procs. Without RGC expect the MA to be blind almost the entire fight - along with alot of the other raid members.<br />
<br />
Yep, he rampages now.   ;)   We just get a tank on rampage and it's ok.  (although a couple times we've had the rampage target change...we haven't pinned this down yet because people are not (intentionally) moving out of rampage range, but the rampage target has changed without the original RT dying...)<br />
<br />
We don't have any knights in the guild, so we have an enchie build agro with non-damaging spells, then the MA does AET and RT attacks to set both of them...works like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teldarr</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lcea Katta and Nathyn in katta are good, fairly easy fights that would probably be a great test of how much endurance your force has.  About a year ago when my guild first started doing stuff, Nathyn took 20 of us nearly an hour.  With mudflation it should be easier, but still a good challenge.  Katta also has that wonderful charm to deal with.<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest the Va`dyn, as others mentioned.  Would also say Lord Bob in velks.  He is a pushover, but ought to be a fun first.  Velk himself might also be worth trying.<br />
<br />
Also, don't stop trying on Vindi!</div></div><hr />
