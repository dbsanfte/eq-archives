<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherm</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I retired ole Sherm last week cause I was tired of beatin mah head against the wall try'n to figgure  a way of holding agro in a group that was used to Pally/SK tanks. He's 65 with 70 aa . I wonder sometimes if I gave in to soon . Maybe I was just a crappy player, never really had any negative comments tho .But I just got really tired of going from one group where agro was NP to another group agro was next to impossible . I guess I'm askin if any of you folks are gettin close to doing the same thing ,because Sony has no intentions of helping our class .<br />

Wether we've reached our personal limit or are continuing to soldier on I doubt anyone here blames you for 'wimping out'. If it ain't fun no more then it's time to give it a rest. <br />

/salute</div></div><hr />

Except my girlfriend retired with me (she's a paladin). She refused to play a game that would only get me more fustrated. She sent a nasty feedback on top of that too :D</div></div><hr />

I think there are quite a few warriors out there with the same feeling, Sherm -  some of us stop playing, and some make other characters...<br />
<br />
My warrior was the first character I ever *really* got into playing, I must admit I am quite addicted to tanking... but when I suffer nightly humiliation when trying to do the one thing I enjoy most, its just too much, and from the looks of things now, it doesn't seem to be on the up-and-up...<br />
<br />
As for me, I went the cheesiest route I can think of - I broke ranks and made a character that I always use to laugh at - a smarmy Paladin - and a froglok at that =)<br />
<br />
I must say, I enjoy playing him, and currently I think it was worth giving up the 500hp and /defensive for all the perks my lil pally has...<br />

Me?  I have no class balance issues.  I think you are all insane.</div></div><hr />

But from group to group aggro issues are different. It depends on how much the group helps you keep aggro. I have been in groups and watched the enchanter die every pull. Replace him with a shammy and never lose aggro again. It's wierd like that.</div></div><hr />

Yeah my fiance wanted me off that silly game cause it was apparently bothering me to play it.  Would log off pissed and such, or sit there waiting to find something to do.  So I made the next logical move, go on vacation and quit the bloody game.<br />
<br />
/Salute to all the warriors left.  You might be a dying race.</div></div><hr />

Glatius said it best (http://thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=39273&amp;#post39273).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I complain.<br />
<br />
I complain because I see something wrong...something majorly wrong with how things are done.<br />
<br />
I don't play a warrior.  This name I use is from a lvl 10 iksar warrior on my account (who is fairly well equipped, mind you).  I play a beastlord and a cleric.  I do everything possible to help a warrior hold agro...from buffing his dex over 105 points to help with procs, to letting pet fight with him to help slow land without killing the slower (if it isn't me), to pulling with slow and debuff and letting warrior taunt off me.  I even stun mobs (when they aren't immune) on my cleric to help him get agro over a slow, or to keep the mob next to the warrior when slow lands.  I even carry a Greatstaff of Thunder around with me to show them what a good agro weapon is if they're still dual-wielding Lammys or something.<br />
<br />
The fact I don't play a warrior has probably helped keep me playing.  I love the idea of the warrior, the tone of the warrior, but compared to EVERY OTHER FREAKING GAME OUT THERE, EQ warriors are just plain weak.<br />
<br />
Sad to see yet another warrior retire from these problems.  /salute  Like Valeris said, tho...when the game just isn't fun for you, it's time to stop playing.</div></div><hr />
