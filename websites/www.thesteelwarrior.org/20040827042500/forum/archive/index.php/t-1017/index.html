<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am still tired and somewhat miffed after browsing the cleric forums yesterday, but one incident this morning finally made me post this.<br />
<br />
SoE is thinking about removing the flags off level 2 and 3 except tactics, but shouldnt they instead invent level requirements in PoP tier one and make flags for anything further way harder ?<br />
<br />
Point one:<br />
There is a pages long rant in the cleric forum on gameglow how poor clerics are and tanks are supposed to provide peridots for symbols and aego/virtue.<br />
<br />
Point two:<br />
A level 62 warrior in a decent but no hard raiding guild (guild on giant faction and mostly farming wtov but not 100 percent sure as they play on west coast time and i am central europe) bugs me to let him join in CoD for the last percent exp he needs for level 63.<br />
Hmm, level 62 warrior with defenders lightblade in main hand and a lamentation if offhand ?<br />
No title whatsoever- i dont care about the title but with no aa's tanking in tier 2 is rather hard.<br />
After joining me he starts talking about how many problems he has holding agro in PoV/S and how comparably easy it was in BoT (lol i dont even want to think about a group with this kind of tank in BoT) to hold agro and that an agro/exp patch is scheduled for thursday.<br />
<br />
My own warrior was level 60 with 17 AA's at PoP release and the cleric 54 or 55 without any AA.<br />
Although i could have had pushed through trials with my clerics way earlier i waited til 60 cause i knew what to expect when i hit PoV at 61 with 23 AA (i wanted nd3/aetaunt).<br />
I dual boxed him a lot in chardok and seb knowing full well that it wont be PoP exp i would get but making cash enough to upgrade more than one piece of armor and now buying all spells up and including level 65 without having to borrow pp or bugging the guild library (alts in guild have no loot rights).<br />
Actually for a while its been my cleric who was providing cash to upgrade my main in slots where i couldnt expect upgrades from raiding or which were not reachable by single groups.<br />
My cleric is carrying around 8 stacks of peridots when going out to hunt either for duo or groups since level 52 or even earlier, never was broke and never accepted donations for rezzes until recently (cause people seem to expect aego/virtue nowadays after getting rezzed and cleric is not epiced) and never sat in pok selling buffs.<br />
Is it only me or is it only now that people with the fast exp make others responsible for their lack of cash and equipment that comes with the fast exp/low cash from pop? (although i have to add some casters made a killing selling 61-2 spells in the first 2 months after PoP release).<br />
<br />
I never hunted in PoP with my cleric before level 58 because i didnt feel comfortable with the spells available compared to the damage mobs do to pc's.<br />
<br />
Clerics should be the last to complain as groups go where the healers are and not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Just some tired troll ranting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is, and will always be, one major problem with MMORPG's --<br />
<br />
People are idiots.<br />
<br />
That is pretty much it.  Get some of your RL friends playing, and never worry about that issue again.  I 2 boxed with a guy in oregon who was 2 boxing for the last year and a half I played EQ and I never had more fun.  No whiny groups, no stupid people causing problems, it was just good fun, which is what the game is about.<br />
<br />
I prefered to think of EQ as a MMORPG that only me and 5 friends played.  It worked out good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got some of my RL friends playing, they turned out to be bigger idiots than most playing this game, LOL. One has spent more than $2200 on the game from playerauctions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i can tell ya gnomb's problem right off the bat being a former guildmate of his; his guild is all a bunch of nice guys and girls who hunted together lots; did a lot of things together; and always helped each other to build themselves as a unit when we were all grinding the levels/farming the gear/planning the future of the high_end of EQ. When they break from the embryo of Divine Legend and hunt with the masses the idiots seem 10X worse than you read about :D<br />
<br />
I can tell ya that was the reason I left the proddies. Time-restrictions, plus the insane amount of idiots flourishing around ya just made it an experience worth ending. I wished I could have been on my old guild's time frame ( they were GMT ) and seen and hunted with them more; maybe things wouldn't have turned out the way they did. But I can see where Gnomb is coming from with trying to preserve a game he's been accustomed to playing; and just have people capable of being where they are doing what they do; and not just skating for the &quot;free ride&quot; and complaining they they're really not &quot;working right&quot; where they are and expect the others to bend over backwards to accomodate them.<br />
<br />
Even now; my wife plays a shammy; I play a warrior; and we rarely see or group with anyone and the game has really been a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />
