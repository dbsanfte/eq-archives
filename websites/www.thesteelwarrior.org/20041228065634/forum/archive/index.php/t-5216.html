<br />
Weapons: swap out your offhand for a CHoS or SotB, for better aggro (attack rate and proc rate).<br />
<br />
AA?  Levels before AA: the XP comes in so much faster once you can do BoT groups, it's not even funny.  Once you're getting AA, my sincere advice is to take defensive AAs before offensive AAs, and mitigation/avoidance AAs before HP-increasing AAs.<br />
<br />
If you MT raid mobs a lot, however, you're better off getting the HP-increasing AAs first, and the mitigation/avoidance AAs second.  But if you're XP grinding, or doing lots of LDoN, you'll benefit more from mitigation/avoidance than from pure raw hit points.<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

<br />
If you really want to go for AA, try ND3 then Area Taunt as fast as possible (best AA ever), then try to get CA3, CS3, PE.<br />
<br />
After that its up to you. Either you continue the heavy defensive line (if you tank often in raids or want to) or more HP AA first (for AEs and magelo boost :p).<br />
<br />
If you have an earthshaker, you could go for rampage too if you like to farm greenies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arch<br />
Combat Stability3 ( 12 pts )<br />
Combat Agility3 (12 pts )<br />
Natural Durability3 (12 pts )<br />
 <br />
Class<br />
Area Taunt ( 5 pts )<br />
Physical Enhancement ( 5 pts )<br />
<br />
Then plan for POP AAs something like this:<br />
<br />
PoP Advance<br />
Planar Durability ( 9 pts )<br />
Planar Power ( 10 pts )**after all others**<br />
<br />
Pop Ability<br />
Innate Defense5 ( 15 pts )<br />
Lightning Relfexes5 ( 15 pts )<br />
Tactical Mastery3 ( 9 pts )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">level to 65, then work on ND1-3, PE, CA1, CS1, PD3.  Once you've pretty much maxed your hit points, worry about other stuff.<br />
<br />
Gear-wise, totally agree on getting hitpoints in slots that don't have it.  Also, call me crazy, but, uh, shouldn't you have some kind of permanent haste item by now???  To have a full load out of Ornate AND a BoC, you obviously have more cash than you know what to do with, get a damn haste item.<br />
<br />
Ok, not sound really mean, but if you are 60 with a BoC and full Ornate but don't have a permanent haste item, there is something very, very wrong.  At current prices on my server, this would mean that you have spent somewhere over 800k on gear AND YOU DON'T HAVE PERMANENT HASTE???  For that kind of money you should at least have a CoF.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, let me change my previous advice.  Don't level to 65, instead reroll another warrior, twink him out in about 20k worth of gear and level him and this time, learn to play the class!!!!<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't want you to be a 65 warrior because you will only give those of us who actually have worked to learn how to play our class a very bad name.<br />
<br />
-edit- p.s. replace the longsword of freedom with a Splitblade of Destruction.  Trust me, you are obviously destined to be a card-carrying member of SBoD Warriors Club.</div></div><hr />

 You are definately right. sorta... First of all I dont put $$ into game as I stated this is my &quot;first lvl 60 war&quot; Ialso have a lvl 65 wiz with 122 aa's that ive been playing with since beta that is  how ive ben able to get ornate for my war. on the point about the perm. haste I had a RBB that I used to sweeten the deal for the Boc in trade with a few other items ie. a ornate bp mold and a few other items. its not that difficult to get a RBB as it is to farm a Boc.  its funny that you jumped to a conclusion that if one char has such nice gear that they buy plat  I quote &quot;To have a full load out of Ornate AND a BoC, you obviously have more cash than you know what to do with&quot;. aparently YOU DO...<br />
I didnt make this post to get flack on the gear that I chose to wear I just wanted a little help on what I should do with my aa's but thanks for your other input on my current question. Have a nice day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like others have already pointed out, you are doing pretty good on gear. No real hurry, but I would replace cloak (either CoF or LDoN vendor cloak+haste aug), offhand weapon (copper hammer), mask (grimling contraption or amy mask if possible), and neck (lots of 50hp+ necks available) - in that order. Do this while you level to 65. Your gear is plenty good to tank 65 exp mobs.<br />
<br />
As far as AAs -<br />
any 6 general (run3 and regen3 usually)<br />
ND3<br />
CA/CS 1<br />
PE<br />
CA/CS 3<br />
<br />
AE taunt is pretty useful, but not nearly as important as it was before Incite. It is handy for emergencies, but IMO at least the basic defensive arch skills are more important to get first.</div></div><hr />
