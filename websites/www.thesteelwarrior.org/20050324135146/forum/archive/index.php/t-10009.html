<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zar</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I am not on a raid or in exp groups I like to try and make some plat. Any good ideas where I  can play a time geared warrior level 70 400+ aa's and a 65 poorly equiped shammy? I have done the basment in HOH and that is ok, but looking for someplace new.  It is downtime so doing something that is right on the edge is not really what I am looking for, easy single pulls :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help would be great!</div></div><hr />

What is the shaman flagged for? I know you want single pulls, but a time geared warrior could tank two guards in solro very easily with a shaman healing and slowing, just make sure you get aggro so your shammy doesn't get munched.<br />
<br />
You can camp tradeskill stuff anywhere and sell it off in the bazaar. You a baker? Camp the stuff in PoN (forget the name) for the poppers used in Bristlebane's Party Platter.<br />
<br />
Potactics for the gems for bloodmetal earrings.<br />
<br />
PoValor for the stuf for valorium rings.<br />
<br />
GoD, can mess around in natimbi in your spare time and hope for a talisman of the spiritseer drop (FT1 neck)<br />
<br />
WoSlaughter, can probably take out most of the names in south field, barring shadowhunter. Maybe even some in the north.<br />
<br />
Make a Dranik Scar expo and hunt runes.<br />
<br />
Honestly there's so much stuff you could do, I can't remember it all. I do this stuff all the time with my level 70 shaman wife, we've levelled throughout our entire career together and have made quite sufficient funds.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was like an ldon type thing. I have yet to try one so that might explain it.  Thank you so much for some ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol Ro is your best bet.  I use the same combo frequently.  If you battle your way up to Xulz tower its all singles and easy pulls at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need 3 actually, iirc, to start a dranik expo. Once you get it started though, you should be able to maintain it with just 2. Unless they changed that with some recent patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bugbokr</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try kunark dragons it shouldn't be to hard still decent loot on them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zar</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shammy is not flagged for sol ro. :(<br />
<br />
Which dragons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's plat your after and you have gate (thurgadin) try Velks ,if you can box a toon or two down at entrance to hold repeat drops it's really quite fun , does anyone else remeber the camp three times ghetto succor  from Lower dogs ? and SCHW etc still sell well ,i remeber when they were selling at 3k a pop and made 20 k in one night along woth the other drops , velium and gems  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zar</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I tried Velks last night up at the Kobolds. Was very easy, got to the gargoyels easy. Made about 1k plat and another 1k in tribute. It was tents, might try basement or push past gargoyels towards castle?<br />
<br />
Also, what about POG? Could I 2 box there? Not sure if it still has the 2 zonewide agro guys, also not sure if I could single pull mobs. Any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">iirc those guards running around were put back in over a year ago, but they're not that hard.  You shouldn't get any bizzare pulls in PoG unless you don't notice a gigantic tree casting dots/AE silence, but without a rezzing class and the ability to have a &quot;normal&quot; zone out, you might get into trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a brief time they removed the PoGs, but then necromancers started soloing there for great experience and cash, so they were then put back into the game. Having said that, If you were able to initially take them out (which I think you would) you would also need to vigilantly time the respawns (45 minutes I think?) to ensure you aren't fighting a mob when they respawn. That might get icky. Furthremore I believe you commented about wanting something that was relatively stress free? This may not be the way to go.<br />
<br />
You could also pharm Kael Arena, take lots of bags and vender the trash weapons, bazaar the heads and toes. If you get lucky with a BP, they MQ fairly well for the Grand Robe of The Oracle quest (the Phylactery will get you nowhere quest).<br />
<br />
You can also duo in Harbinger's Spire, stay away from the Monk epic fellow, but there are lots of trash nameds there that my wife likes to solo when groups are lacking, thus I'm sure you could duo them easy. Loot is probably the cash equivalent to what you might get for SCHW, not sure how trash loot sells though, but you'll also make experience &gt; velks.<br />
<br />
Really though, the money is in the tradeskills. I used to think that 5k/hour was great, but when you start pumping out high quality tradeskill items (alla elemental tradeskill stuff - yes I know you're shammy isn't EP, just using this for a reference point) that still sell for 75k+ a shot, it's tough to think in lower terms. There are some neat tailored tradeskill armors for silk / leather wearers with stuff that drops in Nobles, that sells fairly well - and speaking of Nobles, you could duo most any trash named there for runes and good droppable loot. A druid ft2 waist slot drops off the named Bazu in the SE corner of the map that sells for around 100k, would be easy-peasy for you to camp also. While there you could pharm bloods and hides, either use those to make armor or sell them for decent plat. Something for some rogue poison drops there also that I believe sells fairly well. Just steer clear of Rock Thrower (another named Bazu but he'll rip you up).<br />
<br />
My ranger friend used to solo Rivervale guards and make ~300 plat every 15 minuteish, you could do that solo without even your shammy. For that matter you could do the same with a trip through soldungeona.<br />
<br />
I'll try to keep thinking up more stuff. OH - you could solo the zone in area of Plane of Hate very easily, and turn in all nodrop old school armor for plat gems in poK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zar</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...Thanks for those.<br />
<br />
Problem is a PK server  NC is main hangout, will get ganked to much to make it worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zar</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't find the person to start the instanced zones in DS. Who and where is this person?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
