The way I understand it, the only negative effect from running out of stamina is loss of the ability to jump, provided the stat itself is over 100. I had a pally friend tell me he's parsed himself at doing less dmg when he ran out of yellow, but I'm pretty sure he was full of shit as he couldn't produce the parse for inspection.<br />
<br />
So why is it that I keep running into warriors who stop pulls every once in a while to sit and regain stamina, or bug casters to zing them? I grouped with a 58 ogre warrior today who did that, every 2-3 pulls he'd sit there resting. When I asked, he said he feels he's hitting weaker and missing more when he's out of stamina.<br />
<br />
Now, I know this is probably a stupid question and I feel kind of stupuid asking, but can I get someone to confirm that the yellow bar is meaningless once you get sta over 100, or to deny it? If only so I could have a thread to point people to in the future.<br />

The people who continue to ask for zing or sit are just wasting everyones time.  There are a lot of people who &quot;feel&quot; that running out of stamina effects them negatively, but all parses have shown that to be incorrect.  Though I believe the character model slows down when low on stamina, but what the character model does means nothing to what actually happens.</div></div><hr />

Being a halfling I have to jump a lot to make it around zones such as Velks and Kael.  Unless of course they werewolf or NDT me (or grow) then I can run around just fine.</div></div><hr />
