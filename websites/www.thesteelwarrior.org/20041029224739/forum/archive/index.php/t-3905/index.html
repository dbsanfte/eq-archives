<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings.<br />
<br />
My guild just made its first engage on the boss of the earth tower.<br />
As far as i could feel it has Front AE 1500DD plus 2 sec stun and another small one 360degree AE 400DD plus 0 sec stun.<br />
<br />
Problem were 3 bees that guard the named that our bard tried not to agro while bringing down named without success. These bees started to cast as soon bard pulled named, so the though he was sucessfull and was bringing only named.<br />
<br />
Those bees ate me real fast and then wiped out raiding force with noticeable proffesionality :)<br />
<br />
So any clue on the correct pulling technique? many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can't split them. To the best of my knowledge, the bees are tightly linked to Kuanbyr as pets, and there's nothing to split them on like Vindi pets. So..<br />
<br />
Pull them all at once. One bee is rootable, one bee is slowable, and one bee is mezzable. IIRC, Hrani is the slowable bee: Park a knight on it, get a shammy slow on him, and forget about him until the cows come home. Stick a paladin on the rooter bee, Iri I believe, let him do his thing with Shackles of Tunare. One enchanter can keep the mez bee, Leister, down pretty much indefinitely. Rest of raid corners Kuanbyr whereever, and mows him down. Because of the proc (and yes, the big ass DD/Stun is an AE proc),  it's far safer to sac ranger damage than it is to risk ripostes/too close to the MA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO, it is best to kite the bees with a couple snare classes at their spawn area (no necro/sk's though as they will summon).  If I recall, all are snareable and as was said, one is mezzable.<br />
<br />
Pull named down to raid and kill, otherwise the bees will eat the healers.  Finish bees one at a time as they are level 65 and do hit fairly hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bards have a spell that gates a mob back to this spawn point. You can do this to all 3 bee's. If you guys stay down teh stairs in the room before the boss you can pull boss down, and then gate all the bees back up and they wont come back. The bees keep agro but are out of agro range of the boss so they just stay at their spawn. <br />
<br />
If you decide to move up the stairs after boss is dead expect to see 3 mad bees coming at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great guys Class &quot;A&quot; info ..many thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you work the FD split with a monk you can split it up so you can pull a bee or the boss, but it requires a little luck and some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">we just have a monk pull all 4 down then have him fd the mt will pull the boss corner and engage.  the mezzable one we mez and then the bards keep busy useing some song to gate the other two back to thier spot.  then when the boss is done we get the slowable one then the other one then the mezzable one.  just the way we do it though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Few things that should help -<br />
<br />
First is the AE - it is NOT frontal, it is targeted on the MT. It has a very small radius so it is easy to avoid. Make sure everyone stays away from the MT and they won't get hit.<br />
<br />
Second, gating the bees is the easiest way to beat this encounter, but there are a few things you need to know. Highsun (bard gate song) DOES NOT clear agro. Like Korinn said, the bees will stay agro and if you are not positioned properly, they WILL come back. The trick to the bees not coming back is to make sure Kunabyr is far enough from them to be out of assist range. To be 100% sure, put him in the corner of the room with the weapon rack near the bottom of the stairs. That is the fartest distance you can get from the bee spawn point, keey the boss there and they will not come back.<br />
<br />
There are also some other little tricks that will make thsi fight go more smoothly. Make sure you pretarget everything. You will have a bit of chaos on the pull so everyone needs to know their job. There needs to be a CC team and a boss team. Have everyone target the boss and get near the corner on the pull and make sure that they DO NOT damage the bees. They need to concentrate on getting Kunabyr cornered fast and under control so the CC team can do their job.<br />
<br />
The CC team is what will make or break this fight. Your enchanter needs to have Iri targeted before the fight. The chanter needs to be near the center of the room and spamming his mezz button until Iri is in range. If you have 2 chanters, have one spam Tash while the other mezzes, a little insurance never hurt.<br />
<br />
The rest of the CC team will be 2 kiters/snarers and your bard(s). Have your 2 kiters pull Leiter and Hrani with snare. If they get lucky it will land the first time and give you a nice split for the run back down. The 2 kiters need to chain snare evan after it lands so they can keep agro. Your bard needs to be close to the chanter in the center of the room so he has some room to work. Its a good idea to have the bard pretarget both Leiter and Hrani so he can toggle targets easily. As soon as he sees one of them is snared. Highsun until it land. The kiters can just do laps around the table once the bees are snared, they are easy to avoid. Once the 2 unmezzable are gated, then you can gate Iri and finish off Kunabyr. There is no reason to kill the 3 bees since none of them drop any loot.<br />
<br />
I do this on a regular basis with 18 NToV/Luclin/VT geared people. We wipe a bunch figuring out the best way to do this, and if you have a competent CC team, this is by far the easiest strat once you can execute it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krorghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DOWN!!!! with only 16 people<br />
<br />
Many thanks wandor ur info proved to be unvaluable... Anyway after all the strat the info and the stuff we messed it up on the pull, and agroed a bee the named and a kriger :) Our CC did good itsjob but named started to ping pong on two guys who were below 35PCT life and I though we were doomed, but managed to regain agro and all went smooth till named went down. Named alone is just like other towers mobs, hitting in the 800 range max without defensive, except for the AE stuffs that stopped when he (prolly) ran out of mana (?). Piece of cake.<br />
<br />
Engage (if we can call that an engage) was done in the room before the big one with the tables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Iri is the mezzable bee, not Hrani IIRC, just did him for like the 13th time</div></div><hr />
