<br />
Was one hell of a series.. the most entertaining one in years and NJ played great. Man is Neidermeyer's mom gonna be pissed LOL.<br />
<br />
The only thing that bothered me is when the NJ fans boo'd Giggy when they awarded him the Smyth.. I thought that showed no class because nobody could really argue that he didn't desearve it.<br />
<br />
So I'll say it this one time... NJ &gt; Ducks</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are a better society today because NJ won</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LMAO The Ducks completely blew it they had major karma on their side. Yesterday was Donald Ducks 79th Birthday. <br />
<br />
Seriously though I am a Wild fan and will tip my hat to New Jersey. I did not think anyone was going to be able to stop the Ducks stifling defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah; that series was...one that sticks out as the most exciting and unpredictable as in who was going to win it. all joking aside, &quot;I&quot; thought the devils would have crumbled under the Ducks. They looked that good.<br />
<br />
i was also puzzled when they awarded Giggy the Smythe and the crowd booed. Stupid Jerseyites :D ( i'm only a Devils fan by following my Minor League team, the Albany River Rats, from when I lived up in Albany and having season tickets for years. Go Rats !! although they kinda suck now :( ) There was NO other person worthy of it in that series. I'd wager if it wasn't for Giguere the Ducks wouldn't have made it out of the first round. The guy is Incredible. /hats off to him most definately and I felt bad for him when I saw his face when he was awarded it. He felt so down about his team not winning. <br />
<br />
Frodlin: funny part is Eisner is trying to sell the ducks too. wonder how much the $$$ got inflated to as a western confrence champ as compared to an &quot;almost playoff contending&quot; team. I also smell a Selanne trade incoming :D<br />
<br />
NY Islanders on the other hand; they're a good team. Wang put a lot of credibility into making his Islanders a worthy team. I see them crawling their way back to the top. They earned a LOT of respect the last few years and sure made the Ranger$ $teinbrenner approach to building a team look stupid by comparison.<br />
<br />
Here's to a great Year. Can't wait for the next one !!</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I am wrong here (I may very well be) But aren't the New Jersey Devils owned by YES (Yankees Entertainment) which is owned by George Steinbrenner.</div></div><hr />

This entire playoff year was amazing to watch, the only thing better than playoff hockey is overtime playoff hockey. TBH I was hoping for Game 7 Finals Overtime Playoff Hockey.. it just doesnt get any better than that. I for one love the tension and feeling of urgency that comes with overtime.<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to play more EQ now that the playoffs are over.. I've been neglecting my toons over the past few months. I cant wait for next year and to see what my Blackhawks can piece together after a dissapointing second half of the season.</div></div><hr />
