<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Damonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was having some strange targeting problems today in LDoN, especially if there were more than one mob in camp. I would target mob A (even hail it ) then when I hit ~ for attack and I would attack a different mob. Wanted to know if it's my computer or is anyone else having these sorts of issues.  It was very embarrassing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am having the same problem since the last patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am having this too, it was really bad in plane of fire today.  I would be targeted on one mob, press attack key (~) and sudenly it jumped to another mob.   I also noticed this problem in the ssra basement on skeletons yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kurim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the patch messages said:<br />
<br />
You can now use the (`) key to &quot;Target nearest NPC&quot;, in addition to F8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can edit it under options to prevent this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have attack keyed to Z, but I use ~ for the &quot;toggle between last two targets&quot; key.  I use it a lot on my cleric as I melee a lot (and it's a lot faster than /assist if I know who's got agro), and couldn't figure out what was wrong when it wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
Find the &quot;Target nearest enemy&quot; key (should be F8 normally), and you'll see the ` (AKA, the ~ key) is set as the alt key.  Click on the alt key spot and hit Esc...you'll be back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Damonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been having trouble with F8 targeting actually, even standing right next to a mob in LDoN, very aggravating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I, too, have been struggling with F8, especially in Ldon.  Sometimes I am standing right in front of a mob and cannot get F8 to lock on.</div></div><hr />
