<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm kind of torn on what I should do...<br />
<br />
I have the ability to put an Anger 3 aug on one of these 3 weapons...I'm wondering if I should aug a 1hs and keep the 2hs for dps on raids or aug the 2hs for better aggro. <br />
<br />
I'm kind of leaning towards the augging the Shortsword and putting that in primary...only thing is the amount of damage I take off ripostes with a 18dly weapon is sickening. Eventually I'd like to become a full time 2hs tank. <br />
<br />
Or should I wait and aug something else? Getting another 1150 pts isn't a problem. <br />

What could you possibly be tanking that has a high riposte rate?  I wouldnt worry about ripostes until they are in the 1500dmg range, and even then lots of warriors still DW all the way into time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think those two combos will be close on DPS, but I bet the dual wield combo edges out the 2-hander by a hair.  <br />
<br />
I say this based on the parsing I did in Katta.  In my test, attacking unbuffed from behind on a green-con mob, GBoS (14/18 + proc) and Blade of Carnage (15/20) beat out a WMBS by about 5 dps.  Your 2-hander is slightly better than the WMBS and your offhander is slightly better than a BoC dps wise, so I think you will find either option is about equal for just damage.  Only way to be sure is to parse it yourself though, I don't trust those weapon efficiency calculators when comparing 2-handers and 1 handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Givin that Sparkling Shortsword is a Plane of Air drop, I assume he could be tanking alot of stuff that hits hard.  I really wouldn't waste an anger aug on either of those, but if your going to, I think the Greatblade of Storms will be a longer lasting weapon then either of the others.  If your in a position to be getting a Blade of War or Stone Etched Warsword, I would just wait for one of those and augment that with Anger 3 right after you loot it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah my guild has been in EPs for about a month now. We have 3 BoWs in the guild already but I have about another 3 or 4 Warriors ahead of me (blew all my DKP in VT doh!) right now. <br />
<br />
I went ahead and auged the shortsword, figuring I'll have 1150pts again before I see a BoW or SEWS anytime soon. It seems to work well in my exp groups so far.</div></div><hr />

DPS is kinda hard to search for (3 letters) ... I've been reading  (and now posting) here, that 2H &gt; DW for DPS. But recently I've seen a few hints that this is not always the case, and so if anyone knows the thread I should be reading to clarify this for meself, I'd appreciate the link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BoW/SEWS will beat any pretime duel wield combo for dps, after that we get DBotW and EoE which will beat out both those and Vanazir for dps.  Before BoW/SEWS duel wield is still viable, but it takes some nice hard to obtain weapons, when compared with the GSoT which will put out similar DPS to those weapons at a fraction of the time invested to get then 2h is considered the preferrable choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">^^ What Crystara said.  2h &gt; DW is too simplistic to rely on.  You have to look at the individual weapons.  Generally though, you can get a 2-hander far cheaper than the dual  wield combo it would take to equal it in dps.  BoC and GBoS are not weapons you can pick up in the bazaar for a couple thousand plat, but the WMBS is, so it's not really an equal comparison, it's just a comparison of the weapons that *I* happened to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use different weaps depending on whether I am tanking or not.<br />
<br />
Tanking, GBoS main, CHoS (yes, I need to upgrade that) offhand.<br />
<br />
Not tanking, GSo4W.  Holds aggro very very nicely when I need to offtank, and generally won't pull aggro off a determined tank when I am not tanking.  <br />
<br />
I'm planning to put an anger augment on the GBoS, and a damage augment (haven't decided which one yet) on the GSo4W.  <br />
<br />
I haven't parsed the difference, but my unscientific impression, based on how long it takes to kill a mob, is that the GSo4W does a fair bit more DPS than the dual wield combo.</div></div><hr />
