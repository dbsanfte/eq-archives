<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently I am using the ever popular CHoS/SotB combo.  I also have a Katana of Pain in the bank, and nearly enough points for the top stun aug.  Although the procs are great for agro, I don't want to rely on them so heavily, so I am trying to decide what will be the best DPS set up not accounting for procs. <br />
<br />
What would be best from a DPS perspective?<br />
<br />
11/18 main - 13/20 off<br />
12/19 main - 13/20 off<br />
or would some other combo be better?  Is there a good formula for calculating DW DPS?<br />
<br />
I was considering a two hander, but I already have ambi &amp; no points in PB yet.<br />
<br />
[Edit] NM, I found the thread I was looking for.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hrmm so far horror shard from CT dragon 14/17 main and don't know about off hand hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">13/20 main 12/19 off. your looking at 1-3 dps differenc if that. and the 179 from the hammer will easly cover any loss from being 2 delay slower. any fight long enough for the 2 delay to take effect on the dps you would prolly be better off breaking out the windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You take 2 times the damage, add 13 to that figure then divide the total by the delay.<br />
<br />
11/18 = 1.944<br />
12/19 = 1.947<br />
13/20 = 1.950<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably not even 1dps. Someone said that agro is generated per swing, if thats true use the 11/18 in main. If thats not true use 13/20 (better is better even if its hardly anything).<br />
<br />
Glad to see others are also thinking to not rely on procs to get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey bro, if I were you I'd put chos primary and sobs secondary.  Here's how I see it, delay 18 compared to delay 20 is 2 tenths of a second difference per swing which isn't going to help nearly as much w/your aggro as having 2 good aggro producing procs on 1 weapon.  <br />
Over all imo having 3 aggro procs far out weighs the tiny difference in weapon speed for your aggro generation.  <br />
If PURE damage was better aggro than procs then you'd see alot more raid MT's using say a SEWS over say a BOC/GBOS combo.  <br />
Granted I have no parses to say SEWS does more dps than a BOC/GBOS combo but I just figure it does.  <br />
The only reason I can see for using a Katana of Pain anyways is if your truly hurting for STA because those neg's to all your sv's really blow lol.  Oh well hopefully I helped some.<br />
