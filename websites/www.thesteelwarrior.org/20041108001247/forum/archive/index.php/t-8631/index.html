<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calliopeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've had a few people ask where I found out about the Worn DS cap of 15.  I hate giving the &quot;I dunno, the warriors said so&quot; answer.  Is there a thread somewhere that has parsing or shows how that conclusion was reached?  I'd love to link it in my DS guide.<br />
<br />
I have also been told that Worn DS items won't activate until there is also a cast DS active on the tank.  Can anyone confirm that or provide clarification?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I can personally confirm this. If you do not have any spell DS on, an innate DS will not activate.<br />
<br />
I am not sure where the testing was done on worn DS cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not too many innate ds items are there? most are clicky effects. ive replaced my only innate DS item, but even if there isnt a cap, i think you would be hard pressed to get over 15.<br />
<br />
aten neck is 8, im not sure what else is out there.</div></div><hr />

I think it's mostly shield of pain augs after that.<br />
<br />
But I dunno how many of those you can tolerate putting on armor.</div></div><hr />

I've got 19 worn DS in items, but never put them all on at one time to test it... one of the SKs in the guild that has 17 said the cap was 15, and I never bothered to dig old gear out of the bank and confirm it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ugh 15? If true thats a tad low IMO. Wouldnt be too unbalancing to make it 35 or so like the other caps. I know a few people that have fun trying to get the highest possible DS.<br />
<br />
This is the first time I have heard mention of a DS cap btw, so until someone actually can verify it personally it could just be a rumor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">new range item on lucy with +15 to DS http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=67606 , I somehow doubt it puts you right to the cap, since there is no ft 15 (soon to be 20) item nor a 35 pct shielding or spellshield item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">NICE range item.<br />
<br />
I can confirm that worn DS does not take effect until you have another DS on. (Dain Ring is a good one to keep on hand for that) <br />
<br />
No experiance on the cap, but with how few worn DS items there are and the lack of it on common items I think that a cap makes no difference at this point.</div></div><hr />
