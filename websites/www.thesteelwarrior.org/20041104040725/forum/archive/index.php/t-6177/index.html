<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weylyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently lvl 10.5 Barbarian Warrior I have the full set of newbie quest armor and currently have the following weapons:<br />
1HS - Boarding Axe<br />
2HS - Sarnak Ceremonial Sword (Mainly for low delay and it was very cheap)<br />
1HB - Fine Steel War Hammer (again delay and cheap)<br />
Pierce - Lugald dagger (delay/cheap)<br />
<br />
I don't currently have any 2HB as I could find one with a low delay in my price range, I am not really twinked at all I only gave this char 40pp to start out with my main is only lvl 19.  <br />
<br />
What I am wondering is what armor should I be looking to upgrade to and when?  I would like something that I can hunt/quest for myself preferably because as I mentioned I don't have much cash at all.  I usually group with a druid and either an enchanter or cleric depending on which char my friend feels like playing.  <br />
<br />
Also are there any good weapons I should be going for? Again they either have to be pretty cheap or drop off mobs I can kill, quests are great too unless they require extremely rare drops which can get very annoying hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help and any other suggestions for gear are appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ride your newbie armor out until level 20 or so and your weapons too; if you got paitence and can do some bazaar time you can score some good deals without any twinkage whatsoever...<br />
<br />
the biggest help IMHO for you to make some quick coin; save all the pelts and silks you get.. you can make a good deal of coin fast saving drops off critters that still give you experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like Shik said wear what you got not till about 20, should be fine till then.  But here's a tip of my own, bit more specific than Shik's about drops.  Get every spider silk you can and then buy a tailoring kit, box whatever its called.  Combine 2 spider silks at a time and you'll get a silk swatches, I don't remember what they go for now but on Prexus I used to tell them for 100-200pp a stack depending on the buyer.  Hope that helped ya some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weylyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those are great tips but at 20 what armor set should I go for?  I was looking at Ry'gorr but it doesn't look much better than what I have so I don't know what I am aiming for some of the crafted is nice but would probably be quite expensive.  I would like an armor set that I can realistically hunt/quest for myself around 20ish something special about earning armor your self instead of buying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DrachenfeldTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">centi warspear, prolly best (dam/delay)/pp there is.<br />
<br />
remember 2handers arent really efficient until after level 20.<br />
<br />
paludal caverns has some armor that drops very frequently, dont know if it is better than starting city armor tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, if you're in newbie quest armor ry'gorr is much nicer than what you have just due to AC difference.  Personally I'd go with mix and match crafted and crustacean shell armors.  They should be cheap and should also last you till your 40's at least.  I was still in several pieces of both until my early to mid 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vladd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The player made LDON armors arent too shabby either , iirc better AC then crafted and the armor made from gargoyle granite in the MM adventures carries small + sta , str and sv magic on it. Can probably pick up each piece except for the legs and BP for 100 plat or less each. legs and BP may run in the area of 150 - 200 pp.  <br />
<br />
Also check out the smithing merchants in POK when i was skilling up smithing on my main i would make the pieces and just sell back to vendor so you may be able to dumpster dive for them at an even lower cost then the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">crafted armor, unfortunately; for the price of the gems alone to make it; you can buy similar if not better armor for the money.<br />
<br />
quested gear pre-velious level kinda sucks. you're best off doing the reliable crustacean-PC made-ry`gorr-whatever route for gear in the bazaar. they're all about the same in usability and can easily last until your 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ah, yes. The sarnak ceremonial sword. You'll notice that it's magic. In a couple of levels, use it to kill wisps. Save all the greater lightstones you get and take them to the gypsy camp in North K. Give them to a female gypsy there and she'll give you a book that requires an open inventory slot. turn around and sell the book to one of the other gypsy merchants for about 10 pp.<br />
If you can spend time in the bazaar, then kill spiderlings and spiders. Spiderlings drop spiderling silk, which can be used by smiths; tailors use the spider silk, which drops off larger spiders.<br />
Save all Low Quality, Medium Quality and High Quality bear &amp; wolf hides you get, sell them to players.<br />
If you can do the bazaar, the silks and hides are your fastest and easiest ways to get pp.<br />
If you go to the tundra area of Everfrost and can handle the mammoth calves, vendor the small tusks and save up the hides until you get 4 of them. Give them to the male rogue upstairs in the bank in Halas (four at a time). He'll give you some rogue-only armor, which you can sell to any vendor in halas for between 3 and 10 pp.<br />
Also, save up every piece of mammoth meat you get. Some players who bake still make Halas 10-pound Meat Pies, and mammoth meat is a component in it that is not regularly stocked by any merchant. Whenever you are in Everfrost, watch for someone shouting for mammoth meat (which can drop off calves). Give them what you have, but refuse plat for payment. About half of these bakers will say thank you and leave. The other half will give you nice things. You'll be ahead on the meat if you don't sell it.<br />
Even if you can't run a bazaar trader, spend some time in the bazaar searching for weapon and armor slots you want to upgrade. Get a feel for the regular price of things on your server so you'll know a good deal when you see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">do spend time in the bazaar scanning through the listings of armor and weapons. you will be overwhelmed at first but the learning curve will be well worth it for the rest of your career. curious thing about sellers is that while a person with a 50k item might sell it for 45k to get rid of it fast but will never sell it for 10k the same is not true of low end items. an item thats worth 200plat will sometimes be sold by an impatient seller for 5plat. this is probably a high level player who cannot be troubled to research proper pricing for the lower end pieces he has. if you spend time searching you will find these deals.<br />
<br />
funny you mention the centi warspear. ive sold dozens of these for 15plat each. its weird that they would take days to sell since they are a 20/30 weapon. i would have to say i was giving them away at that price. but the same reason applies to me as to others. the lesser gear i simply dont pay much attention to to set a sane price. and people who search patiently with the /bazaar search utility grab these deals.</div></div><hr />
