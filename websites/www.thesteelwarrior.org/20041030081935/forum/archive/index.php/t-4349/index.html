<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meetsheeld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This weekend we wiped on Xegony. While we looked at what went wrong we noticed something. It appears that Xegony's DPS has increased. Increased to Fennin Ro levels. We both had necro debuffs, slows and cripples on her. Since it appears that Sony changed PoA saturday (apparitions not popping every 6 hours, etc..) is it possible they buffed Xegony? <br />
<br />
Has any other guild killed her this weekend? If so, did you notice any changes? Given that Sony may want to reduce the number of guilds getting time equipped, perhaps they stealth buffed her? <br />
<br />
Of course it could just be a one time thing or that we screwed something up, but I'm interested in hearing any feedback.<br />

<br />
No druid debuffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meetsheeld</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The change to the PoA avatars seem to be Saturday morning, so I was wondering if anyone has any experience since then.<br />
<br />
As far as druid buffs, I think so, but I'm a tank, what do I know :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">same here, DPS went nuts even debuffed wiped at 24% - hurt bad</div></div><hr />

Xegony says, 'stop staring at my boobs, pervs. I'm a guy irl.'</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">when tanking you hear her like mumbling at least i did last friday, weird noises on the island up there. O and for no apparent reason at all EVERY guard + muzlakh despawned one hour b4 her pop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Are you referring to her little chant whenever she AE's?  We did her last week and it was no biggie, we will find out soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">some of the time gods mumble stuff too now.</div></div><hr />

some of the time gods mumble stuff too now.  <br />
<br />
Talking about audible sounds or text?  I wouldn't notice any sounds as I have had EQ sound turned off for at least 2 years now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cmecu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We did xegony little over a week ago, and I had my cleric in rotation. i was closet to her .. and i could her her say somethin, i turned up volume to decipher it.. i was goign to try to write the noises donw, but who has time to write while in that rotation :P<br />
<br />
It sounded kinda sexy . i think i got turned on tehre for a minute :D :rolleyes: :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sdaasiil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">coughreslowcough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/cough crippled, slowed, both druid Ro's, SK debuff +2k AC and still spiked last night<br />
<br />
Went back last night to kill her and it seems to me like she has much more sporadic spurts of DPS. Proof would be in parsing and comparing to older fights. maybe next time i will. She sure as hell is mumbling some crazy crap though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">we killed her a couple of nights ago. dont think our clerics noticed any problems. kept same tank on her for about 50 mins i think or thereabouts.<br />
<br />
she was mumbling something as i ran past her though, couldnt make it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Proof would be in parsing and comparing to older fights<br />
<br />
I won't call it &quot;proof,&quot; but 11/02 with 1885ac tank, 870dps.<br />
11/15 with same tank in slightly better gear, over 1900ac, ~1020dps.<br />
<br />
11/02, 966 non-defensive.<br />
11/15, 1290dps non-defensive.<br />
<br />
dps under defensive wasn't too varied.<br />
<br />
I won't rule out the possibility of Ro's (3.3 min duration) not being reapplied, but even assuming it wasn't, would an extra 100atk equate to an extra ~300+ dps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">last night i made sure druids had her debuffed, SKs, and shamans crippled and slowed on a timer one minute in advance and still noticed much larger spikes in damage we hadnt seen before.</div></div><hr />
