- I don't believe the actual effect is reliable enough to use point to buy<br />
<br />
Do they proc often enough to make a difference, or do they proc TOO often, wasting much of their protection? <br />
<br />
- It would depend on your level of WA.  With Guard 3 I count on overlapping procs to give continuous protection (with WA 5 and off hand).  I'd imagine you'd see the same with this aug.<br />
<br />
Would you use one in your DPS setup? <br />
<br />
- No.  If the effect had reliable reflection (I believe this effect is reliable on a very low pct of spells...I'm sure someone will fill in the precise level of detail as it has been published here before)<br />
<br />
Would it be worth slapping one on my bow (range slot, not BoW) and trying for a proc on each incoming?<br />
<br />
- Absolutely not.  Bow procs are not to be relied upon in any way shape or form.</div></div><hr />
