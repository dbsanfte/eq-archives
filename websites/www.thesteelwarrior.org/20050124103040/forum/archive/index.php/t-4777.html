<br />
Blade of Strategy/ Blade of Tactics<br />
Sword of the bloodsworn<br />
War Marshalls bladed staff<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder<br />
<br />
i'm thinking SotB/Blade of Strategy for aggro<br />
but then should I keep GSoT. I mean it's pratically worthless to sell it back. War Marshalls is for dps.<br />
<br />
also would it be better to go blade of strategy/blade of tactics when I can only get 50 dex?<br />
<br />
my dex with epics is 201 but without about 160.<br />
<br />
so which out of GSoT, SoTB/red epic or both epics would give me the best aggro with a chanter vs with a shaman<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have troubles getting a reasonable proc rate from my red epic.  And it gets resisted a lot also.  For this reason, I like the blue epic in the off-hand - it does wonders for ATK and bumps up DEX.<br />
<br />
I personally think that the blue epic is underrated.   Many of those here are very high up in the game where a 14 24 won't cut it no matter what the effect is.<br />
<br />
I currently use the blue epic to touch off my primal.  Then I generally switch to weapons that are appropriate to the situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For aggro I'd go with GSoT as well, but then again, I'm me.</div></div><hr />

Depending on were and what I fight I bring out different weapons.... Though in LDON I can never get agro ((<br />
<br />
But, all this being said, I would recomend waiting till after the provoke ability has been patched.  Supposedly this new ability will get rid of our RNG proc rates.  <br />
<br />
Time will tell....<br />

<br />
Put the WMBS on for DPS, as you said. With the new melee changes, you will not need more than GSOT and Anger III.<br />
<br />
I use CHOS aug'd with Yak and SOTB aug'd with Anger II and it kills the GSOT.<br />
<br />
My next upgrade if I ever get will be GSo4W with Anger III and I will literally retire my 1hs and 1hb.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefered GSoT over CHoS/SotB before LDoN, so when it came out I started saving and I finally got AngerIII. I LOVE it. Ofcourse there will still be times when you van't get a proc for a short period, it is just the RNG being a bastage, but often times it now flips the other way and I get a silly string of procs. My highest count so far was 6 anger and 5 Planar Stun procs during a 45 second fight. <br />
<br />
I am really thinking hard about my next upgrade, as GBoS and CHSD are within grasp if I roll right. I am really happy with my AngerIII GSoT though and I hate ripostes even if it is only from Tower Boss Mobs and not uber elemental bosses. Food for thought I suppose.</div></div><hr />
