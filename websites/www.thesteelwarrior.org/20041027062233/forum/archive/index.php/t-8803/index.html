<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maztheslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any advice on how to take him down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my guild usually drops him as we farm GOTS for stuff...<br />
<br />
jump in to the hole...classes with DA should DA drop<br />
<br />
he doesnt hit hard..but has a lifetap proc..1k maybe? slowable i belive...so grab a Resistmagic buff and bard, slow and cripple and kill<br />
<br />
a good tank(9kish) could do it with 1k cleric...less good tanks, bring another cleric or druid<br />
<br />
and dont use firebased spells....he'll resist 'em all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">His proc is 1500 and seems to fire fairly often.  With resists and bard you should manage to resist a bunch of them though.  I would recommend bringing two healers if you're not 8-9khps.  A spot healer is good to have on those occasions when he snaps off 3 procs in a row.  <br />
<br />
To kill him just pull him to the true corner over by where GotS is.  GotS and his buddies do not assist.  If you get too close to where the door out of the room is there's a wanderer and 3 gargoyles over there that will add and most likely wipe a single group of average geared players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pff, don't listen to this crap.<br />
<br />
I was at like 7khp, had jack shit for buffs, 2 65 warriors and a 65 rogue, popped furious on engage and he was dead before I needed a heal.<br />
<br />
Bring some friends, I guarantee you can kill him if you're not a retard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maxtheslayer,<br />
I used to farm him for red dragon scales and a way to purchase upgrades.  My group consists of a fairly non-ideal arrangement for him:<br />
65 war / clr / dru / enc / nec / mag<br />
<br />
I get almost all partial nukes with my characters, so really the war and 3 pets are doing all the damage.  Listen to Haass as furious is the way to start the encounter.  I pop mightystrike (or fellstrike) after then evasive after that.<br />
<br />
To negate his lifetap DD, which procs quite a bit and also heals himself, I have the enchanter drop uproar and rune of zeb. onto the warrior and keep them up during the whole duration.  This significantly negates his DPS and makes him much easier for me as my DPS is negated by his resists.<br />
<br />
If you have a melee heavy group (which Haass has vs mine) then the enc w/rune deal may not be necessary.  Even without enc w/rune, a cleric is more than enough to keep up as prior to getting uproar, my enchanter could not keep rune of zeb. on the warrior 100% of the time and healing was necessary, which the cleric was more than capable of doing.<br />
<br />
As for hp/gear and the like, my toons were pretty much all Skyshrine armor clad, droga weapons, some epics, 100aa+ and some (very few) BoT Tower items.<br />
<br />
Since getting uproar on the enchanter, my success rate is 100%, though the fight does drag on quite a bit.  As a note, I have never slowed him with my enchanter as his MR is amazingly high (enc tash and mage mala) and enc nukes never land nor do further debuffs.  I also have a hard time getting dots to land from the necro, which doesn't happen often.  Straight up nukes are your best bet, but plan on the DPS being very minimal (perhaps lures on a wizzie would be the win).  Personally, I'd love to drop my druid for a melee (rogue/monk/etc), replace the enchanter as well and you'll probably do quite well against him.<br />
<br />
The summary of all my encounters is below: (keep in mind a lifetap heals him, so his HP listed below are artifically high due to this, though some fights he never lands one due to my runes, so it kinda averages out)<br />
This mob [Lifetaps] [Summons] [Casts Spells] <br />
Max Hit 258<br />
Ave Hit 119<br />
DPS 103 <br />
Max Spell 1500<br />
Ave Spell 1249<br />
2 min 5 sec to kill <br />
Total HP 35,909 <br />
I've spanked this mob 39 times out of 47 encounters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make friends with a bard, cleric/drood, and perhaps a chanter.<br />
<br />
-bard sings DA song, all jump into the hole.  Note, not recommended for dial up folks and/or very slow zoners...<br />
-chanter should GRM then chain rune tank, bard should sing MR song... lifetap is very resistable with high MR, and rune will block it.<br />
-depending on AC and MR, healing may or may not be necessary... mob seems very resistant to debuffs, but iirc DDs hit pretty well.<br />
-beat down mob; beware, it runs at low health... careful positioning, snare, or finishing blow strongly recommended.<br />
<br />
Total time elapsed, about 5-10 min tops.  Make sure you have a good method to get out for the non-gaters. ;)<br />
<br />

p.s. bring along an erudite SK twink for the sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vendak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nortlav is trivial if you do two things.<br />
<br />
1.) Slow him<br />
2.) Enchanter tank him (Quick Buff 3 Enc really really helps).<br />
<br />
Yes, really.  ENC will more than likely never take damage, if any very small amount (I've tanked him with my ENC a few times).  You just chain-cast Arcane Rune.  His 1k lifetap cannot proc whilst a rune is up.  When he's slowed, he doesnt hit hard at all.  Without his lifetap he goes down like a rock.  ENC Tank for the win~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we just had a pally stun hum  and he droped in like 1-2 min easy to inclues the 2 adds out side the door  and we are not in and war shape or form a elemetnal levle guild as we had no one even close to that level... at most we where a velious level guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>haddion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just bring a cleric, an enchanter, and maybe some dps if you don't want it to last forever.  Enchanter can chain rune on you and his lifetap is not a problem.  Use evasive since npc's can not proc on a miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very easy, period.  Yes, he has a life tap that will knock a player down fast  when you engage him.  Guild would kill him prior to taking down Gots.  On one of those raids, I tanked him when I buffed up to about 7k, but we did have a raid force that was ready for Gots so he droped fast, and I had some fast heals ready.<br />
<br />
The last time we took him, we had a small force (forget details, but more than one group, not all 65s).  We there just to kill him and get his sword for an SK.  I was buffed up to about 7.7k.  Our chanter cast rune on me, and I barely got hit. <br />
<br />
Again, his life tap is all you have to be concerned about, so  just have a strategy to handle that (fast heals or rune), and have MA hold agro so the soft guys in back do not get killed.  Holding agro as always is important, I have seen our guild get sloppy, and have seen casters die on him after they nuked too big.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">much like on venril sathir, chain rune makes this guy rediculously easy... his proc never goes off as long as you have rune up, and since his melee is fairly light, it rarely does.  i 3box him often with warrior/chanter/cleric ... with the cleric nuking and chanter runing.. a few hundred PP in peridots for red scales is a great deal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maztheslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I took the advice and we tried him again last night. We killed him in less than 45 Seconds. Can someone explain to me why he will not cast his Lifetap with Rune up? He never casted it once on me during the  whole fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you again for all the help.</div></div><hr />
