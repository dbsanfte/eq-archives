<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darksign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is regular bash a 0.0 stun?<br />
<br />
If so, does it have aggro over the amount of damage it does?<br />
<br />
I have heard, for example, with the crafted yaks, that the 0.0 stun of the effect is valuable for aggro, so the 0.0 stun of bash should have some aggro to the stun part.<br />
<br />
Where I am going with this, is that it occured to me that Furious Bash and even regular bash benefits Knights alot more than War.<br />
<br />
Knights have access to weapons with high dam/dly to make up for being unable to DW, but if SoE gives Wars shields to go into sword + board mode, wont the Kinghts still come out alot ahead, retaining spell aggro, but having more 1h dam/dly AND the same furious bash?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buldan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always felt that any changes that effect shields across the board will always benefit knights moreso than warriors.  Unless there is a warrior specific change to shields or an ability that only warriors get that can only be used with a shield; messing with shields is a waste of time.  Assuming they're doing this to help warriors.  Otherwise, it's good that they're making shields more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When bash/slam stuns, it is a bit longer than 0.0. Usually it will stop a runner in their tracks for a second or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems an easy enough fix imo, just slap it on :p</div></div><hr />
