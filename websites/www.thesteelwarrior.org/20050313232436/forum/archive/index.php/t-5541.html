Dust is our last Avatar for Xegony access and I wanted to know what timers relate to the event. How long do you have to kill and what triggers the timer start? I was thinking mebbe the spawning of the first splitter spider but really have no clue.<br />
<br />
Further, once the avatar is spawned is it on a separate timer? If so, how long.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, preciate any help in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Timer starts when the splitters first spawn.  My guild is still working on it and the spillters won't despawn if they're aggro'd, so if you have a bard kiting everything up top the whole time they won't despawn regardless of the time.  At least it's seem to work this way for us our 2 attempts we've taken at the ring, had a mess up and kiter died on our 3rd splitter and they despawned.  Still refining our strat really heh, takes too long.<br />
<br />
The time in between sigismond and the avatar despawning should be the same as the other rings pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As it turns out, we made our 3rd run at said Avatar last night...and kicked his butt ;)  Access to xegony now and lucky me, an Ivory Hilted Cleaver to boot!!!<br />
<br />
I heard its rare although the loot table is small on avatar...either way, I'm a happy camper :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
