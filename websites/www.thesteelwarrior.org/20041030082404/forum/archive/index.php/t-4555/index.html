<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I'm looking for potentially easy places to get upgrades, by easy I mean 6-24 lvl 65 person attainable. <br />
<br />
I am on the road to aquiring a second Anger3 proc, but have no idea what if anything I should put it on. What would you guys suggest for equipment upgrades and what weapon to slap an anger on? I'm running out of ideas here lol.<br />

<br />
Edit: I am revisiting this to see about getting a fresh perspective on what upgrades I should seek out. Keep in mind that I am not in an uber guild, but I am able to rally up small raids.<br />
<br />
I have been/am farming the acidic mass in CT for acid bracers, but I don't really know what else I should go for.<br />
<br />
I am trying to get myself into some Seru gear, but even with only 10 people on the raid, I can't seem to win any rolls lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You didn't mention if you had pp to burn, nor what your guild is going for these days. Anyways, a BoC with Anger augment has been said to be good, look around and see if someone have some experience with that combo.<br />
<br />
As for armor, well, try and buy some Ornate Armor molds (or hunt for them) and get some Raex armor on you - Bracers, boots and Gauntlets are the cheapest ones I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ornate is Kizrak's, Elemental is Raex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">erhh .. sorry, my bad - I'm tired here :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I already have ornate in all of the slots I don't have better. I don't care about platinum, I can find ways around that... just anything that might be an improvement for me to get pre-elemental as I am still missing Mith Marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any suggestions? Not a big fan of BoC, so no real reason to change out weapons.</div></div><hr />
