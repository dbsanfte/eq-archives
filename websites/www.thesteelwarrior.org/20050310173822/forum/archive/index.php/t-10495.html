<br />
just wondering if anyone else has had probs with Norton.  When I first installed it I set all the EQ exe files to &quot;permit all&quot; on Norton which worked fine.  That is it worked fine for maybe a month!  Then it stated asking me if I wanted to permit/block EQ when it was mid way through loading up, crashing EQ and giving me no control over the mouse :mad: .<br />
<br />
It seems to be that whenever EQ updates Norton no longer accepts the rule assigned to certain exe files, even although they are still in it's list set to permit.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had any similair problems - or better still does anyone know a solution!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tooby</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i had this problem, I took the eq files off the permit list, and then put them back on again.. im no technician so i dont no why it worked, but i havent had any problems since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Norton is seeing the updated files as different tham they ones you permitted. Any time that EQ updates those files you will need to re-permit those files to contact the internet.<br />
<br />
Personally, before I got my router/firewall, I would just disable norton before playing online games. Not a very secure solution, but I don't keep any of my important files on a networked computer. Plus, any script looking for a host to launch a D/DOS attack will probably move on to a less busy machine for maximum impact. Well, at least, that's how I'd do it. For instance, I would try to replicate my DOS virus on a dial-up machine. There are much easier and reliable targets out there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question. I couple months ago I started having client crashes every other time I zone. iirc that was around the time I got my new comp which has Norton. Think the problems are related? I'm not really all that computer savy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">have you tried disabling norton while you play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Norton is doing it's annoying little pop-ups and screwing around with your hard drive or whatever while you're playing that could definitely cause crashes in EQ.<br />
<br />
My virus strategy is to not keep anything on my computer that I care about people getting, and reformatting my HD when the computer starts running poorly.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bourbon</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Norton AntiVirus is one of the best on the market, Norton Firewall is a steaming, memory leaking, pile of shit.  The best way is to run AV on the system and set yourself behind a hardware firewall, can pick up a router with a decent firewall built in for under $100.  Or if you have a crappy box laying around doing nothing you can install something like Smoothwall on it and create your own linux based firewall, but that's for the truly geek in you.<br />
<br />
I used to work for Symantec, makers of norton products for those that don't know, and NIS had internal names like Smelly Cat etc., it isn't a well liked product even by it's creators.<br />
<br />
If you absolutely must have a software firewall in place for some odd reason, go with ZoneAlarm, you can get it free for personal use and it works fairly well.<br />
<br />
P.S. - all those &quot;intrution attempts&quot; Norton is warning you about is bullshit to make you think you need NIS installed.  There is so much noise on networks/teh intarweb that the chances are unless you are a server or hosting something important, it's just noise.  That's not to say ZoneAlarm won't give you the same warnings and they won't be just as much BS, but just so you know, you aren't under a constant threat of getting your megabits hax0rd no matter what either program says.  Firewalls for personal use are highly over rated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but at least zonealarm is free...<br />
<br />
I will give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomen</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Zonealarm is well, its free and it gives me the falese sense of security I need to sleep at night. <br />
<br />
Although you get the same &quot;problem&quot;, everytime there is a patch you will have to put the everquest files on the list, easy way to sort it is to start eq with eqwindow. and then atleast for me its alot easier to tab out and hit the &quot;lets remember what I pick&quot; and &quot;yes&quot; buttons on the popup window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hammers</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy,<br />
Like Vikken said, everytime your .exe files get patched your firewall sees that as a potential problem.  It doesn't know whether it has been changed by a patch or by a virus and thus ask's you if you want to allow it to go out to the internet.<br />
<br />
I use Zone Alarm and it does the same thing.  The easiest trick to it is when you see your .exe files getting patched switch your security level to LOW (or whatever setting that will allow all programs to go out) when you are FULLY logged in with your toon hit the windows button (or whatever way you like to get back to windows) and change your setting back to med.  The next time you log in, assuming that EQ .exe didn't patch again, you won't have a problem as the file will be valid in Zone Alarms eyes.  This saves your poor computer from you turning off your firewall and having it naked to the world!   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still say hardware firewall for teh win. Its really easy and doesn't bog down your system. Check it out. Otherwise, unless your running the software on another computer that acts like your firewall, you are still going to get the same connection messages on most any brand of firewall software. Hell, even Win XP's mini-firewall still detects some of these security risks.<br />
<br />
I have no issues with my hardware solution now. I'm using a wireless dsl/cable router /w a 4 port switch. I have to occasionally reset it, but otherwise its completely invisible.</div></div><hr />

It basically cuts your disk il multiple partitions, but actually HIDES them.<br />
<br />
http://www.powerquest.com/partitionmagic/<br />
<br />
<br />
Its like having 1 2 3 4 computers in 1 PC, however is a pain to setup unless you are geek.<br />
But with some time and one PTP software you can give it a try.<br />
<br />
<br />
Partition Magic + Ghost = LEET<br />

You just dont care if you fuck up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">02-05-2005, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">zone alarm sucks. both if left unconfigured will lock all open ports. EQ opens a random port EVERY time its run, between 1500 and 1700, so youll have to give the executable specific access through the firewall.<br />
<br />
im a technician for (arguably) the worlds leading computer hardware/software manufacturer and i we have people call us every day with problems playing EQ while using either norton/zone alarm.<br />
<br />
it will work if setup properly, but both programs are so possessive of your system, if they crash, well, its a bitch to even uninstall it. as i recall norton offers an uninstall program but its download only and not included with the install software, zone alarm offers no such, and if you have to remove it after it fails youll have to delete the directory its installed in, edit your windows installer log, and your registry, to fix the &quot;changes&quot; it made.<br />
<br />
i dont use a firewall or AV anymore, interfears with other things i have running. hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
