Use magelo.  You can create a dummy character and buy them to see how much they cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">for general/arch/class/PoP eqcasterrealm (http://eq.crgaming.com/archetype/default.asp?Action=Cat&amp;ClassId=7)<br />
for some general GoD and  OoW look at the mage board (http://www.magecompendium.com/library/aa-long-library.html)<br />
for warr specific the thread  for up to GoD (in the first post) and a little of GoD's ones after, and here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=104120&amp;postcount=3) too.<br />
a complete AA up to GoD (include) here (http://www.aloofhosting.com/phulavit/index.pdf)<br />
for a little help with ranking : library is helpfull (correction in it : the DB for offhand and bash/kick/whatever don't give any aggro, they are just dps).<br />
and for pure war AA in OoW, the mage compendium (http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=17092).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there a more accurate list for the cost of OoW AA's? I know the one linked form TMC is wrong, as Shield Block AA is not 3 per lvl, just for the first lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Man that would be awsome.  I really like the way they made that with all the information and cost.<br />

<br />
This may help you, it is from the sticky under stats on this board.<br />

Warrior AA (http://www.aloofhosting.com/phulavit/index.pdf)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope, no good, no OoW. nbd I guess. Just trying to figure out how many more AA I need to get before i start working on resists again heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phulavit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greetings~<br />
<br />
    I just noticed this post and was embarassed to see links to my out of date Warrior AA chart referenced.<br />
    I decided to get my lazy ass in gear and add all the OoW AA points to the mix.   So here is my revised and updated Chart of Warrior AA abilities (including OoW) (http://www.aloofhosting.com/phulavit/index.pdf) <br />
<br />
I know that I have the point values correct, but there might be a few corrections to be made as to at what level particular AA points become available.<br />
<br />
Please post any corrections to be made and I will update accordingly.<br />
<br />
And by the way, that interactive list that Erutiarmy orginally posted, http://www.graffe.com/AA/  is a great format.  If anyone has the capability to create a similar list, I'd also like to see that posted.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice chart. One thing I did notice, Salvage is 3 levels at 5 AA each, trainable at Lvl 55, 65, and 70</div></div><hr />
