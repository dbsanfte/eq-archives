The graphics were excellent, I loved the spell effects. But, after an hour or so, I was bored.  Hack and slash with no real effort, or endless NPC's to talk to. I missed talking to real people. Well, maybe once everyone has had a chance to look at things it will get better. But for right now, I'm scooting back over to EQ1. It may not be as pretty, but I have plenty of company.</div></div><hr />

I haven't bought it yet... school all day and then work... shortly followed by dwarf tossing from dusk till dawn no time for sleep (but I do have time to post).<br />

Let's get crackin'<br />

What server is everyone going to play on for EQ2?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the whole &quot;I missed talking to real people&quot; part, I think they made a mistake where they let the NPC's talk to you so it looks like tells, or other players ... makes it hard to see when a player is talking .. or not.<br />
<br />
Also, players tend to be more anti social these days - I have no idea why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I'm playing with a rather regular group of old friends, so that probably helps a lot. So far, it seems like the game itself has a lot of promise, but also has the potential to contain a lot of boring hacking and slashing...<br />
<br />
Playing on Mistmoore, under *gasp* TALIC! Garyen should come play with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah .. Freeport looks much cooler when you actually move around in it, than it does from screenshots. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Graphics were alright, but not as good as i expected. Cool water and spell effects n such. However everything seemed very tiny. And i tried changing the resolution to a smaller one, however stuff is still tiny.<br />
<br />
Think about EQ1, FFXI, Morrowind(i know it's not online but i'm talking about the graphics). It felt like you *are* the character, and the world is an actual world around you. It's really hard to describe, but EQ2 feels really different from this.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately EQ2 feels alot like how Shadowbane and CoH felt like. You're controlling a guy in a 3d landscape, but the feeling you get in EQ and FFXI isn't there.  I guess the main problem is...stuff seems small. <br />
<br />
But now that i'm in Qeynos, that feeling is beginning to go away and i'm starting to like it! Just one thing though...why is there options in dialogues, if all the possible answers i've seen so far were yes/no, yes only, and no only. Do you have any other questions about Qeynos? uhh...yeah but it says here that i don't! heh<br />
Does this change later on?</div></div><hr />

Give it time... folks will open up. But playing with friends does help...</div></div><hr />

So far I like it, though too me ateast, it plays way differently then EQ.  But I think that it is a good thing that EQ2 is not EQ with better graphics.  For me I am getting a lot of lag.  I don't know if it is my computer or their servers which is causing the lag, but regardless it is annoying.  All in all I like the game, and I will play it for atleast a month.</div></div><hr />

In EQ2 type:<br />

<br />
In EQ1, type:<br />

They are also connected to SWG:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wargus Volsung</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing EQ2 since mon night late. The grafics are very dissapointing, I bought a new video card, FX5700 no not the cheap LE version, and I have to run with almost everything at minimum setting just to move around. I am not sure why the grafics have to be such system hogs, I played L2 for a good month, the grafics on it are amazing and I could run at medium settings with my old MX440 card. I hope they do something so I can at least see my Char's face and not just a blur where his face is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Other than that I am enjoying the combat, having special moves makes things a bit more interesting, but it is quickly just becoming like taunt and bash in EQ1, you just hammer them every time they open. A friend of mine who was in beta for 2 months finally got his retail copy and started playing last night, he has pointed some new quests out for me and helped explain the &quot;heroic opportunity&quot; and how it works. I am hopeing things get more interesting soon. I am getting tired of wandering around zones looking for a certain named NPC to deliver a note to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok quick question that i need answered quickly: can you only get the EQ1 server title for your character if you get the collector's edition?  or can you get it with the normal version too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quato</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get the title with a server name if you activate EQ2 on the same station account as you use for EQ1.  It is a &quot;heritage&quot; reward for all using an EQ1 account and NOT just tied to the colectors edition.  You pick which server name to have.  So I know a certain High Elf Paladin who chose &quot;of Tunare&quot; even though he was from Ayonae Ro because Tunare is his diety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">kk thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing on the Unrest server.  I have to agree with some people that the lag is tremendous, especially in the common areas like Qeynos and the newbie yards.  The instanced zones are much easier to move around in though and I have little trouble with lag in them.  Couple of things that I do like so far about EQ2:<br />
<br />
I like the travel system.  From the mariner bells you have the option of going to many different zones, not just one.  It seems like they intended to cut down on meanless running if this trend continues over the rest of the game.  <br />
<br />
I am really enjoying the quest system so far.  Its easy to use, and the best part:  they're actually worth doing in terms of experience and items.  <br />
<br />
I'm happy with the way there seems to be solo options and group options in most places.  If I don't feel like grouping I can just try to find mobs that are categorized as solo, and so far there seems to be enough around.</div></div><hr />

Plus- a few of my friends who work in the computer feild have told me that the 5700 cards arent that great. They were kinda a stop gap between developments...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mean to be rude, but an FX5700 card isn't much of a video card these days.  The high settings on EQ2 were designed for this generation of video cards (GT6800 Ultra, X800 XT) and using inferior video cards means killing off the graphics.  I have a 9700 Pro and I have to turn the graphics down as far as they will go.  Oh well, at least it will run on my system I had my doubts before I bought it.  Gives me something to want for Xmas though, although I seriously doubt I'll be able to talk my wife into getting me one, she thinks I play too much as it is (wink, wink.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh mine looks great relatively close to me (i have graphics all the way up) but the rendering distance is a bit limited because i only have an FX 5200.  The only reason that i can run it on the settings i have it at now is my Athlon 64 and the 768mb of ram.  Im probably going to buy a 6800GT pretty soon though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morf</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First impressions:<br />
<br />
1. Quest system owns.<br />
<br />
Browse the web, make sure you absorb all the quest info you can.  Not only are quests immersive and user friendly: but you can also easily DOUBLE the amount of exp that you're getting.  Seriously, fill the quest log and just go out, at one point the other night I was getting hits from 4 or 5 different quests for every mob I killed.  <br />
<br />
Some cool quests I've done so far:<br />
<br />
a. the quest to become a rogue -<br />
The harbormaster in fp was 'cooking the books' with the ship logs and i had to penetrate the harbor office and steal both his private and public logs by searching his office: Zone in to my own instance, sneak past a few guards, start searching his office, find one log. oh no! a guard is coming!  Hit sneak again and he comes in the room and stops, looks around.  It's clear he's not leaving so I 'ambush him' (cool rogue skill from stealth mode, knocks the mob on his ass effectively putting him out of commission for a few seconds) then stun him with 'cheap shot' (a knee to the groin) - at this point I whip around and backstab the bastard, etc....  once he's down I continue my search, find the log, stealth mode back out - return to the quest giver and i'm a rogue.<br />
<br />
b. Access quest for a zone off of the commons (name slipped my mind):<br />
<br />
Shady npc in freeport tells you about the zone, he can't get in because some people are researching in there and he's not on good terms with them, directs you to talk to a guy in commonlands near the zone in.<br />
<br />
The guy is talking about some research process they are doing in the zone, states he won't let me in unless I kill some of the giants in the area to prove my worth.   <br />
After killing the giants, he explains that they are going to hold a ceremony to present me with a key.  I then return to the shady guy in freeport who advises me to betray them at the ceremony, kill their leader, and take a key for myself and him both...<br />
<br />
Sooo, my friends and I zone in to the instanced ceremony, slaughter the bastards, kill the leader (who drops nice loot) and another named (also drops nice loot) then I get the key for the zone, as well as a helmet (they offer plate, leather, chain and silk versions for this helm as a reward) and for that hour I spent doing the quest I got about 75% exp in the level I was in: probably 40 of that came when I did the final &quot;hand in&quot; for the quest.  (again, quest exp OWNS)<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been playing with a group of friends from eq and we've been seriously kicking some ass.  We're only playing part time as we don't want to interfere w/ eq 1 but still are able to make great progression.  <br />
<br />
As far as the performance:  <br />
<br />
I also have fx5700 (256 mb) - 512 ram - I turn the visual options down all the way and it's completely playable, no lag here.  It's a brand new game, to play on full settings you will need a new card, that's just the way it is.  Still, it looks good enough to me  (I didn't buy the game for the graphics).<br />
<br />
<br />
The game is not EQ, with a new graphics engine as some would suggest.  It's a totally different game (although there are a few similarities)<br />
<br />
I was laughing the other night when I found an ogre in freeport named Boomba, who sells pickles. (sound familiar?)  - Well he actually talks now &lt;insert booming ogre voice here&gt; &quot;My name is Boomba, and I sell pickles.  If you want to talk, find a Teir'Dal.&quot; - it would appear that the price of pickles has gone up considerably over the past 500 years, so I didn't buy one.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm liking it pretty well, still going to try out WoW when it comes out, then make a final decision from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ah, cool.  thanks for the info.  Will check it out when I play tonight, he give any quests by chance? ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty impressed with EQ2. Graphics are nice, I have a ti4200 and it still looks good on the high performance setting. Game runs a lot smoother since I upgraded to 1 gig of ram.<br />
<br />
I like the tradeskills, they are easy and its not a lot of click combine crap. My only beef is with gathering resources. Each resouce can be gathered 3 times by anyone, so if you are at a resouce gathering, someone else can come up and snag one of the 3 from you. Now they have a really nice way to lock mobs onto a person, so you can't killsteal, why havn't they done this the resouces?<br />
<br />
HO's are too easy to break in when in a group until the group starts to gel, but other than that I like the HO. They are nice when they go off.<br />
<br />
Exp isn't that bad, doesn't feel like a grind, granted I'm only level 12 because I'm taking my time to enjoy the game but I gained half a level in about an hour with a group of 3, killing mobs easily 5 levels above us. I like the fact that you get exp for finding a place for the first time, that alone has gained me at least 2 levels!<br />
<br />
I wish that the EQ2 interface had the customization that EQ1 has, just because I'm used to my eq1 interface.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm enjoying EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syries</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really digging EQ2.  I have a level 16 almost 17 Shaman.  Exp is getting slow, but I don't mind.  This game does not have the grinding feel that EQ has.  Like people have said the grfx are amazing, and the game for the most part runs smooth.  What I really like are the dungeons that they have, like Wailing Caverns, and Fallen Gate.  The dungeons to me have kind of an old school dungeon-crawl type feel.  I think for a while atleast I will stick with this over EQ, though I still will log in and talk to friends etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-27-2004, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 22 guardian/11 outfitter here. My honest opinion so far is this game needed more time put into it. Either that, or people with better skills.<br />
<br />
What's wrong with it?<br />
<br />
--There is no logic in this game! If you thought travelling by books that are &quot;portals&quot; was bad, i don't know how you can stand this.<br />
<br />
- Travel by &quot;Mariner's bells&quot;. This makes no sense - why not put a few boats in the docks and a guy who would operate them? Have him charge 50 copper or whatever price for the ride - who would give you boat rides for free? Of course, you would still zone instantly, but it would make sense.<br />
<br />
- Griffon towers...not as bad as bells, but close. 1) Griffon are *transport*, why do they take the 'scenic' route every time? 2) Why isn't there someone to operate this? Some explanation to how the griffins suddenly come to the tower to give you a ride?<br />
<br />
- Quests still suck. There's alot more quests, with decent rewards. But for the most part, they still suck. Nearly all of them are killing or running errands, and not very well masked either. <br />
<br />
In addition to that, quests pop out of nowhere. You find a book in blackburrow, and suddenly receive a quest to kill 10 gnolls. It gets worse, because as you read it it gives you quests to kill more and more creatures in blackburrow. But it doesn't tell you to kill them in the book, you &quot;just have to&quot;. No other explanation. <br />
<br />
Also, i was doing a quest for...FIPPY DARKPAW...strangely his name was Fippy Darkpaw the 4rth, not the 3490523843408235th. It involved getting signatures from merchants who are involved in this illegal business with him. That's nice, but according to the story and what a guard told me in a previous quest, i should've turned the book over to a guard. But nooo, instead you *have* to return it to Fippy and accept his reward when you threaten to tell a guard. Why would i wanna do that!<br />
<br />
Quest rewards also pop out of nowhere sometimes. You have killed 10 gnolls...1 silver coin magically appears in your palm!<br />
<br />
They need to hire Squaresoft to make quests for them or something &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
- There is no rain in Qeynos or Antonica. Where's the logic in that? Part of Antonica used to be the Karanas. Hell, the only place i've seen rain was Freeport. This makes no sense and is unfair to those of us who happen to like rain.<br />
<br />
- Player houses are completely different shape inside then they are outside. Hell, they have an inn with a row of doors leading directly into a wall!<br />
<br />
<br />
--There is no roleplaying in this game.<br />
<br />
- Families were supposed to be part of the game, but they replaced that with the EQ1 way - /lastname something.<br />
<br />
- Player-run events were supposed to be a big part, but there is no such thing and nothing to support such things in the game.<br />
<br />
--Poor design<br />
<br />
- The game requires a very good computer to play, and that's fine. The graphic engine is decent. But with that engine they could've easily made it better looking. Blizzard or Squaresoft can make much more beautiful things with these tools. <br />
<br />
- Sound...well, voices are nice, everything else is awful.<br />
<br />
- Character models...all women except gnomes still have giant boobs. What's up with this! Need some customization there. And iksar got ugly...Small heads, wide bodies but small chest. <br />
<br />
Besides that, the game still seems to focus on getting more and more levels, gear, etc.<br />
<br />
Oh, and there is kids in this game, unlike in EQ1. There's like...1 or 2 in the entire city. They're humans shrunk to 50% of the normal size, and it looks disturbing. <br />
<br />
I also forgot to mention...the advertizements had some armor that isn't even *in* the game - that barb warrior woman that's been on the old EQ2 main page for so long is not how barb women look - they look like apes. And the armor she is wearing isn't part of the game. <br />
<br />
They also advertized how there would be multiple layers of clothing, and how great it would look, etc. Well, the armor isn't too different from EQ1 armor. The only example i've seen of that would be the lower part or robes, where they would have ugly pants under the half-open robe. It's really quite ugly.<br />
<br />
However, i've quit EQ1 for good. FFXI is still unbalanced and full of morons. WoW is the MMO version of diablo2 and won't last long. So it's still the best out there, which is quite sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 22 guardian/11 outfitter here. My honest opinion so far is this game needed more time put into it. Either that, or people with better skills.<br />
<br />
People, as usual, as morons. They put no effort into learning how to play the game. The vast majority of people are still just pushing buttons in combat. Some of the worst I've seen come from EQ where they refuse to release they're old play style. I had to have a talk with more than a few clerics about how they don't, and shouldn't, sit down. Telling them to heal me and attack at the same time seems too much for there little minds to handle.<br />
<br />
--There is no logic in this game! If you thought travelling by books that are &quot;portals&quot; was bad, i don't know how you can stand this.<br />
<br />

<br />
So instead you would have us wait for the boat or griffon to pathh all the way to us, then path off a bit after you boarded andthen instantly travel to your destination? You system isn't any better than the one in place. Worse, I'd say since I have to waste time while you maintain &quot;realism&quot; then throw it all away.<br />

Bells are very useful, and safe route around the city. They don't take you directly into the main city, so it keeps people from all standing around like a new PoK or Nexus. They are instant travel for short destination, that would otherwsie be tedious. However, Many fo the loinger journeys require a bit more investment in time. I like that, it gives a good sense of space. I like the down below personally for intercity travel, but it requires a few levels to do safely.<br />
<br />
Griffons let you see the beauty of the game. The handcrafted zones really show them selves off here. Definitely some EQ1 jive going on here. The zones feel personal, and each have thier own flavor. I like this. the scenic route doesn't take much longer than if the griffon had traveled strait there. Even WoW uses the scenic mentality in their griffons. I really give the zone a sense of space when you see out in the distance.<br />

- Quests still suck. There's alot more quests, with decent rewards. But for the most part, they still suck. Nearly all of them are killing or running errands, and not very well masked either.<br />
<br />
This is a blanket statement about various games. Every complainer has a comment about how all quests are the same thing, or this and that. I'm quite sure that developers are listening if you happen to have new ideas on making new types of quests.<br />
<br />
The fact is, there are only so many different types of quests, exploration, kill x or y, collect x of y, defeat so and so, rescue so and so, deliver x. really, if you have something to add, by all means, I'm sure the MMO community in general would gladly lend an ear.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, quests pop out of nowhere. You find a book in blackburrow, and suddenly receive a quest to kill 10 gnolls. It gets worse, because as you read it it gives you quests to kill more and more creatures in blackburrow. But it doesn't tell you to kill them in the book, you &quot;just have to&quot;. No other explanation.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, lets complain about adding purpose to your otherwsie mindless killing that you would be doing anyways. Getting nice xp boosts and/or items in the process. Winner, dude! Right on! (sic)<br />
<br />
Also, i was doing a quest for...FIPPY DARKPAW...strangely his name was Fippy Darkpaw the 4rth, not the 3490523843408235th. It involved getting signatures from merchants who are involved in this illegal business with him. That's nice, but according to the story and what a guard told me in a previous quest, i should've turned the book over to a guard. But nooo, instead you *have* to return it to Fippy and accept his reward when you threaten to tell a guard. Why would i wanna do that!<br />
<br />
Uh, ok...you know that naming your children after a previous family member doesn't have to happen in succession. I could be named joe the 3rd after my great great great great great great great grandfather.<br />
<br />
The quest...well, you can turn in the book to the authorities, you chose not to. fear not however, you can kill the guys in the instance and get the book anyways and do the quest again, free to do the other way if you please. The chest that drops has enough books for you whole party to use. I'm sorry you are unimaginative.<br />
<br />
Quest rewards also pop out of nowhere sometimes. You have killed 10 gnolls...1 silver coin magically appears in your palm!<br />
<br />
You completed a quest that you accepted. There's this great thing called a quest log that contains all your active and completed quests. The default button is &quot;j&quot;. I suggest you try it some time.<br />
<br />
They need to hire Squaresoft to make quests for them or something &gt;&lt;<br />
Yes, everyone here is a squaresoft fanboi<br />
<br />
- There is no rain in Qeynos or Antonica. Where's the logic in that? Part of Antonica used to be the Karanas. Hell, the only place i've seen rain was Freeport. This makes no sense and is unfair to those of us who happen to like rain.<br />
<br />
I think that it just doesn't rain much. I think I read that somewhere. I remember peope complaining about how much bad weather was in EQ. Can't make everyone happy I guess...<br />
<br />
- Player houses are completely different shape inside then they are outside. Hell, they have an inn with a row of doors leading directly into a wall!<br />
<br />
<br />
--There is no roleplaying in this game.<br />
<br />
- Families were supposed to be part of the game, but they replaced that with the EQ1 way - /lastname something.<br />
<br />
- Player-run events were supposed to be a big part, but there is no such thing and nothing to support such things in the game.<br />
<br />
--Poor design<br />
<br />
- The game requires a very good computer to play, and that's fine. The graphic engine is decent. But with that engine they could've easily made it better looking. Blizzard or Squaresoft can make much more beautiful things with these tools. <br />
<br />
- Sound...well, voices are nice, everything else is awful.<br />
<br />
- Character models...all women except gnomes still have giant boobs. What's up with this! Need some customization there. And iksar got ugly...Small heads, wide bodies but small chest.  <br />
<br />
Grabbing at the dark now? I love the &quot;poor design&quot; one. That was original. I wish families had been included in the release, I really liked the idea. There are roleplay servers, just for you. 2 in fact.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, you have no imagination about player housing. You say you are a roleplayer? I thought imahgination was a halkmark trait of roleplay...<br />
<br />
I love the sound track, and the voice overs are cake. Go to Willow wood and tell me you don't want to smack that stupid bard. But thats character, not many games have that, EQ had it, EQ2 now has it. I played a lot of games and the vast majority have no atmosphere or character. I love EQ for it, its what made the game magical. it why I have a favorite zone in EQ. One that evokes an emotional response. Very few games, and even fewer MMOs can say that they have that. If you loved EQ for the, for lack of a better word, &quot;magic&quot; that it had, then you will live EQ2. The developers made a living and breathing world just like EQ did. Its not EQ, a lot has changed, but I will say it is Norrath and it maintains that atmosphere that made EQ so special.<br />
<br />
Who doesn't like big boobies?...<br />
<br />
The children are freaky looking, I'll give you that. Its...just....wierd *shiver*<br />
<br />
Progression is one of the things I loved about EQ. You have it again, a little polished, in EQ2.<br />
<br />
Low level characters look like low level characters. You look like you just git fished out of the sea, and you did. the higher level you get, the more you look it. Considering, most people have yet to past level 20, Ill reserve judgement. level 20 out of 50 isn't exactly....&quot;high level&quot;.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I'm having a blast in EQ2, even more than I did in WoW beta. I didn't think it was possible. I had very low expectations. I was floored by the game. Beta players kept saying that the game wasn't ready. I disagree, a few things have yet to implemented fully, like societies, but the game was absolutely ready for the store shelves. I'm not beta testing this game. The game is release quality. Graphics are amazing. Quest are actually worth doing. Leveling isn't a grind. In fact, I'm not compelled to girnd with anything. There's so much to do that I spend my time exploring and questing and so far the levels keep coming.<br />
<br />
My only beef with the game is tradeskills. I was disappointed about them coming from a SWG perspective. I had hoped they would have recreated the level of depth and skill that that system required. Tradeskill interdependance is really limiting right now. I leave it at that. if you like tradeskills, check out eq2 traders for more info.<br />
<br />
Overall, I love th game. I has everything I loved about EQ (the atmosphere, community, progression) without all the bad stuff (camping, ksing, grinding). the game is really balanced right now and a blast play. I was really amazed that SOE putout a game of this quality. I am by far not a fan of SOE. I expected crap and got apply pie instead.<br />
<br />
mmm, pie...</div></div><hr />

I think you may have misunderstood me. What i was trying to say was some of the game designers lacked skill. The combat and tradeskills were designed very well, but the graphics and content(quest) designers weren't very bright.<br />
<br />
<br />
So instead you would have us wait for the boat or griffon to pathh all the way to us, then path off a bit after you boarded andthen instantly travel to your destination? You system isn't any better than the one in place. Worse, I'd say since I have to waste time while you maintain &quot;realism&quot; then throw it all away.<br />
<br />

I really give the zone a sense of space when you see out in the distance.<br />
<br />
I think you misunderstood me again. I never said that you should have to wait for a griffon or boat to come and pick you up. I never said travelling between zones using alternate paths is a bad idea. I never said you should sit on a boat waiting like you did back in the old days in EQ. <br />
As far as boats go, i don't know how to explain it any clearer. Look at http://everquest2.station.sony.com/#racesRatonga for example. On the screenshot on that page, there's boats. They were for some reason removed. Why not have them there? And have some guy charge you a fee, and then you would zone the same way you would through a mariner's bell. It would work exactly the same way a mariner's bell does. So why put an extra NPC and designs there if it would serve the same purpose? Well, because it would make sense and look nice. No other reason.<br />
Same deal with the griffons...imagine a stable, but with griffons. Have an NPC there that you could talk to. Have a few griffons there, not just a tower with a landing pad where griffons magically appear. No, you don't have to wait or anything, perhaps you could have the NPC blow a whistle and a griffon would approach and let you get on its back, and then fly off. Use your imagination!<br />
Why bother doing all this, you say? Well, why bother putting houses in the city? Why not just have all the NPCs stand all over the place outside? It would make no sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact is, there are only so many different types of quests, exploration, kill x or y, collect x of y, defeat so and so, rescue so and so, deliver x. really, if you have something to add, by all means, I'm sure the MMO community in general would gladly lend an ear.<br />
Have you ever heard of storylines? Once that make sense? Ones that make feel something other then WOO EXP LOOT YAY!<br />
But i do love the fact the fact that quests give exp, so it doesn't feel like a grind. <br />
<br />
<br />
The quest...well, you can turn in the book to the authorities, you chose not to. fear not however, you can kill the guys in the instance and get the book anyways and do the quest again, free to do the other way if you please. The chest that drops has enough books for you whole party to use. I'm sorry you are unimaginative.<br />
 <br />
I'm sorry, but you misunderstood me again. The whole problem is you CAN NOT turn the book to the authorities, and a good Qeynosian would do.<br />
<br />
<br />
You completed a quest that you accepted. There's this great thing called a quest log that contains all your active and completed quests. The default button is &quot;j&quot;. I suggest you try it some time.<br />
<br />
The journal is great, i'll give you that. Your reading skills aren't. Whatever gave you the idea i don't use the journal? Let me try to put it in different words for you. I found a rune under a rock. From the rune i accepted a quest. The quest was to kill 10 gnolls. It was placed in my journal. I have killed 10 gnolls. A silver coin magically appeared in my hand for completing the quest.<br />
What i was trying to say was...coins or other rewards shouldn't just magically appear out of nowhere like that!<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that it just doesn't rain much. I think I read that somewhere. I remember peope complaining about how much bad weather was in EQ. Can't make everyone happy I guess...<br />
<br />
Trust me, it doesn't rain. Unless they added it in a new patch, there has NEVER been rain in Antonica. Check this thread if you don't believe me. http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=grph&amp;message.id=420<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, you have no imagination about player housing. You say you are a roleplayer? I thought imahgination was a halkmark trait of roleplay...<br />
Perhaps this 'imahgination' you speak of is saying that...see, whenever you see something like that, a wizard did it! Doors into a wall leading to rooms? wizard. travel by bells? wizard. Anything ridiculous, unexplained, and with no story behind it? wizard. <br />
<br />
I love the sound track, and the voice overs are cake. Go to Willow wood and tell me you don't want to smack that stupid bard. But thats character, not many games have that, EQ had it, EQ2 now has it. <br />
I don't know what horrible games you must be playing. Or perhaps that's just your taste in music. The voices are nice, no doubt. However, EQ music was awful for the most part. I can't stand the EQ and EQ2 battle music. Hell, they even put an MP3 player into EQ so that people could listen to their own music rather then the game music. But i guess you're just a SOE fanboi, despite what you said.<br />
<br />

Who doesn't like big boobies?...<br />

Low level characters look like low level characters. You look like you just git fished out of the sea, and you did. the higher level you get, the more you look it. Considering, most people have yet to past level 20, Ill reserve judgement. level 20 out of 50 isn't exactly....&quot;high level&quot;.<br />
Actually, some of the level 20 armor is really nice looking. I love my set of steel vanguard, and so far all the armor i've seen was pretty decent looking except for the robes. That doesn't change the fact that female barbs look like apes, and  what they showed in ads isn't exactly correct. <br />
<br />
<br />
My only beef with the game is tradeskills. I was disappointed about them coming from a SWG perspective. I had hoped they would have recreated the level of depth and skill that that system required.

Are you kidding? Tradeskills are great. You have to actually gather resources, not kill for them. You have to use skills, not just click a combine key over and over. It can be very profitable, it can be fun, and it can be dangerous. Crafters depend on eachother just like members of a group depend on eachother. You won't create all kinds of cool stuff by yourself, just like(in most cases) you won't kill exp or raid mobs by yourself. <br />
<br />
I like the game myself, i'm just focusing on the bad points in this post. Besides, i was expecting it to be amazing. You expected it to be crap. When you're expecting something to be crap and it turns out to be decent, you're looking at it from a completely different point of view and let many things that i would criticize slide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we'll have to agree to disagree. I think you are being too negative. Negative feedback is one thing, but your statements were overly harsh. Your post makes it sound like the game isn't fun at all. I remember reading many a post by people on various forums about how aweful the game is. I expected crap for that very reason. Looking back, I have to say that for the most part nearly all those posts were bunk. The game is great fun and I don't want people being turned off from the game because someone wants to focus on everything negative about the game and totally ignore all the good stuff. So to make things clear where I stand...<br />
<br />
The combat is challenging.<br />
Progression is worthwhile.<br />
Questing in EverQuest returns.<br />
Tradeskills are much better than EQ and most other games.<br />
Down time is nearly non-existant.<br />
Travel has meaning without too much burden on everyday tasks.<br />
Grouping is easy to do with the archetype system.<br />
Graphics are awesome, and scalable for lower end machines.<br />
It &quot;feels&quot; like Norrath.<br />
Grinding isn't an issue.<br />
With group xp debt, groups think twice about just letting the tank die. (about dang time)<br />
SOE finally released a game that is release quality.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ugly....<br />
<br />
Servers are still coming down daily for updates, and random sever crashes still happen.<br />
Tradeskills are a &quot;set down&quot; from SWG in many respects.<br />
Everyone is a noob (me included).<br />
No time to read the manual because the game patches so fast on the first patch :)<br />
Tradeskills still have a significant list of issues.<br />
<br />
Ok, thats all I got off the top of my very sleepy head right now. There are more intensive quests, you have to look for them though. Some of the lore books have excellent quests, as do certain NPCs that give lore quests. I suggest seeking these out. It really adds purpose to your mindless killing. (Note: On the book quests, many times you are killing to find more pages or lore items to inspect. So there is a purpose, you just have to pay attention to your quest and not just the quest objective window.)<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
BTW, you can turn in the book to the authorities. I will not spoil it for you, but I assure you that you can. I know, I did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you would be right in saying i was being very negative in my post. I didn't list the positive things about the game - yet. Doesn't mean there isn't any, there just weren't meant to be any listed in that post. <br />
<br />
The tradeskill system is the best i have seen compared to all other games.<br />
<br />
The combat is fast paced, fun, and challenging. There's no more single pulling. - fighting groups is fun. There's plenty of different things to do in a battle, not just press attack. Melee have mana for their abilities as well as casters do, which works out pretty well. There's heroic opportunities that you have to learn and cooperate with your group on.<br />
<br />
Exp debt is good. Exp debt sharing can sometimes be bad. As puller and tank there have been times i wish i could just die and lose some exp rather then train the group - but if i do that i would get blamed for exp loss. Of course if i train the group, everyones debt will be even bigger.<br />
<br />
Locked encounters can prevent KSing. The downside of the lock system is players outside of group cannot be healed or rezzed. While this may prevent PLing, this destroys part of what makes many clerics happy - being able to help or save someone. <br />
<br />
So far it hasn't felt like much of a grind - there's always quests - even if they do have nonsensical plots. <br />
<br />
Everybody is a newbie, which i find great. I played EQ for a long time, but not since the beginning. I always wondered what it would be like, starting out when everyone else is just starting out also.  <br />
<br />
----<br />
As for the quests, believe me, i love good storylines. I always read the journal and listen to the NPCs(i noticed alot of people just skip through). I was one of the few people back in EQ that was actually interested in storylines behind all the raiding. Yet i still find that many quests had little work put into them. Not to say they *all* suck of course. But many do. The great flood of blackburrow, for example, was a nice book but nowhere does it tell you that you must kill these creatures to discover or make the next page visible. And why the set number?  Sure, it lets you kill different kinds of things in the dungeon, for a quest and not just grinding, gives more exp and a nice reward, but it makes little sense.  I'd like to see more quests where the storyline of the quest is the main reward. Not to say the reward should suck! just...it's a damn quest, it should feel like an adventure book/movie, ya know? Not you find a rock, you must kill 10 gnolls, a coin drops from the sky into your pocket. <br />
<br />
Sorry if i'm wrong on the book from Fippy though. I've talked to various guards, the guard captains in Nettleville(i've turned in something illegal to a captain there before). Nothing new from them. The quest log or journal said nothing on any other options. Don't know what else i could've tried.</div></div><hr />
