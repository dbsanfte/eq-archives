<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doctor Choddy C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, kinda new to the whole aggro wep scene, so what better place to ask than here.<br />
<br />
I was wondering, in order, what u guys considered to be the best for gaining and keeping aggro?<br />
<br />
- Hate (EB, TB, etc)<br />
- Stun<br />
- Debuff (-AC, -STR etc)<br />
- Snare (Snare or darkness line)<br />
- Lifetap<br />
- DD<br />
- DoT<br />
<br />
What would you guys rate from best at keeping aggro to worst?  (If you bear in mind that the type of proc is the same level - IE I am comparing a DD vs DOT vs Lifetap vs etc..... of the same level, for example all would be the equivalent as level 30 spells.  (No point comparing a level 65 DOT proc to a burst of flame proc).<br />
<br />
Thanks - appreciate the input, will help my choice of weapon I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carwenst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, here are my thoughts.<br />
<br />
I personally have used a low end combination of debuff, hate, and DD. Most of that is due to my access to other weapons. <br />
<br />
What I have noticed, and someone can tell me if this is just my perception or not, is that debuff weapons are fairly useless after their first proc on a mob. That is why I switch mine out after it procs. <br />
<br />
DD seems to add ok aggro, but all in all I would not say that it will make or break you. I use it a lot mainly because I do mainly FFA exping with a stable group of friends and the more damage the faster the kill. We have two healers in our group and each is assigned one of the &quot;tanks&quot; to cover, so I don't worry too much about aggro occassionally bouncing to the ranger who is the other &quot;tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
Direct hate procs seem to work ok, but I would need something better than the barnacle covered axe to really have an opinion on that.<br />
<br />
Not having used the other types of weapons I cannot really give you a ranking. However, make sure that you consider that the weapon you are using also makes a big difference. You can have two weapons that proc the same effect that are very different in their aggro generating capabilities based on proc rate and dmg/dly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Uh... Hate?<br />
<br />
The reason we use proc's is to get more hate.  Pure hate = win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From my experience, stun weps are the best.<br />
<br />
Especially stun weps that proc like mad, like those Gnoll Lariats.<br />
<br />
You can get about 10 procs a 3 minute fight duel wielding those things.<br />
<br />
Then of course are the uber hate weps, BoC, HG, etc.<br />
<br />
Then after that i'd say debuffs, and after that I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My Gnoll Hide Lariats didn't proc much :(<br />
<br />
I would say, from best(top) to worst(bottom)<br />
<br />
- Hate (EB, TB, etc)<br />
- Stun<br />
- Slow<br />
- Debuff (-AC, -STR etc)<br />
- Snare (Snare or darkness line)<br />
- Blind<br />
- Lifetap<br />
- DD<br />
- DoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Doctor Choddy C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks guys, your info has been of great help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Doctor Choddy C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One further question...<br />
<br />
I see people using weapons with Damage absorbers (Runes, Berserker Spirit, etc.)<br />
<br />
How do these affect aggro?  Do they add aggro?  If so, where would they fit in on the list?<br />
<br />
Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Runes add aggro like healing, so put them in with lifetaps for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No offense, but if I'm in a group over level 15 and somebody in it is using 3/20 weapons, I'm finding a new group :p.  You have to look at more than the proc on a weapon.  Don't use a crap weapon with a proc or you will have zero aggro if it doesn't proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">never done the Gnoll Lariat in Ssra test  eh Brutal .... much fun, i suggest you try it ... youd be surprised at how well they actually do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Doctor Choddy C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is just an aid for me to see what procs are better than what.<br />
<br />
People can obviously see when they look at a weapon the ratio, and can base their decision on the ratio fairly easily.  However, I was having trouble with the procs and wanted to know more info on what procs were best on aggro.<br />
<br />
So, where do you think Rune would fit in?  This is Baadan's list, from above, and seems to be ok for me, but maybe others disagree, but for the sake of arguement, lets just go with his.  Where would you place Rune?<br />
<br />
- Hate (EB, TB, etc)<br />
- Stun<br />
- Slow<br />
- Debuff (-AC, -STR etc)<br />
- Snare (Snare or darkness line)<br />
- Blind<br />
- Lifetap<br />
- DD<br />
- DoT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ya imagine how effective it would be to have all the DPS and heal aggro of a SEWs with chain stuns. Whoops, sorry wrong class.<br />
