<br />
I have seen the Light!<br />
<br />
I have the Ultimate solution to the warrior grouping problem...<br />
<br />
And what is so wonderful, is that it uses SOE's favorite tactic, Itemization!<br />
<br />
A Charm.<br />
<br />
Warrior Only charm.<br />
<br />
This charm activates Only when you are NOT in a Group OR Raid.<br />
<br />
effect 1: Haste 100%<br />
effect 2: 50% Defensive<br />
effect 3: All attacks deal x2 Damage<br />
effect 3: right click cast. insta cast. - Curse of Molasses, this effect is a 50% slow and 50% snare on targeted mob.<br />
<br />
There, problem solved. <br />
<br />
No longer will warriors require groups...<br />
<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adjust the charm stats a little.. 30% bard overhaste, instead of 100% regular .. -90% aggro (so you cant tank with it, or you could have it make the mob treat you like a pet.. anyone else that hurts the mob is higher on the aggro list than you are, also anyone healing you is higher on the list than you are). Add regen to it, and atk rating, plus whatever other stats we would need to solo, innate procs on weapons perhaps? 200 point frequent proccing lifetaps, etc..<br />
          Have the charm work best when you dont have a group, subtract 20% per group member (full group means you get jack from it).. This would have the additional benifit of giving non MT warriors something in the way of DPS.  If concerned over possible exploits with discs, make it so you cant use a disc with it equipped.<br />
Make it scale to your level (appropriate stats for a level 30 vs a 65)<br />
<br />
Also .. If your group is full, the only stat the charm (or make it an augment, for example) would have is +65% aggro (or some number).<br />
<br />
Put it on a quest rather than a drop, make it a &quot;gather the groundspawns from all over&quot; quest, make it slightly tedious, put the groundspawns on a 10 minute timer, and VOILA, warriors can now solo, and tank with 65% more aggro..<br />
<br />
Am I out of my mind or does that sound possible? Looking forward to hearing replies :P</div></div><hr />

Anyways, alternatively, have it like these gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2385) that drop off Overking Bathezid in chardok. IE you right click the charm, and it switches to the other item.  Go from the soloing warrior charm to the MTing warrior charm.. Also, instead of the +65% general aggro, you could put a high proc rate anger proc on it. I think most warriors would be thrilled with a 200+ hate proc that procs like the cleric hammer, over a BoC / anything else.  Probably get around the same type of aggro as a BoC, but with whatever weapon you choose. Would let warriors be a little less weapon dependant, as well. (im just kinda spouting ideas out as I think of them.)</div></div><hr />
