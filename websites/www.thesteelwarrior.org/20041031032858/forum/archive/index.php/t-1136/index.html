<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone Im looking for a good place for me and my wife to hunt but i wanna avoid DL. I am a 44 warrior and she is a 44 cleric. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Echo Caverns, the side past the short and stout area in Shadow Haven.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert.  You can fight at the Twilight Sea zone entrance, which allows you to run if you get in trouble, or you can find a safe area along the wall (there are a few safe spots).  <br />
<br />
Dulak Harbor zone in.  <br />
<br />
Ocean of Tears, seafury cyclops island.<br />
<br />
All those should work for you.  Mobs are consistently high 30s, maybe some very low 40s, in all those places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dawnshroud Peaks till 47, easy. I was soloing there through 46-47, I was getting near half a blue per kill solo, so for a duo it should be decent exp, since you wont have Bind Wound downtime.<br />
<br />
You can sit by the camp fire mid way on your way from Netherbian Lair, zone, to the Sanctus Seru zone (that's going to your right when coming from Netherbian Lair).<br />
<br />
Pull wolves, named wolves, large zelniaks and named zelniaks. With a healer you should have zero downtime.<br />
<br />
Once in a while you might get a lightcrawler or wolf aggro at the camp fire, but it's relatively safe ( I was Hiding while I used Bind Wound ^_^ ).<br />
<br />
Also if your cleric partner sits behind the fire, between the NPC's the wolves that pop nearby will attack the NPC's first.<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns, sure.. but good luck, it's over camped.<br />
<br />
As for Dulak Harbor, wonderful idea. I wish I was a low level again to do some of those zones. Legacy of Ykesha is great if it wasn't for the hassle of getting there. Definitely go there, good exp, great zone with pirate boats and all, lots of funny loot, and rare semi-rare named that pop on any of the boats and in most of the LoY zones after you kill a bunch of the common mobs.<br />
<br />
Also , dunno if you have worked on it already, but this is the place you want to go to help your cleric partner do her Temperance quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh, Oggok :D seriously. them silly oogas are ridiculously easy.<br />
that is if you and your bud aren't ogres :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or Neriak :D Ive killed in Neriak, Oggok, Cabillis, and Grobb.. and my favorite has to be the inky killing, Neriak does have more casters, but where else can you get Decapitated Dark Elf Heads and Happy Love Bracers?? :D They are actually very low hp and dont hit very hard, soloed there before too when i was bored and they were still exp, now i just kill there when im bored or just to have some fun :D <br />
<br />
Rough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the suggestion we will try them all out soon, and yes we allready got her temperance spell with help from our guild which I love by the way (who wouldnt like free 800 hp and 48 ac). There will definetly be some dead Ogres and darkelfs in our future. Muuaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaahaaaaaa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try the spectres in Oasis. I quad them with my druid whos 45 and the exp is not bad. They drop cash loot which you can sell straight off to the gypsy vendors.<br />
<br />
Breaking them may be a little tricky, but once they are broken it should be quite easy and the respawns are perfect for a duo. You can also take down whatever sand giants spawn in the area.<br />
<br />
Another option is crystal caverns,not bad exp and you can sell the acrylia bricks for decent pp in bazaar to tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
At your level you may also want to try the kael WL entrance giants. They may hit a little harder, but you will be getting solid faction so that when you start to do arena you can be ready to get your thurg armour straight away. Plus the giants always give pretty decent cash drops and you can sell the heads in the bazaar for about 100pp for people wanting faction hits.<br />
<br />
As you are not duoing with a slower, I would recommend that you stack up on some DS potions before each session as that will help with your dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skullreaper Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whaaaaa? You want to avoid DL? What on earth for? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sol B</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got through my upper 40s in SolB and Dulak.  Only gripe with Dulak is it's a pain to do CR there when you don't have an invis class.  I spent a lot of plat on invis pots while I was there.  Would reccomend both places though, and you're not far from being able to duo Velks.</div></div><hr />
