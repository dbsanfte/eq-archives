* Expecially after i've already spent almost a year to complete my &quot;original&quot; epic.<br />
* I've grinded and grinded to get to 65 and dont feel that i have the patience to level anymore.<br />
* Now everyone and there brother will be running around with some title in there name. I kinda think its neat to every now and then see someone with a title, now it'll be common place.<br />
* and now more tribute, which i think to first one is junk imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i am personally excited about the new expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
New levels make me wanna grind, instead of what makes it actually FEEL like a grind, AA's.<br />
<br />
New epics(!), we all want them.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they will learn from GoD to help balance the content in the expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, I knew they'd up the level cap eventually.  I also knew that when they did I would be done.  I'm not sure why honestly.  I guess it's the over three years from the beginning of EQ to get my first char to 65, and the other year it took to get my next character to 56.  I was looking forward to getting this second character to 65.  But I also enjoy the fact that I can sign on my old character and he's still max level and max title.  No way I'm going to go back to my old character to max his level again, and no way I'm playing my new character to 70 or whatever the new max level is.  65 is high enough.  They should have left it alone.  Don't they realize that EQ is a dying game and that EQ2 or some other game is going to rise and take it's place?  Maybe they do and they're just trying to squeeze another expansion or two out of us as fast as they can.  Screw em'.  I didn't buy GoD and I'm not buying this.  I'll put my money towards upgrades for my PC so I can play WoW or EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">New epics(!), we all want them. <br />
<br />
No, we all don't.  I don't.  Lots of us don't have our epic 1.0 or are working on our Epic 1.0.  Just because you want it, doesn't me we all do.  In fact, lots of us don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I want epic 1.0 because for me at level 59 in a guild with fewer than 20 players it's still a worthy accomplishment and a nice equipment upgrade.<br />
<br />
I can certainly see where some of you 65's would see that as waste of time, though.<br />
<br />
As for epic 2.0 --- that just makes me weep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Senthiele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Epic 2.0 will not in any way require epic 1.0 to have been completed first.<br />
<br />
Epic 1.0 was a Kunark quest, and new expansions are based on, and require only the original game to access their content.<br />
<br />
It may be referred to as Epic 2.0, but think of it as a new, updated, Epic type quest for a newer and more modern weapon.<br />
<br />
Will I do it?  Time will tell... but the expansion sounds intriguing, if for nothing else than new content and a continuing storyline.  <br />
<br />
Calling it crap, saying it sucks, and complaining about it now is irrelevant.  Save that for what it is when it comes out.  Will it be perfect? I think not.  History says it'll have it's own unique set of problems.  At least SOE pays attention to that and makes adjustments as needed.  We may not all agree with the adjustments they make, but we still speak with the almighty dollar.   If you like it, you'll buy it and play it.  if you don't, you won't.  It really is that simple folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im looking forward to it for an entirely different reason..<br />
<br />
Levels and AA's.<br />
Im in a small guild and we have hit a barrier in progression.<br />
For fun I earthshaker zones and toy around in BoT out of boredom.<br />
I even started doing alot of the quests.<br />
<br />
If it will help me progress Im all for it.<br />
That and Im nae looking forward to the rest of the current AA's. Do I really need wisdom and extended breath?<br />
<br />
Gives me a reason to play again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Epics Yes!! no more DboTW + Insert DPS Aggro weapon</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
let me guess, everyone should be able to jump on epic 2.0 at the start? bullshit, put in the effort if you want part 2, i could have sold my scales and chained off my wingblade for alot of $$$$ but i didnt, i did my turn in after 1 year of hard work, get over it, do the quest, its not that hard as it is long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not one bit of information to give me the impression that this expansion doesnt continue where GoD left off.... difficulty-wise.<br />
<br />
Great. That means I have to sucker up and shell out ($30 most likely) just to level up and still be attractive for pickup groups.<br />
<br />
*sigh*  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Epic 1.0 was a Kunark quest, and new expansions are based on, and require only the original game to access their content.<br />
<br />
Can you be 100% certain that this is how they've programmed the new epic 2.0 quests? You know there are ways to program older content into the new content. I'm not a game developer but i do know how to program.<br />
<br />
Im gonna have to disagree with you. Im going to bet that you'll have to have epic 1.0 done in order to get epic 2.0. Or maybe they could have made it to where you turned in epic 1.0 at some point in the quest to skip a porton of epic 2.0 quest.<br />
<br />
It would seen very rediculous to me to have the people that strived to complete there epics have to start from ground zero, but then again rediculous = SoE.<br />
<br />
Guess we'll have to wait to see, I for one will have to tell Sony to kiss off on this expansion. In turn i'll probably be /guildremoved as its policy for my guild to have all expansions up to date. Which in another turn will give me a reason to retire from EQ all together. It's been a fun time, but all good times come to an end sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hope it requires epic 1.0 therefore the quest continues! Plus I'd rather put it to some good use, its like that old forgotten weapon that I always have on me even though I have banked time gear, its something to be proud of and good memories, would be nice to relive them and reforge the blade!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Im gonna have to disagree with you. Im going to bet that you'll have to have epic 1.0 done in order to get epic 2.0.<br />
<br />
You mean like how you have to have Kizraks before you could get Raex? <br />
<br />
Oh wait, no you didn't...<br />
<br />
<br />
However, these weapons are being designed for people at the upper end of the level spectrum<br />
<br />
Subtitles: They'll be L70 guild acquired weapons.<br />
<br />
Can you HONESTLY see guilds full of L70s sitting in line at Servelous hoping for a single green dragon scale?<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the dozens of mages lining up in SKa waiting for Quillmane?<br />
<br />
Actually, I wonder if the rogues will just have to type /claim and get their epic, in line with the difficulty of the kunark era one (/duck)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I find it funny that all the guildless people are discussing 'Hmm, will I get my epic?'<br />
<br />
In Kunark, they had to balance for the top players being in a fairly weak guild.... These days, they don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh no our epic is going to be a badass 1h with a shield that can transmute into a 2h =oooo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">None of the old epics are in any way challenging these days, making people do them would just be annoying.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind doing mine if I didn't have to go to plane of sky :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm pretty sure it won't require Epic 1.0. All that would do is create insane bottlenecks for TONS of older content, as single groups of Time geared people went and did it all for every non-epic'd character. There would be so much strife generated... Maybe the epic 1.0 could be used to skip a few steps, but I wouldn't do anything more than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So it sounds like logically, requiring epic 1.0 for the new ones wouldn't be the best way to go about this, would bottleneck people in boring farms, and in general piss off a lot of people.<br />
<br />
Yep, definitely looks like that's how SOE is gonna do it then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ThrokRock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Why not make the new epic mobs instanced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">given it says &quot;continue your epic journey&quot; or some such like i would say old epics will be used somehow in the quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">1 or 2 expansions ago, Epic v2 woulda been sweet.  Now it just looks like a marketing gimmick.<br />
<br />
Like someone in my guild said, raising the lvl cap is the greatest way to sell an expansion.  It is pretty much REQUIRED that you buy it if you intend to keep up with progression of people around you.  New expansion could consist of 1 zone, containing 1 npc who drops 1 item, and if the lvl raise is there, people will still buy it.<br />
<br />
It is blatantly obvious to me that EQ has simply become a cash cow.  God damn it, I jus got my Blade of War too!! :( :( :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Im all for those insain bottle necks, those of us that got off our ass and did it would get a head start at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I`ve had my epic 1.0 for years now. In the bank rotting. And no matter how long I play EQ, or how many upgraded weapons I get, I`ll always have the lightsabers in the bank. Why? Because it was a major accomplishment for me at the time. Was one of the most fofiling things I`ve ever done in EQ.<br />
 Anyone doing the 1.0 epic for on their main probably still will use it as an upgrade for a while.  And thats great.  It`s part of the progression of EQ. A right of passage so to speak. An end to a long hard journey, that ended with all your buds cheering you on, and giving you with that &quot;WOOT!&quot; feeling.<br />
<br />
 So now we`re getting epic 2.0. Now everyone has to rag on it before it is even implimented. Why? Wait and see. May be a fun challenging quest, and a hella weapon. Then again it may be in the bank in a year to rot next to 1.0. Hell, it may not even upgrade some at the top of the warrior heap atm. We`ll see soon. But I see no reason to say it`s the end of the world. Also, no one says you HAVE to do the quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You know, they could do both...have it be an entirely separate quest, but you could skip some painful (read: bottleneck) parts if you already have the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Come on guys. I hear people say they don't want to grind exp, and that theyre leaving for another MMORPG? Dude, youre gonna be grinding no matter what game you play.<br />
<br />
As far as epic 2.0 goes, if they just called it a weapon quest would you still be so pissy? Noone is forced to do it, ive never done my epic, and won't do this one unless it's worth it.<br />
<br />
OF COURSE EQ IS A CASH COW. Everquest has been a cash cow from the second Verant saw how many people played it. If you just realized this now slap yourself &gt;&lt;. I don't see why it's such a big deal that soe is profiting off the game when the content is still good, and most of the expansions have contained good content. PoP and GoD have both been pretty good aside from Uqua being buggy as hell, and GoD in general ticking certain classes off.<br />
<br />
The one thing I can say in annoyance to this expansion is that they're releasing it a little early. With an expected release of July 27th, its kinda cutting it close with GoD. At least wait until GoD has been finished by the topend guilds and isn't buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't understand why everyone always has to complain that theres going to be new content coming.. its obvious. You dont have control over what happends so even if you sit here and talk about how horrible its going to be it wont change anything and your making the situation worse for yourself. If you sit back and see it with an open mind it really isnt that bad.. i actually look forward to it. New levels, new AA and new spells mean faster kills and such in experiance spots in pop for instance.. therefor your getting faster exp =). Oh and whoever said &quot;65 is high enough&quot; ..... not when theres Lvl 77+ mobs in GoD zones and stuff. I personally see OoW like softcore player counter-part to GoD. but thats just me.. and im usually an idiot =P</div></div><hr />

Come on guys. I hear people say they don't want to grind exp, and that theyre leaving for another MMORPG? Dude, youre gonna be grinding no matter what game you play.<br />
<br />
Depends how you define *grind* ... standing in one place, pulling single after single, just to get another fricking AA point or level is a grind.  Roaming with a group over a map, or through a dungeon, for decent AA, XP, or crap, is a hunt.<br />
<br />
I know it's a grind when it feels like there's sand in the lubricant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">&quot;Grinding&quot; in other games is different because the content is new, its different, grinding in EQ for me is like playing levels of a FPS/RTS over and over that i've already beaten, but a new game is different, its fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In a recent forum discussion at EQLive, a tidbit was released that many were concerned about. The Kunark-era particle weapons (which will be referred to as &quot;Epic 1.0&quot; from here on out), will decidedly not be prerequisites for the new Epic 2.0 quests. Epic 2 will be an entirely new and different quest, and players will be able to possess both of their epics if they complete the two separate quests. <br />

<br />
<br />
I don't think I've ever played a single MMORPG where the best xp wasn't gained by standing in the same place pulling singles so yeah...I've never enjoyed slow xp, and roaming around was never my thing I dunno I'd rather do your definition of a grind than a hunt.  Coincidentally I hate LDoN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">With the number of places to xp nowadays, you have lots of options in how you xp.  If you like static camps pulling singles, there's plenty of places for that.  If you like fast paced pulling, there's lots of options.  If you like to crawl through a dungeon...plenty of places for that too.  They key is to not  confine yourself to the one or two &quot;best&quot; places and go do things you like.<br />
<br />
I tend to go to a lot of different zones because I get bored with the same old thing.  If we're in the same zone a lot and I start getting bored, I pull more mobs to make it more exciting and make sure the enchie is still awake.   ;) <br />
<br />
This game is so much bigger than it was that first year when there were only a few zones for each level range (remember the days of 80+ in Unrest  :p )...there's tons of content out there...go enjoy it!</div></div><hr />
