Thank you for this amazing input!<br />
<br />
Tell me, have you considered the druid class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i grouped with a warrior who insisted on rolling (and he won) on a ldon int aug because he wanted to be better at tradeskills. i guess maybe warrior do need int :) hey ill believe anything now that ive been shown that some warriors wish they had put their starting stats into charisma :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a 52 warrior who rolled on and won a CHA aug. Some discussion followed about whether it was a good idea for me to have rolled. So I let the bard have it, as it'll be a while before that particular warrior needs CHA.<br />
I've been very tempted before to roll on WIS stuff, lol, because I do tradeskills and I'd far rather have a WIS aug than AGI, heh. Still, I haven't been able to roll on WIS stuff with a straight face, so I don't do it.<br />
For once I'm proud of derailing a post, mwuhahahahha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally wish I had put my starting points into Cha.  Lab is an ogre and I put the points into str/sta which are useless to me now as they are trivial to cap unbuffed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Correct me if Im wrong, but long ago they changed the tradeskills so they would have other Stat checks depending on the class.<br />
Because it was idiotic that a warrior had to get INT gear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, CHA is useful, depending on your level of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some tradeskills have an alternate stat that can be used instead of wis/int. Smithing can use str, poison making and fletching can use dex, i think. But that is about the extent of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jamylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not all tradeskills have alternate stat chacks...blacksmithing has strength, make poision/fletching checks dex but none of the other ones do.</div></div><hr />
