<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been wondering. I am MT of my guild /w 8836hp/1447ac buffed.<br />
Currently we are undefeated when it comes to Raiding(Saryrn,Carpin,AD,3HoH Trials,MB,TZ,VZ,Grummus). For most mobs, Heal wheel keeps me up the entire fight, and I don't lose agro, so we maybe have 2kills a boss(Rampage/Rampage Healer). <br />
Now, My question is this. Given our record, do you think Agnarr, RZtWL, and Bert are within our 64person avg raid force? We all get along well, and know what we are doing. Just trying to get some feedback so Guild Leader/Raid Leader will decide to start doing these mobs, if you think its possible<br />
<br />
MT-8836/1447<br />
ST-8682/1453<br />
3t-8694/1420<br />
4t-8432/1542<br />
(Thats our Tank Wheel, but never gets below ST)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">neither of those fights are straight up MT encounter, so it's hard to say ,)<br />
<br />
just give it a try!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as the hp and ac you've listed for tankage it should be np.I tanked to elementals with less through those targets.As far as your raid force go's I can't say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my ranger , at 7600hp/1450ac tanked agnarr with 1 cleric and shaman spots... I think he did about 250-300dps on me... so you should have nada to worry bout for that.<br />
<br />
rztw does about 550-600dps if you keep the AC debuff off you. Only quads for 1k, and fake RZ seems to aeramp more then rztw. So, another pretty easy mob to tank. we used the same 3 second pause as we used to use for AoW.<br />
<br />
bertox brings the pain. 1700ac , defensive, he has consistantly put out 1150-1200 dps each time I've met up with him. you need to trust your clerics, five of them can keep you up on a tight 2.5sec perfect cho, but without disc you will die on a spike.<br />
<br />
Bertox is easily doable with 40-50. Agnarr 30. RZtW 50-60.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd strongly suggest looking into killing Seru for a BBB, 2handers are going to start getting appealing, and it may be a bit before RZ coughs up a Blade of War. (months for some) , especially for bertox. At least pick up some stormrider carapaces.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you're the MT - some ideas to get you past the 9k hump. hard ldon (EF) for haste cloak. Dain for 20ac/100hp belt. Hard BB for new boots. Warlord gloves from hard LDoN are awesome too, can't remember the theme they come from. Cloak, pick up the crinose werewolf, sooooooo cheap... there's a few hundred hp.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies.<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm planning on upgrading Very soon.. Will have a New Cloak if TT is nice to me, Tipt bracer very soon hopefully, and that will push me 9k+.<br />
<br />
IM trying my best to upgrade, but thanks for the responds guys =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">id think agnarr would do more than 250 dps, if i had to guesstimate id put him just under RZtW. quad 1k with AC debuff seems mostly equal to quad 1.4k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bert max hit is 1900's<br />
<br />
agnarr max hit is 1500's<br />
<br />
RZtWL max hit is 1000ish<br />
<br />
<br />
Bert will be dead before your defensive falls (or its most likely a wipe)<br />
RZtWL will be dead before your defensive falls (or its definitely a wipe)<br />
Agnarr will probably be around long enough to watch your defensive fall.<br />
<br />
A solid rotation on any of these and you'll be ok ... i seriously doubt you will see any of these 1-round an 8500+ warrior unless you get a maz round + ae + riposte (very unlikely).  You will be ok, just make sure you have a solid cheal chain.<br />
<br />
*the only hard part about bert is the event leading up to him<br />
*the only hard part about RZtWL is his adds<br />
*the only hard part about Agnarr is ... nothing ... he's a pussy.<br />
<br />
<br />
*PS- a secret with bert ... lead off with fortitude not furious.  All 4 times i have done him he like to ae rampage 2 or 3 times very quickly at the start of the fight.  Rampage hits through furious, so if youre counting on that 10 sec to get the chain running like most do, youre in for a nasty surprise when he triple ae ramps your ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tamov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">64 ppl is enuf to zerg down any of the mobs you listed above. None of them are overly demanding on the tank neither (not more so than RD for sure), so I d say all of them are doable, but your success will be highly depending on your leadership / past experience of the said encounter.<br />
<br />
As a side note, have you done tipt already detheb? I d imagine you d have a hard time tanking trash there, unless, of course, they changed it again in last patch. Not saying it is impossible to do...but some 9k /1.7 pallies do get teared up by the nocs / ra'tuk there, heh<br />
<br />
Tamov</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agnarr himself is a total joke, his difficulty comes from the entire event, so tanking him isn't a problem and your raid size is an overkill, which is good.<br />
<br />
Bert is an hour and half of fighting non-stop, which is fun the first time you do him, then it becomes almost mindless boredom, anyway Bertoxx himself is quite a punch, At almost 9k hp, you got a pretty good chance to die against him, i've seen a line of 9K+ tanks fall to him in a short period of time.  The good news is that he has pretty low HP.<br />
<br />
RZtW isn't really about the tank, its about the adds.  RZ himself isn't anything special in DPS, you could easily tank him.  The hard part is controlling the adds long enough to kill him, which is a short fight also.<br />
<br />
Ur raid size is plenty for all 3 events, i'd put MM inbetween agnarr and Bert, his melee DPS is medium, and his pain comes from his 3500 DD proc he likes to proc, which is resistable with 500 MR, but still lands enough to be a threat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah Bert sucks.I used furious with fast hard dps incoming last couple times.Agnarr takes awhile and the first few times we did RZTW my defensive dropped.If everything is going smooth with a good chain then yeah,Berts your only real tanking worry prolly.Too bad stuff often doesn't go smooth first couple times hehe. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agnarr is *mostly* slowable and drops down to like an adjusted delay of 2.8 or something stupidly high. Saryrn DPS pretty much.<br />
<br />
RZtW hits hard and fast and has ungodly attack and an AC debuff , a quick remedy for a dead tank w/o solid clerics..<br />
<br />
and since when has Bertoxxulous's single target rampage been AE ramp? it's single target :P discs are laggy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well. I have done all the encounters so far(I am Ele Flagged)...<br />
<br />
Tamov, no offense, but a comment about zerging coming from someone in Fusion..<br />
<br />
And no, actually I havn't tank Tipt due to the fact I've been raiding almost non-stop for the past 3weeks or so when I log on. But, I really wanna give it a try =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bert will be dead before your defensive falls (or its most likely a wipe) <br />
<br />
bert has 500k hp which isnt that low, dont expect to kill him before disc wears off for your first time<br />
<br />
<br />
RZtWL will be dead before your defensive falls (or its definitely a wipe)<br />
Agnarr will probably be around long enough to watch your defensive fall. <br />
<br />
not necissarily, we've never killed him while my defensive was up but we always killed him between the time of my defensive going down and the next wave spawning, if 4th wave spawns youre most likely dead<br />
<br />
<br />
A solid rotation on any of these and you'll be ok ... i seriously doubt you will see any of these 1-round an 8500+ warrior unless you get a maz round + ae + riposte (very unlikely).  You will be ok, just make sure you have a solid cheal chain. <br />
<br />
max damage ever done to me i think was bert with an 8.3 round so no he cant 1 round a 8.5+ tank but if he gets one of those rounds off unless theres a heal coming quick he will get you next round<br />
<br />
<br />
*PS- a secret with bert ... lead off with fortitude not furious.  All 4 times i have done him he like to ae rampage 2 or 3 times very quickly at the start of the fight.

<br />
its not AE ramp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shouldn't be getting hit with berts ramp if you're MA heh.  I always thought it was single target ramp.  Sort of offtopic but uh I forget if ramp/flurry work like weapon procs(can proc on miss) or innate procs(must hit).  Guessing like weapon procs since I use fort instead of furious on flurry mobs on inc due to them stilly flurrying through but I thought I remembered on the kyv named in Tipt not having to deal with him ramping when WS/furious was going.  Maybe I wasn't paying attention though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Almost postitive it's ae rampage... and bert has always died in under 3 minutes for both my guild and all pickups i've done on him.</div></div><hr />

Try it. You will then know what you need to adjust and what areas you may need to improve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bertox is single target rampage.  Start with Furious on the MT and Fortitute on the RT the moment he is pulled into camp (and he has a huge ass melee range and hit box, so be careful).  Bertox has pretty lowish hp (~600k), but makes up for it with some nasty, nasty damage output.  (~1100dps)<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek is the AE Rampager, although his melee isn't all that vicious (500-600dps).  He does have a crazy AC debuff though called Sedition, which makes most of his hits land for near max.  Still, even with the debuff, his DPS isn't what makes the fight difficult.  He's got around 1.2 million (or more) hitpints, as well as an army behind him to take care of.  :)<br />
<br />
Lord Mithanniel Marr is a bit in between, having high damage output (850-1000dps melee + proc damage) and high hitpints (1.3+ million).  It's a straight shot MT fight though with no [real] rampage or AE rampage to worry about.  Just gotta kill him before his room repops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Apoylon it's not ae ramp.You gotta set single target rampage on him or risk some serious damage bouncing down through the raid.I don't remember the numbers,but,for the content he seemed to have the hardest single target ramp we had seen up to that point.The first time you do him can be tough need a lot of healing on 2 tanks...more than your used to.Get the rt to tag and though I haven't done it slapping on fortitude for the rt might not be a bad idea to avoid getting greased on engage.<br />
<br />
I've used furious every time I've ma'd him,but, we usually go hard outa the box and get him down fast.A lot of healing for a guild seeing him for the first time.<br />
<br />
PS. guess it could seem like ae ramp if it's not set with all the dead people lying around you hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tamov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tamov, no offense, but a comment about zerging coming from someone in Fusion...<br />
<br />
Hehe I can't tell my guildies not to log on for EP minis using &quot;we have enough already&quot; as an excuse. We don't really zerg alot more than other EP guilds tho, ~50 is what we have normally, unless some flagging god pops for us and 30 guildies would pop out from nowhere all in a sudden...<br />
<br />
Anyways, the &quot;zerg&quot; word I used was not meant to describe the nature of your raid. It was merely a verb that exaggerated the overkill nature of using 64 raiders on the said encounter, thus pointing out you should have no problem with those targets. I apologize if you took offense.<br />
<br />
And good luck with tipt.<br />
