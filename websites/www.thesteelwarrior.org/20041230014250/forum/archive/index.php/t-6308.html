<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there we were, post-patch after Uqua got tuned and we figured we'd give it another shot.  Going along fine, but kept having issues at the 2nd trap.  Could not hold aggro for shit.  Clerics/druids were constantly getting summoned/killed off of healing aggro.  Had a real hard time locking down the aggro on any of the mobs, which as you can guess makes handling the traps very difficult.  Anyone else noticing the same thing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a seperate issue. Rydaa Dar is too big,  AE taunt rarely hits.<br />
<br />
Shael isn't talking about getting agro, he's talking about holding agro.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't pull mobs off them for shit tonight, Had a Tm mob locked down was at 60% and summoned my healer =/  .  No clue whatsup with it right now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't really notice any aggro issues, but we did have some other very bad issues.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek in time, who was cornered, fell through the floor or something, and summoned the tank who was then ported to the graveyard.  That caused us actually to wipe since he also then leashed.  Second run however things went fine.<br />
<br />
On Quarm, there were major line of sight issues and he seemed to have problems even moving around in his cave.  We spent like three minutes being completely unable to attack him or cast on him because he was partially in a wall.  Note that he had no problem whatsoever attacking us!<br />
<br />
Someone said that he poofed entirely on another server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still alot of healing issues, lots of warping/pathing issues.  Our MT in Uqua found himself getting ported to the zone in from mobs summoning him into walls, and reportedly this happened with other guilds as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raargh</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not only aggro and line of sight are bugged<br />
<br />
we did arbitor yesterday, and everytime we pushed it on a tilted ground it started to warp all over the place, or reappear at bind point freeze there for 5 seconds then warp back on us<br />
<br />
anyone have had this problem with another mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aggro is a mess, aggro procs seem to proc similar to jolt.  Doing ikkinz 4 last nite i couldnt keep aggro on trash mobs, unless i flipped out an eb weapon for plankton, which is the only noneb weapon i have.  It was pretty fucked, we ended up calling raid because noone would hold aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minet</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was worried things like this would happen, when putting anger augs on my weapons.<br />
<br />
i hope it doesnt come to light that  150 DD/stun augs are more aggro productive than an anger 3 aug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We didn't have any more problems than usual in Uqua as far as agro is concerned.  It is just that clerics are throwing heals around like crazy and it is easy to have one of the five trap mobs that spawn be untanked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In BoT last night the giants were summoning the cleric and shaman in my group constantly. In fact, pets were getting summoned as well after being told to back off.<br />
<br />
And the pathing is totally screwed up. I was in SS and pulled a giant from right outside MSR and instead of following me he ran thru MSL then came out the opposite side where our group was. Luckily all the other giants were down or we would have had a nice train.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had alot of aggro problems in storms last night.  A good example was while clearing trash to make room to pull named giants, we had a scorpion mezzed.  Incite, assist mob, target is cleric, taunt, assist mob, target is cleric, taunt again, assist mob, target is cleric.......2 incites and many taunts later, mez fades, mob makes a beeline for the cleric.  Took several procs to get it off.  This wasnt true every time, but much of the time line of sight and proximity for aggro purposes seemed completely borked.  Lot's of summoning of casters went on the whole night.  (most were non fatal thankfully)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the route I'm going.  But my situation is different than a full guild raid pumping out aggro to compete with.  I've just got 9 other characters to worry about is all (only group with RL friends now adays).  So I can't say for sure if it's more aggro than Anger or not.  But flipping the mobs head-wise, it's the same in my particular situation at least.<br />
<br />
The 179DD 0sec stun and 75dd 0sec stun on the Copper Hammer and Bloodsworn have turned the mob to me every single time they've ever proced.  I can't remember a single time I've seen that proc go off and the mob &quot;not&quot; turn to me.  For me, in our little band of characters, the extra damage would be stupid not to take.  The procs even turn the mobs off of my Darkness-happy casting SK friend, whom seems to have forgotten all about his ability to feign nowadays... which usually takes a successful tuant followed by incite to get aggro from normally (piggy backing off his aggro).<br />
<br />
Does anyone have &quot;two&quot; 125DD 0sec stun Yak procs in their inventory on some weapons?  I threw two cheap, crappy procs on the swords for now till I'm ready to get the Yak procs (50dd and 75dd).  I couldn't put two 75dd procs on is why I'm asking.  They're lore.  Won't let me have more than one.  Anyone know if the Yak procs are the same way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I could not buy another yak proc of the same kind (the 510 point 100 dd/stun one) for one of my 1handers because I already had one on my gaudralek in my bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xexe xexe</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just about to make a thread about this until I saw this post.  I have tanked in BoT several times before and never had a problem with holding aggro (even before I had BoC).  However, tonight I could not hold aggro for the life of me.  The necro got summoned on almost every single mob and sometimes the BL would snag aggro and the mob would not turn back to me regardless of the number of successful taunts I got off.  Very frustrating to say the least and I hope they plan on fixing it.</div></div><hr />

Lotta collision warping... especially bad on Bert today.I was constantly punted away from the mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lost real RZ into the wall on Saturday morning, same thing.  Lost 2 tanks to falling under the world before we could get him pulled out.<br />
<br />
Lost one of the Avatar of Dust ring spiders on Saturday evening when it warped under the world and started summoning the raid.</div></div><hr />

Damn, was afraid of that.  Looks like I'm getting the 125dd and 100dd ones then.</div></div><hr />
