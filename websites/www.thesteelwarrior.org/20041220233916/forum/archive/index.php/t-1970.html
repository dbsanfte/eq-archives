<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sykeya</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering about the following:<br />
<br />
Which of these 4 Elemental Gods do you NEED a 2h like BoW for ?<br />
<br />
Fennin Ro<br />
Xegony<br />
Coirnav<br />
Avatar of Earth<br />
<br />
And also does anyone have some data on the amount of riposts these do ? as in % of attacks maybe ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of those like solinar said none need BoW but fennin and xeg are the only 2 that a BoW would have serious impact on since basically no one tanks coir and AoEarth isnt very hard and if i recall has a huge deagro???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do not need a BoW to succeed in PoP.<br />
<br />
While the BoW is probably the best overall package<br />
(insane dps, decent proc rate, low ripostes, nice ac/hp).<br />
It is not needed.<br />
<br />
I have a BoW, i would probably trade it for BF/HG/Aegis combo<br />
to be more efficient when disc drops, but its not that much of a gain.<br />
<br />
BoW is the ultimate weapon before Time, but its not a requirement for sucess.<br />
<br />
Ps : As for ripostes ...<br />
A good CH line is pop is designed around healing the MT for 40% hp.<br />
Aka when i get a CH over 4k, i know there was something wrong.<br />
Either some lag, a fizzle, or a bad round.<br />
1 riposte will not make any difference on a normal round.<br />
<br />
Take a normal Xegony/Fenin hell even Raperm fight.<br />
How many CH have you gotten over 7-8k and lived to tell the tale.<br />
Almost none. Maybe one or two once in a while.<br />
<br />
The reason is simple, once you go above the 8K CH mark<br />
You are into the danger zone, at that point 1 hit will kill you.<br />
Which is often the case, thus explaining the very few 7-8k CHes<br />
<br />
If 5% of the CHes you take are above 7k-8k.<br />
Lets say the dual wield riposte rate is 7% (compared to 5% with a BoW)<br />
<br />
You have a meager 5%x7%=0.0035.<br />
 <br />
Thats a lousy 0.35% chances of dying to riposte dmg when dual wielding.<br />
While that number is 0.25% with a bow.<br />
<br />
Its so minimal nowdays the impact should barely be parsable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the big &quot;stink&quot; about PoP ripostes came within the first few months of release in experience groups were CH chains weren't used.  In the first few months of release mobs were riposting in exp groups ALOT more then normal and 2hs became the new defacto in order to try to cut down on the absurd amount of riposte dmg generated.  Later PoP exp mobs were re tuned but the perception of ripostes and the good DPS of 2handers stayed.<br />
<br />
/scratches her head<br />
<br />
If I recall correcty, I'm getting old :/<br />
<br />
BTW, it still makes me giggle when I fight a level 64 mob that doesn't enrage in PoP then go to old worlds and the lvl 56 mobs enrage :P</div></div><hr />

Ripostes on the other hand, those will mess you up.<br />
