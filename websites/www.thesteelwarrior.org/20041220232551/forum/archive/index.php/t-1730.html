Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game.  Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are.  Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time.<br />
This section will be a little sparse right now.  We're still ironing out priority lists and such, and we'll be back to update this with more information soon.<br />
<br />
Items in the Planes of Power<br />
We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate.  Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed:<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Plane of Innovation<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />
Shields and blocking<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.  We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.  We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.<br />
<br />
New Zones<br />
Both Live and Legends server will be seeing more zone revamps and even a few new zones.  It's a little early to talk about the details of these zones, or even which zones we'll be working on, but the team is looking at some very interesting ideas for places to revamp and perhaps adding a few new free zones.<br />
<br />
 <br />
FYI, that was the future plans for june :<br />

Lets not only think about the uber warriors lets talk about the whole population as a whole.</div></div><hr />

Unless you mean improving taunt through more damage, I don't see where you got this from.</div></div><hr />
