Pretty sure taunt mods do absolutely nothing for warriors. 230 is apparently the cap, and you're at it...</div></div><hr />

The software cap for all skills seems to be 255 so it may do something. Weither that effect is noticable is another question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way, it's a direct mod to s specific skill. In the same way as +kick boots effect only the kick skill, a taunt mod would effect only the taunt skill. Meaning a very slight increase in success when you press the taunt hotkey, and nothing more. It would not add any raw hate to taunting, not would it effect hate generated by procs or anything else, just like a +kick mod wouldn't effect attack speed or mainhand dps. They're simply not connected in any way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And no this mob had no way of proccing a deaggro, it was just a common trash mob.<br />
<br />
So maybe just maybe, this mod has more effect then we actually think, could it be, they made something worth a crap? :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All skills have a hard-coded cap of 252, so the 10% taunt mod would put you there (actually 253, if it weren't for the hard cap). What that taunt mod should theoretically do (based on some of the descriptions for taunt on this board) is increase taunt's success rate. And only that.<br />
<br />
How much of an increase the mod provides, however, is anyone's guess. Most skill mods do very little; an example, from a cleric's perspective since I play one, would be the 8% mod to Specialize Alteration on the Elemental BP. All it does is reduce the mana cost of all alteration spells by a sliver: 1.8%.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine your taunt mod basically does the same; increase the success rate of the specific skill, but by too low an amount to actually make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is perfectly possible that a skill is coded to stop improving after a certain point.  No skills go higher than 255 (or was it 252?) but it doesn't mean they can stop giving benefits much earlier than that.  SoE has stated that the game consider the warrior max (230) as the highest anyone can get for purposes of taunt success.  Therefore any value over 230 is still treated just like 230, at least until they change the system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience, vs. exp mobs, +10% taunt does increase the chance of taunt being successful.  Without doing a test, I'm 90% confident that it is helpful.  I guess I'll finally just have to do that damned test to become 100% confident.  I realize what absor and SOE has said, but I also realize that they don't test their own game, they rely on us to do it.  I did test it briefly vs. a green guard mob in east commons that shouts when taunted.  I was surprised to find that taunt was still only successful approximately the same ammount as on level 65 exp mobs.  I will try to do an hour long test on him (one hour with +taunt, one hour without) soon.  Some will dispute that &quot;you will not interfear with me&quot; does not indicate a successful taunt, but surely it at least indicates something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The source of this was a remark in a Q and A session in a Fan Faire (Vegas I believe) by a dev.  In a nutshell, the dev was asked about taunt skill increases, and he responded with &quot;mobs are tuned for 230 taunt now, so any increase wouldn't really have any effect&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with the changes on test... ie Taunt Failure message...<br />
<br />
This should be now possible to test and parse the effectiveness of these taunt mods...<br />
<br />
I am just hoping we can filter the taunt message well... Because I am sure gonna post a screenshot of the next time I taunt 23 times in a row + AOE taunt and still not get successfull Aggro.. Soon  the butterfly-bitch will die..!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carrot</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It dates back further than Vegas Fanfaire, the 230 limit was uncovered back in like the Abashi era.  I don't remember if Gordon posted it on the EQ Dev boards when they still existed or if it was on a FF transcript somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a small test.  It appears I was quite wrong in my perceptions, hate when that happens!  In a one hour test vs. green guard tolus in east commonlands (who shouts &quot;i'll teach you to interfear with me&quot; presumably on a successful taunt), I tested with and without a +10% taunt mod.  This is a low sample size, but big enough to convince me that +10% taunt isn't useful, much to my disappointment.<br />
<br />
Control: 161 successful taunts out of 262 attempts or 61%.<br />
<br />
+10% taunt mod: 130 successful taunts out of 207 or 63%.<br />
<br />
Clearly in at least an hour of constant taunting, there was basically no benefit to the +10% taunt.  Is it not also quite disheartening that even on extremely green mods, taunt is only ~ to 60% success?  That is pretty messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh that's a 2% increase! Did you actually expect it to make a noticable/useful difference?  <br />
<br />
All of the skill mods which are 8%, 10%, etc only give about a 1-1.8% improvement in the skill they alter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zoriouz</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lmao Splak!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I expected a noticible difference.  My impression was that it was significantly better.  &lt;3 RNG<br />
<br />
That 2% difference is hardly valid with such a small sample size.  A taunt mod is useless at least at the expense of any hps/stats.</div></div><hr />

These are with Boots of Despair equipped. I have no idea if the boots are affecting my success rate or not as I was simply looking for what kind of success rate I had in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But after at least 2 real tests have been completed.  <br />
<br />
The Conclusion:<br />
<br />
10% Taunt Mod adds 1-2% more Taunt Successes for Warriors!<br />
<br />
I would be interested to see this data for SK/Paladins.  I'd be willing to guess that they would gain well over 2% more successes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladin/SK taunt skill caps at 230 as well?  If so why would there be any variation?  <br />
<br />
Taunt seems to have an intentionally low success rate.. now they need to make spells only transfer hate to NPCs at the same rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but Pal/SK aren't capped (without mod) at the same # as Warriors.  Theirs at 65 is 220.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">10% Taunt Mod adds 1-2% more Taunt Successes for Warriors!<br />
<br />
 I'm no statistician, but seems to me 1.1% variance is well within the acceptable variance range for these test sizes. A single fail/success in one of those tests can sway the final number almost .5%.<br />
<br />
 Good tests, but as always need a lot more=/ I don't think you'll get any real accurate/reliable difference with less than 1000 taunts both ways. And I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. Unless you can macro it I guess then just fire up the log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't macro it :(<br />
<br />
I tried.  <br />
<br />
If you do not miss 1 single second on taunt refreshes, it takes 1.7 hours to taunt 1000 times.  That means the test would take 3.4 hours of non-stop taunting on the same mob in a non-group/non-combat situation.  But after I spent about 3 hours smashing the taunt key just to get a 200/200 test, there's no fucking way I was doing more that day.<br />
<br />
And beyond that, with 2 tests done that both show a 1-2% gain, statistical variation or not, I'm satisfied that the results are valid.  <br />
<br />
Which also can be translated to:<br />
<br />
I'm very annoyed that the Taunt mod on Time Loot is USELESS!!!.</div></div><hr />
