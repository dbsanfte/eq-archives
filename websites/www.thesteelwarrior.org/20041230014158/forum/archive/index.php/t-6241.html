<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings.<br />
<br />
I consider myself very well versed in how aggro works in EQ, but there are many on this forum that know far more. Lately a guildie asked me a question that I found I couldn't answer.<br />
<br />
Countless times have I pulled a caster mob with tash/slow, and rune tanked it for a few seconds before the tank (or my charm pet in some cases) has gained aggro. At that point I have stepped away a few steps, and everything has been dandy. However, for some reason, the next time the mob has decided to cast anything, it has decided to cast on me, and immediately after the spell has landed the mob has returned to beating on the tank. This happens far more often with a charm pet tanking than it does with a real player tank, presumably because the aggro difference is much smaller.<br />
<br />
My initial thought is that when it comes to casting spells, the NPC ignores aggro bonuses such as proximity, and thus chooses the person with the highest raw aggro. There could be other factors causing this too though. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any exact info on the cause of this? It could be quite helpful on some encounters like TZ, where he seemingly nukes random people.<br />
<br />
Entharion Sweettalker<br />
Enchanter of &lt;Nordlys&gt;<br />
Venril Sathir<br />
<br />
EDIT: Editted subject line to say 'cast on' rather than 'nuke', since after some discussion I realised this is primarily an issue with debuffs rather than nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs begin to cast spells on the PC, which is agro right at that moment. During his casting, he cannot change his target. Right after the spell is out, he switches to the PC he is agro on. EG: NPC casts a 6sek casttime spell on the ench. Warrior lands a successful taunt after 3 secs, the NPC keeps casting his spell till it lands and swithes to the warrior right after it is out.  <br />
<br />
Expections are random debuffs like malo / mala / tash / (root?) which NPCs usually cast on any PC in his range / agro range. The order of pcs he casts his spells on may depend on their position in his agro list but i dont really know ;p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throag</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that it has to do with the AI change they made a long while ago.<br />
When it comes do casting spells, NPC behave completely differently than when meleeing, for instance, I have very often noticed that even though I had aggro on a mob, the mob would turn around all the people in his aggro list to debuff them (malo etc) and then come back beating me.<br />
<br />
This might just be coded that way and being completely independant to aggro. Just my 2 coppers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think proximity is a big part of it.  I have also noticed that mobs that can tash or slow will often recast those spells if someone gets cured of the effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I play a bard and warrior in groups, ive seen times where I pull with bard, tanking and mobs at like half life and I obviously have aggro locked, and the mob will turn around and start casting something. I /assist the mob and it returns the name of the warrior, but when i tab over to bard i  get the &quot;you resisted such and such spell&quot; or whatever.<br />
<br />
I could never really explain it other than that mobs will cast on whoever the F they want to sometimes. Usually, its like root or snare or something on the bard. There is absolutely 0 chance, none, at all that the bard overaggroed the warrior- at all. Bards are coded to generate dick for aggro. So.. I dont know the answer to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elerion</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am well aware that mobs will continue casting on the original target even if aggro list changes during the casting Buuh, but that was not the issue here.<br />
<br />
Everything else mentioned sounds very likely, and is likely the result of the casting AI patch way back. Thinking about it, the spells I recieve in this manner are always debuffs of some kind, with Malo, Root and various DoTSnares (Darkness, Insidious Retrogression) being most common. I can't remember being outright nuked in this manner. I guess it can be assumed that aggro never actually shifts away from the tank, but the mob debuffs others on aggro list anyway. It might work off a list similar to rampage, debuffing people in the order they entered the aggro list. <br />
<br />
This still doesnt explain TZ's apparently random single nuking though, but I guess that might just be random *shrug*<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

This would make sense but I have a hard time believing that you are still on top of the hate list since proximity is a pretty small factor in aggro.  I haven't personally noticed this happening, but it's definitely odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cast aggro list is very very similar to rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like the guy above said, cast list is similar to rampage, but not completely the same (they can still cast on the person they're aggroed, whereas you never get hit by rampage if you're on top of aggro list).  Still, a rampage list can roughly approximate the order you can expect people to get cast on.<br />
<br />
Also certain spells like Malo or Tash the AI is smart enough to know who already has it so they will always cast it on someone else no matter how much aggro you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had groups in Tactics where a Daiku would aggro on me, malo me, then take turns maloing every person in the group (without hitting them with melee at all). The mob would then focus his attention back on me again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's quite simple.<br />
<br />
Mobs like to debuff people who are lower on the hate list.<br />
<br />
The mob always faces the person it is casting on.  BUT, if you assist the mob at that point, you will STILL get the player that is at the top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
Debuff spells include roots, snares, malo, slows, mezzes, AE versions of these spells, and many dots.  Any of these might be cast on people who are lower on the hate list.  But from what I have seen, mobs save their pure damage spells for the person who's at the top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
So don't fret if a caster mob turns away from you to cast something.  That's just the mob AI trying to stir things up.  Assist it, and you will still get yourself on target.  You're still at the top of the hate list.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my first character was a hunter ranger.  he would get nuked by stuff all the time after he got archery mastery 3 and was pumping out more dmg than the other people in the groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
dmg output has a lot to do with random swapping of targets to cast/nuke/slow etc.  not just aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-21-2004, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">best part is sometimes you can lock a mob into debuff mode and and kill it with little to no mob melee time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know it's a far-out theory, but it sure seems that casting NPCs use like a ghetto rampage system for who they're casting spells on.  ie; if I pull a mob with tash and then the warrior gets aggro, but the mob will always turn to tash/malo/root me.  I'm almost positive that it doesn't do it to anyone else besides the guy on &quot;invisible rampage&quot; or the person with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was camping C3 in ssra for pieces.  Pulled that named there that has the huge knockback AE.  Cornered him perfect and he was knocking people into the corner.  Middle of fight he spins around to root someone and decides to AE.  Everyone beating on him gets launched into adds.<br />
<br />
This sucks with mobs that have a knockback AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can tell, it's a fairly simple crowd control rule.  If there are multiple players on the hate list, then the mob will try to crowd control the people who are lower on the hate list.  I've never seen any particular order to it, I think it's random.<br />
<br />
No matter what, if you /assist the mob, you still get the person who's at the top of the hate list, and that's the person that the mob is trying to hurt.  The other malo/slow/snare/root/mez/blind/charm spells are just its attempt to perform crowd control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues typically take time to get into position.  By the time they are on the hate list, the MT is on it, the puller, and maybe some of the debuffers/pet classes.<br />
<br />
My experience has been that, with debuffing spells, the mob goes in order of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of wierd AI.  Here's an odd thing I've noticed over the years.  This one just yesterday:<br />
<br />
The Anniversery skellies in Butcherblock:<br />
Here I am, standing at the LDoN camp with my two gnomes /following the barbarian.  The skeletons attacked the cleric EVERY TIME.  I was closer to the skelly, saw it coming for me, then it changes direction for the cleric instead.  Completely passes me (undead usually go on who's closest).<br />
<br />
So I did a test.  Saw a skelly way off in the distance.  *Pluck*.  Half the skeletons HPs from my arrow.  He's pissed and coming for me.  Then he blows by me and attacks the cleric again.  Completely ignoring the fact that I just cut him in half with an arrow.  He wanted that cleric.<br />
<br />
The cleric was not sitting at any time during any of this.  I had him standing and on auto follow.<br />
<br />
Seems to me, some mobs can be programmed to go after certain classes first... but it's a rare occurance in Norrath.  I haven't seen very many types of mobs that do this.  A few is all.<br />
<br />
Karnor's basement:<br />
No matter how much aggro we had, no matter who was sitting down in that room, the skeletons there smacked the druid once to stand him up.  Every single pull.  The wizard and cleric are &quot;sitting&quot; right there next to him, but the druid is the only one that ever got stood up, every time.  The mobs would run past other sitting down characters to get at the druid.  This example is different in that the druid is indeed sitting.  This can be expected that the mob would blow by standing people to hit the sitting one.  But not expected that it would run past other sitting people to get at the same sitting person every single time we pulled.  Poor druid could never med the entire hunt there.  They'd stand him up every time, even if we brought a mob in that was already half dead from cleavings in the hallway.  The druid was also higher level than the wizard, so it wasn't a level thing.<br />
<br />
I can't explain it other than they must have programmed some mobs to hate certain classes more than others.</div></div><hr />
