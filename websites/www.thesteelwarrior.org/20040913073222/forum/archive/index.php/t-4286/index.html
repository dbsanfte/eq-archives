There are two threads on vbuletin discussing this issue, one dealing with vie, and one with the stand down in general.  After a few reactionary calls for vie nerf over here, the cleric board started discussing how much of an effect vie actually had.  Go figure we were discussing one of our own spells and if it was or was not a problem.  The other thread discusses the stand down, and for the most part people see the melee plight.  <br />
<br />
Kaesorn, posting edged comments like this will do little to help the cause, and are more likely to alienate people.  I felt slightly insulted by the statment because honestly, while vie is nice, it's not some super end all be all save all spell.... If I thought for a second that nerfing it would fix any or all strait melee balance issues, I'd be the first one crying for it's nerf.</div></div><hr />

/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
I stand by my statement.  I never said that clerics don't care, I said they care more about people calling for BoV to be nerfed than about the warrior issue.  If you don't like I said that, then go ahead and flame away, see if I care that you feel I've insulted clerics.  Almost half of the warrior thread's 48 posts is the argument between me and another poster.  Yet the Vie thread's 75 posts is filled with people having defensive reactions about nerfing BoV, with maybe 10 being about warriors.  A few on there aren't having defensive reactions, giving info or asking a question.  I see more interest in the Vie thread, obviously.<br />
<br />
Like I said &quot;At least clerics will be happy to know BoV wasn't used.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seeing that Clerics had their Mark of Karn line spells nerfed hard after it came out, I wouldn't be surprised if they worried about the BoVie getting nerfed as well.<br />
<br />
Nobody likes their stuff getting whittled down.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd also hope BoVie does not get touched, while they look more into improving us than nerfing others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BoV isn't a problem.... boV isn't THE problem...<br />
<br />
AO monk tanked Time Terris/Saryrn without BoV.   BoV isn't what's enabling this to occur, it really is itemization and class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BoV isn't what's enabling this to occur<br />
<br />
Well, actually, it is.  It's one of the cleric buffs which enable this to occur.  You show me someone who's tanking in Time - be they warrior, paladin, monk, or anything else - and I'll show you someone who has cleric buffs.<br />
<br />
Virtue/Kazad make it possible for a pally to tank Quarm by making it less likely that the pally will be one-rounded.  Does that mean that Virtue or Kazad should be nerfed?<br />
<br />
The same applies to BoV.<br />
<br />
Rather than a nerf, you could more reasonably ask for a warrior-only buff like Symbol but with an extra 500hp, and a warrior-only Vie-type spell that absorbs more damage.<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day, warrior problems don't spring from cleric buffs, and the answer to warrior problems doesn't really lie in nerfing or enhancing cleric buffs.<br />
<br />
Changes to either the knight classes or the warrior class are necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uthuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I stand by my statement. I never said that clerics don't care, I said they care more about people calling for BoV to be nerfed than about the warrior issue.<br />
<br />
Of course Clerics care more about people calling nerf on BoV than warrior issues. Bov regards the class while the warrior issues are a completely different issue.<br />
<br />
Sympathy yes, more important than their own class hell no.<br />
<br />
To even question that is pretty naive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Scary enough, a monk tanked PoTime Saryrn and TT without BoV, on a warrior CH rot. Check out the AO homepage for details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BoV is fine, it's itemization that is screwed up, as usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, it's both.  They should change ALL the buff spells so that tanks in general, and warriors specifically get more hps from them than other classes.  Maybe make them give you an increase that is a percentage of your unbuffed HP total.  That in itself would go a long way towards fixing things.  Before I got my Helanic Tundra armor, it was not uncommon for wizards in the groups I was in to have about the same HPs as me if they had virtue and I had a lower level cleric buff, and my gear then was not great but it wasnt terrible either.   Changing the spells would help, but it wouldnt help nearly as much as revamping all the knightemization problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This idea is not the answer . You dont fix a problem by making another class supplement a warrior's hp/ac to compensate for poor itemization. Warriors have alot of key issues that need to be addressed but calling for nerfs to more than one class in order to fix that issue also isnt the answer.<br />
<br />
The real problem is warriors have not scaled with the game as much as the other classes.<br />
<br />
Having played a cleric to 65(time enabled post quarm) and a warrior to 52 i know somewhat about the issues surrounding the standdown but lack the proper knowledge about what exactly the answer needs to be end game, and thats ok for me because eventually when my war gets to a level to participate in higher level raids ill know exactly what your talking about; But for now, ill just continue reading and participate where my opinion as a cleric matters.<br />
<br />
I dont want to hijack this thread but as i said above making specific buffs just for warriors is teh suck. I like the fact i can mgb 1 spell every 1.5~ hours and be done with buffing everyone, aside from the normal rebuff/rez buff situation its a tedious task to continually have to buff people with different items. Calling for additional spells to buff just the warriors is just that much more work. Fix the core of the class, not supplement it by means of another class.<br />
<br />
As for BoV? Ive yet to get it. I probably will to appease the requirements of a raid cleric but i really see no point. Of the guilds ive raided with we havent used it that much, Xegony/Quarm comes to mind but the for runner of Tanks im supporting during an encounter such as that are Warriors, not Knights or Monks.<br />
<br />
Annnyways.. im a rambling idiot so ill just shutup now :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its funny, That is exactly what every single paladin has said about their aggro lock and tanking ability.  So forgive me if Im rude when I say thats a load of &quot;$$%@!&quot;  :)  I rarely ever see a class point out a skill or spell of theirs that's truly overpowered.  In this case BoV isnt the problem, its what everyone has already mentioned.<br />
<br />
EDIT: My splling and Gramar is the suckh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;After a few reactionary calls for vie nerf over here, the cleric board started discussing how much of an effect vie actually had. &quot;<br />
<br />
Check out AO's website again, this time PART V of the who needs warriors.<br />
<br />
Note it's a monk tanking. Note Vie is NOT used.<br />
<br />
Thus, the effect vie is actually having is certainly questionable.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Doesn't change the fact that warriors have no role outside of tanking, and that it's becoming clear that role is more and more useless every day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Leave cleric bashing to paladins. They have a long history of it, much practice, and will do it better than warriors ever could. Remember the hammer? Days after it came out PoN had parses proving it outdamaged prinal 2-handers or something ridiculous like that.<br />
<br />
Clerics are a good class and one of the few left that, by and large, don't mind and actually like grouping with warriors. And BoV isn't overpowered and doesn't need a nerf; if monks can tank time bosses without it, where exactly is the problem with the spell?<br />
<br />
Oh, and this quote, that's just ridiculous:<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, actually, it is. It's one of the cleric buffs which enable this to occur. You show me someone who's tanking in Time - be they warrior, paladin, monk, or anything else - and I'll show you someone who has cleric buffs.<br />

<br />
The same applies to BoV.<br />
<br />
<br />
This guy is saying that BoV enabled that monk to tank Time even though he DID NOT HAVE THE BUFF UP, because he had virtue? Like a warrior will tank in PoT unbuffed in his place. Virtue and BoV are totally unrelated aside from the fact that they're both cleric spells. Calling for a BoV nerf because someone had virtue on too is like calling for a nerf to ranger tracking because they have forage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sow enabled you to outrun that mob!&quot; &quot;But I didn't have sow up...&quot; &quot;You had skin like steel, didn't you?&quot; &quot;Yeah, so?&quot; &quot;Well, it's a druid buff just like sow, so sow helped you escape!&quot; &quot;/groan&quot;</div></div><hr />

Thank you for making me chuckle.<br />

That was a classic one right there.<br />

<br />
Not that it has anything to do with warriors, or EQ in general. Shiikari will ban me now ;)</div></div><hr />
