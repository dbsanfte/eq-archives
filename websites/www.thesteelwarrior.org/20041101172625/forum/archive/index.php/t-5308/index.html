<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I been sticking with my same family guild for going on 4 years.<br />
<br />
We only have 15 or so people on at a time. I don't generate cash at all. (No Bazaar items in my future)<br />
<br />
I have been on/led  raids up to elemental planes, but don't ever believe I will be upgrading weapons via this route.<br />
<br />
I currrently have dual aug'd (Ykesha and Anger II) CHOS and SOTB, plus a SoD someone lent me.<br />
<br />
I have a GSOT and Some stupid 2HP (yah, yah I know, it was free) weapon I use when I dont want any agro at all. (never got WMBS).<br />
<br />
I know we are close to being able to kill that joker in BoT towers for a GSo4W with just my guild friends.<br />
<br />
I really, really, really want a 41/31 Ratio weapon with 75 DD and Anger III to be better agro than anything previously mentioned.<br />
<br />
Do you all think it will be?<br />
<br />
Jakle<br />
<br />
Gotta set my expectations here. Just don't want to be let down :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Edit - didnt really fully answer the question heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've tanked PoV golems at 62 with GSo4W with little to no agro problems, and seemed to do better than my GSoT in terms of agro.  This was with either of them augmented.<br />
<br />
However, I found my GSoT worked better in BoT, especially when grouped with super-duper DPS classes, but that was because I really needed the proc to stay ahead of them in terms of DPS.  <br />
<br />
Since I love my GSo4W for DPS duties (which I do a lot, and trade it between my war and monk on FV) I've been hesitant to Anger aug it.  But doing so would certainly make for an impressive, consistant agro weapon.  <br />
<br />
My only concern is that in the upcoming GoD expansion, there is rumored to be an AA which will increase weapon procs.  While the 75DD natural proc of the GSo4W is nice and increasing it would be a small DPS increase, it will be interesting to see if a double-hate GSoT would actually be better than a higher DPS/single hate proc GSo4W for agro.  However, at this point it might be a mute argument, as I suspect either would still be great agro.  <br />
<br />
I've never heard of anyone augmenting the GSo4W with Anger III and then regret it.  Will it be better than a Hate III GSoT?  Probably a little better since it'll hold agro better in a drought of proc'ing, but I don't think it would be a night-and-day difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just my comments from the penut gallery, I would go with the advice that Draxus says in the above linked post<br />
<br />
Then I would put angerIII on your best DPS weapon (GS4W). I am a firm believer in DPS agro to smooth out mob agro between procs. Pick up a WMBS for DPS &amp; sell the rest.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it will be in the same class as the weapons listed(with augs) aggro wise if you slap the anger aug on it.  Thats what I´m planning to do with mine and use as a tanking weapon and I use a GBoS auged with lifetap and an unauged Sword of the bloodsworm as my dual wield combo.<br />
<br />
Btw 15 peeps is more then enough to take out Einride Icestorm, the one who drops GBoS and plate BP.  The downside to dual wielding is the ripoests tho so I think you will be better off with GSot4W but you never know what the future brings in terms of ripoest reduing AA´s or something like that when some of the devs finally figure out the how rediculous burden it has become.<br />
So you might want to grab that GBoS too,  at least its an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Screw it then. I am going to do it, if I can do it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got GSo4W 2 days ago and put angerIII on it, I've done everything from CoD to BoT and LDoN both high risk and normal and haven't had any problems holding aggro on anything. I haven't raided with it yet but I'll let you know.<br />
<br />
ps. even when I don't proc, incite+ dps seems to take up the slack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Threads like this speak volumes as to how much better the warrior class is doing these days.<br />
<br />
A shift is starting. Many of you are starting to indulge in your desire to maximize DPS AND aggro. For the longest time it was all about the aggro-proc crutch.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's great that a warrior can consider putting an aggro proc on a GOOD DPS weapon and do the job effectively because he or she still has the proper TOOLS (incite) to do the job and NOT be hemmed into choosing JUST aggro proccing weapons.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I know it's a tad off topic. But, there ya have it. Have fun with your greatstaff. And good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Threads like this speak volumes as to how much better the warrior class is doing these days. <br />
<br />
Although they said that hate proccing weapons where a short term fix for a system problem, the availability of them with LDoN has made a huge difference to the masses unable to get a BoC/BoW. <br />
<br />
It's refreshing to be able to consider using a decent damage setup while not sacrificing aggro. Though the pre-Elemental/Time crowd is still averaging 60DPS. Most clerics who actually try to melee and heal can get 50ish DPS with just their summoned hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I put stun on my GSo4W rather than anger, and like everyone has said, the dps on it is wonderful, the agro is wonderful, and the 100dd on the proc helps dps still more... great weapon all around, slap an aug on and it'll last you till elementals at least.</div></div><hr />
