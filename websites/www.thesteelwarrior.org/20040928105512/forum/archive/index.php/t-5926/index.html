<br />
Given that historicaly fact, I think warrior HP's were 'working as intended' and you should have to pay for the addition 500 HP as AA. They are bonus. The fact that warriors alone even get the option is gravy on top. <br />

Nope. Can't do that, otherwise you get a false sense of class balance. Talk about heals alone and paladins look underpowered. Just like if you talk about shaman nukes alone, shamans look underpowered. You really don't look to care about balance tho, so I'm not surprised you'd try to limit it only to heals.<br />

Not always. I play with paladins all the time in my group when playing shaman, they make wicked complementary healers even if I have a warrior tank. You know damn well that you're not always in a group to tank, but it suits your purpose to claim that you are. Sorry, try again.<br />

You were just claiming how the second fast heal isn't so fast... and I point out the FACT that it's still faster than the second fast heal that the cleric has, so you're still, you know what, BETTER. And now you're trying to deflect it into what wins out because it heals MORE? You're wriggling trying to always show how paladin heals are so slow and so bad. You start claiming how rthey're so slow, I show how they're faster than anything else, so now you drop that line and start focusing on how little they heal compare to a cleric? typical.<br />

In trash clearing mobs, FAR more people than the MT get hit. Slowers, healers, and debuffers chief among them. And most of the time, THOSE are the ones needing the fast heals more, as they can't live as long as a tank. If you're just healing the tank, you're not fulfulling your role nearly as well as you could.<br />

If you're that stuck on never memorizing it, that fixated on seeing it as so useless, than there's nothing I or re-balancing the spell can do for you. Doesn't mean it's &quot;never used for anything&quot; by everyone though.

Not all of em, but some of the squishier ones certainly did. It was not a fun fight. Kinda funny how you think it was either all of the group or none of the group would die, and that ALL groups without paladins would die, while all groups with paladins would die.

Once again you're debarking from the healing issue. That was in response to YOU making a statement about war/pal in TANKING not me.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
As I've stated before you can't talk about JUST healing. Just like with warriors you can't talk about JUST defensive. It paints a false picture of reality. And one that supports you, I might add, so I see why you might want it.<br />

<br />
HALF your class? don't be ridiculous, if it was HALF your class then you shouldn't even be anywhere NEAR Warriors in tanking. No, you're a vasty majority of a tank, and a minority healer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me summarize. You say you're always hitting the mob, you never, or rarely, bother to heal anyone, or if anyone it's helping the MT because it's useless too. You're always tanking.<br />
<br />
You know what, you shoulrd be playing a warrior with /shield if that's all you're doing, because you're wasting a whole facet of your playing abilities.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know, you'll be saying you don't bother to buff or stun because those are useless too. <br />

/boggles at Wulf warning ME for pointing out buddy's troll, and not warning the guy who trolled....<br />
<br />
Dude, that wasn't a troll, that was pointing out someone else's troll and not responding to it like I wanted to. The &quot;alternative&quot; that I mentioned and intentionally did not go into the details of (due to not wanting to troll) is nothing more and nothing less than the truth.<br />
<br />
[moderator warning #3]<br />
<br />
Kahm: If you're talking about defensive, yeah, I agree. But defensive is not &quot;always on&quot;, it is on about 1% of a warrior's playing time.<br />
<br />
During regular fighting, it only takes TWO stuns over a minute to equalize the damage taken between a warrior and a paladin - remember that even now paladins and warriors only mitigate about what, 12% differently? And you're only expending 150 mana a minute or 15/tick total for that. You have a LOT of room to regen mana more, and stun more.<br />
<br />
To claim that stun can't situtationally mitigate more than a warrior's passive abilities is just plain nuts. Only defensive surpasses it.<br />
<br />
Sjoc: That's what other paladins have mentioned saving the AA manaless stun for. Divine stun. <br />

I think the thing that irritates me the most is that they claim to be THE Paladin Community...and then act like it's their house.

<br />

Being a moderator isn't easy (I am not a moderator for PON nor do I play one on TV).

What, and the people who claim that paladin heals are useless, that paladins are useless as tanks in GoD, and the ones who claim beastlords are jsut as good or better of tanks are being reasonable? Come on... <br />
No, I wasn't looking for a nerve to hit, I believe I already mentioned that. I *WAS*, however, trying to show how paladins aren't as bad off as some like to try and claim. Of course that's going to hit a nerve with the people who don't want to see or hear it.<br />

Paladins who do the same thing are kicked out for doing the same thing.  You have some wonderful Paladin company now.<br />
<br />
Funny how I see several paladins there who are MUCH more deserving of banning, and they are posting there while I am not. Take for example the paladin that called ME an idiot or stupid... and they didn't get a warning. Yeah, see, that's very biased moderation.<br />
<br />
If I posted enough inflamatory statements about Warriors constantly where each stupid post generated 10 worthless responses then the board moderators have to step in.  Same deal with you Deamon.<br />

I wouldn't have an issue of being moderated or warned, if it were fair moderation. But it's not. I get warned (the one justifiable warning, I might add) for calling someone a fool for doing something, but people who call me an idiot are conveniently ignored and not warned. Repeatedly.<br />

Almost every paladin on that board agreed that warrior needed improvemtn before the melee changes. They even had a stickied topic addressed to the devs at one point suggesting something that looks an awful lot like Incite over a year ago. You guys are living up to every ugly warrior stereotype that other classes have given you. And for any of you to have the brass balls to call PoN whiney...well that is just the height of irony.<br />
<br />
PoN has banned far more paladins with   a god mode complex than they ever will warriors. But you wouldn't know that I suppose, since most of you just drive by, tell them they are stupid for wanting to actually have a useful role and then come talk about how cool you are on back here.<br />
<br />
I only ever started posting at PoN because I spent months arguing for a warrior aggro boost there, but I've come to appreciate that it's one of the best EQ communities around. It deserves far more respect that most of the drivel and vitriol that's been spewed around here lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Gimmel has been assimilated. :eek:<br />
<br />
 Edit - Gimmel, as far as anyone with a pair of working eyes can determine, Paladins still DO have a viable role, both in groups and raids.<br />
<br />
 They currently have trouble tanking in one or two trials.<br />
<br />
 Repeat for emphasis.<br />
<br />
 They currently, among ALL content in EQ that's been broken, have trouble tanking in one or two trials.<br />
<br />
 That is NOTHING like being passed over for the vast majority of XP groups, such as was the way things were pre-Incite. To suggest it is is laughable at best and idiocy at worst.<br />
<br />
 You suggest that lots of Paladins have gotten the ban lately? Bring us proof - link the posts that got them banned. Reread the Ikkinz trial post and tell us how many times Taragor as one example used language solely to inflame the person he was rebutting. THEN explain how Daemon's posts fall into the 'bannable' category when Taragor did NOT EVEN GET A PUBLIC WARNING.<br />
<br />
 They don't like him? Fine. They don't want him posting there? Fine. They wanna boot him, find a better pretext that doesn't make them look like a bunch of Ivory-tower Paladins afraid to confront what happens day to day in EQ - Hell, I'll bet half of them refuse to believe Paladins have tanked Ikkinz successfully.<br />
<br />
 Banning him for KNIGHTEMIZATION is the height of absurdity or the height of timidity. Which do you prefer for an explanation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Gimmel,<br />
<br />
Did Derringer, Kether, Graal, et al. really support the aggro change? Or did they fight it tooth and nail? Was the sticky supporting Warrior aggro changes taken down and despite being asked not put back up during the call for a Warrior stand down? Was it heavily redacted in &quot;deference&quot; to a PoN administrator adamently opposed to Warrior aggro changes? When specificly asked, did they put up a general statement of support, a poll, any expression of solidarity or did they beg off stating they'd concider  specific Warrior proposals?<br />
<br />
The Phase 1 Melee Changes being put in place, did PoN posters say with good grace, 'Well I disagree but that's SoE's decision.&quot; or did they immediately start threads alledging Paladins would no longer Add Tank/off tank in raids and asking where their upgrades were?<br />
<br />
When possible difficulty for Knights in GoD emerged did Paladins post sentences like (paraphrasing) 'Paladins have lost their group role in GoD.' or 'Paladins can't get flagged!!&quot; and follow that up within 2 weeks of a new (and more difficult) expansion with calls to remove Defensive from the game or give Defensive to Knights.<br />
<br />
The Class Balance board is dominated by those bitterly opposed to the Phase 1 Melee Changes. Some contend Warrior aggro was just fine and others that superior aggro control was THE one thing that differentialed Paladins from Warriors. Ocassionaly the same person alternates views depending on wind direction.<br />
<br />
Only by reading the Lord Citadel section do you come to understand that many Paladins want to be Holy Warriors with the ability to MT effectively in groups, a useful raid role, and to cast some decent spells.<br />
<br />
You are welcome to come here and talk smack about Warrior vitriol. But friend, you really should not have a selective memory when doing so.<br />
<br />
Warriors should be fair with regard to the question of Knight survivability and GoD.<br />
<br />
BTW, I missed when Warriors ever asked that Clerics be nerfed. I suppose that returning Warrior support for Cleric issues in the past with vitriol and drivel is ok though.<br />
<br />
More to the point:<br />
Wulfhere seems (at least to me) to be a quite fair and very tolerant administrator. Another administrator does get involved with debate and does ocassionaly seem to use the ability to ban (Furor) as his ultimate argument.<br />

Talk about biting the hand that feeds ya :D.

Any class with snare or ensnare can assure virtual aggro lock. Perhaps mobs should be made universally tougher (ATK buff) and ALL the tank classes receive a mitigation boost of an equal amount. Rangers/Shaman/Beastlords/Pets have all been main tanks for groups I have been in at one time or another. These classes (and pets) are NOT MT classes! Of course some adjusting would have to be done per expansion set, ie Velious mobs certainly do NOT need more ATK, maybe in fact less, but need to hit harder. PoP mobs certainly hit hard enough, but have much lower ATK values. <br />
The problem we then run into is the REQUIREMENT that a Tank be included in every exp group. I know, late in the PM and early AM, Tanks are NOT always available. I am also on a very crowded server, Tunare, so if we have a Tank problem here at certain times of the day, other servers certainly do.<br />
At the very least for gods sake, remove the Tank AA's from the pure casters and maybe give them a few more hp AA's in replacement. We all hate seeing the Enchanter/Wizard/Mage/Necromancer one rounded, but to see a caster Tank is ludicris.</div></div><hr />

It's amazing how quickly the shoe is on the other foot when warriors get a leg up. Almost every paladin on that board agreed that warrior needed improvemtn before the melee changes. They even had a stickied topic addressed to the devs at one point suggesting something that looks an awful lot like Incite over a year ago. You guys are living up to every ugly warrior stereotype that other classes have given you. And for any of you to have the brass balls to call PoN whiney...well that is just the height of irony.<br />
  <br />
<br />
Wrong, Most paladins I've seen are were quite content with the situation.  many paladins agreed that something needed to be done, but actually very very few actually suggested serious improvement instead of tiny, meaningless upgrades like most of them.<br />
In fact that the whole thread is about Normal LDoN and PoE exp makes me laugh, who cares what classes can tank this trivial stuff? Last 2 PoE groups I had actually had TWO paladins, and we still made kickass exp.<br />
When you actually see beastlords regularly taking Tank spots for GoD, then something is wrong, but these &quot;once upon a time a beastlord tanked hard LDoN&quot; are exceptions anyways that are no real threat to paladin group viability<br />

Yes, another huge problem. Knights just don't realize that these trials unlock Time level loot dropping raid content, or they just don't care because they are fucking spoiled now in their tankability. As long as druids can't rez Gimmel, you are on the save side in these situations.</div></div><hr />

You suggest that lots of Paladins have gotten the ban lately? Bring us proof - link the posts that got them banned. Reread the Ikkinz trial post and tell us how many times Taragor as one example used language solely to inflame the person he was rebutting. THEN explain how Daemon's posts fall into the 'bannable' category when Taragor did NOT EVEN GET A PUBLIC WARNING. [/B] <br />
<br />
Firstly, I'm either not awake, blind or both (can't find the post), but the orignal warning to BOTH Daemonwind and myself were done at the same time publicly. Him for trolling, myself for flaming.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it's interesting that though I argue with BB and Frodin alot more (that 1 thread excluded) that none of us has ever been warned in regards to what we say. Mostly because generally the tone of the conversation stays civilized even though BB and I tend to never agree.<br />
<br />
Third, my original arguments with Daemonwind started with him representing himself as a *shaman* arguing against any idea of heal spell upgrades to the paladin class. Midway through, he was now representing himself as a warrior. This obviously lead to problems.<br />
<br />
Fourth, I'd like you to find any of my posts where I have ever asked for a warrior nerf. There isn't any. Look at the arguments about GoD and you'll notice I'm not asking for nerfs, I'm stating my concerns about what may be on the other side of the fence when guilds finally cross all the trials.</div></div><hr />

Still waiting for the explanation of how the roles are completely reversed when some pallies can't tank a few mobs in some trials (that are NOT required by entire guilds... just one pass per raid) less than 3 weeks into a new expansion...</div></div><hr />

Seventhsword, Goodwind, Qualtar, Tsunamix are the names I can think of off the top of my head, look them up yourself.<br />
<br />
 I suppose that returning Warrior support for Cleric issues in the past with vitriol and drivel is ok though.<br />
This is just amazing. First of all it's just wrong, since I was told flat out &quot;You can get your fixes after we get ours, if ever, get in the back of the line, you've get a raid role, be happy.&quot; By several people, especially warriors.&quot; There was no &quot;warrior&quot; support that I'm aware of. But even if there was, and maybe there was, you are saying I should &quot;back up&quot; warriors in whatever they say simply because of a few warriors at some point said that cleric might need some fixes? That's just stupid. Too many of you don't look beyond &quot;Paladins say this, paladins want that.&quot; There is no universal &quot;paladin&quot; position. Some are glad warriors are fixed, some are concerned about their future role, some will never be content until they can shoot laser beams out of their eyes. Much like the the posters here. It wouldn't take much digging to find more than a few posters who thought things were just dandy in Kunark, and that a knight should only ever get a group if there's no warrior available. Yet to claim that that's what &quot;warriors&quot; think is equally dishonest as what several of you seem to be saying. Individuals hold these positions, not classes. And the individuals are a lot more varied than you might think. And if you ever stopped to listen to them, you just might learn a thing or two.<br />
<br />
It's called empathy. Putting yourself in another's shoes. Try it sometime.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you this though. I don't think that TSW would ever have a stickied topic on their class balancing board addressed to SOE suggesting a fix to a knight class problem the way PoN did. Nor do I forsee a TSW admin writing a lengthy article for Spawnweek on the relative power imbalance of knights and warriors the way Romidar did. Maybe you guys ought to step back and ask why that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Gimmel, you keep equating the &quot;paladin problem&quot; as something equal to the warrior aggro issue, like they're somehow the same kind of thing<br />
<br />
That is simply not the case.<br />
<br />
The warrior aggro issue was so widespread, so commonly known and understood, that it went beyond the tanking classes. Nearly EVERY class and community in the game agreed that there was a big problem with warriors, that that problem was aggro, and that it needed to be fixed, and NOW. Not only that, but this issue had been a problem for years and years, as is illustrated by the implementation of Enraging Blow weapons back in VELIOUS as a &quot;temporary solution&quot; to the problem. In Fan Faires, the warrior aggro issue dominated the class balance forums, and SoE, if I remember correctly, even hosted a chat on the topic which attracted WELL OVER a thousand people.<br />
<br />
The same cannot be said at ALL with the &quot;paladin problem&quot;.<br />
<br />
No, the warrior problem and the &quot;paladin problem&quot; have only the most passing of similarities... they are not truly &quot;alike&quot; at all.</div></div><hr />

There is no universal Warrior position either. Except even at the worst of times the closest thing to a Paladin nerf proposed by Warriors was making stuns rational. No one ever said lets balance Paladins by removing their heals from their spellbook.<br />
<br />
The stickie was not up when Warriors were most concerned about this issue. In truth one admisitrator did not agree with any Warrior aggro changes.<br />
<br />
Let me be honest. I felt Romidar sumarized many threads and posts made by others. It was organized, coherrent, contained a couple of novel ideas, and he didn't have to do it. So grats Romidar.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that Knights are getting flagged and are not /lfg. Are you getting sucked in by rhetoric? This is largely an effort to assume the primary MT mantle (the 'Tank Parity' campaign) or at least undo the Phase 1 Melee Changes if possible. Look at who is most vocal. Look at their posting history.<br />
<br />
I do not believe if Druids pulled this %%$&amp; on Clerics you'd be too amused. OMG Clerics are required in GoD!! I can't perform my group role!!! SL must be removed from the game or given to Druids!!!!<br />

Of course there isn't, and the paladins who talk that way are being equally ignorant as many of the posters here.<br />
I know for a fact that Knights are getting flagged and are not /lfg. Are you getting sucked in by rhetoric? <br />
I know for a fact many warriors were getting groups in PoP. That doesn't mean there wasn't a problem. Your argument works both ways.<br />

Unlike knights, druids are designed to hold more than one role fairly well. But the fact is that non-cleric healing is grossly out of date in new expansions. Shamans, druids, and paladins all really need serious improvements in burst healing ability. For the longest time, raid content has required stupid amounts of clerics, and I hate it. It should change. No single class should be required for single group content, and no class should be required in double the proportion of every other class for raiding the way clerics are. It's poor design.</div></div><hr />

Warriors MT hard hitting mobs better than any other tank because of Defensive. That's the way it's been since Defensive was released and the way it is now. It has nothing at all to do with GoD except some TRIAL (some at least that don't even have to be done) mobs may be too difficult for some Paladins.<br />
<br />
I failed Tipt twice because I wasn't a Paladin. The trial is not just the boss mob kill.<br />
<br />
And you are right. Because Paladin heals, stuns, and Root don't have enough value, some are convinced they should be Warriors. Just exactly like Druids they have several roles, those are buffs, heals, Res, and remove curse in those spellbooks - not just tank stuff at all. Primarily melee Gimmel. Primarily. The difference is that Warriors are &quot;...unmatched...&quot;. Matching them kinda defeats the whole reason for Warriors existing doesn't it.<br />

Are you TOTALLY deranged?  Paladin's have been playing in God mode since the release of PoP.  As I recall, it was the paladin community that was the most vocal opponent of warriors getting any part of their much needed upgrade.  For the first time in a long time there is something approaching balance among the tank classes, and the greedy children at PoN can't stand the fact that they're not at the top of the tanking heap anymore.  <br />
<br />
Personally I don't give a damn about some argument you had with daemon or anyone else on the PoN board.  This one &quot;pot calling the kettle black&quot; statement you ended your post with demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have NO idea what balance is.

<br />
Totally? No. Just a tad. :) My comment about warriors thinking themselves Gods had to do with their attitude, not their in game abilities. <br />
<br />
I agree with you that during PoP knights had the advantage, but that advantage was purely due to AGGRO, we weren't better than warriors tanking wise, we just had the ability to gain and keep aggro reliably whereas warriors had to rely on RNG and a skill that to this day is still broken. <br />
<br />
In comes the incite line, which btw I agree warriors needed. <br />
<br />
What I have a problem with is the defensive upgrades your class got that knight classes did not (and I'm not talking about your added 500hp at the cost of a retarded amount of AA), but WAIT, not only did you get an upgrade, but that upgrade was followed by a new expansion that made doubled it's effectiveness. Why may I ask was your class the sole benificiary to these changes? We are BOTH plate TANKS, we BOTH have a role as TANKS, paladins didn't TANK better than you pre-changes (not aggro DMG MITIGATION). You guys don't want equality, you want supremecy. <br />
<br />
Has it even occured to you people that maybe paladins want upgrades because WE'RE tired of having non tanking classes replace us in groups? No, I guess not, that would require you to think of someone else but yourselves. <br />
<br />
Of course I can see the replies now. From the BB mentality that anyone that has only 6k unbuffed doesn't know how EQ works to the Daemons' mentality who'll spew forth the &quot;YOU WANT TO BE GODS&quot; or even better yet &quot;if you want to TANK like a warrior reroll your character and make one&quot;. Maybe you guys should all reroll your warriors and play paladins and we should just scrap your class. I mean according to you ppl we have SO MUCH in our spellbooks that dwarf your abilities that it's beyond logical thinking as to why ANYONE would play a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Actually the warning post had both the warning for Daemon AND myself in the same sentence. If you go to that thread you'll note that it goes from warning #1 to warning #3 without a warning #2. Ironically, our friend Daemon has not posted to even DENY that what I am saying is true because he's fully aware of the event. Not that it really matters in the end.</div></div><hr />

I can't find the post where seventhsword was banned, but here is a post by Frodlin in this thread here mentioning specifically about seventhsword having been banned. So, you can either believe that Frodlin is in cahoots with Gimmel, which would mean that they have premonitions and made those posts in advance mentioning the banning of seventh just for others like me to find or you just have to accept that seventhsword was banned :p<br />

Nope, he was banned. It was one of the happiest days of my EQ career. The fact that it was done by Romidar just made it even more satisfying. Romidar is extremely patient and even-keeled, almost to a fault, it takes a lot to finally exasperate him.</div></div><hr />

He is proposing a major nerf to the caster side of paladins in return for a major boost to tanking, making paladins and warriors almost identical. This is because he personally doesn't like to heal, he likes to tank.) But he's got far more of a grasp of logic, game mechanics, and basic grammar than seventhsword ever could.<br />

Did Derringer, Kether, Graal, et al. really support the aggro change? Or did they fight it tooth and nail? Was the sticky supporting Warrior aggro changes taken down and despite being asked not put back up during the call for a Warrior stand down? Was it heavily redacted in &quot;deference&quot; to a PoN administrator adamently opposed to Warrior aggro changes? When specificly asked, did they put up a general statement of support, a poll, any expression of solidarity or did they beg off stating they'd concider specific Warrior proposals?<br />

Quoting myself from this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3652&amp;perpage=40&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1) on 10-16-2003:<br />
<br />
In regards to warriors, I've mentioned what I think needs to be done many times: Taunt needs to work at a minimum of 75-80% of the time against even cons and below at the skill level equalling a warrior's taunt cap. A taunt success rate of 75% would give a 6% chance of having 2 failed taunts in a row, as opposed to the current 25% chance. A taunt success rate of 80% would give a 4% of 2 successive failures. An 85% success rate would give a 2% chance of 2 successive failures. I also think taunt should probably work just a touch better against raid level mobs too, maybe the following suggestion would help in that regard. Taunt should also add a bit more +hate when moving a tank to the top of the hate list; instead of top of the hatelist+x (whatever x is currently) the added aggro margin from a successful taunt should be tripled (x*3). The range on taunt could also use a small boost, maybe 25% increased range. It shouldn't be &quot;ranged aggro&quot; but the range on taunt is TOO small. I don't like the innate hate idea because it makes it harder for warriors who don't want aggro to do good DPS and it lessens the warriors ability to control whether he has aggro or not. We have warriors who get aggro when they don't want it already. It would simply make their lives harder to make that situation worse.<br />
<br />
I think changing taunt to work at a much higher rate (75-90%) against even cons and below and increasing the added margin of hate from a successful taunt would probably be enough to make warriors as viable a choice for xp groups as knights are. The biggest reason many groups don't want a warrior (as opposed to prefering a knight) is due to lack of reliable aggro.<br />
<br />
I think your memory is fuzzy if you think even a large fraction of paladins didn't think at least some upgrades to warrior aggro were needed. We knew it was an issue. The vast majority of the paladins who were discussing the issue here (and at PoN) at the time agreed with that, although there was disagreement over what boosts were needed and how large those boosts should be. There was the occasional paladin who was upset that his eye lasers weren't working, but that's it.</div></div><hr />

Romidar has been one of the most solid guys in eq for well over 4 years now.  Actually 80-90pct of pallies are good folks...we just get the LOUD ones that come over here and stir the pot fairly often....hardly representative of the majority of level headed ones.<br />

I dont understand how Warriors having incite and defensive suddenly negates 65 levels worth of spells/class abilities like LoH/FD/Rez/ (Free fast horse for practically no AAs) and ALMOST the same mitigation, in what are supposed to be HYBRID classes,as in secondary...as in not as good as.<br />

I won't hold it against anyone who thinks like this.  They simply don't care about balance and just want Paladins to suffer.  I just wish they would admit it.  There are Warriors out there that do see and feel the problem.  We all have different ideas about how to address it but I'm just happy they see it.<br />

Lay Hands is equivlant to a 2 HP/s regen.   Invest more AA and can push it up to a whole 5 HP/s.  Wait...can't most player generate 5 HP standing there?

I recommend looking at the Lord Protector's forum.  Less flaming yet the concerns are still there.  Is a 2400 AC Paladin talking out of his rear saying these things are too hard as is?

Knights have things Warriors don't, it is called BALANCE. What you are is a TROLL. You want the &quot;superman&quot; class. You wanted to be a MT? Then start a WARRIOR! Paladins are BACK-UP tanks, that is the cost associated with that spell book. There is stuff in the game outside the trials you can do, that we can't.

Warriors gave up their spell books after all (hides the discs behind his back). Knights are hybrids after all, and that should mean that they should all go stand in PoK and be happy casting spells on each other with LFG up while the real classes actually get to kill things.

Face it, from the beginning of EQ, melee classes have been outright SCREWED by the &quot;Programmers&quot;. Monks were the ONLY melee allowed to solo, and yea, that may not be abig deal to you, but it is a CLEAR indicator of  the classes power.

 Beat them with a Warrior tanking? Then that would mean the survival rate of Knights depends on about 25 Time clearings worth of loot for a Pally? Sounds balanced to me - how many VT clearings did it take before Knights could tank the raid bosses in PoP?</div></div><hr />

Knights are SECONDARY tanks.If your not able to tank it,it was made that way and be glad your father class exists.The only encounter embalance would be if a WARRIOR cant tank it.Then you have problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Read it again Partha.  I have no Quarm loot.  I have what....5 pieces of Time loot?  Evidently that isn't good enough to tank in Discord.  Ask the 8K HP Rogue instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I still don't understand how the fact that knights have a very hard time tanking trials is a class balance issue.  It's an obstacle to be overcome, that was made that difficult for a reason.  In about 95-99% of the content in this game a knight is interchangeable with a warrior.  In some cases, a knight is clearly the prefered choice for an encounter, why should the converse not be true?<br />
Also, I have seen it asked of warriors in more than one thread recently, &quot;Well, do you want to do this over and over again to carry all of us who can't tank it though?&quot;<br />
Honestly, yes.  I'm not, and may never be at the level of the game where I'll be tanking these trials, but if I were, and there were 50 paladins and sk's in my guild that needed to get through it, and I was the only warrior in the guild capable of doing it, you can bet your ass every paladin or sk in my guild would get flagged for it and move on to the next step in the progression even if that meant me doing trials until I was sick to death of it.<br />
  I'm in a small guild, I'm fundamentally doing that now in PoJ trials for all the lower level folks in my guild that can't get through them, the high level folks are carrying lower folks though one at a time until we're all flagged.<br />
Also, from everything I've read (again havent done it, may never),  you don't have to get more than a handful of people through the damned thing for your entire guild to progress.<br />
This seems to me to be less about class balance and more like a convenient excuse for knights who are jealous of the melee revamp to regain their dominance.<br />
If all you're asking for is either a retuning of the trials so that knights can tank them, that's one thing (be careful what you wish for, if that happens, lower geared warriors will be able to do it, and then the uber folks won't be able to sit high on their mountain and bask in their uberness without tripping over the elemental geared folks that &quot;shouldnt be there&quot;),  but some knights, particularly paladins are asking for across the board changes to either one of both classes based on ONE SET OF TRIALS.  I just have to call bullshit on that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Knights can tank the trials, its just harder <br />
<br />
Trails at this time are above the level I cn do, so am relying on comments from friends who have done them for this, and what Madronedorf has said here.  A knight tanking these certain bosses in trails comes down to luck.  They win or loose based strictly on how the RNG treats them.  I don't see any real good way this can be fixed without either gimping the encounter, or giving knights something overpowered.<br />
<br />
The point is Knights get a lot of stuff (thats not even needed) given to them. <br />
<br />
The ability to earn stuff.  You do have to earn those AA's, they are not just handed out.  Admittedly not hard, but still.  Personally, I like it when I see a knight I know lacks defensive AA's, but has a horse...I know I shine compared to them when it comes to tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Still makes me wonder, Aeka, how the hell you can consider yourself ready for GoD tanking when you don't have a single QUARM loot, knowing all along that Paladins haven't tanked boss mobs in previous expansions without farming the content before and during first. Quarm is previous content, and you haven't even got a piece of that to your name. Your wish to tank these is as ridiculous as me wishing to tank them.</div></div><hr />

I took the liberty to look at your guilds &quot;homepage' forum, and the horrible roster in there. Judging how I was swarmed with 2500 hp priests, 5500 hp tanks and 1500hp casters, I'd just say that you are very, very far away from understanding anything past Plane of Fear break in.<br />
I find it absoluty hilarious that level 65s are a minority in your guild, yet you sit here and talk to people years ahead of you in raid progression how the current TOP RAID bottleneck should be knight tankable, when a single rampage round is enough to wipe your whole group there.</div></div><hr />

 And there is now. In the past there had been no progression content that required flags, either, or required stuff like being level 52 or lower. It doesn't invalidate Sony from changing the rules of THEIR game as THEY see fit. Only the unchanging expectations of people used to the way older content is done makes this an arguable point.<br />

 Actually, that's the difference between the Paladins who have stayed silent on this issue (and passed the trials) and those who are most vocal about the trials. It's also the difference between the actual Warriors on the board and the trolls. Do you know what it is?<br />
<br />
 Had there been that nuke you talk about, they would have sucked up the fact that they could not tank it and gone about their business, or they would keep gearing until they COULD tank it. Instead of doing either, the more vocal Paladins are crying for the content to be weakened and/or unique Warrior abilities to be farmed out to Paladins in weaker form so they can do what they historically haven't been able to do anyways. I swear, you HAVE been assimiliated.</div></div><hr />

the progression of your guild as of February the first.<br />
and you want to TANK Ikkinz trials , the hardest test of tanking known so far for a tank in this whole game, already as a SECONDARY TANK ?!<br />

Meaning, only tankable by a paladin.<br />
<br />
If the trials dropped no loot, and only served as guild advancement, I would have no beef. But since they are being used to exp and farm gear after already passed, there is an issue.</div></div><hr />

Sanctification neither works on DT, nor does it work on Luclin DT like on Shei Vinitras.<br />
<br />
the gear we farmed so far only drops from the trigger anyways, which is indeed knight tankable.<br />
and for exp? Just letting you know, as theres no way you gonna get first hand experience on this subject any time soon.<br />
in EPs you can still AA at least 50% faster than in those trials. So people exping in ikkinz trials for the sake of exping are idiots. Sewers1 is better exp, and the nameds there can drop spells / loot as well, and are actually tankable by ANY of the 3 tank classes that can zone into KTaz (theoretically)</div></div><hr />

BZZZZT. As long as it the resist adjust is not &quot;unresistable&quot; (as in DT) sanct works. Which is why I specifically said a -500 resist. But that is niether here not there. The point, which was obviously far too subtle for you, is that if the trial required a knight to pass, you would be bitching to high heaven.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I seem to recall that Shei's DT used to be resistable (but with a lure level resist adjust), which is why DA would block it, but not the old world DT. But it is currently flagged as unresistable, with no mention in the history of a resist change, so perhaps I'm just losing it :)</div></div><hr />

Very good Partha, you are making progress<br />
<br />
In Bastion of Thunder, the Enchanted Ring of Torden is made of 2 parts, the first part is &quot;single group content&quot;, and while it was pre-instancing, it was still designed as &quot;single group content&quot;.    The mobs that dropped the combine containers also dropped ornate leg molds and other decent loot.   The mobs were originally only tanked by warriors using /disc defensive, and they WERE guild advancement mobs that a single person had to complete to gain access to raid content (Agnarr event) which also happenned to drop loot.  <br />
<br />
Gimmel, you and I both remember I'm sure all fo the posts over on the PoN board where Paladins said unequivocally that they were unable to tank these mobs in early PoP, and that it required /disc defensive.   I was there early (as the first person on my server to zone into BoT), and remember vividly these things occurring early in the expansion.   Fast forward to today and Knights are tanking it no problem.<br />
<br />
Having said that, something i find interesting is the following statement:<br />
<br />
If the trials dropped no loot, and only served as guild advancement, I would have no beef. But since they are being used to exp and farm gear after already passed, there is an issue.<br />
<br />
I have talked about something almost identical to this, only that trials dropped the same loot as post-trial adventure type trials that are knight tankable.  As you know, this has been met with considerable resistance over at PoN, but I wonder what your position is on this, as it seems like a true compromise to me, that guild advancement content requiring a warrior to tank early in the expansion, but allowing for less insane bosses and more or less tanking &quot;parity&quot; for the exp/loot after a person has entered the zone beyond.</div></div><hr />

I hear you, but I think it's an important difference that it is not physically limited to 6 man groups. The fact that there is no other choice but to do it as only 6 people is very different.<br />

I think it's a great idea, the best solution that I've heard so far. If the purpose of the encounter is guild advancement, and since unlike PoP, not every person has to be flagged, I think it is entirely appropriate. The fact that some of these trials are dropping gear that could be an upgrade to Time level players is where I find the problem with the trials.</div></div><hr />

 And I still have to wonder how anyone made it through any previous content where it was SWORN the only way it could be tanked was with a /disced Warrior.<br />

 Oh, wait.....the Warriors blazed the trail, and the Knights came back and did it later. Imagine that.<br />

 And as far as what's in store - I think I'd like to see some of the drops past the trials for plate tanks before I get any ideas about what the HP/AC ceilings are.<br />
<br />
 Oh, and I went and dug up a quote from PoN...........<br />
<br />
At the higher end of the game the main problem is only one or two people are gunna play &quot;hero&quot; (Tanking) while all others just do dps, warriors have crap to do cept for a little more dps, knights can still help raids a lot, but on some raids where everything is covered (Good chain, no adds/ no ae dmg or ae dmg covered by mgbs) we're in a worse boat then warriors cause we're just doing subpar dps then... but thats not TOO common (but not rare enuff to ignore either)  <br />
<br />
 Wonder who said that? ;)<br />
<br />
 EDIT - also found a quote from Gilfalas:<br />
<br />
 As for warriors verus plate knight tanking, well every expansion it has always been the Warriors tanking any and all raid level mobs for the first attempts and the farming. After that when the gear has been gotten, THEN the knights have been able to tank the mobs the warriors did in inferior gear. Itemization is the issue and has been for years.</div></div><hr />

The orginal DT, Cazic Touch, was originally resistable...newb. The change history on Lucy only goes back so far...newb. I remember seeing a level 65 warrior named Donzi resist 2(two) DTs in one hour from the sphinxes on the 7th? island of sky back during Kunark...newb.<br />

Don't be so quick to call someone a newb...newb.  <br />

I call someone a newb that thinks he can comment about raid content that is at least a whole fucking year away from his guild.<br />
I'm in fact very picky with who to label like that, so don't even try to make it look like I loosely use this term on anyone with stupid views, you gimp Paladin crybaby :P<br />

Chuckles, you keep forgetting something. Paladins HAVE MT'd AND SEC TANKED THESE TRIALS. Just because YOU can't != no one can.  <br />
<br />
So maybe warriors should have shut the hell up about their aggro issues and waited until their guilds were farming LDoN raids to get geared up so they could go back and be viable tanks in LDoN easy with their augs.<br />

Posted by Frodin<br />
I have talked about something almost identical to this, only that trials dropped the same loot as post-trial adventure type trials that are knight tankable. As you know, this has been met with considerable resistance over at PoN, but I wonder what your position is on this, as it seems like a true compromise to me, that guild advancement content requiring a warrior to tank early in the expansion, but allowing for less insane bosses and more or less tanking &quot;parity&quot; for the exp/loot after a person has entered the zone beyond.<br />
<br />
Part of the resistance stems from BB saying that the loot quality in the post trials would be of a lower level because the encounters were reduced. That you couldn't expect to get the same loot for less work.<br />
<br />
Second. Replacing content with a lesser version to throw a bone to players (it's more than pals since with a war in those instances you could use a druid healer maybe etc) doesn't solve the situation of the lack of survivability that is required from knights to be able to do the regular content. Again, I go back to what I've discussed with you before. IF we go according to EQ history lvl 1 is easier than 2 then 3 etc etc etc. If by the point ppl are now at (trial 6 or 7?) knights are struggling to stay alive unless healing is very focussed, what will this mean in true raid zones? Again, look at the dmg output of named in PoJ exec trial and look at the dmg output of BoT/HOH/Tactics trash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if it was an observation modified by subsequent posts by me.<br />
<br />
I may have somewhere at sometime observed that a Moss_Snake_1 shouldn't drop the same loot as Quarm, but I surely have not indicated that a encounter that is fair to Warriors and Paladins alike should drop less desireable loot when a Paladin is MTing.<br />
<br />
At the proding of some Knights, I agreed that it wouldn't bother me if a guild progression version of these trials had no loot and an experiance version did.<br />
<br />
In a discusion of auto-scored group appropriate instanced content, I specificly stated that a group should not have lesser quality loot because a Paladins MT's rather than a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Do you have to make up sh1t in every post you make. Is the compulsion that hard to resist?<br />

<br />
6. In instanced single group content, auto-score group capability (Healing, slowing, Tanking) and create appropriate challanges (appropriate risk) with the loot commensurate with the difficulty of challange they are able to meet and group composition (appropiate rewards). Players seem dissatisfied with using their judgement and performing this task themselves.<br />
<br />
Under the assumption that these xp/loot trials WOULD be easier since paladins would be able to tank them it therefore leads to a lower difficulty challenge thus granting lower reward. <br />
<br />
I was in fact suggesting in such a system Paladins would face different risks than Warriors for the same quality reward. However, the Sword of Ultimate Uberness (WAR Only) and Mace of Ultimate Uberness (PAL Only) wouldn't have the same stats. I'll leave it to you to conjectecture which would be better<br />
<br />
Though I must admit being a little more awake you may have meant that in a jesting manner. I apologize in advance if that was the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is why I've been more of the opinion that you should have the flag trial have no loot in them. Then have post trials for xp/loot purposes geared to where either class is an option. This way you'd have no chance of disperity in the rewards.<br />

The apology was PRECISELY to prevent what you're doing in this very post. I was apologizing in advance if what I had written and QUOTED to you in the reply just before this one had been taken OUT of context as to what you were trying to say back on PoN.

Actually if I take both replies look at your first reply then combine that with the second reply that has the *guess which would be better :) * in it one could construde that you ARE indeed expecting the better of the 2. <br />
<br />
NOW, with the advent that the second post was but in jest, it eliminates the conclusion that can be made with the combination of the 2.<br />

All THAT being taken into account leads back to if the *past* was missunderstood at this *present* time I am apologizing for the *future*.<br />

I was unaware I was suppose to get down on my knees and grovel. Please oh sir warrior of all knowlege, do not look down upon this unknowing ignorant minor class paladin yada yada yada.

That is such a retarded comment. Knights were happy in PoP not because after farming a zone for 4month they could tank the God in it, but because they actually served a PURPOSE upon their guild entering it. Which btw, was NOT MT (few exceptions)<br />

In regards to my guild level. You gotta love that it's the PoTime lvl warriors cussing and insulting because as not being Time geared I have no right to bitch. Well guess what.

you're damn right we consider ourselves the king of tanking. Funny thing is, all the other non tank classes in the game and most of the people playing hybrids agree. Oh, gee, and guess what, SoE agrees too!<br />
<br />
You're just further proving that you feel you have some right to be so close to warrior tanking so as to be no real meaningful difference, while being able to retain everything that your spellbook gives you.<br />
<br />
Warriors are the tanking specialist, therefore they will remain having a decided edge in tanking over hybrid tanks... period.<br />

Any decent tank in my EP guild can tank the first few trials. The caveat of the needing the warrior is ONLY with the highest of the trials, for flags that only ONE person in a raid needs.<br />

  That is the way almost every new exspaion is. Right now higher geared knights are tanking those also. As you progress into this exp you will get the gear required to tank those trials and also the higher level trials. This exp is designed as the next step after time, and the single group flagging is nothing more than a time sink. If the trials where made to where any tank + healer + slower + 3xDPS could handle them, then they would no longer serve the fuction they are intended for.</div></div><hr />

A GOOD guild, does what it has to for any obsticle put in the way. a BAD guild avoids them and whines &quot;&quot;X&quot; is to hard, wahhhhh!&quot; Which guild are you in? If you are doing Plane of Time, you best be in a GOOD guild, or Plane of Time was never properly tuned for difficulty.<br />
Trondir hit it right on the head, the Paladins whining loudest are not even at the stage of the game they need to be. If the trials get weakened, MANY Warriors will soon be doing them also. I can play in the morning (I work third shift), and Tanks are at a premium. So perhaps I should jump on thie &quot;Knight bandwagon&quot; to get the trials nerfed, then upgrade my stuff, and tank it! <br />

Turns out that all paladin whiners (aeka, taragor, Graal, dronedorf etc) are all at the same stage of the game or not even there yet. Quarm down less than a month ago, most of the time gear is just slightly better EP Gear (phase1-2)<br />
<br />
Someone please wake me up when knights &gt;8300 hp show up here, I'm tired of these half-rangers demanding to tank content which is the very edge of their current guildprogression.  <br />
<br />
Maybe that should give you a fucking clue as to what the problem is. I don't BITCH cause I can't tank Fennin Ro in EP because it's a warriors job, BUT that same warrior can't take 5 ppl with him to DO it. <br />
<br />
I don't BITCH cause warriors at MY lvl tank Druav, RZ, Sol Ro, etc because it's a warriors job, but that same warrior can't take 5 ppl with him to DO it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The egotistical DRIVEL that comes out of the warrior community is so fucking retarded. <br />
<br />
TELL me oh great ppl that have PAIN STAKINGLY taken MONTHS on END to achieve PoTime gear, that have stayed up HOURS upon HOURS upon HOURS risking sleep deprevation and divorces and the like. Are YOU happy that warriors in guilds that don't even have EP access let alone PoTime access can start getting ALMOST PoTime equivalent LOOT? <br />
<br />
Cause if you don't have a problem with a warrior with VT leveled gear tanking the first few trials and gaining loot that's BEYOND the level of EP gear, but you have a problem with an EP paladin getting that SAME loot not BEYOND it. Then you guys REALLY need to have another standown and have SoE /chardel all paladins in EQ.</div></div><hr />

1. you probably can tank all these mobs.<br />
2. its not important for your progression anymore anyways, you are way past Druav Sol Ro and Fennin.<br />
<br />
Did you risk sleep deprevation during EQ? What makes you think those that started earlier are? My guild raids 19:00 to 23:00, sometimes midnight, and we killed quarm (before you). Talk about social raid hours, what a bunch of BS<br />
What loot are you referring to that a non EP Warrior could get? <br />
Bracer of the Heartstriker is probably the very edge of what a VT Warrior can get, and its gonna be very close for him to tank Hearstriker J in tipt, dont forget that guy has a rather large rampage.<br />
<br />
how about you saying something of importance now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">Why does Taragor keep talking about a VT-geared warrior and an elemental geared paladin like VT just has some kind of pre-elemental crap?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">I have no idea where you get that impression from Tugurok. AHR loot is on par with some elemental drops, however due to the slow respawn of VT you will most likely not have many AHR loots, but alot of the 85-110 h/m stuff which is SERIOUSLY below the 130 h/m stuff you get from minis, and the 150 stuff from the 4 gods is way superior to anything you will see in VT.<br />
Not even to mention the far superior focus and ATK effects. You wont find 30% DD focus in VT, not the same quality of healing focus, not the same spell hastes. <br />
<br />
VT is clearly pre-elemental but can I see your magelo maybe Tugurok ? :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">Hello? Earth to Trondir? <br />
<br />
I said *EPs*. See, that's short for ELEMENTAL PLANES, not Time.<br />
<br />
Keep working at it; it'll come to you.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point Taragor was making, that a VT geared warrior should be sucking compared to a EP knight, is bogus, all of Trondir's dick-waving to the side, though I'm proud of Trondir for having figured out how to put VT loots into a magelo (but why is he using a boc and not a bloodfrenzy? ah well, baby steps)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">ok, please tell me what Time loot I mentioned. Must have slipped here.<br />
I asked a warrior twice of your worth what a top VT warrior would use. he said BoC HG; cause all VT weapon drops kinda suck the goat.<br />
<br />
<br />
I said *EPs*. See, that's short for ELEMENTAL PLANES, not Time. <br />
you said &quot;AHR loot on par with Time loot&quot; which is big BS and I responded to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">Some warrior told you a BoC is a better choice than a Bloodfrenzy, and you are too incompetent to know that's completely nuts? Are you even a warrior? I just assumed your magelo was a joke, but I guess not.<br />
<br />
I hate to break it to you and your friend, but a Bloodfrenzy is far superior to a BoC. And AHR loots ARE on par with some Time loots. How many 50 AC masks are there in Time? Of course Time loots exist that replace them, but you certainly aren't sucking if you have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">I'm a retired warrior from the Stromm server, I started with a rusty short sword and the guild tunic, sorry I dont match your twink standards.<br />
<br />
 Heck who cares about the difference BF / BoC now? You said VT loot equals EP loot and a guild could skip EP farming (which they cannot, you'd knew this if you were in time) and go from VT to Time right away.<br />
you claim that AHR loot is better than EP loot and on par with Time loot, which is huge BS as well. <br />
First, you can find equal loot for AHR loot in EP as well, however nobody would take these minimal upgrades from ppl that need them more. AHR loot is sub-par once you beat Phase1 in PoTime and is easily replaced as you farm it.</div></div><hr />

Must people careen from one phoney arguement to the next in a constant weave as if people don't know they are phoney?<br />
<br />
The same access that is granted by the first four trials can is granted by a guild raid.<br />
<br />
Trial #5, Vxed is a slaughter 100 and hail a mob trial. The 100 mobs killed have a max hit of about 1000HP. Named mobs in the zone can be avoided. Except for 1 Heartstriker which isn't bad at all. Vxed is VERY Paladin doable.<br />
<br />
Trial #6, Tipt has 2 hard hitting mobs. One seems to have a version that hits less hard. Those two mobs can be quite difficult, but the list of Paladins and Shadow Knights that have succeed is NOT small. In fact the first of these named mobs is easily reachable, quite killable, and very farmable.<br />
<br />
If you can't cruise into Kod'taz, perhaps just perhaps it's because you don't belong there yet.<br />
<br />
Clerics can probably heal in bazaar loot.<br />
<br />
The deal is that WARRIORS were given Verant/SoE put in place/confirmed in writing/supported by changes/reinforced by further changes ability to be &quot;unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles.&quot;<br />
<br />
You should be gratified that near end of expansion equipment lets you approach a Warrior's ability to survive the most brutal battles.<br />
<br />
Warriors, a 100% pure tanking class, without the ability to affect battle by buffing, healing, Ressing, GRC, etc. etc. of COURSE have some superiority at the ONE thing they do other than general DPS.<br />
<br />
Oh, I forgot, we are also the Masters of armed combat.<br />
<br />
Stop reading the Warriors Class Description and thinking Gee, that would be nice to add to my capability as a Paladin and then lobbying for it.<br />
<br />
1. Many of the flags aren't needed. They are substitutes for Guild raids that grant the nessecary access.<br />
<br />
2. Paladins CAN and HAVE MT'd them anyway.<br />
<br />
3. Paladins CAN MT in GoD experiance groups.<br />
<br />
4. Although no group is guaranteed success against a named mob, Paladin MT'd groups can already, this soon in the expansion, kill named mobs and farm loot.<br />
<br />
To the point of entering Kod'taz, Paladins that whine it's too hard have NO case except that it takes more luck and perhaps more healing to do Tipt.<br />
<br />
Beyond the first 6 trials, Paladins may have legitimate complaints. But a lot of what is claimed and the equipment level of those claiming it is a testament to how phoney much of the Paladin campaign to acquire Warrior-like mitigation or get a Warrior mitigation nerf is.<br />
<br />
Their foolishness actually will make it MORE dificult for those Paladins encountering real problems to get a hearing on class boards and by SoE.<br />
<br />
Aeka is in fact one of those most active in efforts to hybridize Warriors and remove Defensive from the game.<br />

My point is that some classes must accquire the best possible equipment to do some tasks and others do not. Paladins must acquire BETTER equipment than Warriors to perform as well vs. high DI mobs. Clerics and as you point out, Wizards can perform without the &quot;best&quot;. There, DO YOU GET IT YET?<br />
<br />
You show me one thing in your class description the says anything beyond primarily melee. Anything that says &quot;able to MT the most brutal mobs in the game just like Warriors.&quot; It's not there. It never was there.<br />
<br />
By equipment alone is a Paladin able to MT high DI mobs that resist stuns - no discipline/no caster hand waggling substitutes for this need.<br />
<br />
The integrety of the game does not require Paladins to be able to MT the most dificult high DI mobs as easiliy as a Warrior. I believe it's a good thing that as they acquire end of expansion equipment they can.<br />
<br />
Nobody died and made me king.<br />
<br />
But Verant and SoE promised and delivered on my &quot;unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot;. As it turns out these are the mobs at our current frontiers. These mobs change as we progress.<br />
<br />
This was NOT a promise made to hybrids and if they had it, Warriors would no longer be unmatched.<br />

Hey dopey. I'm not in PoTime. I'm in EP. If you're going to insult me why don't you get your facts straight first. I'm arguing with the damn warriors who ARE in PoTime who cleared the first 5 trials while sticking fingers up their asses and actually had to hit A to pass the 6 trial that the discrepencies between paladins and warriors at the lower levels of GoD are immense due to the mitigation changes and their def disc. <br />

Interesting. I'm 3rd best healer in the game and the highest shaman and paladin in your guild agree. Ok, I'll have to remember that next time I do PoE xp and tell the warrior &quot;Healer? Hell no we don't need one, I can do it, I heal better than a shaman&quot;<br />
<br />
Stop wasting space, the ONLY thing I do better than a shaman in heals is fast heals and group heals. Now the fact that I have the FASTEST heal doesn't mean I heal BETTER or else I'd be #1 healer in the game since my heal is faster than a clerics. Secondly the only other way I heal better than a shaman is group healing since they don't have group heals. <br />
<br />
Now if YOU think I'm 3rd best healer in the game cause I can combine my fastest heal of 850hp with my group heal of 900hp to surpass the healing capabilities of a shaman, I think the shaman in your guild needs to play a warrior and your pally needs a reality check.</div></div><hr />

good thing I am naked right now. lets see.<br />
I can cast 1 SoS for 30% of my naked mana, thats 3 SoS, another one with Harvest used.<br />
Since I am naked, no ID focus applies, so the base of 2740 is there. <br />
Since I am naked, I miss 20% of my spell haste.<br />
Since I am naked, I cant use elemental legs to concussion away (your guild at least got some of those, dont they?!)<br />

<br />
I'm level 65 with 300 plus AA and in EP, i can tank a little i think <br />
<br />
this time last year i wasn't able to tank much past the POJ trials <br />
I would NEVER have dreamed of posting on a board that i couldn't hold agro against Rallos Zek the Warlord , seeing as i'd be nowhere near that mob for a VERY long time <br />
<br />
<br />
so why is anyone wishing to whine about whether or not Paladins ( i noticed few SK's whining ) should be able to tank stuff , or to be more honest ,1 or 2 paladins who cannot currently tank the mobs in question , that would totally remove the needs for Warriors from the game .<br />
<br />
Earlier in the thread it was suggested that Pallies wanteed to be the Holy Knight or similar , to Heroically MT everything ? well guess what , that class DOES NOT EXIST !<br />
<br />
I want to be GANDALF ! a cross between a druid , ranger wizzie and whatever and be GREAT at them all  <br />
<br />
hmm Strange , there doesn't seem to be a Gandalf listed in the class descriptions <br />

Well, just goes to the title of my post, gotta love PoN administration....<br />
<br />
I remember reading a recent post on PoN directed at the administration, saying that one of the problems got banned &lt;meaning me&gt;, and the other problems, &lt;meaning the rest of the warriors&gt; will find ways to get themselves banned soon too. Paraphrasing here, but it's close to 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
I think the &quot;problem&quot; they're referring to is the voices that are showing that Paladins domn't suck nearly as bad as PoN would like SoE to believe. =P</div></div><hr />

Hey dopey. I'm not in PoTime. I'm in EP. If you're going to insult me why don't you get your facts straight first. I'm arguing with the damn warriors who ARE in PoTime who cleared the first 5 trials while sticking fingers up their asses and actually had to hit A to pass the 6 trial that the discrepencies between paladins and warriors at the lower levels of GoD are immense due to the mitigation changes and their def disc. <br />
  <br />
<br />
Your the moronic dope, whining about stuff you aren't even geared for, loser! Hit /played, see that number (prob like 300+) means you play EQ to much if it is over 100 (and you had best be in the game from the original expansion for that). There is no jealously, I am laughing at your wasted life, plugged into EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u216"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p216">Well actually, it doesn't suck.<br />
<br />
Before the Phase 1 Melee Update we had a nice debate about wether an inate Warrior 386HP advantage after AoTC was fair and if the Warrior Class Description meant it when it said we should be able to make ourselves the focus of attacks. Some Paladins argued that we were on a different mitigation table and Paladins were created the Masters of Aggro - that was their special game niche from initial release, etc. Some Paladin said he has never memed a spell.<br />
<br />
But AO having non-Warriors tank all of PoTime galvanized the Warrior community and eventually SoE acted.<br />
<br />
Aeka argued for hybridizing Warriors giving us utility and having us all tank the same.<br />
<br />
After the Phase 1 Melee Update to help achieve balance, some Paladins wanted compensatory changes since their spellbook was useless. Then Paladin_A or Paladin_B said it was the end of the Paladin class and Paladins should get Defensive. We agreed SoE couldn't expect Knights to tank high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
GoD came out and within 2 weeks someone said Paladins have lost their group role and another said Paladins can't get any flags. Arbosch called us all stupid and either Paladin_A or Paladin_B called for Defensive being removed from the game or given to Paladins. Aeka argued that we should all tank the same and Warriors need utility. Graal argued Warrior aggro broke the game so Paladins should get Defensive.<br />
<br />
Frodlin tried to find a compromise. I quoted scripture (class descriptions) and after enough bible thumping on my part got banned.<br />
<br />
As they used to say in old movie theaters, this is where I came in. Kether will declare he's gathering irrufutable proof Defensive should be removed from the game or given to Paladins, Aeka will call Defensive a relic of early broken functionality, and Graal will say Incite broke the game. Madrone will furrow his brow mightily and poot a thoughtlet into the interweb (yw).<br />
<br />
SoE will fix things and 7200HP unbuffed Paladins will screem they can't tank DD and Defensive should be given to Paladins.<br />

Unfortunately, I can no longer read PoN and will therefore have some difficulty insuring that my facts are precise.<br />
<br />
If you never posted and discussed a self-buff, ability, or discipline that allowed Paladins to increase their &quot;burst mitigation', I do apologize.<br />
--------<br />
Those Paladins that beat the drums for &quot;balance&quot; really have little understanding of EQ. For most of us this is not a PvP game, it's PvE. Classes don't compete with each other except for spots in normal experiance groups - parties kill mobs.<br />
<br />
A Main Healer Role was created for Clerics.<br />
<br />
There IS no balance. Clerics SHOULD be *The Prime Healer* in the game. Sure, Druid and Shaman can be main healers for normal experiance groups. They can be backup healers or rotation healers for the Rampage tank or Add Tank.<br />
<br />
But Druids are not going to be as successful as a Cleric being Main Healer for a group doing LDoN Hard Assassinate or the GoD trials as they are currently designed. When you need *The Prime Healer*, you group a Cleric.<br />
<br />
The same is true for Warriors and the &quot;......unmatched ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; There is NO balance. Warriors are the BEST MT vs. high DI mobs. Warriors are *The Heavy Tank*.<br />
<br />
A named mob that hits for 2100HP's and regularly wipes out high-level groups is a brutal battle. There's NO getting around it. Get a Cleric and a Warrior and stfu or petition SoE that it's Tooooo Haaaaard.<br />
<br />
Do Knight's need &quot;burst mitigation&quot;? Sure, probably, but not Defensive. Druids don't heal like Clerics and Knights shouldn't get Warrior-like &quot;burst mitigation&quot;.<br />
<br />
Frodlin was right. Look at the &quot;burst mitigation&quot; non-Warrior melees get. It's not Defensive - it's things like Weapon Shield. Now that might be appropriate for Knights, but not Defensive by another name or by another method.<br />
---------<br />
I'd invite you to debate Derringer despite our differences. But I'm a little weary of the spoiled-brat mid-level Paladins atm (not including you) and their phony arguments, concealed information, lust for Defensive and posting about zones and fights they should not see until after their 20th or so PoTime clearing. And they do not appear to be able to restrain themselves from yipping on the porch when the bigger dogs are hunting nearby.<br />

<br />
Single group content. Repeat after me, single group content. One of these days it may seep in.  <br />
<br />
this is one of the few times i will ever see eye to eye with you, its bullshit you need time loot(raids, 30+ peps) to be able to do 6 man content, its like a fatman trying to get into size 11 pants.<br />
<br />
this expantion needs to have all its content ment for 6 people or less reduced to ornate required level slightly above that.<br />
<br />
what they are really doing is cutting corners by taking the hardcore from being raid only to being &quot;hardcore group&quot; so they can save on raid encounters and group stuff world space<br />
<br />
(less world space for theses epic battles to take place= cheaper to run zones = they get to keep more of our money)<br />
<br />
it should take 1 group content to do 1 group content<br />
<br />
i will say that any paladin that beleaves that having maybe  .007 percent of 6 man group mobs untankable by them, or maybe 10 mobs out of GoD in raid format untankable needs to get a rattle and a diaper, i bet you not even 5 percent of the player base from each server will spend more than a few weeks there before relising its not worth it, <br />
<br />
** .007 percent DOESNT BREAK THE GD'd GAME! **<br />
<br />
hell its trials, you probibly wont be doing these unless you HAVE to to flag someone else, its not like people LIKE doing them over and over, and not like people will log more than 2 days play time in that one zone over the next few months, this is just and excuse to ask for new toys, you got spells with GoD, all we got was a new tome that doesnt really do anything we couldnt  before, and with the level of weapons and gear the people using it have, it wont be more than a grain of salt in a shaker</div></div><hr />

<br />
There might be a problem with GoD trials. That has NOTHING to do with the absurd feeding frenzy at PoN. 18 months in god mode clearly spoiled paladins, who very obviously want to be warriors with spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Edit: Are you actually banned, Burly, not just warned? If so, that's a total disgrace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u225"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p225">Here is the post Battleblade wrote which got him warned (banned?) at PoN:<br />
<br />
Just to clear the record:<br />
Buff a Paladin with no buffs using a Cleric. Determine the total number of HP's added. Click off the buffs. Do it with a Shaman, a Druid, a Ranger, any class at all. Now have that Paladin buff himself. Which buffing class buffs the most HPs?<br />
<br />
My point about LoH and to a lesser extent Soulfire. Who has the single biggest heal in the game? Don't quote Warrior aggro as an advantage by tossing DBow/EoE at us either.<br />
<br />
My general point about Paladin clerical abilities - this is not the lower 40% of the Cleric's spell book. For a melee Paladins have a huge spell repitoire. Would anyone in their right mind suggest a Combat Medic role for a Ranger? Such spells are not free in class balance. The power they represent is and should be deducted from Tanking capability.<br />
<br />
My point about Incite. PoJ trials were faaaaaar long gone history when Incite was added to assist LOW level Warrior with a fundamental tanking ability given to them in their Class Description that was not unique to a single class. High level PoTime Warriors had no major problems with aggro - Paladins have said so on PoN.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, the Warrior Class description does not give them the spells found in the Paladin spell instead it gives them the &quot;umatched&quot; ability to survive the most brutal battles. If a mob that hits for 2k HP's+ and regularly wipes groups isn't brutal, then you tell me what is.<br />
<br />
Need it nerfed because your class can't handle it? Fine cut both it's DB and DI in half.<br />
<br />
But you aren't entitled to match a Warrior's &quot;unmatched&quot; ability to survive the most brutal battles anymore than a Druid should CH.<br />
<br />
BB <br />
<br />
Here is Gilfalas's reply and reasoning:<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
While we agree in that ALL experience group content should be tankable by any of the three tanks, we tend to disagree in the concept that all 6 man content is intended or even should be intended to be experience group content. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
No, your misquoting me. NOWHERE have I stated anything at all about EXPERIENCE group content. I have universally and sxplisitly used the terms single group or one group content.<br />
<br />
I do not care if it is an XP group, flag group, trial, day at the beach, knitting circle, spelling bee, nuclear weapon test or whatever (even the infamous purpple jello). If it is content aimed at a 6 person group, all three tanks should be valid choices. Period. No but's. No exeptions. No if's. Nada. Zip. Nul. Void. Zed.<br />
<br />
Am I clear yet?<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Again, it still wouldn't allow knights to tank the content, but it certainly would fall in line with your philosophy of 6 person content being more or less sacred as being fair to all 3 classes.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you ahve read my posts you would have seen me state this very thing on several occasions in regards to these challenges.<br />
<br />
If it is RAID content (and no I do not accept and never will accept the falacious hypocrycy that is termed the 'one group raid') that requires 2+ groups and a warrior to tank I am fine with that. I have lived with that for years.<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
PoJ trials were faaaaaar long gone history when Incite was added to assist LOW level Warrior with a fundamental tanking ability given to them in their Class Description that was not unique to a single class.<br />

<br />
OK BB for the first time I think your totally full of @#%$. YOU were one of the single loudest warriors SCREAMING out that the aggro deficiency wa sa class wide issue at all levels and now you come her and have the gall to about face and lie and say that it was only a, and I QUOTE 'LOW level Warrior' issue?<br />

My point about LoH and to a lesser extent Soulfire. Who has the single biggest heal in the game? Don't quote Warrior aggro as an advantage by tossing DBow/EoE at us either.<br />

<br />
I ahve never once mentioned time weapons in any post I have made. No one I know has them.<br />
<br />
As for your further garbage on Lay Hands and Soulfire, I will chalk that up to trolling and give you the appropriate warning. I am assuming your not as moronic as the statement would seem to make you be and that you realise how rediculous and infmatory such a statement actually is. <br />

It's a total joke.<br />
<br />
Here's my reply, btw<br />
<br />
Man, these &quot;warnings&quot; and bannings handed out to people who have different ideas than you are just about the lamest things I've seen.<br />
<br />
How about &quot;warning&quot; Taragor for the insane modifications he's proposed? How about &quot;warning&quot; Barrand for calling for invulnerability for paladins 17% of the time? How about &quot;warning&quot; Kether and Graal for wanting to nakedly appropriate key warrior abilities? How about &quot;warning&quot; Graal for such OBVIOUSLY trollish comments like calling the acquisition of a hategiver, a bloodfrenzy, 2 anger III augments, Aten gloves, and WA5 &quot;relatively easy to attain&quot;. It's a HELL of a lot easier to get a fully charged soulfire than it is to get what Graal calls &quot;easy to attain&quot;. Where's his warning? <br />
<br />
I guess we know why he hasn't gotten one.<br />
<br />
I actually don't mind a little moderation. But I certainly object when it is so NAKEDLY prejudicial. Anyway, I'm out of here. Paladins can nod up and down in unison among themselves about how they must have defensive all they like. <br />
<br />
I personally think all warriors should just leave PoN until Gilfalas gets reined in. I won't be going there any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u226"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p226">Well, I will reply here and call it a day.<br />
<br />
While we agree in that ALL experience group content should be tankable by any of the three tanks....<br />
I stated where we agreed afaik, one place where we disagreed, and did not state this was our only disagreement on 6-person content. I did not misquote - I didn't quote at all.<br />
<br />
Yes, I did argue that the Warrior Class Description indicates Warriors should be able to make themselves the focus of their enemies attacks (read it if you wish). I argued that Warriors should have adequate aggro control at all levels.<br />
<br />
Warriors and Paladins alike stated at that time, before Incite and LDoN augs, that high level Warriors with BoWs, Aten gloves, etc. had little problem and that higher level Warriors with DBoW/EoE, Symbol of the Planesmaster, and Reax BP's had no issues at all.<br />
<br />
At the time I discussed those issues I used a BoC and SeM - no Aten Glove and no Reax BP. I argued given my experiances and the Warrior Class Description.<br />
<br />
Since then, I have obtained DBoW/EoE, Symbol of the Planesmaster, and Reax BP and must conceed that the aggro issue was in fact primarily a low-level poorly equipped Warrior issue - just like I stated in my post.<br />
<br />
Incite and the LDoN procs address range aggro and initial aggro issues to provide a more balanced result, but not one absolutely needed by high level well equipped Warriors.<br />
<br />
However, &quot;needed&quot; (an SoE representative's word used in a interview) aggro control improvements has NO bearing on the GoD debate - none.<br />
<br />
The &quot;-1 DI&quot; change and 500HP's for 60AA might have bearing since SoE recently intoduced them to distance Warrior surivability form Knight's, but I note that this fact which does impact GoD MTing is ignored.<br />
<br />
My comments about Paladin's being the biggest HP buffer in the game, LoH and Soulfire, etc. were clearly directed at inflamitory comments made by Graal about Warrior Aggro Control. I was pointing out just how trollish such random comments are in the issue being debated. Don't want to talk about HP buffing capability, the size of your biggest heals, etc. then leave DWoW/EoE, Bloodfrenzy, and the rest of that stuff out of the debate. The entire paragraph shows the context.<br />
<br />
In truth, you will see Paladins making the most outragious comments unchallanged by the moderator, swearing a bluestreak, etc.<br />
<br />
Is Aeka banned here for calling several times for Defensive to be nerfed or removed from the game without giving Warriors full compensation in their always present mitigation? Nope.<br />
<br />
If Gilfalas choses to become deeply involved with debate on a board he moderates and use the ability to ban as his best arguement, then that's his priviledge.<br />
<br />
Now frankly some people don't like debate. IMO they should avoid places where they know it is being conducted.<br />
<br />
All six-person groups can not equally perform in all content. That's a fact. The GoD trials are not good evidence that Knights should get Defensive or Druids should get CH. That's opinion. (I hope I don't get banned for expressing it) :D <br />

<br />
Here's one of the recent beauts to appear on PoN (from Dagny Firestorm):<br />
<br />
As for the mitigation boosts that paladins will receive, you have to consider that knights did not have suitable high DI mitigation for 5 years while Mob DPS was increasing. Knights went without high DI mitigation through Kunark, Velious, Luclin, PoP, and LDoN. (Divine Aura has an 18 minute recycle time and is not effective for tanking high DI single group mobs.) That's a lot of content to go through without high DI mitigation. In contrast, I saw warriors asking for improvements based on 1% of all known content (PoP exp groups). <br />
<br />
You can't coach that! That's just all raw ability there. (Bold mine, and that was her entire message, so don't worry about selective quoting.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">Its simple, Paladins want to be Warriors WITH a spellbook! EQ is to hard for them, even though the game has been made easier, INCLUDING Kunark, at every expansion. <br />
I believe Warriors need the SK/Pal spell books since they both claim they are &quot;worthless&quot; (only when it is to make a point, otherwise they exploit the books to the fullest) , so why would it matter?! I'm an honorable guy (honest) and I won't exploit the spell books+ Warrior, hhhhooooonnneesssstttt I won't!</div></div><hr />

Gerick, the point here is to move people along.   People who are finished with the previous expansion are moving out and leaving room for those who haven't yet.   The point here is a concept called &quot;Progression&quot;, for the same reaosn you're locked out of the Elemental planes, you're locked out of GoD.   Just because something is designed for lesser numbers doesn't mean that it needs to not be a challenge.  If you're not up to the challenge, don't go.  Go get up to the challenge, and THEN go.

 Sony should post a goddamned sign on the entrance to the Ikkinz trials 'Quarm killers only need apply'. That would make the EP and lower folks who have no sense of progression finally stop and figure out what it means. I hear enough anecdotal evidence of Paladins with handy amounts of Time loot tanking these things. The people who are squalling the loudest - some have barely scratched Time for loot, some are still in EP, hell, some aren't even fucking 65 yet.<br />
<br />
 GoD is where the big kids play, folks - bruised ego? Too fucking bad. You must be THIS tall to go on the ride, and if you're not, go farm the fucking elevator shoes you need to do it.</div></div><hr />

I never cried before incite, asshat. Go search the board for me pre-december post. Now hush newb, this discussion is as much for level 62 as it is for level 65 clerics with 2k hp :P <br />
<br />
Awwww, he called me a newb. How sweet.<br />
<br />
Ya, sig says level 62. Sorry cockgobbler if I have better things to do than update my sig for you.<br />
<br />
All I see are a bunch of self centred, whiny bitches in warriors. You went crying to SOE for years about taunt saying how you were worthless for anything but raids. Guess what? You are worthless for anything but raids. MT the boss mob, die like a good little bitch and shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
GoD is a worthless piece of shit expansion, so it seems fitting that warriors are in love with it.<br />
<br />
I love warriors, you give them the fixes they whined about and still find fault. Bitches.</div></div><hr />

If you were 62 in october when you registered, you most likely are STILL not the targeting audience for GoD<br />
You're kinda like the cleaning guy wiping my desk after I leave the work for the day that complains the new Ferrari is too expensive for him.<br />

Your the worthless piece of shit, you play the god char of the week. Prob was a Necro then dr00d. PLed n00b is all you are, we all get a laugh you wasted all the time making 62 with a Paladin and never figured out you were designed as a #2 tank.<br />
1. Second choice<br />
2. Back-up<br />
3. Not the best at it<br />
Its the DUMBASS knights like you that give the rest a bad name. Hey, let me clue you in. You have UTILITY abilities, you have to PAY for those. You don't want them, PLAY YOUR WARRIOR! That spellbook cost you, you are just to STUPID to figure out how to exploit it, and where to do so. Go where you can exploit it, GoD laughs at you. PoP, Luclin, LDoN, Velious are your playgrounds.</div></div><hr />

Banned! :D <br />
<br />
I missed why, etc. but obviously it's because I steadfastly argued that Paladins should not receive Defensive because of the trials.<br />
<br />
BB  <br />
<br />
WOOT! The greedy asshole Paladins banned you! You should be proud! They are the biggest piece of shit group of players in EQ right now. They were the Necromancers when EQ started, the Druid after Necro got WELL deserved nerfs. The overpowered class of the week player. Screw them all to hell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u240"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p240">Well, actually I don't feel that way at all. I think all classes should be fun to play and be able to contribute. Both Class and encounter design determine if these goals are reached.<br />
<br />
I do think Warriors have a survivability advantage provided by more HP's, &quot;-1 DI&quot;, and Defensive that should be preserved and have real value vs. mobs encountered during progression. This has provided Warriors with a role as preferred MT's vs. high DI mobs particularly in raids.<br />
<br />
I believe Paladins are Tanks too and should be able to contribute as Tanks in groups and raids, but be disadvantaged vs. high DI mobs (and advantaged vs. other types of mobs).<br />
<br />
A dozen or so PoN posters disagree.<br />
<br />
Vocal Warriors or Paladins certainly do not represent the views of the vast majority of their peers. At the same time, the discussions are read by SoE and may help move forward things like the Phase 1 Melee Changes that benefit even those who wish we'd put a sock in it :rolleyes: <br />

on that page i say people dont hang around trials for xp or loot, they just progress, so it doesnt break the game because it doesnt break groups, so i do agree with you on that much at least, &quot;get pushed thru and stop complaining&quot;<br />

2 recent expansions which catered to casual and lower end players, and now it's time for one that caters to us exclusivist bastards who FOR GOOD REASON dont' want to be experiencing the same content as you.  <br />
<br />
and what are you smoking here? LDoN is one, and it wasnt in a row, it has nowhere near the content of luclin, vel, pop OR god, it was a mini expantion, and LoY? that is a flaming pile of dog crap<br />
<br />
in the history of EQ, there has been more raiding expantions since the birth of velius than any other type<br />
<br />
hell i hope they give you alot more 6-8 hour raids like luclin so you wont be bothering me much anymore<br />
<br />
at least each expantion had SOMETHING for non raiders, but GoD is complete, balls to the wall, assnine content</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am replying to this shit expansion by, cheat me once shame on you, cheat me twice shame on me. SOE isn't selling me another expansion even remotely marketed for raid people! 90% of my guild didn't buy it as we warned them, that cost SOE a whole lot and is why they are still peddling this steaming pile of shit that only 1% of the EQ population wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">Gilfalas strikes again! Now he &quot;warns&quot; Landrain for the following:<br />
<br />
The only level playing field I see will occur.... <br />
<br />
Is if paladins get 75% defensive, get a 40% dps boost, get a 98% rez, get 90% snares, get 6k nukes, an any zone TL spells, a 100% Mez that lasts 5 at a minimum, a pet that does 100dps and no-fail FD, oh and a 80% slow...<br />
<br />
then the Paladins would be perfectly balanced against every other class.. <br />
<br />
Because of course, no one should be better than paladins at anything. I mean its not like a warirors sole and only job or responsibility is Tanking...<br />
<br />
Tanking IS balanced between warriors and knights. Anything that We can tank (NON-DEFENSIVE) you can tank with an identical group/gear... <br />
<br />
The ONLY thing unbalanced is Defensive... but then thats about as useful as the 120+ spells, Class Only Abilities and AA's...<br />
<br />
Defensive is powerful and unbalanced, and it was DESIGNED that way... What WAS NOT designed was encounters limited to ONE group that REQUIRE defensive...<br />
<br />
[this added by gilfalas]<br />
OK consider this a warning for trolling. This post is purely to incite a negative reaction. Landrain your other posts prove your smarter than this. Please make your arguments rational and intelligent. - Gilf <br />
<br />
What a jackass.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, there are threads on PoN titled stuff like &quot;Why I hate warriors&quot; and rants from fools like Arbosch, Soledragondead/Seventhsword, and a number of others which he passes by without comment, not to mention plenty of false or incendiary stuff from many PoN regulars.<br />
<br />
I really think warriors should just leave PoN -- it's simply not a level playing field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u245"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p245">that is bullshit, he makes a excellent post and gets blammed for it.<br />
<br />
he points out that they arnt a dps class, arnt a caster class, arnt a CC class, and that no paladins thinks its okey to beat out the other classes in those area's, but let it come down to tanking, and they can fuck the master class, *****prefered****** model of tanking however they feel, and he does point out the only thing differnt as far as groups go is our save your own ass ability/raid ability, and SK/paladins have their own version as well. (ok, HT and LoH needs faster fresh and made to be a discpline, but thats about it)<br />
<br />
<br />
and im so sorry that you chose a spell book instead of defensive, need a hankie?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">God forbid we are challanged.GoD does fine.<br />
How else were they supposed to challenge us? VT v2.0? No thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">Warnings?  WTF is that?  I got banned for calling Gilfalas &quot;arrogant&quot; when he spent ten paragraphs describing how he could mitigate 100 percent damage for up to 15 seconds with his stun repertoire on inc while XPing in PoE.<br />
<br />
Haha I didn't get a warning just a boot.<br />
<br />
Grats on your banning, consider it a badge of honor as the board juxtaposes itself into a regurgitation of the &quot;poor paladin&quot; theorists.  They were the God class of PoP.  Poor guys, they have fallen from Gods to Mods.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">not fallen, its more like old school gothic where pre patch you could have keys to use potions, even if you where being hit, no drink time/animation time required, then they patched it and everyone bitched the game got to hard.<br />
<br />
basically their ~ key no longer brings down the consle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">Ok, they want real ideas to fix the supposed problem.I saw several mentions of &quot;at least 25% extra mitigation&quot;.<br />
So here was my idea:<br />
<br />
<br />
An AA ability for Knights that when maxed would give 25%mitigation on a 10 minute timer.<br />
Cost 10 AAs per 5% Mitigation<br />
5 levels = 50 AA cost = Total 25%<br />
Required Level 65<br />
Required all previous defensive AAs (LR etc)<br />
When used it also uses a 25%-50% chunk of your mana<br />
GoD required expansion to train the AAs<br />
<br />
Its like a lesser version of defensive, and costs LESS than our 500hp does.The idea was mostly ignored except for this bright chap.<br />
<br />
SlvrThndr7 you have a totally great idea that after pal's finish grinding all possible useful tank aa's they then can spend 50 more aa's to get a def disc 30% /- less then what warriors get for merely passing a mid 50's level. I'll support that suggestion as soon as warriors whine and get incite to work on only non GoD mobs since clearly warriors in the best of gear never whined of aggro problem and as every warrior here has said GoD trials are only meant for the &quot;best&quot;....... <br />
<br />
/waits for warriors to jump on and support this totally FARE IDEA. <br />
<br />
Moderators may I ask how one goes about ex pressings one's beliefs that some people are being dis genuine with their views/logic with out using anything considered personal attacks or poor paladin behavior. I value my posting privilege here.  <br />
<br />
This kind of response shows why its not a eal complaint but a b1tch fest on the most part.I offer a real solution to what they request,and because it doesnt = what a warrior has+ , it gets ignored or laughed at.<br />
<br />
I rest my case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">The reason that was ignored is because there was a better one already on the table.  The person you squoted is &quot;soledragondead&quot; and anyone who's been around PoN for any period of time knows that Soledragondead is none other than the guy who used to be known as &quot;Seventhsword&quot;, a person who has the respect of an entire zero people on those boards.</div></div><hr />
