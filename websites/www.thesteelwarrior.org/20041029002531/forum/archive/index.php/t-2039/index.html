<br />
I have a couple of questions.  <br />
Mobs apparently can get roll a success for flurry from a miss?<br />
Mobs get 5 additional rounds PLUS the 4 from the origional round so 9 hits and 1 bash in one round?<br />
Anyone else geting deaths from pain and suffering?<br />
<br />
I thought it was suposed to be ONE addition swing I know when PC's FLURRRY we sure as hell don't get 9 rounds in.  I'm  sure when tanking the AOWar he didn't take 9 swings at me in one round.  When he was successful on a flurry he would swing 5 times in a round.<br />
<br />
I've looked through the rest of my logs a bit and see other named mobs taking 9 and 10 swings in one round when successful on a flurry roll.  Fix this crist.  If you want to have mobs able to hit 9 or 10 times in one round make the message...<br />
Ofossaa the Enlightened goes APESHIT on Brutall!<br />
A flurry by their definition is TWO adittional attacks in a melee round not 5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe you took 3 ripostes?<br />
<br />
Would fit with the 4 attacks + 1 bash + 2 attacks from flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He got 9 or 10 attacks in on the same round EVERY FLURRY.  Also found this on several other mobs.  <br />
<br />
Guardian of Coirnav 9 attacks on every flurry<br />
Hydro hits 7 or 8 times on successful flurry<br />
<br />
Didn't  pull logs from fire yet but I would guess to find the same situation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe... Anyone remember the days when you could kill Pain and Suffering? Was a little mob in Paineel that was kinda like the &quot;Water Source&quot; mobs and such (i.e. it wasn't so much a mob as a static object). Oh well, VI/SOE fixed that.<br />
<br />
No clue about the other stuff though, never really pay attention. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
notice the target box (above group window below personal window) and the name of the mob hitting me in the chatbox.<br />
<br />
Ironically my fully buffed hps there are less than my unbuffed hps now :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lilcure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The real shaft of this post is that DI still isn't fixed (or heal bug in general for that matter)<br />
<br />
You were healed for 4800 then took 490+1832 in damage and died.  Seem to remember a patch a  few back about this supposedly being fixed ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Flurry was originally just 1 full round of attacks from the mob correct? If it quadded Flurry would be 4 + kick/bash. if it doubles then 2 + kick/bash. Etc etc.<br />
<br />
 Not sure about that log section. Offassa slow much? Did it wear off? Just looking at it quickly I would *think* that this is the actual Flurry<br />

 And the rest is normal melee. Log only counts in full seconds, it's entirely possible even a small tiny little bit of lag would make it look like extra attacks in the same second. Other than that uhhh...I dunno. Haven't logged any big ele plane fights, will start to now to look out for this.</div></div><hr />
