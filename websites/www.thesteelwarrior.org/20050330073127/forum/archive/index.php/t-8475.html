We got him to 6% on our first attempt tonight.  The only issue we had was mainly the FD on the MT.  We had the MT stand up immediately and taunt but they couldnt keep agro.<br />
<br />
So we tried tank switching which worked fair but not the best.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on this fight please.<br />
<br />
If you wish email me at shaffer0420@hotmail.com<br />

If you got him to 6 on your first attempt, you are on the right track, some guilds take weeks to get him that low while learning. <br />
<br />
just keep trying what you did before, work out a few kinks and youll get it.</div></div><hr />

6% on first try with the strats is still pretty good, though you'll get more out of raiding figuring it out yourself.</div></div><hr />

This problem isn't that hard to solve. Won't exactly say how, but just remember back to Luclin and how to deal with cursed and seru.</div></div><hr />

I do appreciate everyones responses.</div></div><hr />

Obvious your lying to yourself, cause you posted here asking for info, plus 6% first try? Meaning you already had pre-info to the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyways since this game is ruined anyways, and theres no surprises anymore. People beating uqua 2nd try? Heres how you do vallon zek time, 20 warriors, 20 clerics, 32 wizards, should do the trick.</div></div><hr />

I just turn towards the wall when he enrages.</div></div><hr />

I guess I was mistaken when I thought forums were there as a source of information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow, ok, don't spam it the whole fight, just spam it for 90% of the fight.<br />
<br />
I figured a guy tanking Time VZ could be trusted with some common sense....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MezViia</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you turn away from a mob when it enrages?

<br />
If you can tank him for 90%, turning to the side a tad when he enrages shouldn't kill you, while leaving attack on while facing him will, and letting him turn on rage due to a slow /stand, or dying because of /stand /attack on during rage would likely wipe half of the melee not paying attention. Could make two seperate hotkeys I suppose, but I do what works for me.... use the same hotkeys for the ikkinz mobs, where if you dont have attack on you can actually lose aggro, granted they die in about 60 seconds...</div></div><hr />

These forums are a source of information, just not a source of spoilers, atleast not for end-ish game content.<br />
<br />
I like to think most people who ran up against Vallon got owned getting him down to 90ish% on the 1st try and thought &quot;fuck that was hard, how are we going to deal with that&quot;.  Then they tried again and again with a couple of different ideas, then went back to their MBs and discussed it while they were at work the next day, some bright spark came up with some different ideas so next night they cleared phase 1 again and had another 3 goes... and repeat until you beat it.<br />
<br />
The reason no one here wants to just tell you how to do it is because the people who went through the above senario know how fucking awesome it feels to beat what is one of the hardest encounters in PoP after working it out for themselves.  Everyone deserves to get that kinda buzz outta EQ.  Its what we play for isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you multi tank, raid doesnt have to worry about controlling agro or MT standing up fast enough, just send in 2 tanks defensive on him. you should try to single tank of course, it is easier if they do, but plan on him switching agro. just re-assist heal after each heal. you will have to leave at least 2 dedicated healers on the secondary tank.<br />
<br />
i dont know what the trick is, i know everyone uses the stand hotkey, but agro still bounces around to 2nd tank at least twice or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aguktawarrior</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is because the second tank is useing aggro weapons no? While the primary tank is massive stunned =D We single tank him and have since we tried to multi-tank for our first like 2 goes. We didnt have the healing power to do that so we worked out a solution for single tanking, and found that the stand hotkey is not the only thing thatll mitigate the fd...<br />
<br />
I always tank VZ because our other tanks are lazy and dislike spamming a key over and over again. The only times I lose aggro is when I die or some silly melee engages at 100percent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bractos</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Click snare items (swollen fungusbeast gland, sceptre of the forlorn).   Best way to keep him on the MT and from jumping the clerics if he stuns your MT  instead of the RT  early on.     Pretty common knowledge and something you likely know already.<br />
<br />
Vallon is a pain, and it is a hell of a feeling beating him the first time,  almost as big a rush as that first tallon kill.   The first Rallos was the biggest for me though, even more than Quarm, he's a beast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aguktawarrior</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clicky items are one way to do it, but that is more work then is really needed.<br />
<br />
Our first Time Rallos kill was my high point also, I had those few but great feelings of yay-ness that I rarely get in EQ these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we killed VZ and broke into phase 5.  Then killed CT and Bertox and wiped on RZ at 50% then our time ran out.</div></div><hr />
