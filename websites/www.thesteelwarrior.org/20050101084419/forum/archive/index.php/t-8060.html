Already posted this about 2 hours ago in the Tavern, since stats/skills didn't seem like the forum to post a bug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield also instantly ceases protecting target no matter if under disc or not./shield is not supposed to work while you or the person you are shielding is in a discipline. As far as it not working while out of disciplines, only think I can think of is maybe they made it have a message that you are no longer shielding when someone goes out of the /shield range, instead of going out of it and letting you know you are no longer protecting someone when the time is up on the shielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding only doesn't seem to work with disc that would lower the damage taken (stonewall/defensive at least, haven't tried with furious/fortitude). I can use /shield just fine with evasive.</div></div><hr />

Now about AE taunt..that sucks..and I hope they fix it soon..but until then I guess AE taunt first then disc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sucks that these bugs were not found, but I'm very encouraged by the changes that were made and by the information that's being provided by Sony dev staff about issues they're working on. I'm sure that this will get cleared up within 2 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They postponed it a week and not a single person tried defensive + ae taunt?  Hmm well i'd say they didn't test at all in that week then as that's a relatively common everyday occurance.<br />
<br />
The point is not whether they get it cleared up in 2 days or not...the point is ALL of the competitors out there prevent this shit from happening in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im pretty sure the reason they postponed it was so they could get the buy back aug feature in...which is pretty nice anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe its just more of an indiction as to the lack of the number of competent testers/players banging the code on test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you're in software QA, you are constantly crushed between two competing (and often conflicting) urges: <br />
<br />
1) ship it with all bugs identified and/or corrected, or<br />
2) ship it on time<br />
<br />
Most complex software (and EQ falls in the category) has so many permutations possible in its code that testing each of them in a reasonable time period is literally impossible. QA managers usually draw up a matrix of all those possible scenarios and then take a look at the delivery schedule. In the years I've been involved in software QA, I have never had enough time to test every scenario. So, what you do is create something called an orthogonal array. This tool gives you a way to deploy your test resources in the most efficient manner possible; its intent is to touch as many of the options as possible. The pay off is that you reduce your risk.<br />
<br />
But you're always at risk. And something always gets through. Competitors don't factor in, because they're subject to the same imperatives.</div></div><hr />
