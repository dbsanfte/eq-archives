<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what they make alts for, Glatius.  No class in this game is perfect, and the system seems very generous on allowing you to have alts.<br />
<br />
However, now that I've played the warrior for a while...the other classes just don't seem that involved and immersive.  I get so bored with them, since on my warrior I've got all these abilities I can do and I have to trade off since I only have so much rage.<br />
<br />
I've tried the Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Mage, and Hunter so far (and a tiny bit if Warlock).  All of them bore me so much I end up deleting them...except the Hunter.  The Hunter seems to be closest to the level of interaction I have with the Warrior, so I'll be working along that as an alt until further notice.  I might try Priest or Shaman soon, and see how they are, but I'm not getting my hopes up.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is a side effect of my time as a (Battle) Cleric in EQ, and classes just completely bore me unless I keep track of lots of stuff at once (which I have to as a warrior, but not so much with other classes).<br />

<br />
I don't object so much to the idea that in an instance I'm going to have to be on my toes even more than anyone else in the group.  While I can find it aggravating at times, I could live with it.  What I object to the most with the class is the apparent reduction in the ability to successfully and enjoyably solo as you level.  Quests slow way down and unless you're grinding on things that are substantially below your level, risks go way up.  No emergency escape abilities beyond retaliation, which is certainly not a guarantee of survival if you get an add and has way too long a refresh timer to really be that useful.  No inherant movement rate increase, unlike most every other class.   And nothing else in the way of really useful solo skills beyond something like hamstring.  The class seems very weak in the ways I spend the majority of my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, that list is pretty big, and nearly everything you listed is extremely overpowered. I'd be happy with a warrior only improved hitrate, as we'd be generating rage and doing a wee bit more damage than before, which would help out a LOT in our ability to keep and maintain agro. I wouldn't want much more than that, as the job of keeping agro on the warrior is not the warriors job alone.<br />
<br />
Having some weapon-based, non-talent improvements would make me pretty happy as well. I'd like it to actually be a choice between say, an axe and a mace, other than &quot;ok, this one has +10 AGI, but the other has 1-2 more DPS...&quot;. I realize that there are arms talents, but its touted that we are the master of weaponry and arms, and even a slight enhancement for varying weapon types would make things a little more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">01-16-2005, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats probably a little overkill.  The main thing Wow warriors hurt somewhat bad in right now is PvE solo.  We handle adds rather poorly, and can't do elites anything near how the other classes can from our lack of healing and our lack of burst damage.<br />
<br />
However, as I'm learning, post 40 anyways (Where mobs actually hit hard enough to scratch the paint on my armor), in instances warriors dominate.  This is coming from a 49 protection specc'd (the really underpowered as the numbers go) war.  I find in most cases lately I have near limitless rage, and at least decent damage output, particularly if I can get a couple of mobs to hit.  <br />
<br />
War is an extremely busy class in WoW to be really effective at.  It's almost EQ bardlike now that I think about it.  I can tank 3-4 mobs without too much difficulty, but it requires a fair amount of target switching and skills unloaded on them.<br />
<br />
Just tonight we were splitting up some giants in maraudon,  the pally (47) and a rogue (48) paired off on the one giant while I took the other.  By the time they finished it off, I had nearly had the one half dead solo.  I suspect I could've done better if I wasn't defensive spec.   Thats a pretty good testament to sunder armor, and our general overall effectiveness.<br />
<br />
As far as changes go, I would like to see an Acc + talent put in, and thunderclap revamped (Talent) slightly as far as either its' damage, or it's slow duration is concerned.  Tactical mastery could go away, but it's a good predecessor to anger management, which while underwhelming in itself, produces 1 rage ~ 3 sec in combat.  It also keeps a good amount of diversity in the arms tree.<br />
<br />
The general suggested changes seem to be way overpowering to war would be able to do, particularly one specc'd arms or fury.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really think that Tactical Mastery should be a skill and not a talent.  At Rank 5, level (checks ass for a number) ... 50, lessay, you can retain 25 Rage when shifting stances, if yer willing to dump the gold down.  Just moving that out of the Talent tree would go a long way towards buffing up the class without putting us up over the moon.  Putting an Accuracy Talent in place of it works well, or a Dual Weilding one.  Talents should be useful, not necessary.<br />
<br />
Move Flurry up a tier in the tree, or improve it.  A Shaman can learn it 10 levels earlier for 10 less points invested than a Warrior.  I guess all that time learning magic spells gives them an edge in combat ... or ... eh ... well, wtf to that.  It's not as if we get a powerful Warrior variant, it's the same useful but middlin' party trick.<br />
<br />
That's what they make alts for, Glatius. No class in this game is perfect, and the system seems very generous on allowing you to have alts.That quote reads like so :: Who cares if the warrior class is flawed?  Other classes are working fine, play one of those.  Bring your warrior out to play when someone needs you.<br />
<br />
Blech.  Prolly not quite how you meant it, but still ... blech.  Comments like that remind me of bad days.  It's not your fault, but I'm retching and I wanted to share.<br />
<br />
From the WoW General Screeching boards ::<br />
What I can tell you is this. I can tell you we sent a slew of compiled Warrior concerns to the development team. I can tell you they agree that Warriors are not performing as well as they should be in various situations. I can tell you they're doing what they can to remedy those issues with the class. This doesn't say *working as intended* to me.<br />
<br />
Yar, it's a good class, it's usually fun to play, but we have leap more hoops te be effective than others do to excel.  We're screwed as main tanks if the group doesn't co-operate.  We hit brick walls before other classes, and have hurdles that other classes don't. Holding aggro in a group?  Remember to credit your group.  We should be dancing like this to be superb - not to be effective.<br />
<br />
Oh, and cycling through weapon setups with a button push, or per stance is glorious compared to the ol' right click to equip.  Stance Sets (http://capnbry.net/wow/) apparently has a bug with cycling past a two-handed weapon, but I like it.  Peeling WeaponSets out of Cosmos works well too.</div></div><hr />

Well it was a particularly bad night, I was a bit outta sorts but overall my sentiment is as I wrote it.  I don't think it'd take much to redress the issues with the warrior class, either.  My warrior is certainly workable, I'm just not so sure it's working properly.  Which of course may be due to all the gnomish engineering I glued to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">01-17-2005, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My warrior is certainly workable, I'm just not so sure it's working properly. <br />
<br />
I think rage is the key.  A mage or a warlock knows for a fact exactly how much mana they have to work with.  The same holds true for a priest, shaman, or druid.  A rogue gets a set amount of energy and his energy refreshes at a pretty steady rate.  A hunter has more mana than he knows what to do with and non-stop firing won't deplete it.  The warrior on the other hand starts with very minimal rage and has to seriously work at generating it and at saving it.  Wait too long between pulls?  Sorry, rage goes bye bye.  Want to hold aggro?   Good bye rage, forget about doing pretty much anything else.  And so on.<br />
<br />
Rage, how it's generated and used, needs a serious adjustment.  There may still be room for a modification or two after that, but rage mods would be a big step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

Whoa, maybe you need to step back and reread what you quoted.  You obviously completely misread it.  In fact, looking at your reaction, I would have no clue you even read what you quoted.  It sounds more like your personal comment rather than a reaction to what I said.  Just how do you translate &quot;No class is perfect&quot; to &quot;Other classes are working fine, play one of those&quot;?  I'm not even sure if you translated through Japanese, to Korean, to French, Spanish, then German and then back to English you could come to that conclusion.<br />
<br />
No class in this game is perfect.  That's entirely true.  Each class has their flaws, their problems, their weaknesses.  Have you forgotten just how much this game encourages alts?  Between the mail system and rested experience, it's very feasible to play an alt that is also just as fun as the main without giving up on the main at all.<br />
<br />
My whole statement was for Glatius' comment that he's not finding the class as much fun as he did before.  Every game gets repetitive, especially when you stick to only one character your entire time.  He doesn't have to play a warrior, no one's making him, and I was simply saying that when one class starts frustrating you, playing an alt to get a totally different experience is a rather fun thing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoa, maybe you need to step back and reread what you quoted.

I didn't think you meant it the way I read it, I wasn't just blowing smoke up yer ... hey hey!  You quoted that line, and I'm certain that you read it.  Cuz I've read many of yer posts, and yer no dummy.  But both of those paragraphs were equally significant, parts of a whole thought, with the second split off to further emphasize it's content.  You're right, it did sound like a personal reaction - it was a personal reaction.  My quoted paragraph there was the big highlighter to indicate that.<br />
<br />
To fully lay the thing out, just so's I can be on the record.  The comment in question wasn't a reaction to *No class in this game has blue suede shoes*.  It was a reaction to a warrior expressing that he no longer finds the class suitable, and the proffered response *That's what they make alts for ...*.  That triggered the reflexive interpretation *Other classes are working fine, play one of those.*, which I framed in the rhetoric of days gone by, from other class bawl outs.  <br />
<br />
Because *Comments like that remind me of bad days. It's not your fault, but I'm retching and I wanted to share.*.  In other words, old familiar bells are ringing in my ears (thru the tinnitus), and I am having an adverse personal reaction.  Which had nothing to do with you directly, it wasn't yer fault.  Just a resonance thing.<br />
<br />
I was reasonably certain you didn't mean it the way it hit, as certain as I can be on winter nights, when my physic powers are quescient.  And so I added that other paragraph I was talking about earlier, to make that perfectly clear.  At least, such was my intent.  Coulda but didna do it better. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought long and hard about even posting on this thread.  I don't know if Warriors are broken.  I honestly have no problem soloing (equal to or +1 to 2 level mobs higher) or grouping.  We could use some tweaks I believe.  Warriors were insanely powerful in Beta, then they reduced us a lot, I think we just need a middle ground.  <br />
<br />
I don't know.  I seriously don't see, at least at level 51 with limited PvP and raiding at this point, how/where we're broken that much.  Maybe my perspective will change once I start doing those more.  The biggest problem I see with a lot of Warriors I group with is that they don't use all their abilities/stances to their advantage.  They may spam thunderclap (worthless mostly imo), or heroic, and maybe a rend, but that's it.  Completely underutilizing the class.  <br />
<br />
Sure Pallys can survive a lot longer than us.  As it should be.  But really they do not have great dps.  I've seen Pallys survive some incredible things, but they're oom and almost dead when they do.  <br />
<br />
I was fighting Ogres in Burning Steps (50-53, I'm 51), and averaging about 150 DPS, with some spike over 200.  I even took on two level 51 mobs at once (not intentionally!, and one was a caster which helped) at once and lived without blowing any timed discs.  No it wasn't easy, but if Warriors were truly gimped or sucked, there's no way I'd be able to do any of that.  And my gear is nothing special,  best thing I have is my Truesilver champ which I made myself.  <br />
<br />
Sure escapability can be an issue.  Few things you do here though.  First careful with pulls, if you get two mobs, just run.  90% of the time I can outrun a bad pull.  If I get aggro that I don't want, I either use a potion, time disc, or I just hamstring both of them and run. (pulls or aggro of 3 or more equal to or higher level mobs will usually kill any class, maybe not a pally but most others) If you have piercing howl (I know its talents to get it etc.), that's a great escape ability.  And also when I solo I'm always panning the camera around watching for roamers etc.  If I see one heading in my direction I'll start to back up and manuever my mob and myself so it doesn't aggro.  <br />
<br />
Again, not ranting at anyone, and not saying we don't need loving cause we do.  But I honestly don't think Warriors suck nearly as much as lots are saying.  (God the Blizzard boards are a pit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're still thinking of this game like EQ where even beating one mob of your level is an accomplishment.  In WoW half of the class are expected to beat 3 mobs 2 levels higher than they are without breaking a sweat.  Ever done any of those escort quests that the game expects you to protect some NPC from 3-4 NPCs that are the same level as you?  Those quests aren't elite because certain classes can do that with ease (and some can't, but that's balance for you).<br />
<br />
What you don't realize in your example is that just about every other class can either:<br />
<br />
1.  Win trivially<br />
2.  Escape trivially<br />
<br />
And some can do both... and just about everyone does more DPS than you to boot.<br />
<br />
Now how often are you going to try to fight 3 mobs 2 levels higher than you just because you can?  Not very often, but it says a lot about class balance.  There seems to be a long time perpetuated myth from the EQ days that someone who solos well doesn't group well when nothing can be further from the truth, with the sole exception being the EQ Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">agreed.... At lvl 42 having no trouble soloing elites give or take a lvl or two around me. All it takes is a bandage maybe a meal after the fight and I can go for hours.... Retaliation/Sweeping Strikes/Cleave make multi mob pulls or 2-4 doable if you don't panic.... potions in combat make surviving bad pulls alot easier.... hamstring/piercing howl when you need to run.... And if you die... so what no penalty and 30 sec-1 min run to your corpse... my god all of these make WoW incredibly warrior friendly compared to what EQ gave us. Would love to see Flurry a tier up in the talents but hey cant have my cake and eat it too. Not to mention a warrior in PvP is viable in WoW so many skills to use against every type of class. Heck even Rogues with their dps cant take an equal lvl warrior all the time. And Casters can't root and nuke us down like they could in EQ (Ornate Mithril Boots and Pummel are useful against this). Fear a hunters pet with intimidating shout and hamstring him and hes yours all night long. I'm just saying if you make use of the many skills and talents a warrior was given in WoW you can do so much. And most of the suggestions of talents were rediculously overpowered....weapon swapping made to a quick key is nice, but not a major issue, I would rather Blizzard spent time on more pressing concerns like Server stability. Just my 2cp<br />
<br />
Agreeing to the post 2 up......</div></div><hr />

I dont see that expectation, or even that ability, at higher levels.  Maybe at lower levels but thats kinda moot.</div></div><hr />
