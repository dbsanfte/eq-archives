See, i'd expect this coming from someone wearing Crusty, but near as I can tell, you're out about 60hp over someone wearing Fierce arms, legs and boots, and you've got no drop gear that far surpasses anyone with platinum can buy, and YOU'RE the one bitching?<br />

Allow me to submit my magelo.  if you can find a bastard who's got more HP with less raid loot, i'd like to see him.  You've got 800hp on me, and nothing to worry about.<br />

<br />
1. Some pieces are better than Skyshrine and Kael armor.<br />
A required level of 46 and a recommended level of 60 would really do some balancing here.<br />
<br />
2. The pieces are on par with high level no drop gear.<br />
When the owner of a high level quest gear get better stuff, then the old gear is made obsolete and pretty much worthless.<br />
When the owner of the new cultural gear  get better stuff, then the old gear can be sold for quite some cash.<br />
The cultural armor should be made by a smith, but then later imbued through a no-fail combine, that also made it no-drop, sort of like Solstice Earrings. This would also give the smithing market a more sustainable economy, because the gear that is made will not recycle the market over and over and over.</div></div><hr />

There are people that have ebayed entire fackin accounts with more and less HP than you . It is a fact of life. Deal with it and move on. I have met several Ebayed chars that I use to know and ya know what it makes me a little sad but I get over it. Yes there is armor that is pretty awesome that is not no drop. I happen to personally spend a ton of my off game time in the bazaar buying low selling high. I have made myself enough money that I own nearly a full set of Fierce Heraldic. What you are saying is because I am not level 65 with 12 zillion AA I do not deserve to have decent armor. Guess what your wrong. I earned my armor maybe not by killing raid level mobs but Uber Guilds aint my thang and XP grinding aint either. So again I stress get over yourself I earned my stuff and I am not uber I simply spent the time working in another area that allowed me to afford these upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Actually, some of it is better than anything you'll find before VT/ornate. They really screwed the pooch when they made a couple of those armors far superior to the other diety sets in terms of HP. <br />
<br />
It needs to be nerfed down to a 25hp/40hp spread like the rest, and differ only in stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WTF why would you want it nerfed down, nice mentality to have. 'I cant wear it so no one else should be allowed to'.<br />
<br />
So you chose agnostic and you cant wear it, tough, cry me river, deal with it and move on.<br />
<br />
There are other compareable armours out there that you can wear if your agnostic, you just got to look around:-<br />

Yes they are hard to get, and the drops are rare, but they arent unobtainable to get.<br />

BD cultural is not uncommon to find on several bazaar toons.<br />
<br />
Velious quest items<br />
-------------------------<br />
- Less available than BD cultural.<br />
- Worse stats than BD cultural.<br />
- Not droppable, but MQ-able.<br />
<br />
Tae ew<br />
---------<br />
- Better stats than BD cultural.<br />
- Require uncommon/rare drops, which lower the availability to near zero.<br />
- Droppable, if you can find a piece that a toon is willing to drop<br />
<br />
Livestone/farwater<br />
-------------------------<br />
- Better stats  than BD cultural.<br />
- Require drops from elemental planes that are not easy available.<br />
- Droppable, but as rare, if not more, as tae ew.<br />
<br />
BD cultural is simply not in the right place in the line here.<br />
Lower the stats or make it harder to get drops/make or amke it no drop to get it in line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BD cultural is simply not in the right place in the line here <br />
<br />
Get over it.  It was plenty in line back when it came out.  The price of BD's shot thru the roof, and the BD's STILL weren't the issue for most varieties of cultural.<br />
<br />
I had the only human smith on CT mass producing Fierce to sell for quite awhile, and BD's were never my issue.  The sunlight, and until Jaggedpine opened, Fenne Blood, was the issue, and that was FAR more rare than blue diamonds were/are, with people farming both POH and POG and Seb for gems, and using them in other tradeskills as well.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, you see loads of it in the bazaar, but you also see a lot of FBSS's and centi longswords too.  That's what happens when an item has been available for awhile.  It's not the item's problem, it's the game's problem.  FBSS's were damned near 20k when I started playing, you don't see me bitching about their availability now.<br />
<br />
You're agnostic. Boo fuckin hoo.  You chose the easy route to avoid minor faction issues.  Get over it or re-roll.  Some people enjoy tradeskills and there are many smiths available to make each kind of cultural these days.  That's just what happens.  People make twinks to occupy their time, pimp them out in cultural and sell it off a month later for less than they paid for it.  Big deal.  Time to stop whining about cultural and move on.  People lived without it before, and I think you can live without it now.</div></div><hr />

It was unbalanced then.<br />
<br />
Today its incredible easy to get due to the many components dropping in easy zones. Yet SoV armor is still hard to get and inferior.<br />
It is still unbalanced.<br />
<br />
Make a turn-in quest for SoV quest armor then, where the reward is a large bag of platinum worth 10Kpp for greaves and BPs, 8Kpp for arms and helmets and 5kpp for the rest.<br />
That would improve the SoV quest armor instead of nerfing the BD cultural, but the effect would still be a more balanced set of items.<br />
<br />
Balancing items is just as important as balancing classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on my server i asked about them and apparently theres only 1 or 2 on the server and someone reckoned the price would be about 20-30k and thats if you could find the components which are very rare and this is waaay more than what one would pay for a set of cultural greaves.<br />
<br />
im agnostic. i have a full set of SS armour save for the BP, but im still short of those warriors with full sets of FH or HT armour.<br />
<br />
I dont complain about that per se, if someone can afford to buy it, good for them. My only beef is with SoE for not having an equivalent agnostic set. Heck even put it with slightly less stats to compensate the deity worshippers for the disadvantages of worshipping a particular deity. <br />
<br />
I heard at the last Fan Faire they said they were looking into allowing people to change diety. I wait in hope....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Diety armor is unbalanced imo.  But it's already out and it's not gonna change.  I think SOE fucked up putting it in as unbalanced as it is.  I'm not agnostic, my diety armor is equal to or worse than Velious quest armors though.  And I really don't believe people should have been able to get armor better than the velious quest armors just by saving up plat.  But like I said, it's out, it's not gonna change.  Nerfing it would just cause more problems, and really I don't think a nerf is necessary, I just think SOE should be more careful in the future.<br />
<br />
Btw, I didn't choose dwarf or brell for supposed benefits over other races, I chose them for roleplay reasons.  In fact, when I made my char, I had no fucking clue about religion causing faction differences.  SOE fucked up big time when they did this, and I really don't think they had a clue about what the effects would be.  Racial armor does effect me as is, but only minorly, and I really don't care, but I stand by my belief is wasn't the smartest thing to do.<br />
<br />
Also, one thing that I just don't understand... in most fantasy, dwarves are renowned blacksmiths, yet our cultural is subpar.  It doesn't make sense to me.  I'm not saying that as dwarves our smithed armor should be unbalanced in our favor, I would have liked it more if it was balanced for all, just seemed like something that didn't fit in the fantasy genre.  Ah well, there's a lot of things SOE fucks up, and a lot of things they will fuck up in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RZ just seemed to.... agressive for a Halfling who is more fun loving. I kinda picture my Warrior up in front of the monster kicking it's shins, and reaching up and poking it in the eyes a la Three Stooges for my Taunts. (Nyuck, Nyuck, Nyuck) <br />
<br />
I don't think I will have a problem with armour even without the ability to wear any religion specific cultural. There is enough good stuff (Velious quests, Dwarf Cultural - non deity for a few slots, etc.) that I can use until PoP stuff is more available (I.e. until I get into a guild that actually owns the PoP expansion...)<br />

This would be fine if they actually stuck to that belief, but in many of the new expansions you are indifferent by default, regardless of your diety.<br />
New quests has drops that nullify the diety, like the scalp in LGuk that evil dieties can use to get on par with agnostic people, and you get it through the farming of faction, so its no problem at all to get a hold on it.<br />
<br />
SOE should REALLY start to differ the factions alot more and if they need items like the scalp to allow some dities to do the quest, then it should ALL/ALL, so agnostic players and those with the right diety stay ahead and keep the advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that there are some holes in who can wear the various armors.  Some class/race/religions got left out in the cold.  SOE has fixed some of this and there is usually a set of armor for most people.  But if you're going to complain that some diety armor is better than others and that's 'unfair' all I can tell you is that life is 'unfair'.  If it's that important to you that you always have the best armor available, maybe you should reroll or join a raiding guild and go get elemental armor.  Someone somewhere somehow is always going to have something 'better'.  It's time to get used to it and not let it bother you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, people bitched for over 3 years that tradeskills never made anything that was useful.  3 years people worked on their skills to get them over 200 and the best they could make was fine plate for noobs.  They revamp the skill system so that tradeskill masters could make armors of master level and now everyone who doesn't want to do tradeskills bitches about that.  Tradeskills HAVE to make items that are of a high quality BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO GET TO A SKILL LEVEL TO MAKE THEM.<br />
<br />
Go farm HOT until you see a full suit of plate drop, and then go work up blacksmithing to 240 and pottery to 120 and brewing to 150 and THEN come back and tell me which one is &quot;Easier&quot; to get.  You can go farm velious armors or you can pay for the time people like myself invested in getting my skills to a level where I can make armor for lazy people.<br />
<br />
Also, one thing that I just don't understand... in most fantasy, dwarves are renowned blacksmiths, yet our cultural is subpar <br />
<br />
Your armor isn't subpar.  The unimbued versions of underfoot are the exact same as the unimbued version of heraldic.  The IMBUE is different, and it's different for a reason.  Altho dwarven warriors are common, I'd say I've seen more dwarven clerics running around in my day.  Ignoring a massive part of the dwarf population wouldn't make for a good deity armor, so you got a balance.  40hp/40 mana, good compromise.  Trust me, if it didn't exist that way, half of the dwarven population would have been completely screwed, and that would have made dwarven smithing even more worthless than it is now.  The RZ imbue is imbued that way for a reason...RZ followers aren't casters, they're warriors, followers of the warlord.  Mana on an RZ piece would be useless to everyone who wore it, so it makes no sense.  Of course, anyone who's not RZ doesn't care what the reasons are, they just think it's unfair and will continue to think it's unfair.  Whatever, I don't give a crap.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you picked agnostic, but when you're on that religion screen after rolling up a beefcake barbarian warrior, I don't know how you can pass over the option (1 of 3, no less) that says THE WARLORD and instead choose agnostic.  It makes zero sense to me why anyone would do that.</div></div><hr />

-------------------------<br />
- Better stats than BD cultural.<br />
- Require drops from elemental planes that are not easy available.<br />
- Droppable, but as rare, if not more, as tae ew.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Lol, I like the part about how rare they are.  My server is fairly high populated (acknowleged)... but we only have 3 guilds capable of Elemental planes.  However, out of a guild that is elemental capable, there are generally AT LEAST 3 250+ smiths.  That means there are at least 9 (prolly closer to 20) on my server capable of pumping these out. <br />
<br />
Oh wait, the required drops are not easy available?  Wake up dude... when a guild gets elemental flagged THAT IS ALL THEY DO.  Think about the average number of &quot;uber guild&quot; people you find tooling around in tier3.  Yes, you see em sometimes, but not nearly as often as before, and if you do /who all 65, I garuntee you'll see at least 20 people in elemental at all times.   My point is this:  The drops may be fairly rare, but they never going to touch the tae ew... I have farmed thuls for hours before, in addition to doing gnome quest, and have seen ONE pristine scale drop.  Go look up how many it takes for even one attempt on those greaves.<br />
<br />
Anyone railing for a nerf on diety armor needs to remember that the game is growing, and that better gear is coming out.  Farwater/Livestone may be rare right now, but they won't be for too long (just look at elemental bows and how common they are anymore).  And yeah, I'm a Rallos-Zek follower.  I thought war was cool, and since I'm playing a warrior I thought it fit.  Sucks to be any of y'all that didn't pick right /shrugs</div></div><hr />

No Plate. No Cobalt. No Invis BP. No Invis Legs. No IGS. Etc, etc....PLUS! Cultural armor that is made specifically for iksar shamans! Wheeeeee....<br />
<br />
LOL I just find it amazingly stupid that after a three year tug-of-war (STILL ONGOING) of trying to balance out all of the classes, SoE decide that they are going to make the class UNBALANCED even within itself.<br />
<br />
How stupid do you have to be?<br />
<br />
I got along just fine my whole career and MA'd plenty of stuff. But why the hell can't the makers of this game figure out that someone who has spent 1000's of hours at a game has an emotional attachment to it and doesn't want to see someone else running around in FH armor when they can't buy or quest anything comparable in numerous slots until they are Vindi+ ?<br />

They should have given them 50 more str/sta than the other cultural if they felt the need to set them apart. Giving them double the hitpoints of the other cultural sets where +hp&gt;all is the name of the game was moronic.</div></div><hr />

My point still stands. Cultural armor was a big league fubar. Dividing factions WITHIN a class is the dumbest thing they could ever do. <br />

How many people here got tired of hearing the Ogre-warrior-no-frontal-stun issue when being considered as the &quot;best&quot; possible warrior? Yah, figured as much.<br />

P.S. I played a Dorf warrior on Solusek Ro in October of 1999 :) I know exactly what it means to level up using that stuff. The game was more fun then than it ever became :)<br />

Took me about 7 runs of Langesax quest before we got one LoW...I thought it was going to be the big moneymaker for our guild at 400pp per run too LOL...</div></div><hr />

Maybe to make the game a bit easier, because a lot of people had made their characters BEFORE cultural armor was out. Since there was absolutly no use for a god, they chose agnostic for faction issues (which are moot).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright, lets stop being ridiculous for one damned minute here and lets see EXACTLY what the bonus is for Fierce over what an agnostic has to choose from.<br />
<br />
Boots -- Fierce 60hp, unimbued 30hp...but vindi boots are 50hp and Vindi is pre luclin, so we get a 10hp difference in that slot.<br />
<br />
Greaves -- Fierce 80, Myrmidon are 40.  40hp there.<br />
<br />
Waist -- Heavy rubi girdle, equal for all.<br />
<br />
BP -- Nobody who's anybody wears a Fierce BP.<br />
<br />
Cloak -- See above.  Heiro owns.<br />
<br />
Pauldrons -- If you think your best option is imbued granite spaulders, you are mistaken.  Chokidai hide spaulders and the Rubicite ones from CT are what anyone with any stones is gonna be wearing.<br />
<br />
Bracers -- 55hp on Fierce.  However 8 stamina and 25hp on the BoB.  I'd call that a wash since everyone seems to wear BoB's anyway.<br />
<br />
Gloves -- See comments on BP and Cloak.  Myrmidon 4 life.<br />
<br />
Arms -- 60 raw on Fierce, 35 on Rubi ones from CT, and Myrmidon arms are comparable to Fierce in total hp with the stamina.  I actually wore Myrm for awhile but switched back to Fierce solely as a fashion issue.  I'll call it a wash too.<br />
<br />
Helm -- 60hp, Thurg crown is 7 stamina 35hp, Cowl of Mortality is best tradable haste IMO, and is 9 sta 50hp.  Helm shouldn't be an issue either.<br />
<br />
Visor -- 60hp.  35hp off crystal spider eyes, and if you're not afraid of camping something, you can snag a nice 85hp mask out of CT to put it to shame.  Alternatively, camp stormfeather and I'll call Eyepatch of Plunder better than a Fierce visor too.<br />
<br />
Collar -- 50hp.  Clattering bone neck is 30hp and 8 stamina, the neck of choice of most people I see, including people who can wear fierce.  Worst case scenario is a 20hp difference.<br />
<br />
So we add it all up and we get what...10 boots, 40 legs, 20 collar.  OMFG! 70hp!  I'd absolutely die if someone had 70hp more than me because of his deity.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of this nonsense.  Fierce is nice.  It matches, it lets me wear the l33t red like I used to wear back in the day when Rubi was the best shit in the game, but it IS NOT the be all/end all that you people claim it is, you're just too lazy to look for items that you can wear, and instead choose to bitch about smithed armor.<br />
<br />
70hp in exchange for some faction...sounds even to me, now enough of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're talking basically a full suit of FH vs Kael/SS equivalent you can't really substitute hps gained through STA for raw HPs.  Most people wearing a full suit of that are going to have max STA buffed.  Once you get that then STA = 0 hps.  Personally, I don't think it's that big of a deal.  You can get roughly equivalent stuff with a mix of ToV/Ssra loot.  <br />
<br />
I will say that FH has allowed me to save more DKP pts up instead of getting a bunch of mediocre junk in ToV so my chances at VT loot are better now than they would be if I was agnostic and had needed to swap out a bunch of gear that had some STA on it but little to no HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crist0</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's compare it to the other cultural armors, shall we? And remember, HP&gt;All.<br />
<br />
Helm:<br />
FH - 60hp<br />
OC(other culturals) -  30hp<br />
<br />
Arms:<br />
FH - 60hp<br />
OC - 30hp<br />
<br />
Face:<br />
FH - 60hp<br />
OC - 30hp<br />
<br />
Feet:<br />
FH - 60hp/5sta<br />
OC - 30hp<br />
<br />
Hands:<br />
FH - 50hp<br />
OC -  25hp<br />
<br />
Legs:<br />
FH - 80hp/5sta(10 sta on HT)<br />
OC - 40hp<br />
<br />
Neck:<br />
FH - 50hp<br />
OC - 25hp<br />
<br />
Shoulders:<br />
FH - 60hp<br />
OC - 30hp<br />
<br />
Wrist:<br />
FH - 55hp<br />
OC - 30hp<br />
<br />
That's a difference of  265hp and 15 sta(not counting gauntlets or BP). That's a big difference, and you can try as you might to explain away how people dont use these pieces, but we all know it gets used until end game luclin(&quot;roughly equivalent stuff with a mix of ToV/Ssra loot&quot;) in some cases. It's cheaper and easier than even ToV armors. BP/Greaves sell for under 10k on my server, and things like bracers are 1-2k.<br />
<br />
Glatius, your point fails because FH/HT armors are also for a hybrid class.<br />
<br />
If you don't see the design fuck up with that you're borderline blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just because you have cultural doesn't mean you have to wear it.  I'm sorry your race/religion combination has other classes that need consideration as well.<br />
<br />
If your cultural isn't the best piece for the slot, don't wear it and don't walk around with a 265hp difference like the dorf above me tries to advocate you do, because that's what your argument is based off.  I don't walk around in crafted just because it's the warrior armor, and I didn't wear each piece of Indy just because it's warrior armor.  Instead, be intelligent, quit yer bitching, and get the things I listed above and the difference will be next to nil.<br />
<br />
And Khumak --<br />
<br />
I maxed my stamina about 6 months ago I wanna say, taking into account the fact that my accounts have been canceled since march.  it's not an easy task, especially for someone who didn't put any points into it at the start.  For people who are bitching about how much better fierce is than gear they can get, the stamina on their gear does make up a large chunk of their HP.  I'll agree that NTOV + people will be capped, but those aren't the people who should be complaining about Cultural.  I'm not gonna discount 6hp/stamina point on the majority of people who are saying how much better Fierce is than stuff they can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the bright side, the more people in your guild wearing the better cultural, the less competition there will be on those drops that are close to as good.  So in the end, it means you do get better gear since you'll be competing against a smaller pool of people, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crist0</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are playing stupid Haass, you know as well as I do that having the &quot;chosen&quot; race/diety war combos just drop a couple k to surpass the stuff  &quot;lesser&quot; race warriors would need to spend a shitload of raiding time to get is moronic. <br />
<br />
I don't wear cultural, actually I fit into your &quot;NTOV +&quot; category. The fact that FH/HT is SUPERIOR to gear from ntov boss mobs as well as other cultural is part of what pisses me off.  It was &quot;supposed&quot; to fit in between thurg and ss gear, when it was implemented...and it does, for the most part.<br />
<br />
You know what I'm talking about - after all you have 7 out of 11 possible slots filled wth FH(Glatius does too, he replaced all of his kael armor with it from what I understand). How hard was it to buy that? <br />
<br />
More importantly, why should other warriors have to work harder to get worse?</div></div><hr />

Furthermore, you know NOTHING about how I obtained my Fierce.  I have a 244 human smith, I put COUNTLESS hours into getting mine. I made every goddamned piece for me, and for the other warrior in my group, don't tell me about how you put in more work sitting on your ass crawling thru NTOV with 50 other people.<br />
<br />
Why yes, I do have Fierce in 7 slots, and if my warrior was agnostic, I'd have it in zero slots and I'd have 4750hp.  That's certainly something to bitch about now isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, and it's 10x the work to go camp an FBSS as it is to grab one outta the bazaar, what's the difference?<br />
<br />
The only people who had Fierce when it came out were the people who put the time in to gear up their smithing, and the people who had the plat to pay me for the time I spent doing so.<br />
<br />
The only people who had Ykeshas/FBSS's/Lamentations/etc/etc/etc etc when they came out were THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THE TIME IN TO GET THE STUFF.<br />
<br />
Now, I can run into the bazaar and buy a yak, and I can buy some Fierce.  That's the way the game is.  I'm sorry you're obviously not astute enough to figure out how the EQ economy works.  Items enter and do not leave.  Once the supply overcomes the demand, the price drops and people get nice gear for cheap.   I sold a Glowing Black Stone back in the day for 20k, but it's not worth crap now.  It's still a nice item, but supply/demand seems to have you confused.<br />
<br />
<br />
You would also not have 4750hp without it, I encourage you to play around and see what alternatives you could get to it in the thurg/HoT range that you evidently played in by looking at your armor. <br />
<br />
I don't know why I bother proving you wrong all the time, but I reckon I'll do it again just so you see how much of a dumbass you're being here.   Check the magelo in the sig, and go to alternate profile entitled &quot;Just for Crist0.&quot;  You'll see a happy little ditty that nets me 4771 hp with absolutely no fierce whatsover.  Once again, anyone complaining about it is too lazy to look for things that can replace Fierce and instead choose to bitch about it.  Consider the matter closed, I proved to you, without a doubt that the difference is MINIMAL at best, but i'm sure you'll find a way to come up with some other bullshit reason why Fierce is SO much better than your gear.<br />
<br />
In the future, might wanna check and see if it's possible before you challenge someone to prove you wrong.  You'll end up saving more face that way.</div></div><hr />

The mask alone is enough for a couple sets of the FH you replaced. The legs could buy another. The shoulders could easily do so as well(I've never even seen the shoulders drop, and I've killed my fair share of ww dragons). Each bracer would require you to get several friends together to complete the quest(when you can find cherista up). Vindi will require several raids to snag his boots(you don't think a guild raids to get one person gear, do you?). Your new range slot requires bringing more friends and camping ME waiting for a vamp to drop it. As for your arms, I've never heard of them- neither has allakhazams or any other eq database. Neither has google. <br />
<br />
So what we come down to is this: You spent  roughly 5 times as much plat as if you bought the FH pieces, you needed a group or two of friends twice for your bracers after finding the quest mob up, more friends to camp your ME range, a good bit of raiding for your boots, and to buy 2 exceedingly rare items for your arms and shoulders.<br />
<br />
And you still have 42 less ac and 56 less hp than with the FH.<br />

<br />
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PURCHASE EVERY PIECE OF GEAR JUST BECAUSE IT'S TRADEABLE.  You're pissed that people can buy armor, that's exactly what it comes down to.<br />
<br />
I don't spend ANY money, and I can get everything, save the vindi boots, which fit your criteria of &quot;Pre luclin&quot; armor, with a group of 6 just raking in XP.  I see how it is now, you have zero idea how to play this game.  You think that everything that is tradable must be purchased, and everything that is no drop must be raided for.<br />
<br />
Grodans idol can be soloed, I've done the cappy in WW with 4, and I've camped every camp in CT in one group, not to mention farmed up my Myrmidon Pieces with 5.<br />
<br />
And you still have 42 less ac and 56 less hp than with the FH. <br />
<br />
This argument was never about AC.  It's about HP.  You decided to bring up AC after I met your HP requirement.  I told you the HP edge was miniscule, you denied that claim and I proved you wrong up one side and down the other.  56 hp is just over 1% of my total HP, if that's not miniscule, I don't know what the hell is.  I'm done arguing with you.  You can sit around crying about how shitty your gear is and no one is going to give a crap because you obviously have no idea how to improve it, nor how this game works.</div></div><hr />

I spent pretty much all my spare time on it when not raiding for a period of 7 months Crist0, but thanks for being so contemptous of my time.  At this point all I can really say is, life isn't fair.  Your character caught a tough break when they figured out the cultural armor.  Them's the breaks.<br />
<br />
But hey, here is some consolation.  I still can't solo any better than you can and neither of us will ever solo as well as that punk caster over there wearing gear that cost even less than a set of cultural armor.  So there are things even more unfair in EQ that maybe we should be more concerned about, ya think?</div></div><hr />

I've been raiding for years(since kunark). I know it used to take a little bit of time for skillups(I have a cultural smith as well..don't tell me how tough  FH was, you never had to hunt down iksar blood for it ;) ) if you didn't dump plat into it, but there's no way it could have been that long. <br />

If people have only been playing for a year and a half, they must have been ebayed because there's now way they could have better gear than you in that period of time<br />

<br />
I dumped 80 THOUSAND platinum into smithing, and it took me almost 2 full weeks, with the help of 3 friends working FULL TIME on nothing but skillin up smithing.  Nothing but padding, nothing but ore.  I spent entire DAYS in skyfire kiling nothing but Chromadracs with 3 other people only to net 1 or 2 Sunlights per EIGHT HOURS, and then I had to repeat the process in North Karana competing with trackers for rare spawn Fenne's just to get a rare spawn blood.<br />
<br />
I don't tell you that your time raiding is insignificant based upon the fact that your actual time doing things is nill, and you spend your time sitting on your ass while the monks do the work.   I could say that the time you spent raiding was LESS important than the time I spent working on my smithing, because your contribution in that raid was miniscule, and the mob could have been killed without you, but I don't, because i have a basic level of respect for what other people choose to do in this game.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, because of people like me, who put in the time and the effort into being able to craft my own armor, Cultural will NEVER be nerfed.  You can't take away things that people spent WEEKS on a relatively one dimensional activity.  Just because some people can get a cheap set of armor now due to mudflation and some people's lesser standards for their time spent, does not mean that the armor needs to be nerfed.  <br />
<br />
I don't care what you think you've been doing since kunark, it is NOT more important than what anyone else has been doing, and you're not impressing anyone by claiming it is.</div></div><hr />

See, that's the part I don't like Glatius. Not everyone did put in major effort over a long time.<br />
<br />
Do you know how long I spent factioning just to do the gaunts of dragonslaying turn in Haass? I'll give you a hint, it was 3x more than the amount you just gave for your smithing powerlevel. That's just 1 piece of armor.<br />

No, I don't think I've been doing it, I'm sure I have...see I was there. I didn't say it was more important, I want you to read it slowly - I put alot more time into it. <br />
<br />
As for nerfing..what makes your &quot;work&quot; more important than every other cultural smither of another diety? Why do you think you should get a far better result from doing the exact same thing?<br />
<br />
<br />
You discount everything everyone else does as being as important or as time consuming as what you do.<br />

Hardly. Spinetwister was doing a &quot;woe is me&quot; routine over the opening of zones, because of his large amount of time spent getting to them compared to the &quot;noobs&quot;. So, I used him as in example.  It's pretty valid to be questioning that type of reasoning. He started playing after luclin was released, and some of the &quot;noobs&quot; have been playing since original eq..but that just sailed over your head I guess. <br />
<br />
As for here, I've got a valid point(again)..something Glatius even grudgingly acknowledges. And again, I think it slipped over your head. <br />
<br />
I do have to chuckle when you take things so personally, and threaten me with things like:<br />
<br />
<br />
kindly remove yourself, lest some of us make your life very difficult until the mods remove you.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can call me on acting &quot;better&quot; in this respect anytime you want, because I am better than that. You need to step back, and remember what's being argued about is in a game instead of taking it personally so often. It might help you comprehend where the other guy's coming from instead of attacking him like he's bogarting your french fries.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to have to disagree with you here Crist0.  See I've gone from maximum KoS Kromzek to Ally to Kromzek by killing in Skyshrine, alone.  It took me a week of pretty consistant work in that zone.  I also spent a week prior to the big smithing patch working on getting my smithing from 86 to 197.  It cost me 17k to do that, ever last plat I had.  It's taken me the 7 months I mentioned since then to get my skill to 225.  I'm sorry Crist0, faction work is a cold stone bitch, but it pales to smithing.<br />
<br />
Lets take acrylia plate armor for example, one of the only skill up paths for a Barbarian smith, since Barbs don't have a lower tier plate armor to skill up on.  The hardest component to find for acrylia plate are windstones.  You need two windstones for every single combine.  Windstones drop off many mobs in luclin, but very rarely.  They're on the precious gem table so any mob that can drop a precious gem can also drop a windstone.  The aliens in the various zones with grimlings seem to have the best drop rate.  Even still you can hunt for them in chunks of four to eight hours and still only come out with one or two.  I know, I've done it.  If you do it this way, it will be years before you skill up high enough to matter.<br />
<br />
So instead you buy as many as you can from the bazaar, if you have the plat, and/or vendor mine.  On my server buying them in the bazaar means 300-500 PER windstone.  Which means just on windstones alone you're spending 600-1000 plat PER combine.   And on a good day you may see 4 or 5 windstones for sale in the bazaar, if someone else trying to do the exact same thing you are hasn't bought them up already. Gaining one skill up typically takes 20-30 combines, unless you get unlucky and then it can take an obscene number of combines to gain that skill up.<br />
<br />
Acrylia plate originally had a pretty good market, so this was fairly possible.  You could buy the components and sell your successes in the bazaar at a high enough margin that you'd cover your costs and maybe even come out ahead.  That really isn't that possible anymore.  The prices on acrylia plate have been steadily dropping.  Which means that now if you manage to sell your successes, you typically lose money on the deal.  Which means you have to generate your skill up plat some other way.<br />
<br />
Now, you might call this 'easy', but it sure as hell is time consuming.  And while Haass was able to take advantage of the grace period before the change, most people weren't.  And even still, because of the deadline involved, Haass had to do an obscene amount of work in a very short period of time or lose out on the chance for easier skill ups altogether.  And he was taking a huge gamble.  Perviously smithing made items had pretty much been crap.  For all he knew they were still going to be crap after the change.  He could have been completely screwed out of all his time and all his investment.  He was extremely lucky that he wasn't.</div></div><hr />

Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying &gt; Fierce Heraldic. By a LONG shot.<br />
<br />
Uh, anyways, the problem here is that people aren't seeing their rewards as enough.<br />
<br />
Crist0 spent all that time factioning to get his gauntlets.<br />
<br />
The reward? The gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Enjoy them. Be happy with your reward. It's why you did the faction work.<br />
<br />
Glautius spent all that time skilling up. The reward? Cultural smithed armor.<br />
<br />
Enjoy it. It's why you did all that factioning.<br />
<br />
Everquest is designed to make BOTH of you spend large amounts of time and effort to achieve things.<br />
<br />
For someone that's played for so long, Crist0, you have to know this by now.<br />
<br />
All that time you've spent raiding, has been to acquire the gear you got raiding. If you felt you were wasting your time, you wouldn't have spent the time doing that.<br />
<br />
You can't go back in time and get it back. Not even after cultural armor comes out to make some of that gear more and more dated.<br />
<br />
I spent a month or so factioning in chardok for the first ring. I haven't even started the second ring. I'm not complaining that people can make Valorium rings (or buy them) for cheaper.<br />
<br />
I chose to spend my time working on the ring quest.<br />
<br />
You chose to raid. Someone else chose to smith.<br />
<br />
RZ diety armor is the warrior friendly armor.<br />
<br />
FINE HERALDIC is pretty damn good armor.<br />
<br />
Brellium is pretty damn good armor. For about 20k oh so many months ago I was able to get brellium pauldrons and brellium greaves. That's AC 20 shoulders for a shorty (a great deal) with dex and hps ... and AC 40 pants with 40 hit points.<br />
<br />
That's one helluva leg up.<br />
<br />
Just because a zek worshipping human can get 40 more hit points here and there, it's not gonna make me blow a gasket.<br />
<br />
Because given enough time and enough raiding on my own, I'll pass that level of gear anyways.<br />
<br />
Or it too will get gimped in the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

To me that's roughly the current equivalent of using shadowscream armor to get your higher smithing skillups(incidently, did you make back all that plat you put into smithing?). Just illustrates how much more effort is required for poorer results. <br />
<br />
The point is that the &quot;chosen&quot; race/diety combos have better results from cultural armors, despite the fact that they don't require any extra work. There isn't even a roleplaying reason for it(even goes against all roleplaying reason), it's just bad game design. <br />
<br />
Might not be the worst thing they've done, but that doesn't make it any better.</div></div><hr />

So GODS are worse than FH armor now huh?  I'd trade every piece I own for those Gauntlets, and I'd happily go back to that agnostic profile.  I think the major problem here is that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.<br />
<br />
Trust me pal, if I could tolerate enough people to form a raiding guild, I'd happily do it.  I'd rape NTOV and Ssra up one side and down the other, and I'd be wearing the best shit the game has to offer.  I can't do that.  I hate people.  I can't devote time at &quot;prime time&quot; to play EQ.  I hate people.  I can't raid 5 nites a week to meet the uberguild requirements. I hate people.  Being able to tradeskill stuff is the only way that people like me can get stuff that I put in the time to work for, I just can't play at the times that I need to in order to get stuff like you have.  That doesn't mean I put in less time or deserve anything in this game any less than you do.  You raid with 50 people.  If you're not there, the raid goes on.  Your role is insignificant.  The time you put in is a guild effort, and you get the rewards divied up amongst the guild, to make the guild stronger and to be able to kill bigger and better things.  I don't have any ties.  Whether I'm wearing Champs/Myrmidon or Heraldic, i'm killing the same shit, and i'm not competing with people like you.  Smithing gives people like me a way to make some armor thru some very time consuming processes that we otherwise would not be able to obtain.  That's not a bad thing.  It keeps people like me playing and it gives us a sense of accomplishment, and like it or not, there are WAY more people like me than there are people like you.  <br />
<br />
People like me can make armor.  Whoop de fuckin do.  I'll still never loot a bloodfrenzy.  I'll still never quest Gauntlets of Dragon slaying.  I'll never see Rallos Zek, I'll never set foot in plane of time.  Do you REALLY think you got the short end of the stick outta this deal?</div></div><hr />

But what I'm most happy about is that not only was I able to make some very nice armor for myself, which was slightly better than what I had, I was able to make some chain armor for some long time friends who were never going to see a 45 AC chain tunic any other way.

<br />
The BD Cultural armor is CULTURAL armor, not Warrior only armor.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek and Tribunal worshippers (Except the occasional off-beat Bard for Tribunal ) only have Warriors that wear plate armors<br />
<br />
Dwarves, Halflings, Humans, Gnomes and whomever else I'm forgetting have all 5 plate classes in some cases that can use the same  armors.<br />
<br />
Should Bards, Sks, Clerics and Pallys all take it in the shorts so Warriors of those races can have the equivilent of the other 2?<br />
<br />
Each line of cultural is balanced for it's users, not balanced with relation to class. As I said before, it's cultural armor, not class armor<br />
<br />
My Warrior has 2 pieces of Helanic Tundra armor, both made by my Barbarian Shaman, so maybe that could be seen as twinking, but he did not get them till he was level 49, and the Shaman spent countless hours farming all the stuff to raise his skill in Smithing and Brewing (Already had Pottery fairly high) and Tailoring high enough to do all the sub-combines. And even so my Smithing is only 184 with an added 5% from Gearlock. To make those 2 pieces, I've done 60 combines. Very expensive, bordering on foolish waste on my part, but that was before the change to the substances needed for Shadowscream Armor and I wanted to be self -sufficient and make a set of armor for my warrior myself.<br />
<br />
Don't spend time obsessing over what someone else has...take the time to enjoy what you have. Makes life much easier and ulcer-free</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I have with cultural armor is that is too easy to get.<br />
Its true that the smiths work hard to get the skills required, but once they have the skill they can smith for 20 others and the armor can stay in the market forever.<br />
Another problem with it being so easy to get components for is that people at 46 can be better equipped than people at 60 and all your comparing of armor from CT, WW and so on goes out the window then.<br />
There are several ways to &quot;nerf&quot; the armor without destroying the smiths work.<br />
<br />
One way could be to make the armor recommended level 60/required level 46 combined with a no fail combine that gives it the good stats, but also makes it no-drop.<br />
This would mean the gear would only get full power from level 60, which is somewhat equal with the level required for getting SS/Kael or NToV gear and making it no-drop just as gear from those zones will balance it the last step.<br />
<br />
Another way, which is less attractive for smiths, is to make one of the necessary and uncommon components for no-drop.<br />
This could again be combined with a no-fail combine to add the good stats and make it no-drop.<br />
This means smiths will have to do the farming themself, which probably would drive the prices up and the availability down.<br />
<br />
Trust me pal, if I could tolerate enough people to form a raiding guild, I'd happily do it. I'd rape NTOV and Ssra up one side and down the other, and I'd be wearing the best shit the game has to offer. I can't do that. I hate people. I can't devote time at &quot;prime time&quot; to play EQ. I hate people.<br />
<br />
Many others have a hard time tolerating other people, but they are forced to do it to get access to the items from zones, such as ToV and Ssra.<br />
I see little reason why someone should be able to take an easier path to better items.<br />
<br />
But what I'm most happy about is that not only was I able to make some very nice armor for myself, which was slightly better than what I had, I was able to make some chain armor for some long time friends who were never going to see a 45 AC chain tunic any other way.

<br />
You do not see a problem in being able to give armor away for free that is better than the armor the guild can get themself from HoT??<br />
These friends did not have to work for the armor and now they might not want to bother with HoT anymore.<br />
The armor can cause more grief than joy.<br />
I can only hope that the guild is run with officer distributed loot and the officer will now put them far down the award list, since they already got the best gear.</div></div><hr />

ToV is level 46+, is it not?<br />
<br />
VI already made the decision to make this have a recommended level on it...it is level 45.  If I choose to make a twink and haul his arse into ToV to get myself armor, I have to wait until he's 46.  If I want to wear armor at it's full stats, I have to wait until 45.  Same deal.  The recommended level is already on the items, and it's there for a reason.  Whether you agree with the reason is pointless, it was applied, and I have a hard time believing SoE is going to change it just because you don't think it's a good level to recommend.<br />

Ah, but see, you're only seeing half of the game.  I work overnites, my &quot;prime time&quot; to play is in the early mornings.  I'm still a paying customer, I still put in plenty of hours, probably far more than some of you back in my day (insomnia is a common occurance for those working nites, and when I can't sleep, I play video games).  The only way one can access &quot;Raid quality&quot; loots is by playing in the evenings, american time.  Why is that fair, and how does that fit into your logic of who deserves what items?  The fact that people like me can make items for myself to replace SOME (read it again. SOME) of the loot that I could otherwise only get by raiding with a high end guild in the evening isn't a bad thing.  It encourages people like me to keep playing and keep seeing progress.  Cultural armor is nice, sure, but compare it to raid loot.  it lacks the stats, it lacks effects and it lacks resists.  It's good armor, ya, but a guy in full cultural doesn't have much in the way of stats and he doesn't have much in the way of resists.  It's one dimensional armor, and you cover all of those bases with raid loot. <br />
<br />
You do not see a problem in being able to give armor away for free that is better than the armor the guild can get themself from HoT?? <br />
<br />
I gave away so much goddamned plate out of ToV it was ridiculous.  I MQ'd more thurg leather and silk for friends than I can count.  The only difference is that you don't have to track down one of the (single digit population, mind you) grandmaster smiths on the server to quest out HoT stuff.  Maybe in your guild every piece that falls in ToV has a class there that can use it, but my group is goddamned good and with a group of 5 characters we farmed up mountains and mountains of plate we could MQ for friends, acquantainces, friends of friends, other guildmates, etc.  You guys are making ToV out to be some monstrous task, when it's really not any harder for a group of 60's than farming up crap to work on your smithing is.</div></div><hr />

My server is fairly high populated (acknowleged)... but we only have 3 guilds capable of Elemental planes. However, out of a guild that is elemental capable, there are generally AT LEAST 3 250+ smiths. That means there are at least 9 (prolly closer to 20) on my server capable of pumping these out. <br />
<br />
Oh wait, the required drops are not easy available? Wake up dude... when a guild gets elemental flagged THAT IS ALL THEY DO. Think about the average number of &quot;uber guild&quot; people you find tooling around in tier3. Yes, you see em sometimes, but not nearly as often as before, and if you do /who all 65, I garuntee you'll see at least 20 people in elemental at all times. My point is this: The drops may be fairly rare, but they never going to touch the tae ew... I have farmed thuls for hours before, in addition to doing gnome quest, and have seen ONE pristine scale drop. Go look up how many it takes for even one attempt on those greaves.<br />
<br />
Anyone railing for a nerf on diety armor needs to remember that the game is growing, and that better gear is coming out. Farwater/Livestone may be rare right now, but they won't be for too long (just look at elemental bows and how common they are anymore). And yeah, I'm a Rallos-Zek follower. I thought war was cool, and since I'm playing a warrior I thought it fit. Sucks to be any of y'all that didn't pick right /shrugs <br />
<br />
Hey, buy a clue. In the time its taken us to equip most the guild in 40-100% MOLDS in elemental planes we have gathered enough components for 2(two) attempts at farwater plate bp(both failed), 1(one) farwater plate legs, and a couple of fire plate items. The items are ungodly fucking rare, even compared to molds and you need shitloads of them for every attempt. Coupled with the very poor successrate of about 33% at 250 smithing and you dont get shitall entering the world. Elemental plate is in NO WAY EVEN REMOTELY COMPARABLE to availability of cultural armour. <br />
<br />
There is 8 elemental guilds on Veeshan, guess how much elemental plate is for sale in bazaar? If you guessed completely zero then you get a bonus star! Elemental bows require generally 1 semi common bowstaff, 2 semi-common string components(except fire which are rarer) and some very common metals to make cam parts. Elemental plate requires upto 8 INSANELY RARE pieces of MULTIPLE components. The parts in earth are truly insanely rare. Water not quite so but close. To clue you up, we make roughly 20-30 elemental bows (thats completed bows not attempts) per attempt at earth plate. Wow, amazing.. there is more bows for sale.. whoever would have guessed!<br />
<br />
On the overall debate, the only piece that annoys me is the leggings. 80hp is simply too much when you compare to velious gear. It was somewhat annoying midway through Luclin that I realized that I would need to kill HP of Ssra in order to get leggings which barely beat cultural. At this point only FOH had beaten it and were farming it every spawn. All the rest is fairly well balanced with whats out there (though its far easier to come by). I know they wont be changed, but the legs really should have been 50-60hp max, not comparable to stuff dropped by a mob only 1 guild per server at the time could kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all, however your entire argument has revolved around how much &quot;work&quot; you put into it. If a *single* piece of my armor took 3 times as much &quot;work&quot; as your entire skillup process...well, that fairly well blows your point out of the water now doesn't it?<br />

These friends did not have to work for the armor and now they might not want to bother with HoT anymore.<br />
The armor can cause more grief than joy.<br />
I can only hope that the guild is run with officer distributed loot and the officer will now put them far down the award list, since they already got the best gear<br />
<br />
No, I see nothing wrong with it.  First of all because I know that people give away gear all the time.  People multi-quest the questable armor.  People sell items out of the elemental planes in the bazaar.  People sell or give away things all the time.  Now, why is it wrong for me make the armor and give it to my friends, but if I was to go to the elemental planes, get a chain mold drop, and give it to them instead, this would be okay?<br />
<br />
Much of the PoP gear is droppable, is it not?  Did SoE do this because they felt it was important that everyone only use gear that they themselves aquired?  Or did they do it because they knew that often times people wouldn't use it and therefore it only made sense to make it droppable so they might sell it or give it away and at least reap some reward for their effort?  Why should smithing be penalized because the gear is player made but if it comes from hunting some PoP plane, its hunky dory it be given away or sold?<br />
<br />
And why exactly is it any of your business what I do with the gear I make?  I'm the one who invested the time, the energy, the plat.  What I do with the rewards of that investment is no one's business but mine.  If I wanted to make 100 cultural BPs and 100 tae ew chain tunics and drop them one by one in the bazaar to either be picked up by any n00b who wandered along or to rot, how would that be any of your business?  Is it any of my business what you do with the items you aquire, regardless of how you aquire them?</div></div><hr />

The &quot;problem&quot; with your God, as has been mentioned many times previous,  is the devs got a little lazy and needed to make Brell's armour palatable to Pallies, Clerics AND Warriors. I really don't know why they didn't make a Crimson Darkscale equivalent for other gods (thats what the RZ SKs in my guild want from cultural smiths). Perhaps they overdid this gear but it also didn't appear until Luclin, not SOV, when people were getting the HP drops and VT drops as well, which made it not appear quite so... upper echelon in comparason. <br />
<br />
Its not the first time they screwed up on itemization a bit and it won't be the last, unless there is no more new content added in any way, shape or form. Deal with it.<br />

<br />
Well I don't know what all the warriors on your server are wearing, but half of the warriors in my guild (myself included) are wearing mostly FH armor and that's after spending a few months farming the hell out of Ssra.  We're in VT now and after clearing it 4 or 5 times plus some of the faster repops most of us are still wearing more than half FH.  So I would argue that for a lot of people it's still a concern until they've spent a long time in VT or have moved on to the Elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where to start:-<br />
<br />
First of all I am an agnostic dark elf warrior. I did not choose agnostic back in 2000 because I felt it was easier, I just felt it suited the class. However hearing all these  discrepencies and how easy faction was for us agnostics I decided to make a RZ DE warrior to check the places I used to use often as a young warrior and did quick test.<br />
<br />
Going to assume Neraik (indiff/amiable), Grobb (dub) and Oggok (app agnostic maybe higher with RZ) are similar with both dieties for a agnostic and RZ warrior.<br />
<br />
Freeport:- exact same up to the bank at least for agnostic and rallos zek. Pretty much dubious to all (save the bards guild which is apprehensive).<br />
<br />
Qeynos:- exact same up to the bank for RZ and agnostic. Can get to the bank unscathed (dubious to most save once again the bards guild for both which is app).<br />
<br />
Rivervale-Fairly identical for both. Low faction for everywhere but not kos save the clerics guild (which is threatening).<br />
<br />
Highpass Hold:- Pretty much identical. Mixture of dubious (guards), apprehensive (merchants) and indifferent for both. Safe to get to bank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Faydwer:- pretty much kos to both, didn't go there much as a young DE war  and cleared pog a few times on agnostic so scowls now. Am asuming I am kos to most there with a RZ worshipper, let alone a Dark Elf.<br />
<br />
Odus:-  Erudin mostly dubious and apprehensive with a very few threats to both agnostic and RZ, can get to the bank fairly safely with both. Paineel is apprehensive for both.<br />
<br />
Kunark:- No real difference. apprehensive starting to OT for both, kos to FV for both.<br />
<br />
Velious:- RZ has an advantage here. app to dwarves dub to giants. Agnostic is app to dwarves, kos to giants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luclin:- Shadowhaven :- Same pretty much dubious to both<br />
Seru:- Not sure with my agnostic warrior as he is scowls now but for arguments sake we will say he started off dubious,  the RZ worshipper is dubious as well.<br />
Katta:- I could not get my level 1 there alive, but I will give the advantage to the agnostic here as I believe RZ worshipper will be kos, and my agnostic started out dubious.<br />
Shar Vhal:- Indifferent to both.<br />
<br />
POP:- think faction is minimal here no matter what race/diety you are,<br />
<br />
<br />
I looked all over for this faction discrepency, and really where is it? I pretty much knew RZ worshippers don't have it nearly as hard as they were saying (even better than agnostics in some circumstances), and my personal tests showed the same results. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly I will look at Haas' list:-<br />
<br />
&quot;Boots -- Fierce 60hp, unimbued 30hp...but vindi boots are 50hp and Vindi is pre luclin, so we get a 10hp difference in that slot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vindi boots are his rare drop. Seen them drop 3 times in 20 killings. compared to FH boots which are better and sell in bazaar on Fennin Ro for 5-10kpp. So work 5 times as hard for boots with similar stats.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greaves -- Fierce 80, Myrmidon are 40. 40hp there.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well seeing as you want to add stamina for all your other comparisons do not forget the 5 sta on the greaves ;). FH grieves are around 10kpp in bazaar on my server.  SS mq legs are 15kpp+. Again do more and pay more for less. Not to mention plate from velious is used by far more classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Waist -- Heavy rubi girdle, equal for all.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Only if you camp the HRG or have the 30-40kpp to afford it, FH is 6 less ac, 5 less raw hp, and goes for 8-10kpp on my server.<br />
<br />
&quot;BP -- Nobody who's anybody wears a Fierce BP.&quot;<br />
<br />
 True. Most tanks wear Vindi or Erad so its pretty fair there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cloak -- See above. Heiro owns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hiero? FH has more raw ac, more raw hp, and goes for half the price for a hiero on my server.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pauldrons -- If you think your best option is imbued granite spaulders, you are mistaken. Chokidai hide spaulders and the Rubicite ones from CT are what anyone with any stones is gonna be wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Anyone with any stones will have max stamina already with buffs. 15 ac &gt; 15 stamina. Chokadai are also close to twice the price of FH on my server. Rubicite are closer to FH however, but again FH are 8-12kpp on my server, Rubicite around 40-60kpp.<br />
<br />
Bracers -- 55hp on Fierce. However 8 stamina and 25hp on the BoB. I'd call that a wash since everyone seems to wear BoB's anyway. <br />
<br />
Not even close to a wash. More ac, more raw hp on FH. Not to mention the seemingly cheapest piece of FH around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloves -- See comments on BP and Cloak. Myrmidon 4 life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed gloves not great, fairly balanced here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arms -- 60 raw on Fierce, 35 on Rubi ones from CT, and Myrmidon arms are comparable to Fierce in total hp with the stamina. I actually wore Myrm for awhile but switched back to Fierce solely as a fashion issue. I'll call it a wash too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only thing that keeps the mymr in contention here is 4 more ac, not stamina heh. 60 raw hp on arms is very hard to beat until high end ssra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helm -- 60hp, Thurg crown is 7 stamina 35hp, Cowl of Mortality is best tradable haste IMO, and is 9 sta 50hp. Helm shouldn't be an issue either.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cowl is 16 ac, and not everyone has 100kpp to buy it. The head is also one of the last places you want haste when you get higher, because of the availability of the Helmet of Rallos Zek, which is not that far off of the price of the cowl mind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Visor -- 60hp. 35hp off crystal spider eyes, and if you're not afraid of camping something, you can snag a nice 85hp mask out of CT to put it to shame. Alternatively, camp stormfeather and I'll call Eyepatch of Plunder better than a Fierce visor too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Its not better at all stat wise, and again amy mask and sf mask are a bitch to get compared to FH which goes for 5-8kpp on my server. If I had the choice I would farm the components for the FH mask in a heartbeat over the others. FH also beats both in ac quite comfortably.<br />
<br />
&quot;Collar -- 50hp. Clattering bone neck is 30hp and 8 stamina, the neck of choice of most people I see, including people who can wear fierce. Worst case scenario is a 20hp difference.&quot; <br />
<br />
People on a strict budget maybe. FH beats clat in raw hp and ac once again, but seems to be about 5kpp more pp. I cannot see any reason why people would throw away that much ac and raw hp for a few stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So we add it all up and we get what...10 boots, 40 legs, 20 collar. OMFG! 70hp! I'd absolutely die if someone had 70hp more than me because of his deity.&quot;<br />
<br />
The difference is you have a choice. others do not. The difference is the balance of raw hp and ac is far grater than 70hp.<br />
<br />
Honestly if I had a choice the only two pieces of FH I would discount would be the BP and hands. Maybe the HRG if I could afford it. The components are easier to farm, they are more available to buy, and less classes use them. Most of those comparisons are not even close.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sick of this nonsense. Fierce is nice. It matches, it lets me wear the l33t red like I used to wear back in the day when Rubi was the best shit in the game, but it IS NOT the be all/end all that you people claim it is, you're just too lazy to look for items that you can wear, and instead choose to bitch about smithed armor.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am sick of it myself. I am seeing the same arguments here a lot of other classes have used on warriors to keep us down (ie we had it badly three expansions ago so we deserve to be better now, which in itself is not even true). The same &quot;why worry about me worry about yourself&quot; mentality that some people use when we show an imbalance. These type of blanket statements are annoying as hell because this is a  mmorpg.<br />
<br />
In my own test I found that being a Rallos Zek worshiping Dark Elf has literally all the benefits, while the agnostic does not. Cannot speak for every race and diety but a spade is a spade.  That its not the best gear in the game, or that this problem is not  only warrior related  is no excuse.<br />
<br />
All I see is a bunch of people who stumbled into an advantage and want to keep it to themselves (hence the staunch attempt to try and dismiss the arguments against it). If agnostic only armor was released tomorrow that had a better balance of raw hp and ac you bet RZ worsippers would be moaning about it, and I guess some agnostics would try to keep it as is to keep the advantage to themselves. Human nature I guess.</div></div><hr />

sure, it's from a total RP point of view here...but seriously how much difference is there between velious quest armour and FH/HT/MM/K..etc. gear?<br />

Enough to make a fuss over? Or just to nickel and dime to death on message boards?<br />

I say if you picked a god, did the time learning a trade, than profiting from it..than by all means ride the wave. those who just want the quick fix and swap circumstances in order to benefit yourself and talk smack about anyone else who may or may not have it &quot;better than you&quot; is ridiculous. <br />
<br />
there's enough sh*t in the game to squabble over; and enough other items that can get your l33t toon all beefed up just fine and waving your phallic representation at others.</div></div><hr />

I freely admit that smithing has been an advantage for me.  One I intentially stepped into.  I put in the time, specifically for the Armor I currently wear.  Now, if they went through and changed the agnostic armor so that there was a Warrior only version that had identical stats on it to the Barbarian cultural I wouldn't bat an eye.  Couldn't care less in fact.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand they went through and nerfed my gear because some people had penis envy over gear that is nearly equivalent to NTOV gear, which is currently three expansions old mind you, then yes I'd be pretty pissed off.<br />
<br />
I've worked for my armor thank you very much.  I've in fact worked for it twice since I had kael quested in almost every slot I now wear Barbarian cultural.  Just because some agnostics Warriors don't have it quite as good is not going to make me okay with people advocating my hard work be pissed away to make them happy.  You want Barbarian cultural?  Go roll up a barbarian Warrior.  Then go skill up your black smithing to over 200, make sure to have a Barbarian shaman available to imbue ivory for you, and skill up your tailoring and brewing to support your smithing.  Then come back and talk to me about 'nerfing' the armor.</div></div><hr />

Everyone thinks they worked hard. I worked for months to get  full set of mymrdon, each piece looted not one quested.

This isn't non-agnostic vs agnostic. It's the difference between Agnostic, Tunare, Brell, Thule, Inny, Bristlebane, Bertox, Mith Marr, Prexus, E Marr, Nife,  and Karana vs Rallos Zek. <br />
<br />
ALL of those diety armors, including the RZ armor, are wearable by warriors and at least 1 hybrid class/cleric.<br />
<br />
<br />
nearly equivalent to NTOV gear<br />

The problem isn't what it's equivalent to, it is what it isn't equivalent to - that being all of the other cultural armor.</div></div><hr />

Reread what I said.  I clearly stated that if they got armor with identical stats, I wouldn't care.  Hello, would NOT care.  Why should I give a damn if they can gain the exact same armor I have the exact same way I did?  <br />
<br />
 Are you saying your work deserves more reward? Or are you implying only warriors who go through the entire drill of tradeskills get these items? Yet you are mad at agnostics? Who the hell are you fooling?<br />

I'm pissed off at people like you who seem to think that because they don't have it, it must therefore be nerfed.   Get over it.  You're not going to succeed in getting it nerfed because for the love of pete the discrepency isn't that big.  It's not like the Warriors wearing cultural with higher HP are suddenly more capable than Warriors wearing cultural with the lower HP.  If a Paladin can tank just as well in PoP with an average of 600 HP less than a Warrior, what the hell difference do you really think a hundred or slightly more HP is really going to make in the overall scheme of things?  Nice to have, you bet.  Must have, no way.<br />
<br />
People who want to undermine other people's hard work over something so relatively insignificant just cheese me off.  This isn't mana burn we're talking about.  This isn't us going off and soloing mini-bosses using charm.  This isn't us going off and soloing mobs that would rip you to shreads.  This is us working our asses off to gain a very small advantage that really amounts to almost nothing.  Go nerf the Paladins, at least that makes some sense.<br />
<br />
Edit:  And you probably feel that all those people in quested armor that was a gift or something they paid for should also be nerfed, because of course they don't rate anything that doesn't measure to your demanding requirements.  Get a life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO the best and most fair change that can happen is that they make ornate at least ten times more available, so that us agnostics at least get some form for a  fair shot.  I have done a lot of BOT (not tower mind you) named and never seen one drop, not one. Ornate is a fair upgrade to FH, but the effects is what really distances it.<br />

I don't want to worship Rallos Zek, I don't want shit spoonfed to me, I don't want to get anything for free, but I want a damn fair chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To add more fuel to the fire though, compared to FH armor most of it sucks anyway.  There are only 2 pieces with more HPs than FH armor.  The BP is MUCH better and the legs are slightly better.  Unless you want the gloves for the clicky effect the rest of the ornate sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cultural armor is nice, sure, but compare it to raid loot. it lacks the stats, it lacks effects and it lacks resists. It's good armor, ya, but a guy in full cultural doesn't have much in the way of stats and he doesn't have much in the way of resists. It's one dimensional armor, and you cover all of those bases with raid loot.<br />
<br />
Cultural armor has stats and resists, only a few Velious piece has effects. In many cases the cultural is on par with the velious armor piece both in stats and resists and in some cases the velious armor is actually sub par to the cultural.<br />
<br />
that would be insane. but seriously think about it when most (if not all) of you guys agnostic played for certain benefits like not being kos and other quests that some religions have to do hard factioning on. Now that something goes someone elses way you have to complain. I know it's easy to get. I know it's not that expensive. I know Iskandar is wierd. But it's not like thats the best damn armor in the game. If it was seriously the best armor in the game and getting to 65 isn't really that hard wouldn't you start over? Yes.

<br />
If agnostic was actually taken into consideration when quests was made, then the cultural armor would be fine, but Sony does not do that.<br />
If they did, then you would see quests that agnostic and evil OR good dieties only could do. Evil dieties would not be able to gain enough faction for the quest, if it was meant for good dieties. Likewise for evil diety quests, where good dieties would not be able to ever do it, but evil and agnostic would.<br />
The way we can see that Sony is not thinking on agnostic at all is that EQ keeps getting new gear that can only be worn be a diety toon, new quests that allow all dieties to do them, although some require a little item, like the scalp in LGuk.<br />
Remove the scalp or make it ALL/ALL, so the good and agnostic players get more benefit from their race.<br />
Add more quests that are depending alot more dieties instead of making the reward diety only.<br />
<br />
As it is now, being agnostic gives you no advantages, because quests are made, so all will be able to start out as agnostic with easy to get faction items, the major quests do not take diety in account, new NPCs and towns are generally equally factioned towards all dieties.</div></div><hr />

Having a diety did not get you any benefit. Being agnostic was really the only way to go. My how times have changed. <br />

You don't have to buy all your gear just because it's tradable.  All of those items, save Vindi boots, are obtainable with one group of level 60's, and you'll get XP doing it.  I know you guys that XP in PoP aren't used to seeing loot where you hunt, but before that godawful expansion, XP camps actually dropped items.  I know, it's a shock to some of you.  On your point that Stamina shouldn't play a role in my gear selection, I think i've proved it does.  Both profiles sit at 210 stamina, and they're within 60hp of each other.  <br />
<br />
Do I benefit from being RZ? Yes.  Is there a roleplaying(the hell you say!) reason why I should? YES.  Why shouldn't followers of the GOD OF WAR have GOOD ARMOR?  It boggles the mind doesn't it?  EQ is an MMORPG...the RP stands for Roleplaying, and altho SoE falls short of that standard often, there are obviously a few people on that Dev team who do their damnedest to keep it that way.  <br />
<br />
Is the bonus huge?  Hardly.  I can pretty much guarantee that if I were agnostic, I'd be wearing that profile (vindi --&gt;Myrmidon probably, and I might be wearing Myrm greaves, which would put me at 1216 ac at the cost of about 25hp), and I wouldn't be any worse off for the wear.  I'd still be over 1200 ac, and I'd still be damned near 7khp fully buffed.  Is that REALLY worth comlaining about?  Well, I guess for you people who don't know how to get gear thru any method other than the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

,,,,says the guy going on and on about how good droppable gear should be to people wearing the stuff with &quot;no drop&quot; on the item tag...<br />
<br />
As for your &quot;RP&quot; reason..why exactly, from a roleplaying perspective...would a clumsy Barbarian make armor superior to the masters of smithing - Dwarfs? That's anti-RP, not RP.<br />
<br />
The rest of your argument's  already been covered enough...downplay that advantage at all cost, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's worth defending because it is something I've already paid for in time, pain (trying clicking combines for hours on end and you'll know what I mean), and grief.  Now some yahoos who are all teary eyed because their combination of race/class/religion didn't give them the exact same benefits want to come along and nerf the crap out of it because they don't want anyone to have any advantage they didn't gain on a raid some place.<br />
<br />
I've paid my dues, I've earned the armor the hard way.  Now leave it the hell alone.  If it's that big a deal to you then start a campaign to have an identical set made available to your character class/race/religion, I really don't care.  Just because someone has something SLIGHTLY better which they EARNED, even if you think you've put in more time on trying to earn gear as good in a different way, doesn't give you the right to cry NERF!<br />
<br />
How about I start going through and judging the difficulty of the various quest and the boss mobs that drop various loots and start crying nerf every time it seems like a quest might be a tad too easy or the boss mob might be a tad too much of a cake walk?  How apperciative would you be if it was YOUR gear that people were waving the nerf bat at?</div></div><hr />

This isn't non-agnostic vs agnostic. It's the difference between Agnostic, Tunare, Brell, Thule, Inny, Bristlebane, Bertox, Mith Marr, Prexus, E Marr, Nife, and Karana vs Rallos Zek. <br />
<br />
ALL of those diety armors, including the RZ armor, are wearable by warriors and at least 1 hybrid class/cleric.<br />

<br />
The problem isn't what it's equivalent to, it is what it isn't equivalent to - that being all of the other cultural armor.<br />
<br />
Fine, make Underfoot, Mischevious, Serene, Luminent, Thunderous, and all the rest of the cultural armors the same stats as RZ/HT armor. Then you have 4 other classes complaining about the loss of wis/int and mana on all their items. <br />
<br />
Once again, it's CULTURAL, not Class armor. It's balanced by the culture and classes within that culture that can wear the armor, not balanced against the class members of all the cultures that can wear the armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because 3% of FH and HT armor wearers went through the entire tradeskill process to make their own armor when they did not have to does not change much. Really you get as much sympathy from me as I get from you regarding this. You did it because you wanted to I am sure, not because it might effect the economy if other warriors have the same options available to them. How can your work be wasted if you already have what you worked for? <br />
<br />
You had the choice, I do not. You don't even want to grant those the opportunity that you had, and that screams greed to me.</div></div><hr />

Does not work like that. Not going to throw 150 days away just because you do not like it when someone brings up a  concern that they would  like fixed. Going to support a positive change that will hopefully come about. FH is not worth throwing away so many days and levels, to suggest so is ridiculous. I want to be agnostic, and have a chance at the same type of armor, if this means better  ornate drop rate great so be it. I will never ever play anotehr character from 1-65 again, so no thank you.</div></div><hr />

People have been asking the same questions since EQ came out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't make an ogre so I get stunned alot.  Will I be a useful tank without it or should i reroll?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't put any points into stamina when I rolled my character.  Will this hurt me or should I reroll?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I picked halfling instead of a bigger race with better stats.  Will I still be a good warrior as a no good stinking halfer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I picked a barbarian for my shaman. He has low wisdom and no regen and no AC bonus.  Should I re-roll my shaman as an iksar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't pick Rallos Zek as a god (Like I should have, because I'm a goddamned warrior, but that's beside the point), will I still be a good warrior?&quot;<br />
<br />
YES.  YES YOU WILL.  People will not turn you down for groups because you're a shorty, people will not turn you down for groups because you're not wearing red.  YOU WILL STILL BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME AND LIFE WILL GO ON.<br />

Anyone getting the idea by now that 2 different people designed these?  One guy made warrior greaves and the other guy made all the rest.<br />
<br />
I could list all the armor greaves from Kael too, but this speaks for itself.  Champion greaves SHOULD have 70 or 80hp on them, period.  So should Myrmidon, and Warlord Greaves should no doubt be 80hp bare minimum.<br />
<br />
Can we put this deity issue aside, speaking as a warrior, not as a barbarian, not as a follower of the Warlord, and have all of us agree that Cultural is not the issue, the Velious implementation is?  This is something that I think all of us can agree needs to be fixed, and it will not lead to nerfing of anyone's hard work, and will address the issue enough to satisfy everyone.<br />

I made this point a few pages back, the only piece of FH/tribunal which is seriously unbalanced is the legs. But I need to disagree with upping Velious armour as a response. Try looking through Ssra/VT drops and might note that the difference between pants that takes 40-60 people to obtain vs 5k in bazaar is way too small. Cultural should be 50 or 55hp (and possibly add a few resists instead), and the split versions should be 30hp/mana.</div></div><hr />

I dont see how these are unbalanced now when u can pick the following items up in the bazaar :-<br />

Also there is the new elemental player made armour, which may be rare at the moment, but this will filter down to the bazaar over the next few months.<br />

Actually Cristo I was comparing a 25k item (Fierce heraldic greaves) to a 75k item (ornate greaves mold). <br />

Agnostic armor can be worn by anyone, therefore if the stats were identical there would really be no reason for other cultural armor, people would wear agnostic.  The race that makes the majority of the unimbued armor (agnostic in effect) is humans.  Therefore the humans would have their normal market, which is already huge because they can make the largest number of imbued armors, and they'd be cutting into the market of Barbarians as well.<br />
<br />
At this point there are only two character classes that look for barbarian cultural plate.  Tribunal following Warriors and Tribunal following Bards, of which there are not a lot.  Make the human made unimbued armor identical in every way and there will be no reason why anyone would ever go to the trouble to be a barbarian smith or to seek out barbarian cultural.  And those that have already done the work would be screwed blued and tattooed.</div></div><hr />

In some ways the whole cultural armour debate reminds me of the old days when Furor bemoaned the fact that at the top of his game he was stunned too often in melee and wanted the frontal stun immunity given to all warriors when they hit 60.

&quot;The problem isn't what it's equivalent to, it is what it isn't equivalent to - that being all of the other cultural armor.&quot; CristO - then what you and others are basically asking for - if I understand the past 8 pages - is one(or more) of the following: <br />
<br />
1 - change Fierce Heraldic(Bard &amp; War) and Helanic Tundra(Bard &amp; War) armor to the exact same stats that on most of the other pieces of cultural armor benefit 3 out of the 4 or 5 classes that can wear them (Bard, War, Pal, SK, Clr) but that do absolutely NOTHING for one of the classes (one of the two classes that can wear the Fierce Heraldic &amp; Helanic Tundra armors - and probably make up 90 - 95% of those two classes that wear the armors - I can't remember the last itme I met a Bard of either the Tribunal or of Rallos Zek<br />
<br />
2 - change the stats on all the other cultural armors to the same stats as FH &amp; HT - which by doing so you'd then have to remove the positive stats for the other 3 or 4 classes that can wear them benefit from - otherwise they are all out of balance AGAIN then aren't they - by giving too much +sta and +hps to the OTHER tank classes - as well as the stats that only THEY benefit from - with no additional benefits to the warriors that can wear them.<br />
<br />
3 - change the Agnostic versions of the armor to have the SAME benefits as the diety-imbued versions - thereby eliminating any real need for the Diety-imbued armors at all - since there would be no differences among them - and one more reason to create all characters as agnostic that can be - removing even MORE of the chance of role-play(there's the role-playing card) from the game.<br />
<br />
I got news for you and everyone debating from the point of making it all the same - you are the ones trying to compare apples to oranges here - by comparing say the Fierce Heraldic armor to Blessed Full Mithril armor - you are basically trying to compare the relative benefits of the OLD High Elf and OLD Dark Elf armors - armors designed with a completly different set of class/race combinations in mind(with some overlap) - balanced(well - as balanced as things were back then) to benefit in some way ALL the classes that CAN wear them - not just ONE of those classes - and not make them all the exact same thing out of a little cookie cutter mold.<br />
<br />
The people calling for the change or nerf to EITHER side need to take the blinders off and look at it from a Multi-Cultural / Multi-Class perspective - and not from what will benefit just their WARRIOR the most.<br />
<br />
PS: for those complaining that the Dwarves are the ones supposed to be able to make the &quot;best&quot; of the armors/weapons in game according to accepted EQ story - here is a cut from the EQ home page - with the description of the dwarves:Dwarf <br />
<br />
Dwarves are short but extremely strong (much more so than humans) and dexterous. They appear to be small, burly humans, and males are never seen without beards and mustaches. Of course, dwarves do not see their lack of physical height as a disadvantage. To them, it is simply the way of things. Besides, it is just as satisfying to break kneecaps as it is to break noses.<br />
<br />
Dwarves believe in many different things, and each is willing to die for their beliefs. One thing all dwarves share is a common belief in good, strong ale. It would not be strange to witness a dwarf in battle, a weapon in one hand and a frothing mug in the other. To better serve their dwarven patrons, taverns across the lands have specially constructed stools that can take a beating. The innate infravision of the dwarves allows them to see if a mug is half-empty or half-full in even the darkest of rooms. For the safety of those around, the mug better be half nothing and always full!<br />
<br />
Dwarves have such a neutral character that even the Teir`Dal will allow them into Neriak, to a point. Of their professions, dwarves may choose to serve their god as clerics, take on the mantles of paladins, harry the enemy as warriors, or pursue the refined arts of the rogue.<br />
<br />
The faith of dwarves lies mainly in Brell Serilis, the Duke of Underfoot, but some also serve Bristlebane.No where in this do I see a spot that in the EQ-Genre thay dwarves are the best weapons/armor smiths out there - in general fantasy - maybe - but remember this is THEIR world (SOE/Verant) - not ours....<br />

They'd have to add a new catagory of restriction.  Maybe that wouldn't be a big deal, since they made diety restrictions to begin with, but they'd have to add one where if you had any diety at all you couldn't use the item.  And the agnostic armor is more prevelant than Helanic tundra, as an example, so all the agnostic players would reap a big windfall of availablity and expense, while the diety players would then have it more difficult.  So you want to exchange imbalance for imbalance, as long as it's in your favor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it's imbalanced.  Yes, I believe there were valid reasons for them making it the way they made it.  No, I don't think it's that major an imbalance.  No, I don't want them nerfing my gear because some other people think it's unfair they can't wear it.  No, I have no problem with people having other gear reasonably available that is comparable as long as it doesn't blow the market for diety armor all to hell as a consequence.<br />
<br />
It's not so much that I prefer it in my favor as I certainly don't prefer it in my disfavor, particularly since I've paid my dues, earned the skills, and made the armor already.</div></div><hr />

Not worth me getting them to be honest, not that much or an upgrade for me over the fh to warrant spending 75-80k, or spending dkp points on, when another agnostic tank in my guild can get a decent upgrade of them over myrmiddon or warlords greaves.<br />

Well now 2 people have answered this point, yet you've ignored it for 2 days. Did you want to screw all the Clerics, Bards, Paladins and Shadowknights in all the other cultures, or just give RZ and HT users the shaft? In a perfect world a seperate set of armor for each class in a culture would fix this problem, but then it would not be cultural armor, but a newbie armor upgrade, but with 2 more expansions plus content still not working, I doubt Sony has the time for it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;They need to be brought in line one way or the other, raise every other piece to FH level or nerf FH..one of the two should happen to make up for the fact that the armors were very poorly designed and implemented&quot;<br />

And Abividad - again - Every single set of cultural armor - including FH/HT has at least one casting class listed.<br />

Do I honestly think they will do anything about the jacked itemization of the cultural armor?<br />
<br />
No. Not unless we were to go over it in detail on the PoN board*coughcoughexpbonuscough*. We just don't have the dev members in our pockets to get the point across to them.<br />

I guess you're including Bards as a casting class, since only Warriors and Bards can wear HT plate and Bards were an after thought, added after it was pointed out that there can in fact be human bards who worship the tribunal.  Originally the armor was indeed Warrior only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm defending the fact that the armor has been implemented for quite some time.  People have invested huge amounts of time and effort in gaining the skills to make it.  To change it now, because of an imbalance that really has no bearing on anyone else's enjoyment of the game just isn't very reasonable.<br />
<br />
You have gear options available.  Maybe they're not as easy to obtain relatively speaking as the diety armor is now, but remember when it first came out diety armor wasn't that easy.  Now, it is.<br />
<br />
Basically you're saying that your loss of enjoyment in the game due to the fact you can't find and wear comparable armor is sufficient to make undoing or trivializing my efforts built on what has been available for some time justifiable.  Do you really lose that much from the game because you don't have agnostic armor equal to HT?  Is it really something that stays on your mind constantly and eats away at you?  Does it in fact mean that you eat significantly more deaths, spend more time LFG, and succeed less at raids as a consequence?  Or have you successfully compensated for this glaring disadvantage you so obviously labor under and actually done just fine?  If you have, then messing with the status quo just for theoretical 'equality' is just stepping on my dick because you don't think yours is quite long enough.  If you haven't then I wonder if a few hundred extra HP is actually going to help you.</div></div><hr />

The appropriate thing to do would be to make sure that CULTURAL smiths did not try and slap one single type of armor onto everyone of that race.<br />
<br />
They should have had SEPARATE armors even within CULTURAL designations. <br />
<br />
Why did they create Fulvous Darkscale (CAZIC THULE) if this wasn't possible? Ever hear of Blackened Darkscale (INNORUUK)? I would kill for some of those pieces....<br />
<br />
You ever look at that stuff? Doesn't really follow Haass' RP argument. Why the hell stop there? Did you ever notice that those were added AFTER FH and HT had been out for a while? Why make concessions to those race-class-deity combinations?<br />
<br />
Was it so hard to make it that cultural smiths made separate armor for each class that could wear it of that race? No, it wasn't.<br />
<br />
It still isn't. It's just laziness and re-priortization by the dev and tradeskilling team. Incredible laziness. The flowchart of covering each type of God and each class within a race would have taken an hour, tops.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what someone would or would not do at this point. It is irrelevant. They aren't going to change it. <br />
<br />
Arguing anything besides the fact that the implementation sucked and that people received an advantage from it during one point of the game is just stupid.<br />

<br />
Zotha, I don't agree with your assessment here -- <br />
<br />
I made this point a few pages back, the only piece of FH/tribunal which is seriously unbalanced is the legs. But I need to disagree with upping Velious armour as a response. Try looking through Ssra/VT drops and might note that the difference between pants that takes 40-60 people to obtain vs 5k in bazaar is way too small. Cultural should be 50 or 55hp (and possibly add a few resists instead), and the split versions should be 30hp/mana. <br />
<br />
Why do you think that Ssra VT drops have the stats they do?  Because of the velious legs that preceeded them.  If Velious legs for warriors had been balanced correctly against other melee legs (Paladin Kael legs have 70 GODDAMNED HP.....CLERIC Kael legs have 90hp FFS), then Ssra/VT legs would have been itemized appropriately as 90-100+ like they should have been.<br />
<br />
And you, and many others keep using the &quot;5k in the bazaar&quot; response.  Fierce wasn't that cheap for a LONG time, and still isn't on many servers.  I had no problems getting rid of them for 45k for a few months.  Corroded pieces that dropped in Kael and ToV were expensive as hell when they came out as well.  Mudflation shouldn't play a part in gear balancing.</div></div><hr />

Cristo, i got a question for you do you play a Pally ingame ? because you certainly whine like one.<br />

There an many things in the game that are unbalanced, and you can either deal with it and move on,and enjoy the game or whine and rant and rave about it and try and piss other people off in the process.<br />
<br />
So some people chose agnostic, and some chose a diety, some can wear a certain armour some cant. The main point is that everyone had the same choice, whether it be an informed one or not. Deal with the choice you made and move on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to wear a lot of FH gear, I finally upgraded my legs from FH to Fiery Might.  At this point, I don't wear a single piece of FH, and I wouldn't benefit one itoa from it whatsoever.   I can probably give a 'relatively' unbiased assessment of FH/HT armors (aside from the fact that I used to wear them, although I don't think it'd cloud my judgement too much).<br />
<br />
- Every piece of FH that I wore, I either bought for extremely high prices, or set up raids for.   Set up raids for?   Yep!  I bought it when it was new (within first week or two), and there was a grand total of *1* smith on my server who made it.  I paid 60k for the legs.  In exchange for 3 other pieces, I arranged a trade of a Vindi BP (i.e. I organize a Vindi kill, he loots Vindi BP, and gives me the 3 pieces of FH in exchange).   <br />
<br />
- Frodlin is a Half-Elf, and is incapable of making his own cultural armor or he'd have made it.  As it stands, he is at a total disadvantage to others in terms of getting skillups in smithing because, while the components are expensive, the time spent skilling up on cultural is significantly less than the time spent skilling up with non-cultural armor.  I raid a LOT, and had to make a decision that with no real return on investment (i.e. I couldnt' make suits of armor that would return any investment that I made into Smithing, making skillups a moneysink and a larger timesink).   This essentially says &quot;Frodlin will buy any smithed armor he so deems necessary to equip&quot;.   Frodlin's smithing skill is a meager 180 at this point, and there's not much need to see it go any higher, because there's no real ROI involved.   <br />
<br />
- Every piece of FH that I wore, I upgraded from Skyshrine quest armor.  It's not as though I didn't &quot;put in the time&quot; so to speak, I put in the time, and then put in the cash and time again.<br />
<br />
- I got one of the first ornate leg molds on my server (#3 I think).  Without hesitation, I gave it to a dwarf in my guild, because it was a much more significant upgrade for him than for me.   I didn't *have* to, he didn't ask, he actually refused at first, and only being convinced that I was serious about it did he finally accept them.<br />
<br />
Analysis:<br />
<br />
- I firmly believe that nothing that's tradeskilled which doesn't require equivalent numbers to attain should exceed the quality of that which is raided for.   I like this about Elemental armors, because you have to raid to get there, and it's a return on your raiding investment.  I wouldn't have had a problem with cultural armor exceeding the quality of Velious quest armors if the components to fashion them required a better force and time commitment.  <br />
<br />
- Tradskills in EQ are pathetic.   Endless combines for a random chance at a skillup is silly.   I've always been opposed to relying on the RNG for somthing which should be better controlled.   Each time I repeat a &quot;tradeskill oriented&quot; task (i.e. my RL 'tradeskill' is sales) in RL, I learn from it, and can apply that to my next attempt at success.  If I failed 30 times in a row before learning something new in my job, I wouldn't have that job any longer.   It would be preferable in my estimation to have tradeskill &quot;skillups&quot; similar to acquiring experience in EQ, you always learn from an attempt, and dont' have big ol jumps at random times.  Also, tradeskill oriented quests should be implemented in EQ... travelling to a given location to learn from a master who sends you to gather components and shows you how to combine them should have a &quot;tradeskill payoff&quot; in terms of several skillups or it's equivalent.   Looting tradeskill oriented loot the same (the fact that you have this piece of no-drop loot when you hit &quot;combine&quot; indicates that you've acquired it, giving you an automatic tradeskill skillup, because quite frankly, you are now much more knowledgeable than you were previously.<br />
<br />
- RP and Tradeskills:   I happen to think that this is justified.  I certainly am at a disadvantage with how smithing has been implemented in EQ (being a half-elf) but it's reasonable.   My &quot;people&quot;, Half-Elves, have no culture, we've simply got human fathers with good taste.    Armor imbued culturally for a diety should indeed reflect that culture and that diety.   It's unthinkable that armor imbued by the power of the god of war would be less suitable for warfare than that imbued by the god of digging gems out of mines.  On the other hand, those that follow the god of digging crap out of mines should have a skill called &quot;mining&quot; that when underground acts similar to &quot;forgaing&quot;, and turns up gems and ores rather than food, water, and the occasional dragon toenail.  Clearly, dwarves should almost have the monopoly on the gem market, and they don't.  Barbarian culture is based around &quot;toughness and fighting&quot;, and it's no surprise to me that the bonuses granted on HT armor reflect the culture moreso than the diety.<br />
<br />
- Diety selection:   When I was a newbie, level 9 or 11 or so, I learned a very painful lesson on the docks of Butcherblock mountains.   After dying 6 times in a row while bound in freeport, and taking the boat back time and time again, what in essense was approximately 7 hours of playtime riding the buggy ass boats, I closely checked the &quot;kill messages&quot; and noticed that the issue was they were calling me &quot;infidel&quot;, meaning that the dwarven guards were opposed to my religion.  I figured as a half-elf I was cool with dwarves, but this was wrong.   I lost every one of my corpses that night and almost left the game because of it, and re-started from scratch.   Faction was a pretty big deal to me, and quite frankly, it was pretty annoying that there was no corresponding &quot;payoff&quot; for the negative faction hits I took, as I was also KOS to Ogres who were my Rallos Zek compatriots.   When FH came out i looked at it in relation to other armors and said &quot;well, there's the payoff&quot;.   It was a little too much IMO, but on the other hand, I saw the justification (i.e. one armor set made for each culture and pretty much matched the culture or diety from whence it came).   <br />
<br />
In the final analysis, yes, there should be some benefit to selecting a given diety, and a given culture over another.  Just because at a given point in time (i.e. when you made the choice) it didn't exist doesn't necessarily mean that it shouldn't evolve, or that it was right that it didn't.   I would say that there's probably a significantly better way of dealing with this than has been implemented (i.e. a base cultural set of stats and a no-fail combine which 'tailors' your armor piece to your class, making the difference between armor sets less, although I believe strongly that there shoudl be a difference).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could too bring up the poor Agnostic troll who did not know good races would still not like him, but its really miniscule and irrelevant.  Race is a far bigger penalty compared to diety (especially with FH). If we want to RP now should we  let Ogres, Trolls and Barbarians be twice as tough toe to toe compared to a Gnome? Should we introduce racial only armor where again the natural warrior races get better gear at an easier rate? <br />
<br />
I have no doubt you guys worked really hard, and do not want to see others enfringe on your hard work. <br />
<br />
But I do not understand why you do not mind every Tom Dick and Harry having  these pieces available today, yet are annoyed at the chance of non-FH and Trib factions having a similar shot at an equal type.  So to me it either means some smiths are worried about further price drops, or want to keep their advantage with the gear they own. <br />
<br />
I really do not believe its because of the roleplaying factor (roleplayers pick a diety because they want to be it, not because they can get gear easier).   <br />
<br />
Balance and RP cannot co-exist IMO in Everquest. Some just seem to use it when it benefits their argument.  Its just the way the game goes. Its about risk versus reward, the exact same with the actual warrior class and knights right now. One side has a better ratio. Not game breaking like Glatius said, but its still a fairly big gap, especially when you do get to the high end and a few hundred hp can take months to upgrade through raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If for example they made it that every rallos zek worshiper could make FH armor, it became no drop and only a 250 smither could wear it I doubt you would have many complaints (some though because like you said someone always has some problem). Its that it is so easily available today that is the problem,  especially for those who cannot wear it.<br />
<br />
Non-FH and trib armor is about the same as velious quested. FH and Trib are a step above it. It would not be such a big problem if the gap between velious quested and the next step up was so huge as far as risk and reward for non- FH and trib dieties.<br />
<br />
So I still think making ornate more common will be the best bet. Everyone will be happy.</div></div><hr />

You are in the vast minority, most people bought it in bazaar for far less effort. <br />
<br />
Lemme ask ya this Kavak.  If Fierce Heraldic was still so godawful rare that it sold for 15k+ per ring (that is 15k for bracers and such, 30k for helm, gaunts, pauldron, 45k for greaves/bp, or in Frodlin's case, 60k or a vindi BP), would it still be &quot;too good&quot; for the effort?<br />
<br />
Because I did not hear this complaint at all when I was selling armor.  No one bitched about how their chosen deity/race combo was getting shafted and that it wasn't fair because RZ people got their stuff too easily.  Would it still be unfair if only the richest of the rich on the server had this stuff and you never saw tanks running around in red?<br />
<br />
I think your major problem with this armor is the fact that mudflation, and in my opinion, poor judgement on a smith's part, has brought the price down.  I took a month off in March before I quit for good shortly after I came back in april, and in that time, my once almost cornered market on Fierce had taken a serious fall on CT.  Smiths were selling armor for less than the total cost of all the parts and the 60% fail rate I was having, which means they HAD to have spent time farming every single piece.<br />
<br />
The point is that for someone to be selling greaves for 5 or 10k, they are taking a major kick in the teeth selling pieces that low for the work involved in making a few pieces.  Try it if you haven't.  Go gather up enough components to make yourself a full visible set of Heraldic, and make note of how long that takes you.  It's goddamned boring, shitty work.  Then triple that amount, because the fail rate was complete ass when I came back.  I went 1 for 7 on my last batch before I quit, with MAXIMUM SKILL.  20k in blue diamonds down the shitter, 16 man hours in skyfire, down the shitter.  6 hours in Crystal Caverns, down the shitter, all for a pair of boots which I could sell for 5k at the current server prices.  <br />
<br />
Mudflation should not play a role in balancing gear.  If you're getting Cultural armor for that cheap, someone is taking it up the ass, either in the pocketbook, or in their time playing EQ.  Just remember, at one time, Ykesha's were 10k strong.  Just because Joe Noob can pick them up in the bazaar now for 200pp and give him to his necro pet doesn't mean that it's unbalanced gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway isn't  mudflation against the logic being used here why this armor should stay to the benefit of RZ and HT armor? So that the people who supposedly worked ten times as hard for everyone else to get their cultural armor efforts are not diminished?<br />
<br />
And if you agree that mudflation is necessary don't you also agree armor like ornate should be brought more in line?<br />

Can't have it both ways.</div></div><hr />

I think you're misunderstanding my position, and I apologize for not separating the anecdote from the position well enough to make that occur.<br />
<br />
My position is a simple one:<br />
<br />
1. Fierce Heraldic armor is too good for the *danger* required to get it, not the effort, but the risk.   Effort and risk are two entirely different things.   <br />
<br />
I put a lot of effort 2 years ago into getting my eyepatch of plunder, but the effort was absolutely stupid and meaningless, I busied myself by timing cougar killings (and don't tell anyone but I polished off a few gnomes out of boredom too).  The only 'challenge' was,  would my patience outlast Stormfeather's spawn rate?   166 hours later, it did.   <br />
<br />
Killing greenies for hours at time in order to collect rare components for tradeskilling is patently absurd.<br />
<br />
If now for instance, the components themselves were *no drop* and came from similar level mobs to HoT type mobs, I wouldn't have much issue with it, but they're not.<br />
<br />
- NOT FOR ONE MINUTE do I believe that FH quality armor should be equippable by a Paladin or cleric or SK, I am opposed to FH and HT being equippable by bards, except for the fact that RZ/Tribunal bards are almost nonexistent.   As i stated earlier, I think besides ornate being more common (which I agree with, although I'd argue that if Ornate were more common, the molds should be no-drop to prevent the bazaarization of ornate armor, and to encourage hunting for your own upgrades), cultural armor could probably stand being finalized by the person wearing it in a no-fail class specific upgrade which would balance this issue out.<br />
<br />
- Since ogres and trolls and iksar with faction issues DO receive racial benefits, there's a payoff already in place for the disadvantage.   Besides that, faction issues based on race are specifically covered and we are informed of them from the getgo when we start playing EQ (it's in the manual) whereas we're not informed anywhere that I'm aware of of the negative consequences of diety selection, yet there needs to be an offsetting bonus for the disadvantage, or at least in my mind there should be.  I dont' think that it should be as large as it is, but it should be there regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah do not know how to edit but my last posts wording was all out of line and a big mess. Completely disregard it please.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I  basically meant to say was you guys are using mudflation as a reason for your effort, but now are saying it should not be used as a reason for balance at all. Effort is a huge part about mudflation IMO. <br />
<br />
I personally think mudflation will always be there and play a role, but it can still me messed up (windblade selling for 5kpp after a month or whaterver after pop was released before nerf),<br />
<br />
Also 16 hours is a weekend raid for me in SSra, with zero advancement most of the time. I have done a ton of Verants boring quests. I am willing to bet over the levels I have camped stormfeather himself as long as it would take to become a grandmaster smith, and I still do not have his piece. I am also a Master potter and Fletcher.<br />
<br />
So I believe I do understand as to what hard work for advancement in this game is.<br />
<br />
It still does not change the fact that this armor is obtained for a small fee  by the majority of people, and the rate of ornate entering the servers are miniscule even 6 months after pop has been released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then, once again, what does it come down to?  Was Cultural implemented correctly, or was Velious and Ornate implemented poorly?<br />
<br />
Had either been implemented better, there wouldn't be a problem, and I think we can agree they are both broken (I'm sorry, but after lookng at other Velious greaves, I can't believe I ever got excited when my Champs dropped) and apparantly Ornate is as rare as that ancient cyclops in east karana.<br />
<br />
So change either (with the corresponding changes up the ladder to all greaves higher level than velious), and you've solved the problem, no?</div></div><hr />

<br />
FH armor requires you to farm some pp to buy it in bazaar and click a diety at character creation. You guys are  assuming everyone has to become a GM smith to wear it. You do not, in fact the vast minority took that route as I said earlier. its not required, it was a choice. Its a lot easier to raise the cash for it if effort was all you were concerned about.<br />
<br />
Frod:-&quot;&quot;I put a lot of effort 2 years ago into getting my eyepatch of plunder, but the effort was absolutely stupid and meaningless, I busied myself by timing cougar killings (and don't tell anyone but I polished off a few gnomes out of boredom too). The only 'challenge' was, would my patience outlast Stormfeather's spawn rate? 166 hours later, it did.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
LOl I feel you there, the quest is shocking, I am still after him after a year and a half. Hopefully they can make the bird not miss spawns at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frod:-&quot;&quot;Killing greenies for hours at time in order to collect rare components for tradeskilling is patently absurd.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree 100%, I was not even commenting on the situation of trade skills, but this seems to be Verants mentality for anything worthwhile these days. So I agree, not just with tradeskills but with charms, ssra and above, anything as its painful. But people still do not need to do any tradeskills to wear FH armor.<br />
<br />
Frod:-&quot;&quot;If now for instance, the components themselves were *no drop* and came from similar level mobs to HoT type mobs, I wouldn't have much issue with it, but they're not.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
I personally have no issue if they are droppable or not, I am just trying to show some that the effort line of reasoning does not really cut it. yes overall if we look at the game, Everquest is too harsh in areas, not just tradeskills. I personally have an issue with:- <br />
<br />
a: Something needs to be done to make other diety and agnostics get armor a little more accessible (better ornate drops IMO).<br />
<br />
<br />
b: RP is a silly line of reasoning if you want to justify droppable gear that any joe who clicks RZ at creation and has a bit of pp can use. If you want to use RP as a line of reasoning then I am sure you Rpers would like the work and effort made so that it is worn as a symbol of your ode to your god by tradeskilling for it, and making it no drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;- NOT FOR ONE MINUTE do I believe that FH quality armor should be equippable by a Paladin or cleric or SK, I am opposed to FH and HT being equippable by bards, except for the fact that RZ/Tribunal bards are almost nonexistent. As i stated earlier,&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah this is where it can be a little messy, because like Glatius said earlier (I think it was him)  this is not just a  warrior problem. So if you make armor that caters to non-diety and other diety warriors you have to make armor that caters to every other class as well. It can really be messy, never be balanced and it causes a huge mess. Thats why I still believe that a better ornate drop rate will really solve many issues. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; I think besides ornate being more common (which I agree with, although I'd argue that if Ornate were more common, the molds should be no-drop to prevent the bazaarization of ornate armor, and to encourage hunting for your own upgrades),&quot;<br />
<br />
Couldn't the same be said for FH as far as being no drop and droppable heh?  Anyways it does not matter much to me personally because I hunt in BOT a lot, but FH statwise at least is very close and in some cases better than ornate  and always for sale so the damage is already done. The effects of ornate are nice and a disticnt advantage however. Though even if they made it 10 times more common it would still be pretty rare (honestly do ornate bracers even exist?)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;- Since ogres and trolls and iksar with faction issues DO receive racial benefits, there's a payoff already in place for the disadvantage.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I meant racial benefits to their class in the form of droppable armor, like dieties are getting right now. It was an example as to why roleplaying was a silly reason. People cannot complain about the warrior class in general in other threads and then say &quot;Don't worry about what others have&quot; at the same time without sounding a little contradictory IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sites like this make roleplaying in a  mmorpg like Everquest non-existant. The game has been made static with all the spoiler information on varius websites (not the websites faults mind you, they are an example of what people want out of this game IMO). Its just not a true roleplaying game. Did you guys spend a while in IC finding out about the four map pieces? Or did you read it on some web site or heard it from someone who read a web site?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot; Besides that, faction issues based on race are specifically covered and we are informed of them from the getgo when we start playing EQ (it's in the manual) whereas we're not informed anywhere that I'm aware of of the negative consequences of diety selection, yet there needs to be an offsetting bonus for the disadvantage, or at least in my mind there should be. I dont' think that it should be as large as it is, but it should be there regardless.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
A RZ DE warrior at least has pretty much zero faction problems over my DE agnostic warrior. There is no risk picking the God Rallos Zek. Only reward over others. In this game 99% of the people who do play it do not roleplay. So what is the incentive for all these new Rallos Zek worshipers? Roleplaying? No armor that is easily accessible for its statistics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well okay if we have if we have to use the RP as a good argument and why certain dieties should get benefits I will explain why I have a  problem with it. I think that if you want a benefit for worshiping your God, you have to work hard for it. I don't think you should get any benefit over another diety just because you clicked another button at creation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look at Glatius for example. He worked hard for it and I have no problem with him wearing armor like that. But really it is foolish to think with cheap armor selling like candy in bazaar that most took that route.<br />
<br />
Again personally I do not have a problem with FH being droppable, but I do not even see this as a roleplaying game anymore (yes before its rehashed ten times in the strictest sense where you really do roleplay as a follower of Rallos Zek, technically yes you are playing the role of someone other than yourself but the same can be said of all games) as so few people use it for that reason.<br />
<br />
So if I had to acknowlegde that most choose Rallos Zek because they wanted to roleplay, and it was a justifiable reason as to why some get benefits over others, that is why I would have a problem with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am firmly convinced you lack the ability to comprehend what you read. When taken in context, I was pointing out the fact that *if they wanted to make FH superior* they should have done it with stats instead of HP.<br />

<br />
People whinning because they cant wear it, and then want everyone else to suffer also<br />

So I will clarify one last  time :)<br />
<br />
If we want to view this in roleplaying terms I believe dieties should have to work much harder than just visiting bazaar with platinum, and then I would have a problem with FH being droppable to any Joe who has a bit of cash and can click &quot;Rallos Zek&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
However personally I do not believe roleplaying to be a good reason, so I really have no problem with it being droppable right now.  I would just like  some more accessible armor like most RZ warriors have right now (ie see more ornate drop).<br />
<br />
So what I am trying to say in conclusion is not matter what way you look at it, Its not in line with the current situation from any side of any argument as far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I sounded confusing and disjointed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Haas:- Changing greaves in Velios armor does not solve much. Firstly FH is a full set of armor minus rings, earings and range slot. Velious armor has no visible slots. FH also beats velious armor in almost every slot as far as. hp/ac ratio (save bp and gauntlets), <br />
<br />
Not to mention some of us are going on years of wearing it now, and would like some new upgrades that are more accessible (hint:ornate).<br />
<br />
I really do miss velious sometimes, its an expansion Verant got right on IMO. Although plate bp and leg drops in kael used to irritate me hehe.<br />
<br />
Velious armor is old now. There is no &quot;warrior&quot; only line of armor in Luclin at all, just drops off high end ssra and above. There is warrior quested armor in POP that is fairly accessible (non-elemental), but its so rare equiping a guild in it will take a lifetime.<br />
<br />
In fact looking at it that could be the very problem heh, cannot believe I did not see it sooner. Every expansion but Luclin has seen full sets of class-specificarmor and quested armor for certain classes, except luclin (well and LOY but wtf is that anyway). So the gap is 2 expansions for non-FH and non-tribunal wearers. FH and HT fills that gap for those diety worshipers, but others are left with nota  lot to work with.<br />
<br />
Even then the simplest fix would be ornate drop rates, even if they made it no drop. Its pretty good risk versus reward with the zones you have to hunt in, they just fubared the drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we look at the expansions Verant have always (save luclin) put in sets of armor that while not easy to obtain, are made to equip raiding guilds or small raids looking to gear up. Crafted, Indo, Cobalt, Champsm Myr and Warlords. The next in sets of questable/class specific armor is Kizraks<br />
<br />
Sure there might be a better drop off of a named in a particular expansion compared to a slot ot two but if you did not obtain it at least you have the quested armore which was fairly close in stats. Now you have people based on diety all gunning for those drops off of rare named because they have expansion old slots that are not going to be upgraded anytime soon unless they can get the drop off the named.<br />
<br />
The difference with Luclin is you are spending guild time farming shards and key pieces (ie slowing of the treadmill), and not respective armor upgrade pieces off random mobs. <br />
<br />
And this is specifically a good  case for a nerf not being needed for cultural, and instead a fix on ornate drops or an introduction to luclin quested (or just plane more accessable armor that is not 1 in a million rare) armor if there ever was.</div></div><hr />

Cultural armor is much more unbalanced at level 50.<br />
<br />
The best thing would be to require a leather padding made from no drop silks from mobs like ice borrowers in WW in the last combine (these mobs already drop tailoring tradeskill stuff, so it should not be too hard on smiths if they dropped smithing tradeskill drops too).<br />
Maybe each cultural armor type should drop such a no drop item and the level of the mob could then be used to balance it somewhat.<br />
<br />
Maybe a few HP should be added to Velious and Ssra armor too, just to bring them somewhat in balance.</div></div><hr />

Your pseudo-intellectual questioning of the basic intelligence of the people that have taken issue with your position normally doesn't even work in a high school debate match. Debate is a give and take, point/counterpoint. You made a valid point stating that  you were upset that the Warriors that wear RZ and HT armors have an advantage over ones that wear all the other versions of BD armor. That you were upset that the armors were not balanced for all warriors. Myself and a couple of others made the point that the armors were balanced for the classes capable of using them within the respective cultures. Until I called you out about it, you did not address our arguments, yet re-stated your own original argument as if no one had understood and responded to it when in fact 2 or 3 actually did.<br />
<br />
Yes, I used language meant to draw a certain response when I asked if you wished to  screw the other classes on their cultural, or just give RZ and HT wearers the shaft. The point of a debate is to make folks believe your side. Language takes an important part in that. But that's no more baiting thanbelittling someone by telling them to read and not skim your own posts if they wish to debate you as a response. You could probably count on one hand the number of bards that worship RZ or the Tribunal on any given server, not a blip on the radar as far as a measureable percentage of possible wearers <br />
<br />
In response to me you wrote Actually if you were reading my posts you wouldn't have had to ask. Look a page or two back and see the part where I say:<br />
<br />
&quot;They need to be brought in line one way or the other, raise every other piece to FH level or nerf FH..one of the two should happen to make up for the fact that the armors were very poorly designed and implemented&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To which I asked point blank :Yes I read what you wrote. I just never saw you say what you would do. Screw all the other classes on their cultural, or screw the RZ and HT folks.<br />
<br />
And your snappy comeback:Baiting much?<br />
<br />
If you read it try comprehending it. I don't give a fuck which would happen, but one of the two should happen.<br />
<br />
I did read it, and understood it. You said one of 2 things should happen. It's not my job to read your mind and pick which one you want to happen to correct the injustice. I do that, then I'm assuming and we know what that does to us all. And again, you say I'm baiting while in the same post denigrating my reading comprehension. You would not call that baiting? However, in all that you did manage to answer, even though it was a copout I think, avoiding taking a public stand and decisively having to alienate one of the groups that would be hurt by the correction you believe is necessary.<br />
<br />
Personally, as I said in the thread a bit later, I'd have liked to see each class within the culture have it's own armor with stats geared to the class. But I also don't think, with 3 more expansions due out before EQ2 comes next summerish, not to mention finishing Time on the fly and dealing with gramatically/spelling challenged NPC and every broken door in every city in Norrath, that they are going to do anything about it. Some people, like myself just luckily picked a good diety before the armors were introduced. I picked Tribunal because I like the idea of Justice uncompromised by subjective thoughts of &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;. Others probably re-rolled to take advantage of the newly introduced armors. Not my business to tell em how to play, but it's not something I would have done myself. Then there are all the people making new warriors after the BD armors were introduced that are taking full advantage of the gear available. I see how that might upset people...hell it upsets me and I can make and wear the stuff. But it's no different from having a bunch of Uber friends take a character along and protect them to loot a bunch of no drop gear that couldn't possibly be gained at the level a character is. Now I just need to go out and find some Uber friends to do that for me.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it just comes down to different personalities and ways of looking at things. If I were a different religion, say a Halfling worshipping Karana, the RZ and HT armors would not bother me at all. Since I don't play on a Zek server, and have friends and guildmates that I group with regularly, I see the game as Me and my group against the game, not against other players, so what another player wears does not impact me. The difference between the different armor sets is not game-altering in my opinion. You obviously have a different take on the situation. <br />
<br />
I wish you well in your further adventures in the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crist0</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you did not address our arguments<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I did..you simply didn't like the fact that your argument wasn't valid because a mana using class used those armors as well.<br />
<br />
Now let me tell you a story:<br />
<br />
A Chinese king asked Sun Tzu to train his concubines. He takes them out to the courtyard, and explains that when he gives the signal to face right, they turn right, left they turn left, front they turn front, and rear they turn to the rear.  <br />
<br />
He listed the orders three times and explained them five times. Then he gave the order to face right...and all of the concubines started laughing.<br />
<br />
He said, 'If regulations are not clear and orders are not thoroughly explained, it is the commander's fault.'<br />
He then listed the orders an additional three times and explained them five more times.<br />
<br />
He then gave the order again - and all of the concubines laughed again.<br />
<br />
He then said, 'If instructions are not clear and commands not explicit, it is the commander's fault. But when they have been made clear, and are not carried out, it is a crime on the part of the officers.&quot;<br />
<br />
He took the commanders of the left and right flank, the king's two favorite concubines, and had them beheaded on the spot.<br />
<br />
Do you see how that story could possibly relate to the discussion we are having right now?</div></div><hr />

Because of the velious legs that preceeded them. If Velious legs for warriors had been balanced correctly against other melee legs (Paladin Kael legs have 70 GODDAMNED HP.....CLERIC Kael legs have 90hp FFS), then Ssra/VT legs would have been itemized appropriately as 90-100+ like they should have been. <br />

Eh, what the hell does single class armour from mid-Velious have to do with high end Luclin armour which can be used by ALL plate users? Im almost positive that cultural was released near the start of Luclin, so why should player made shit come anywhere close to competing with what was then available to like 1 guild per server or less. The legs were poorly implemented, taking a cookiecutter approach with no consideration to what other current itemization.<br />
<br />
People whinning because they cant wear it, and then want everyone else to suffer also. <br />
<br />
Hey, take a look at my Magelo and see how dumb that statement is. The fact is that My guild has been through VT, is currently in Elemental planes and STILL has 2 warriors using Cultural legs because they didnt luck out on Fiery Might and Fennin has been a bitch to us. The other leggings in Luclin/tier3 POP just werent a big enough improvement to warrant taking. If that isnt classically imbalanced, I dont know what is.</div></div><hr />

See how easy this is when you speak directly? Ok I stipulate that a Bard can wear HT and RZ armor. That point given, any Bard that choose the Six Hammers or Warlord as their diety has gone against the norm with regard to diety for their class. I'm all for that. No one wants to see cookie-cutter characters. But I believe my point that those Bards represent a statistical fraction of the wearers of those 2 armors of less than 5% is not the same thing as for all the other races where more mana users will be wearing them than Warriors. The good of the many over the good of the few</div></div><hr />

Again, the solution is to make all cultural BD armors customizeable for the intended class, but unfortunately that's just not gonna happen. Think I'm done flogging this horse now, why not find a windmill all Warriors can tilt at together?<br />

I wish you well</div></div><hr />

Yeah.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
Because as an agnostic warrior I can't wear it.<br />
<br />
Do I want it nerfed?<br />
No.<br />
<br />
What do I want?<br />
I want access to comparable armor with a comparable level of effort OR I want the ability to change religion.<br />
<br />
When I created my Ogre Warrior *pre-Kunark*, there was no reason to choose a religion. My faction was bad everywhere except Oggok/Neriak regardless of my choice and I kind of liked the idea of a Warrior thumbing his nose at the petty beings that called themselves gods. Things are somewhat different now. If I was to re-roll, my new warrior would be RZ.</div></div><hr />

I snuck into Freeport (invis) to do epic handin's recently. I'm fairly sure the guards were threatening (will check tonight with a new agnostic ogre using the PoK books). As far as I recall I also got attacked by Qeynos guards before I slaughtered Blackburrow several times and was welcomed as a long lost brother.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 places I can remember that my friends RZ Ogre was KOS before faction work and I wasn't (just dubious). Katta and Fairies in WL.<br />

<br />
I don't mind a quest, so long as it is either soloable, or at worst single groupable.<br />
<br />
or even unable to sell in your own town to merchants sucked (try a half elf warrior RZ and see what happens). <br />
Not much of a disadvantage now. Just hit the book to PoK and all is well. Doubt many new Warriors spend more than a few hours in their hometown before moving out for good.</div></div><hr />

I get a feeling I need to strangle someone. I agree thought smeeth should be able to make high end armor, but then maybe if its THAT GOOD it should have been requiered those who want the fucking stuff go and skill up not just give some lame amount of cash for upgrades like those.<br />
<br />
As I said in general I am happy that its available for my fellow warriors. Just dont fucking dare try to wave your red armor in my face saying how many hp you got. I get pissed off thinking I spent hours and you spent cash and we now in same boat so it seems.</div></div><hr />

Made an Agnostic Ogre Warrior and a RZ Ogre Warrior. Straight out of the box, no faction hits except newbie note handin.<br />
<br />
Both Freeport and Qeynos guards were threatening to both characters.</div></div><hr />

Anything is possible...<br />

<br />
I agree, and the HP advantage is *even smaller* for the average agnostic Warrior.<br />
<br />
SK's (and Paladin's) are *required* to choose a religion, so they all benefit from cultural by default. Not only do Warriors struggle to maintain any competitive advantage over Knights, but *some* Warriors start even further behind.<br />
<br />
And yeah, it annoys the hell out of me.</div></div><hr />
