<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I have yet another question about hate procs... <br />
<br />
/sigh <br />
<br />
I just got a CHSD tonight, and before this was using CHoS mainhand and SotB in offhand. <br />
<br />
I was the only warrior on the raid, so it defaulted to me, but now I have to try and figure out, honestly, which proc is more aggro? <br />
<br />
Is 450 hate better than 75dd + stun? Equal? <br />
<br />
Only got to use it a tiny bit tonight, tried the CHSD mainhand, and copperhammer offhand, seemed okay, but I've read somewhere here that stun &gt; 450 aggro. Any truth to this? <br />
<br />
Any and all comments or suggestions very welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can someone post the exact hate on Taunting Blow? And yes I hold aggro better with my CHSD then I did with my CHoS. Granted some fights it wont proc and some fights it wont stop proccing. So it can be aggravating. But when it procs aggro is mine the rest of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">arf arf<br />
<br />
Taunting Blow = 450 pts.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you're not familiar with the LUCY database yet, it's a great site for that kinda info.  Procs are looked up in the &quot;Spell Search&quot; box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It really does feel like nearly equivalent aggro.<br />
<br />
If I had to hazard a guess, I'd say that the CHOS proc is 75 hate (for the DD, whether resisted or not) + 300 hate (for the stun, whether immune/resisted or not) = 375 hate.<br />
<br />
Taunting Blow is 450 hate (unresistable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CHOS is 175DD, not 75 :)<br />
SotB is 75DD.<br />
<br />
The good thing I found is that it either gets totally resisted (both components) or lands, which means you always get 175 or 75 DD if the proc lands, no partial resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khalad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have both and without the proof of parses it is my opinion that the CHSD is far more effective then the CHoS in generating, maintaining and regaining aggro when it's my turn to take the beating. The CHSD is my most valued piece of gear and my precioussssss has not let me down. (AND as a proper Dwarven Warrior the graphic for the CHSD is a sight to behold while the CHoS looks like a dainty carpenters finishing hammer... nuff said :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Copper Hammer of Striking is 179dd, not 175.  But close enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Erm yes... brain fart on my part hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kyryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've used CHSD in main and CHoS in offhand for quite some time now.  I've tried reversing them as well.<br />
<br />
The proc rate on CHSD seems to be far greater than on the CHoS, at least anecdotally.<br />
<br />
Since you were lucky enough to get it, use it. It's really a great weapon.  I really really love it when it goes streaky in my favor too.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to really skew the equation, go put the ykesha proc on your CHSD :)</div></div><hr />
