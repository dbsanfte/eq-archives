<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arlusair</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So like many others, my guild like to use a ranger to WS pull PoP gods. I never fully understood this and just wanted to get a clear answer. While the ranger is WS'd, as the MT do you just taunt without attacking or do you attack and taunt to build up hate? <br />
<br />
I dont attack and use the taunt key while the ranger is WS and then AE taunt when WS goes down and then I start swingings. Is this how it's suppose to be done?? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parv</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wait until heals are rolling on me, then start attacking and taunting.   If that means that it takes clerics 30 seconds to get in place and set up a rotation and the ranger gibs, so be it.  Does you no good to suddenly pull agro by just taunting the mob before heals are going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Ranger Announces 10seconds left<br />
<br />
3. Warrior counts to 5, then ae taunts<br />
<br />
4. Ranger gets out of MT corner<br />
<br />
Thats a basic WS agro boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">monk or warrior da pull &gt; weaponshield.  Either works depending on the rampage dps of the mob.  Its nice with rots also as heals dont land with them da so no heal aggro ect.  Why waste a rangers dps when you can da pul with a tank, not lose dps and gain a def war on rampage.  Pretty dumb imo.  Of course you need to ae taunt when the mobs in range, but chances are the ranger will still die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our rangers almsot never die on transition, and they can tank rampage in potime fine...we have a warrior tag second on agro list though, so he/she is behind the ranger for rampage. As far as lost dps, everything's cornered for us anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parv</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">monk or warrior da pull &gt; weaponshield <br />
Only problem with that is sometimes agro will get fucked up randomly - I've had times where Monq would charge in DA, I'll come in a few seconds later, and the mob will just ignore him and jump on me once I get into proximity agro range, usually before heals have started.  Half the time when a cleric DA's the puller after the puller gets hard agro, the cleric will get on rampage.  It might work well if you cast DA on the MT, but you still run into the proximity agro problems while DA and setting up.  It's shady agro the way DA works, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not.  Rangers give the benefit of providing agro while being basically DA.  And yeah, we wall just about everything, so disc loss doesn't hurt.<br />
<br />
And if you need AE taunt for initial agro....I definitely know I'm doing something wrong when I need to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stikka</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our rangers die about 50% of the time when WSing (I get to drag their bodies :) ), but it is a worthwhile sacrifice.<br />
<br />
Usually goes this way.<br />
<br />
Monk pulls, Ranger tags with bow at long range and lobs arrows till target there.<br />
Hits WS disc, tanks and chain casts snares etc while stood on the MT. MT hits attack and taunts a bit.<br />
Ranger calls WS off in 5 and Jolts like mad, MT AE taunts, mob beats on MT.<br />
<br />
Ranger only dies when MT is a tad slow or his jolting goes to hell or if we havent seen a wafer thin tree hugger in the last 20 minutes :D<br />
<br />
It's just a matter of practice and I am sure there are a few dozen different ways to do the job, but the above works for us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WS is nice for really big hitters such as reparm (and maybe blazzax. of course a good debuff team can do it before he even gets to camp but they usally are gay and wimps about it so WS works well....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from my experiences before we WSd a lot until now where we use it alot. Agro control definetly seems better for us especially on mobs that always went wacky like ofossa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a ranger to WS on Reparm usually Maybe other times but rare..<br />
<br />
1.) Reparm pulled...<br />
<br />
2.) Ranger activates WS - has a RT CH cycle with SS's going.<br />
<br />
3.) CH cycle starts on MT, along with Rune/SS cycles<br />
<br />
4.) Debuffers call debuffs. Tash/Malos/HoS<br />
<br />
5.) Shaman Slows...<br />
<br />
6.) When Slow is called, I pop  Defensive, attack<br />
<br />
7.) After first CH lands on me. AoE Taunt...and normal Taunt<br />
<br />
8.) Ranger slinks off..<br />
<br />
IF I die, next tank is standing next to me, not attacking, he steps onto mycorpse. He calls defensive, when heals land he does AoE Taunt... <br />
<br />
On transition, you sacrifice whoever gets aggro, no way around it.<br />
<br />
We have done Reparm this way for about a month every 3 days. Very rarely do we ever get to the ST before Enrage. Our MT's have 9300, 9100, and 8900 HP's</div></div><hr />
