<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamov</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 things i want to ask about this encounter:<br />
<br />
1) Is there any way to split the golems without a FD'er / bard? Can I just aggro everything and train to zone in, since DD is supposed to be tethered? Had an yellow con earlier today so it doesn't seem like paccing them and pull DD would be a viable idea.<br />
<br />
2) Should I find a 2hb/ piercing weapon to tank him? I have a sews atm, but seeing the fact that my group's dps is pretty poor (clr, druid, bst, nec, enc, war), I am a bit tempted to get something like a gsot4w/GSoT and A2 aug'd it just for this fight. (DD is slash resistant, right?)<br />
<br />
any other tips on DD would be appreciated as well.<br />
<br />

<br />
yes he is leashed<br />
<br />
no you don't need a bard if you have a good chanter (whom you'll need for DD anyway)<br />
<br />
i wouldn't consider Clr, Dru, Bst, Nec, Enc and War poor DPS .. <br />
oh and i'd let the Nec pull :P<br />
i use the Votal's blade shown in my inventory, so a sews should be doing good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1)  Not sure about the split.  Have always had a Monk or Necro with me that could split it.  DD is, in fact, leashed.<br />
<br />
2)  This is before I got my Darkblade yesterday... but before that I use JoS+EoE(Both with A3) for tanking.  On the DD I pulled out the BoW and tanked her for max DPS and tankability since you can't use Def.  I didn't notice that she was resistant to slashing, DPS seemed fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Virtually no GoD mobs have resistances against weapon types any more.<br />
<br />
All Ikaavs have Chaos Guard though, which mitigates all damage by 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamov</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks.<br />
<br />
1 more question: pulling with dispell takes care of chaos guard, right?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atila</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you want to pull with dispell might even hit it a couple times to make sure you get rid of chaos gaurd. This helps a ton on dps, I cant imagine killing him with that 50% mitigation on the whole time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">07-28-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need anything special for pulling the golems. Can tag with an arrow and just wait out in the hallway. The DD and her pets will spawn and run up to you, but will despawn as they leave the room. They can make it out a tad so just back up and let the golem warp on you. I don't think you can leave them up and pac because the adds spawn in those corners where they stand so I'd imagine they would add during the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pull the golem on her left (your right when facing them).  The golem on her right (your left) does not aggro on the DD pull.  Respawns can be a problem if you didn't time/space them out correctly.  We always let all the pats respawn once all of the static spawns were cleared.  This way we could plow through the respawns in about 10-14 minutes leaving plenty of time for the DD fight to ensure no respawns get in the way.<br />
<br />
I haven't done the trial in months so I have no idea of the current fight.  Originally she had 150k hp, then it was dropped down to 100k.  I brought a bunch of pumice stones for the melee and casters since right clickies allow them to instantly cast a memmed spell.  With 5 of us dispelling we made sure to debuff her as much as possible.  The warrior would use riposte disc at the start then stonewall for the rest of the fight.  Depending on your dps, the fight should last approx 2 min, still leaving some time on your disc when the cruel illusion spawns... a much easier fight than the DD.  I think I parsed the CI for like 300 dps with stonewall.</div></div><hr />

Ikkinz single trials have been nerfed a lot. <br />
<br />
I did one again last week. Groupe was enc, rog, mon, mag, cle and war :<br />
<br />
- http://membres.lycos.fr/Odeus/eqparses/ikkinz1-single-0722.htm : PA and DD fights parses.<br />
<br />
- engaged first mob at 00h23, killed Diabolic Destroyer at 1h15. Those were taking almost 2h30 - 3 hours before. Way less trash to clear.<br />
<br />
- Pixxt Annihilator dead in 54s, and ONLY 367 dps.<br />
<br />
- Diabolic Destroyer dead in 49s, and ONLY 484 dps. Low ac too to parse 338 slashing dps on dd with db/bf...<br />
<br />
And  WITHOUT any def/evasive disc... Just used furious then fellstrike on those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, that is a huge nerf.   I guess they gimped it so most can defeat it w/o a heavy reliance upon Time gear.  DD was doing 1000 dps on Time equipped warriors, stonewall, and 2300-2500AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at least we know that they prefer to gimp a content rather than give knights def or furious :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamov</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe your high dps group together with the riposte disc largely distorted the dps of DD... look at the parse, DD had a 29 % hit rate (versus the universal 60 w/o avoidance) on you...<br />
<br />
I did DD yesterday... tanked him for 2 min 30 secs, and took around 987 dps. (no riposte disc available since i blew it on a wipe trying to place the healers in the hallway :P)  Of course you gear is alot better than mine, but I stlil think the main reason you got such low dps from DD is because 15 seconds out of your 49 seconds tanking DD were on a riposte disc together with an unlucky streak of rolls on DD's part...<br />
<br />
Was doing it at around 10700/ ~2.2 AC as your reference.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot for the input, however, helped alot :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to add, I had previously thought that DD would turn on the next person on aggro list if we used defensive or stonewall.  I accidently hit stonewall after my furious broke and he DID jump off me, onto a monk.  <br />
<br />
This lasted only a few seconds, I was able to get aggro back and it held with stonewall up throughout the fight.  It really helped us out.  10.5k tank, 2k ac at the time.  We won with monk, mage, cleric, warrior, druid and enchanter.  No ae mez, just bliss and the mage used a heavy DS on both myself and the monk.<br />
<br />
Monk pulled with dispell, popped his disc, then I took over.  Worked very well.  Also, once DD dies, another yellow named popped, so be ready for that as well<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamov</div><div class="date">08-07-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the adds just keeps popping ugh. Ask my enchanter, due to a complete lack of dps (bst and I only...) the fight last for 3+ minutes for once... i think he mezzed 10+ mobs. <br />
<br />
Alot easier once the enc get used to it / get the GoD AE mez tho. Other ikkinz trials are trivial compared to this one, how lame.<br />
