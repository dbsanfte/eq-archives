<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I choose to go mostly for HP's after doing searches here and asking around.. and now at level 33 I question if it was a bad decision.  At my current lvl (33) this is my Stats:<br />
<br />
AC:  756<br />
HP:  1901<br />
ATK: 794<br />
<br />
If I was to wear the highest AC in all slots (using only the gear I own of course) I end up with this:<br />
<br />
AC:  812<br />
HP:  1668<br />
ATK: 811<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm wondering is... is the higher HP configuration worth the loss of AC?  I am personally inclined to say yes but I haven't parsed anything to see if breaking 800 AC would reap a reward greater than an extra 250ish hp's extra on my main config.  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
P.S.  I've also thought that maybe I shouldn't worry about AC effects until 50ish due to my defense not being as high as it is going to be when it starts to matter a lot more than now at 33.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ac at that level. either way your hp will increase and so will your ac so each is fine just 50ac&gt;240hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">add about 325 AC to that total for purposes of Max Defence, then compare what your in with other 60 warriors.<br />
<br />
Your AC is fine in either set, I myself would stick with the HP gear, as your not loosing a whole lot of AC, but your gaining a bunch more HP (if any of it was from stamina, the gap will only increase as you level as well)<br />
<br />
and 750ish AC at 33 is nothing to laugh at.  Before Kunark, most warriors at 50 had a hard time cracking that.<br />
<br />
and in a few more levels when you do need to be CHed, youll be more efficient with it having more HP.  your only a few levels away from CH territory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I am certainly getting mixed answers.  I can see the CH points tho.  Just went for the HP's due to the overwhelming answers to that on the serverwide.thesteelwarrior channel everyone pretty much said go hp go hp always.  Is there a HP per AC theory I should use ?  like 10hp=1AC or something.... I know there might be nothing in stone but a theory?<br />
<br />
Side note, I will try the AC gear see how it goes..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">first, read the uber tanking thread thats stickied on this forum.  Once you have read that you will see different mobs have different di/db and that really determines whether ac is better than hp... However, if you see xp mobs hitting you for the min value often then go with the higher hp outfit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1ac = 10hp ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At your level, the AC is more important.<br />
<br />
Get to 1k AC FIRST, then start tinkering around with trying to max hit points.<br />
<br />
You're still tanking monsters where AC mitigation makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Truthfully, at your level Gun, it all depends what you want, a lil higher AC, or a lil higher HP.  Do YOU value a higher ac or a higher HP.  <br />
<br />
And i dont think the &quot;ubermob tanking&quot; thread will give him the answers he needs, as he wont even be thinking bout tanking most of the stuff it talks about for at least another 30 levels.<br />
<br />
as you sit, your gear is far better than most warriors had at lvl 30. with either set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're higher AC set shows a better over all quality of equipement, with 194sta still.  IMO, no questions, say with your highest AC value.  When you get 55+ and are tanking in xp groups in Tier1 pop, you'll be glad you have more AC.<br />
<br />
At level 33, as someone who has healed your level range, AC matters a ton more until you hook up with a 39+ cleric.  Even then, they can live with whatever amount of HPs you have.  Since most everyone has KEI now, it won't matter too much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donvanlot</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't worry too much about gear at that level, but for the short-term I'd go with AC since you won't get Ched much.  Besides CH the only reason I can see hps being important is breaking a tough spawn.<br />
<br />
Hopefully you'll be 45+ in no time and you can gradually switch over your gear! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OgreOverlord</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Ide be more likely to go about half way between what ppl are sayin here id use my best HP and AC pieces some where between you HP and your AC setup .. both will be goin up with lvl and you will save some money to get a few better pieces ... me ide sell the Barbed Ringmail and keep the Veluim BP.  and look at getting a Clattering bone Necklace or a SC wristband in place of the BoS. but all in all you hvae some nice gear for you your lvl that is forsure<br />
<br />
But Ide  be more likely to go somewhere in the middle of what you have as your AC and your HP's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(Everything I am going to say here is pretty much visible in my magelo)<br />
<br />
Ok, so I took OgreOverlord's Advice and went in between the 2.  So my 2 gear sets (max AC/Max HP) look like this:<br />
<br />
MAX HP<br />
<br />
HP:  1981<br />
AC:  782<br />
ATK: 824<br />
<br />
MAX AC<br />
<br />
HP:  1720<br />
AC:  840<br />
ATK: 840<br />
<br />
So, the average configuration using those 2 extremes is:<br />
<br />
Average Config<br />
HP:  1850<br />
AC:  811<br />
ATK:  832<br />
<br />
My main Config that I have achieved trying to match this &quot;inbetween&quot; is:<br />
<br />
HP:  1895<br />
AC:  812<br />
ATK: 824<br />
<br />
Now, in my opinion that is a pretty good in between.  Have I noticed a huge difference?  slightly on the max I get hit for but not much.  Now I was thinking about what some people here have said, to include &quot;try to hit 1k AC first&quot; and &quot;1AC=10HP&quot;.  If this is correct then  the difference between Highest AC profile and Highest HP profile in AC is 58.  Meaning that 58*10=580 hp's 'extra' because of the higher AC.  And since the higher AC profile has 1720 HPs that would mean that 1720 + 580 = 2300 which to me looks way better than the higher HP profile. AND  better than my average 'in between' profile.  So, I am not asking for help deciding really since firstly I know its my choice and my preference... I am mostly asking if I am using the right &quot;Logic&quot; to make my decisions.  All your help is appreciated...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">try to get 1k ac. once you do hp. getting to 1k ac will help aton later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doobi Doobidoo</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either of the inbetween settups you have are absolutely fine. Hell, at that point, I'd almost be inclined to go with looks. :D Like most peeps were saying, work your way toword that 1Kac mark, then push for all the HPs you can muster. Now get your butt out and level instead of obsesing over this before ya worry yourself to death..... Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krunt</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the real answer here is ding.  At your level niether setup will change your ability to tank in exp groups and whatever raids you are doing.  And as far as the future holds.. Ferice Heraldric.  It has great AC and HP; you won't find much better outside of HoT and even then its highly debatable.  Save what plat you have now for a frostbringer then buy some better haste.  After that start getting FH armor and by the time you are 50 and in a full set of FH or Better you will be better equipid then half the warriors out there regardless of level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">friss</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most important stat for fighting any mobs below lvl 53 is AC, but this only applies if you get it high enough to get the biggest benifit.  If you can't reach the right amount of AC then go hP's.</div></div><hr />
