<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard there is a big gain each 100 AC.  If this is true, 1802 AC and 9341 HPs would beat 1787 AC and 9431 HPs.  If it is a nice round curve, I imagine that the 90 more hps and 15 less AC would be better.<br />
<br />
Since I don't parse, which is better for tanking?  (I use the 1802 AC setup in PoWater because it is my old Net of the Deep Sea which I use for EB).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the question posed, i dont think there are significant increments (ie no 100Ac jumps). I think its just a shallow curve that flattens out as your Ac gets very high.<br />
<br />
After I saw the original AC thread, I changed my orientation from trying to get HP/AC to AC/HP. I have been trading off HP's now for AC and parsing. As my AC has climbed mob DPS has declined. The challenge now is to find the point of diminishing returns, the point where additional AC provides no significant improvement in mitigation etc. My challenge, like everyone, is to find the &quot;right&quot; gear to enable me to experiment. <br />
<br />
Most recently, nothing was up so we went oldschool and killed vulak.  Most people viewed Vyrins Earing of Insanity as junk so I bought it and traded out Tear of the Rainmaker. +18AC, -30HP, other stats moot. Stat improvements like anything else are cumulative so its hard to see significant differences. I accidently deleted my most recent FR log so i have no tangible evidence of the most recent AC bump vs last encounter.<br />
<br />
I am curious as to other people perspective.<br />

I can't imagine that this trade off pays untill you are over 2000 AC (if then). Say 18 AC provides 0.1% additional mitigation. That would mean every 2970 HP of damage you take you will have mitigated 30 HP.<br />
<br />
I would say the 1:6 ratio should start to change as HP over 7500 are less valuable than those under 7500.</div></div><hr />

Just that if you are using formula's you may be better off weighting HP less and AC or resists more. Until the fix complete heal (agian) so that it's no longer nearly comeplete, or almost always complete heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
reread, its reverse. trading down 30 hps to gain 18 raw AC, thats 1AC gain to 1.66 decrease in raw HP. i would have to check but equipped thats ~27 AC gain for say loss of ~34HP (1.26 ratio). after all this is about experimentation. now for sure there is probably a level where this is foolish to do. I think I am at the opposite extreme. I think it would be very difficult to identify at what point in the curve you should stop emphasizing HP and focusing on AC. Luckily, in many cases of equipment choices, you dont have to choose one over the other since then tend to come together.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd go AC/HP for pop mobs, HP/AC for everything else.  Haven't got or seen enough data to see if there's a breakpoint between high 1700's and low 1800's, but you aren't talking about that big a diff in hp... about 2-4 ticks worth of self-only regen with that kind of gear anyway, even for inferior non-troll races. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that AC is more important for pure melee fights but AC is useless when it comes to procs and spells.  HP is still very important.  I'm basically going for highest HP I can find unless I can get a significant AC upgrade or an important effect by taking another item with a little less HPs.</div></div><hr />
