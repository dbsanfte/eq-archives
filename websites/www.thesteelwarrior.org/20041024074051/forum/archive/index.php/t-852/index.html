<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>carlelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He is on an 18 hour timer that he likes to miss. I have done this camp twice the first one took 2 hours and then the second one took 13. I dont wish this camp on anyone its so damn boring. <br />
<br />
It is not the timer you have to worry about though, its some punk trying to KS it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, 18 hour timer, that he does skip.  Spawns near the 3 gnomes playing some form of game.  Be ready to put out a lot of damage fast, as there is a good chance that there will be multiple people ready to ks you (2 sk's sat next to me when I did it, openly admitting they were going to attempt to outdamage me even though I had been there hours before either one of them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stressful camp trying to get rid of all the KSers! Had a druid-bot trying to KS me for his monk who was in NToV or something.. had a SK there also.. Rogue there too.. 3 Other warriors.. and then everyone thought he skipped the spawn and left.. and lo and behold 5 mins later my level 48 (was 49, got killed trying to kill him :p) Looted the last piece needed :D <br />
<br />
So yeah.. 18 Hours +/- some.. skips a ton.. farm couger claw earrings or something.. but it is the most boring camp i have ever done. i have given up camping anything now, if its not up when im there its not worth camping. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It has been quite some time since I camped Stormfeather and he did indeed skip spawns. For some reason though, I remember hearing they removed the skipping spawn thing from Lodzial and Stormfeather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they removed it from Lozdial</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually from my measurments from being on to see him spawn 3 times in a row he is on a 18hr 40min timer and does skip.<br />
<br />
Stormfeather is teh debil!<br />
<br />
As much as I want the Eyepatch for my rogue I will NEVER step foot in Iceclad again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm tried to edit but said I dont have permission to edit my own post so sorry for the double post.<br />
<br />
Forgot to add that he will never skip more than 2 spawns in a row so his max spawn time from last killing is 56 hours.</div></div><hr />
