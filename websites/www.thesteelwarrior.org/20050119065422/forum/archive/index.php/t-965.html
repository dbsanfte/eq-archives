Now in most situations I do not have a lick of problem keeping aggro. One question however, as I progress to higher tier planes (Tier 3+) will this combo be sufficent untill I get EB weps? If not, what would you suggest I upgrade to? Guild is capable of doing up to BOT towers if that helps you guage.<br />
<br />
*edit* I have a Frostreaver and Ancient Fire Etched Flamberge<br />
as my 2h weps.<br />

If your ever in a MA position, break out frostreaver, at least till you get EB anyway.</div></div><hr />

Although my own experience with kreizenn was rather good.<br />
But in most cases its agro comes from high dps more than a high agro proc.<br />
The 100dd proc is lure based (and its procs a ton) and i have it only seen resisted on mobs that are completely immune to fire (some ST named and kreizenn himself for example).<br />
I still use it from time to time on special mobs like xtc where you wont do much melee damage anyway and more in the way of procs due to huge atk debuff AE (but only when not tanking as about every warrior in guild has an EB weapon by now).<br />
I was using Frostreaver for 2h myself before i got my Gaudralek and its rather nice for agro unless you have to compete with EB weapons or other high agro 2handers used by knights.</div></div><hr />
