<br />
If you MT a bit on raids, I would say go ahead and aug it if you dont see any other agro weapon coming your way.  <br />
<br />
If you dont MT on raids, then I would hold on to the staff as a situational DPS weapon / agro weapon and save your points to aug a better agro weapon if/when you get it.<br />
<br />
For normal exp grinding, as long as the group understands agro, I would feel fine tanking with that staff unauged.  If it isnt doing the job you want, I would probably aug it with a cheaper yak proc from Guk instead of anger 3.  You can still kinda use it as a DPS weapon in raids as long as you are careful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeeko</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aug it.  I have, and it rocks.<br />
I use it as my aggro weapon in groups/raids AND as my dps weapon on raids when I'm not the MT.  The latter works because other tanks have decent aggro generation when they need to.  The only drawback is that I can't usually use it when I'm asked into a pickup group and am not the MT.  (usually rare as I form most of my groups)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the reason is the enhanced proc rate on the staff, since the innate proc checks first there's less chance for anger to proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   There are many cases where you dont have the time to get aggro with ONE aggro proc too many peeps are gona be dead.  Case in point last night in Ferubi I just finished killing one mob in front of raid and turn to see a ukun (60-65) in middle of casters, I have to pull aggro and do it now not later, with incite and 4 hate procs plus WA I get aggro fast not on demand but one hell of a lot faster then one aug on a dps weapon.   Going over log file later the smallest max hit for the night was 975, casters dont live long when hit with 1000hp melee.<br />
<br />
  Put a DD on it, keep it as a dps weapon.</div></div><hr />

You are trying to make a good DPS weapon in to a mediocre agro weapon. You are better served by putting agro on agro weapons and DPS on DPS weapons.</div></div><hr />

It still works fine for holding agro and use it if I feel I dont absolutely need hate procs, like offtanking, finishing off mobs etc.<br />

Anger3 is going on my BoC ~<br />
<br />
Some people do like to put an anger3 on it and use it as an agro weapon. I suppose this works out better for those that MT 100% of the time and are doing a lot of PoP encounters where reposte damage can be an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you put anger3 on the Gs4W you have an aggro weapon that will serve you untill you get a BoW or suchlike, if you need a DPS weapon occasionally buy a WMBS or suchlike. If/When you get a BoW, Sews etc, you can always put a 150DD on the greatstaff and use it as a DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why people would bag a FAR superior weapon like the Gso4W, in order to use a crappy GsoT.This is where you are making your mistake. GSot4W is FAR superior DPS, however, GSoT is FAR superior agro. If you put the agro proc on the GSoT, now you have an even better agro proc AND a good DPS weapon AND you didn't have to shell out for a WMBS. Doing it your way, you end up with an OK agro weapon and an OK DPS weapon and you had to spend the plats to get the DPS weapon. When you are looking at the agro of a weapon, DPS is largely irrelevant in the comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GsoT just isn't that much better aggro... Its way overrated. Seems to be the common opinion now that if it isn't a GsoT or SotB/ChoS combo it won't hold aggro. A clean, unaugmented Gso4W holds aggro just as well as a GsoT.<br />
<br />
I used to have a frostreaver... when the GsoT first appeared in game, I borrowed one from a friend and used it exclusively for a week. Then I returned it, because the aggro on it was inferior to my frostreaver. When I got a Gso4W  I was able to keep aggro, purely by DPS, I could bag my frostreaver. Enter the new expansion, and the augments,  something which was allready good, just became better.<br />
<br />
An augmented Gso4W isn't an &quot;OK&quot; aggro weapon, its a bloody fantastic aggro weapon with incredible DPS for the risk/reward encounter where it drops. (don't think there's anything that equals it's dps tier 2 or lower.)<br />
<br />
As the original posters comment included the thought that: &quot; he can get a better taunt weapon /w coalition raids &quot; I'd thought to give him view, a gso4W +A3 performs better then a BoC+3/CHSD combo, and at least as good as a Gbos+3/CHSD+3 combo. This is not number counting and paper pushing, Its actual raid &amp; group experience. So unless this coalition will supply him with a BF+BOC or similar combo, he's better off augmenting the G4W and getting a cheap non-aggro weapon for the ocasion he doesn't want aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't ever bothered auging my GSot4W, but compared to a GBoS + A3 and BoC + A2 (with WA5), the agro on the staff doesn't even approach dual wielding, and I'd be sceptical that auging the staff with Anger3 would bring it very close. That said, the staff does have the advantage that you only have to buy one aug, so if you actually have the option of holding out for a BoW or SEWS or the like (which not everyone does), its not that bad an option.</div></div><hr />

I have a Go4W (unaug'd) and there is no way I'm throwing an aggro proc on there.  The Go4W is my best dps weapon and if I'm not tanking, my job becomes pumping out as much dps as I can, thus, I want the Go4W and I don't want it sucking aggro off the MT.  If I am tanking, I generally don't care what my dps is and when I used a GoT, it worked great.</div></div><hr />

So, I grabbed a GSo4W and Anger 3'd it.  Compared to an un-aug'd GSoT (my last weapon) it's a major improvement.  Now, I tank 99% of the time for both raids and groups, so I dont' sweat not having it as a DPS weapon....  So far, I'm VERY happy with it as an agro-getter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only testing I did on an unaug'd GSoT vs. an unaug'd GSo4W was at PoV golems one long afternoon.  <br />
<br />
My personal feeling was that the GSo4W was better agro pre-slow and debuffs (usually enough to allow the slower to not gain agro, providing they were slowing at an appropriate time).  However, further in the fight the GSoT (thanks to its procs) would be better agro.  The longer the fight, the better the GSoT would hold agro for me.  <br />
<br />
I also noticed that my GSo4W was downright horrible in BoT for holding agro vs. high DPS classes (such as a GSo4W wielding monk and EQ/AM3 ranger) and against many mobs it wasn't even strong pre-slow like it was in PoV.  My GSoT was noticeably better for agro in BoT in all situations I came across.<br />
<br />
Lastly, in a 58-65 LDoN, my GSo4W held agro equal to the GSoT with a larger damage output.  <br />
<br />
My conclusion?  The higher level mob you fight, the less effective the GSo4W will be for agro, and the more important the GSoT's proc becomes for holding agro.  With my own testing, I realized it wasn't worth putting an agro proc on my GSo4W.  I've kept it for a strong DPS weapon, since I have enough opportunities to use it as such.  I don't doubt that an Anger III GSo4w would be a good agro weapon, but it just didn't fit my play style to go with that setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always found the GSo4W DPS aggro alone outperforms GSoT, in exp groups or on raids. The only time a GSoT stands a chance is if they get a hot proc streak. What too many don't appreciate is that aggro is not about procs alone: DPS generates aggro as well, and thats where GSo4W blows things like the CHSD away. The 75pt DD proc is just DPS but the whole package works well.<br />
<br />
I MT about 80% of the stuff my guild fights. We're killing elemental flag mobs and VT. I use an Anger III auged GSo4W for anything that hits in excess of about 1000 and most of my exp groups (as for LDON, in normals shit dies too fast to worry about aggro). Its my workhorse until the BOW comes along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all due respect this statement really isn't borne out by reality<br />
<br />
Even a &quot;plain&quot; GSoT will out agro a GSo4w.  A modified GSot will greatly out agro a GSo4W.   Just get 2 warrs with similar aa skills; put them both side by side on a mob; watch agro.  I have and I can tell you your conclusion is erroneous.<br />
<br />
The GSo4W is an amazing weapon IF you are grouped with classes that do not have ellie+ lvl agro capability.  I'd personally aug it with DD but I can see folks making a case for anger/stun.  Maybe with WA 5 it is viable; I can't comment as I don't have that to work with.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day though even a GSo4W with anger will have a limited use...high end rogues/casters will pull agro off it; a 2 proc'd GSoT also has limited ceiling for agro control; but it is HIGHER than the GSo4W.<br />
<br />
You get much more long term agro utility from a 2 agro proc'd GSoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that said, when exactly in your raiding career would you look to retire the GSoT for something better? As I understand it auged GSoT will be more than adequate for all XP mobs (sub EP) anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a gso4W +A3 performs better then a BoC+3/CHSD combo, and at least as good as a Gbos+3/CHSD+3 comboThere is no way in hell that a GSot4W+A3 can comepete with a BoC+3/anything+3 combo uness you don't turn on attack. There have been multitudes of parses on this subject and the fact is that DPS does not account for near as much agro as Hate/Stun procs do. You might &quot;feel&quot; you hold better agro, but parses prove otherwise. I have a far superior DPS weapon than a GSot4W and it isn't even close to the agro of my BoC+GBoS BEFORE I got the augs.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way - DPS agro has been calculated at around 1 damage = 1 hate. If you have a typical war set up and use CHoS+SotB and put an anger 2 proc on each, you end up with:<br />
2 CHoS innate PPM = 800 hate (figuring stuns at 400 hate or so)<br />
2 CHoS aug PPM = 800 hate<br />
1 SotB innate PPM= 400 hate<br />
1 SotB aug PPM = 400 hate<br />
<br />
That's a total of 2400 HPM or around 40 DPS worth of hate. In order for your GSot4W to equal the hate of the combo above, it would have to do 40 DPS more unaugmented, or 20 DPS more with an A3 augment. While it is a good DPS weapon, it's not 20 DPS more. Once you start to figure in WA, the gap becomes even larger since 2h weapon don't benefit as much since the raw increase in number of procs is lower.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it was pretty well established that a weapon's damage bonus was significant in determining its aggro, and that aggro was measured per swing rather than per point of damage.  This favors the fastest 2 handers that fit into the 28+ delay category, of which GSo4W is one of the best.  So while a Windblade might have the same DPS as a GSo4W, it will produce less aggro, because its damage-bonus-to-delay ratio is worse.<br />
<br />
From experience I can report that a GSo4W + 50 lifetap has nearly the same aggro as a Jagged Shard of Frozen Flame + Anger 3 / Great Blade of Storms + Anger 2 combo, and will steal aggro from the latter combo about 1/2 of the time unless incite is used to widen the gap.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the GSo4W is the highest DPS-aggro weapon you can get before a BoW, and putting Anger 3 on it should be extremely effective.  Those who say &quot;no way&quot;, have you actually tried it?  I'm not putting Anger 3 on mine, but I'd love to hear of firsthand comparisons.<br />
<br />
I actually hesitate to recommend the GSo4W as a pure DPS weapon, due to how I witness it routinely drawing aggro off of unaugmented BoC's and Anger 3'd weapons.  To me it's a logical choice to convert into an aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While DB is probably a significant part of determining agro inasmuch as its important in determining DPS, I would'nt put it ahead of other factors such as procs or just pure DPS.  GSot4W out agros Windblade because it does more damage anyway, in regards to both ratio and DB.  <br />
<br />
When you're comparing between two tanks using different weapons, it helps if we know what sort of AAs the two had.  Jagged Shard and GBoS aren't going to do as well v. a GSot4W if the dual wielder has no offensive AA and the 2hander has full offensive AA, WA5, etc.  And with full full pre-GoD AA + Sinister Strikes, i'd be suprised if Jagged Shard + GBoS wasn't very close to GSot4W in DPS.  <br />
<br />
I find an un-auged GSot4W to be no where near the agro of GBoS + BoC, with anger3 and 2 respectively.   My normal group has two tank, me and a 65 SK.  The SK always pulls, and pumps plenty of agro in right off the bat to give me an agro boost for whenever i get a succesful taunt in (since he tanks well enough that it doesnt matter in most cases if he tanks for a bit til I do).  With dual wielding, once I get a taunt (and incite afterwards) in I have very, very few problems holding agro, and even if taunt doesnt work I'll eventually get agro, usually in 4-6 procs which takes anywhere from 10-45 seconds.  With a GSot4W, I'll steadily lose agro back to the SK after a taunt + incite and have to keep taunting to keep agro even 25% of the time (SK uses Greater Stormwatcher's Horn), and there's absolutely no chance of me pulling off agro without a succesful taunt.<br />
<br />
While I'm not really willing to spend a bunch of points just to see if the GSot4W actually would approach the agro I have currently (plus from parsing I also find that DPS isn't that much better if at all, even with double riposte maxed), I'm pretty doubtful it would be.  This is with all 2hander offensive AA and all dual wield AA except for Sinister Strikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i seriously have a hard time beleiving that 1 dps = 1 hate. if hate is figuired by the max hit of a weapon or whatever like that then a gstaff would be like a stun or taunting blow every single atk round which is incredibly far from accurate.<br />
<br />
BoC with anger 3 will out aggro the gstaff with anger3 without much of a problem, trust me, i know as i have both aug'd as such.  the gstaff is still pretty good aggro and is good to switch off to on hard hitting mobs once intial aggro is locked. whenever i use the gstaff when not tanking i will pull aggro eventually on mobs, just generally takes much longer than the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use GSot4W almost exclusively now. The only time I don't is when tanking a boss mob (I have Bloodfrenzy/GBoS, all my weapons are unauged except heated blade on my GSot4W).<br />
<br />
Is GSot4W more aggro than Bloodfrenzy/GBoS? Over the long run, no. Especially when you factor in that a lot of bosses do some kind of lame slow or stun crap and procs become an even more important component of aggo generation.<br />
<br />
Is GSot4W enough aggro in many cases though? With all Luclin/PoP offense AAs, yes it is. With incite, I can hold aggro on over any melee in my guild that aren't taunting, using spells to specifically to gank aggro, or using aggro weapons (granted we're not exactly stellar, the best weapons we have are Emperor Staves and 16/20 daggers). I can hold aggro over casters as well, as long as they spread their mana out on mobs, rather than dumping it all on a few and then medding a few fights out.  The thing is, exp mob fights are so short now, that GSot4W is actually better aggro than my Bloodfrenzy/GBoS, just because of proc streakiness in short fights (ie I tend to either rip off 5 procs in a fight and have flawless aggro or 0 procs and I struggle).  Plus, because of the fact that GSot4W is *enough aggro* I might as well add some extra DPS.<br />
<br />
I've also been hunting hraquis/regruas lately a bit, I definetly don't dual wield here. Dying to a 1200 damage riposte scares me.<br />
<br />
I can see some cases were auging it with anger 3 or ykesha would be a good idea (it's not in my case, because its also my raid DPS weapon). Most of the time, I would say its a bad idea to aggro aug it though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't use a 2 hander for agro atm while raiding; I use 4x EB proc dual wield.  But then again I'm pre-ellie.<br />
<br />
I use GSoT in Hard LDoN &amp; GoD where ripostes hurt; I would retire it from this mode when I got a better weapon that had an innate EB proc on it (BoW being the most obvious).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, quite divergent views in this thread.  My guild just reached the elementals, every tank has BOC and/or Anger 3 aug'd 16/19 or 17/20 weapons, but no Bloodfrenzies.  GSo4W DPS aggro (in a warrior's hands with full offensive AA) is problematic for us.  I cannot use this thing attacking 100% of the time on raid mobs.  My standard behavior is to turn on auto-attack 20 seconds after the main tank does, and even then, I have a chance of drawing aggro later in the fight, unless I turn off auto-attack periodically.  Maybe things will be different once some Blades of War drop for us.  If you ask me, for a pre-elemental guild, the GSo4W would be *too much aggro* to be used as a full time DPS weapon on a raid, and therefore is a logical choice to convert into an aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />

I have never had a problem with non-warriors using this weapon.  It's the fully AA'd warriors that I see producing aggro with it.  I avoid it being a problem through incite and careful attention.<br />
<br />
It could be just a transient situation at my guild's point in our equipment and AA distribution, I suppose.  I would think that it would be a bigger problem for people who are still at the GSoT level of the game, but maybe not.</div></div><hr />

I dont see it in your magelo.  That would be because I put the gear that I use in my magelo. I haven't bothered putting in the 3 bags of gear I tote around for various situations. I had a GSot4W that I replaced with an Ornate Greatblade, neither gets used ever. The only time I play my warrior I am playing tank, I have a wizard for DPS. No way I can do anywhere near the agro I get with BoC+2/GBoS+2 with a GSto4W.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never used the GSot4W for aggro, cause I used a Gaudralek and after that a BoW, but on our raids I am often one of the first to die when the MT died. I am using the GSot4W only for damage with a 125 poison DD augment. I normally look very hard if the MT is alive or not, cause I am then often MT2 or MT3, but healers could not switch so fast in the past to hold me then.<br />
<br />
The GSot4W is not a real aggro weapon ( procs a bit more than usual ) but for the efforts you need to lay hands on it its the best on the market for damage.<br />
<br />
When you only want aggro, there are lots of weapons outside which are better than the GSot4W on the short aggro way. But most of them suck on the damagepart.<br />
<br />
Btw. when youre a fan of dual wield . try to get a BBotE. That little thing outaggroes a BoC or a HG easyly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks for all the input, alot of varied opinions on this.  I didn't aug the staff, and instead have gotten several new weapons to use.  This may be useful info that folks want to see, but as I wasn't sure where to post, will just continue this thread.<br />
<br />
After camping xanamech 9 times, a spike driver finally dropped.  We've also raiding the BOT tower bosses, so I have the shield.  So my aggro set up is this:  <br />
<br />
Primary:<br />
Cord Hilted Spike Driver (Augmented)<br />
Delay: 19<br />
DMG: 13  <br />
Effect: Taunting Blow (Combat)<br />
Effect: Anger III (Combat)<br />
<br />
and this:<br />
<br />
Stormrider Carapace (Augmented)<br />
AC: 54<br />
STR: +15  DEX: +8  STA: +15  CHA: +6  <br />
HP: +125  SV FIRE: +15  SV COLD: +15  SV MAGIC: +15  <br />
Focus Effect: Furious Bash IV<br />
Slot 1, type 7: Flawless Teal Crystal of Enticement<br />
<br />
I'll be tanking alot of tier 1 bosses in the following weeks with this set up (starting with Manaetic Behemoth tonight, although we know thats not really a MT type rotation).<br />
<br />
Just wanted the concensus on if this is a decent setup that will last me for quite some time.  Still plan to use the staff for non raiding situations, but the 'turtle' type tank I think will hold aggro and be able to last quite awhile.<br />
<br />
Magelo is below, its mostly gtg except for a few augs I may have missed.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Axxegrinder <br />

You guys are obviously capable of killing the BoT named, get yourself a GBoS then aug that. You should have very good agro with that set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigAlFoxTrot</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. Bag the shield unless your the rampage tank.<br />
<br />
Also agree, why ruin a perfectly good DPS weapon putting an agro proc on it.  Now you can't use it when your job is DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a gsot4w with anger III. I am in an elemental guild. The agro is incredibly good. <br />
<br />
When being in tank rotation as either MA or further down the ranks i have had no problems getting and holding agro.<br />
<br />
When not being in tank rotation i cant use the gsot4w at all. When a non bow or non bloodfrenzy warrior tanks i will eventualy take over agro without use of anything else than attack on<br />
When a bow or bloodfrenzy warrior tanks i will close to allways be second on hate list wihtout use of anything else than attack on. <br />
<br />
Not to put anger III in the weapon seem realy like a bad advice in my situation. I rescently joined the guild i am in and are way way way down in the list for ever getting an agro weapon. Maybe if i intended to be useless untill sometimes after quarm this would be an option, but not realy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twalin</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">definitely get a GBoS and bag the shield.. i had GBoS and CHSD and GSo4W when i got my GSoT and personally.... i bagged it like after 5-10 mobs......... just b/c it wasnt anywhere near the duel wield imo and well imo GSo4W is better then GSoT (both w/o augs)<br />
<br />
for those of you that want to talk about dps... well i parsed GSo4W on katta banker unbuffed 1300 attack and came out about 93 dps (3 from proc)... compare that to my SEWS that i got a couple weeks ago at 100.5 dps (same banker same attack etc)<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; btw wandor have any parse data on Ornate Greatblade? curious to see how it stacks up since most people have always said it's crap b/c of low delay/db etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the responses.  You were right on with the shield, even with my corded spike driver auged with anger 3, it takes me a long time to build up aggro.  When I used a CHOS in offhand instead of shield, walaa, no more aggro issues<br />
