Im here now, and the map lead me to an empty spot, then started leading me nowhere.  Then it picked up again, led me to an empty spot, then stopped working.  I had a full crew, we were both checking track and visual and didn't see mob.  We scoured EW from 7pm to 7am game time, and nada.  Also, I had to 'duck' to get a new map from the gnome in IC, appears he's a lil underworld<br />

YAY. Thought so, it wouldn't suprise me that every damn step is broke or if they have not even finished this quest.  Raaj post on the damn developer boards about this.  this is bs, it has been broke forever and we were told it would go live on the 13th and now nothing. not to mention there hasn't been one step on the 2.0 that hasn't been broken from the start. <br />

Let me clarify something first. There is a chance that you'll get to a point where the map is leading you and then it'll say &quot;The map seems to have led you in the wrong direction. There is nothing here.&quot;<br />
<br />
There may also be times where it says &quot;The map doesn't appear to be leading you anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of these are part of the functionality of the map. The first is when it has led you to a &quot;false&quot; spot, meaning that Larnik has covered his tracks well enough to fool the magical leading properties of the map. The second is just that there is nothing for the map to lead you to, which means that it's not night time or Larnik's trigger isn't around.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't solve the issue for you, then what is still broken?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

This is exactly what happened, wish I had the log, but here's my best shot.  I turned in the pestle long ago, so this morning I logged in 'what map' the gnome and proceeded to EW with my map.  Once there, it was 6 am.  The map started working, pointing me to a spot near icefang.  7am arrived however, and the map stopped working.  Ok, no problem there.<br />
<br />
So I wanted until 7PM game time, map started working again.  I followed it for some time, and then got a message similiar to this 'the map hasn't led you anyplace useful (sic)'.  After I got this message, the map stopped working, and I kept getting 'the map doesn't seem to lead anyplace useful (sic)'.  This continued for quite some time, then eventually (still the same game night here), the map started poiting again, but as I followed, it eventually did the same message as above  regarding the map leading to noplace.<br />
<br />
Shortly after, another warrior sent me a tell saying he spawned the guy and got beat down.  So I go back to EW, and my map doesn't work at all, just gives me 'the map doesn't seem to be leading you anyplace (sic)'.  Looked near last tanks corpse, nothing.  Nothing on track either.  When the tank that was able to spawn it came back, his map no longer worked either.<br />
<br />
I was neither levved, nor invised, nor illusioned etc when I was using the map.  Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response - Axxe</div></div><hr />

Well, once again, it started to point to a direction which turned out to be false. Then it simple stopped working.  Is there some huge trigger time on this or something?<br />

I don't see the reasoning behind this.  The mob only spawns at night for one. to ask a group of people to sit there for hour at a time hoping the map will spawn is quite silly.  i have no idea why the trigger would not be up. i am the farthest on my server in the quest and have tried several times after the &quot;fix&quot; even waiting there for the next night to come and yet still get nothing. i have also gone back to get a new map.  <br />
<br />
Can you answer the rhyme or reason behind the mob not spawning or how to make it spawn?  i don't see how it is reasonable to expect people to gather a group and sit in a newbie zone where you can't even exp waiting for something that may or may not happen.  <br />
<br />
also if it does not spawn is it beneficial to get a new map or it matters not? i find it frusterating to have had every step of the 2.0 broke up until maybe the anguish part which may or may not be broke when we try to turn in the item.  <br />
<br />
So this part of hoping for a map to maybe work isn't my idea of a fun quest when there is no way to tell or figure out why the mob is not spawning.<br />

Axxeman, there's a 15 minute trigger &quot;respawn&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've been here for a few hours now.  No other warriors in the zone.  The problem I described above just keeps repeating.  Map will point, I get there, find nothing, then the map ceases to work for awhile.  Repeat ad infinitum.<br />

EDIT- Just did it again, and it behaved just like before the patch.  Map keeps giving directions, but Im standing on the trigger spot. (4871, neg  7954, to be exact)</div></div><hr />

would be fantastic to get a developer to answer us on this instead of just saying it is working as intended and ignoring it.  obviously this can't be the way it is intended to work and somethign is still a bit buggy.</div></div><hr />

At 7pm, I follow the maps directions to a point and get a consistant &quot;Its ahead of you&quot; /walk 2 steps &quot;Its behind you&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only thing new that I have seen, post patch, is now after a long period of time getting the ahead/behind message. You get a new message of &quot;The map has led you in the wrong direction&quot;  and then I start getting messages about the map not leading me anywhere. All the way up to 6am.<br />
<br />
I have made the IC run 5 times now (thanks to norent map) and each time I have waited (with a group of bored players) til 7pm, seen the map not work up til 6am, then til 7pm again and see it still doesn't work and disband that next 6am.<br />
<br />
I don't mind wasting my own play time hours so much as wasting other peoples time along with it.<br />
<br />
Btw, is the map supposed to lead you to a trigger point to spawn the gnome (trackable if he spawns?) or does it lead you to the gnome himself as he moves around? And does he spawn consistantly 7pm til 6am or is there some form of trigger that is not functioning properly? Or is it the map leading people in wrong directions?<br />
<br />
Its really hard to explain what the specific problem is if you don't know how it is supposed to work in the first place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I went out there with a bst and did the old trick where ya put the pet on guard and he points at the nearest thing (used to spawn a dwarf for shawl or deathsquad)<br />
<br />
Well anyway, with use of the map and pet we narrowed it down to the right spot but nothing would trigger.<br />
<br />
Maybe we are just unlucky and the randomization factor (gnome outsmarting the map so basically not spawning) has just been unlucky for the rest of us still runnin all over ew.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could sit there and stare at that silly energy receptor all day and it didn't get you anywhere if the mob was not up. which it usualy wasn't due to the traffic in the zone.<br />
<br />
i just wish to point this out that the map may do the same thing. and maybe totaly pointless.  id bring a tracker . <br />
<br />
 I could be way of base of course i am simply making a comparison to a earlyer part of the quest with a similar pointer object.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>zuko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have done this  gnome 3 times before I got him and beat em good for making me wait so long. Here is what I have seen and done:<br />
<br />
Map will  point to TWO possible places:<br />
<br />
If you get the Icefang location you can forget about spawning him cause he will not . Period.<br />
<br />
If you get the location between Kael and GD  in the W direction, the first attempt  you try to trigger him will most likely FAIL.. you will have to wait for the map to work at 1AM. When you go back to this same location it will continue to give you directions right about 3AM or 4AM. On my 2nd and 3rd tries the map STOPPED giving me a direction! **RED FLAG PEOPLE** gnome is running to Kael and you are too far away to reach him. And oh! surprise .. no one can track it, attack it or stop him EXCEPT the WAR doing the hunt .. failed (that was my 2nd attempt).<br />
<br />
Solution for this .. Get a magician and a cleric and that's all the group you need. Position the cleric up ramp to Kael  route and make em look E for the gnome running to the zoneline . Place the magician in the middle point of route from the ramp and Kael zone in and also make him look E IN CASE the Cleric doesn't pick  him up visually. Once the map does it's thing, cleric should see him go down ramp and magician will need to CoH you fast to cut off the gnome at the pass. Give him the magic sentence and start beating the living crap out of him once cleric is there.<br />
<br />
I would agree that this is pretty harsh for people to wait on, but look on the bright side ... most classes have their job cut out for them since they need to do a raid type encounter to continue to their Epic 2 steps in Anguish :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">&quot;Gnome spawns and runs toward kael&quot;, where does gnome spawn?  Shouldnt he spawn when you run over where he is hidden?<br />
<br />
Also which direction is he comin from?  Does he depop at the ramp to kael?<br />
<br />
When you say between kael and GD in the west direction you mean the zonewall?  GD is north of Kael.<br />
<br />
Prexus maps still just pointing to icefang deadend.  Guess I'll have to wait till whatever patch fixes this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't matter where he spawns .. its random.  1st time I tried it was running around randomly with map and I got to see him like not to far from me running. The only thing you need to know is that he will always go to Kael zoneline and go byebye.<br />
<br />
And yes, the location is W to zonewall between Kael zi and GD. When I was hunting him and I couldn't get the good location I always went for another  after a day of playtime.</div></div><hr />
