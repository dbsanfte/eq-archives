<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dragorn Champion<br />
Was grinding in WoS last night and Dragorn Champion happened to be up. Pulled with XP group and things didn't go too peachy. Adds ended up killing our two DPS, and eventually cleric ran OOM. Second time I enlisted another guild grp and things were much better but thought I'd give everyone that hasn't done it the skinny.<br />
<br />
First, mob is very resistant to all magic and slowers if they don't get lucky will likely die to summon. Second, mob has lots of HP, so healers will need lots of mana. Third, since nukes are often resisted mob is better to take down with melee...although I recommend as many rangers as possible. Mob has a small AE rampage, so if you have all rogues and monks and don't have enough healing yer likely to lose many of them.<br />
<br />
He does hit hard even disced, I think roughly 1200. Once slowed he's really not that bad but the more healers the better. Our guild has 1 grped it but was very tight, wasn't a breeze even with 2 grps and we're all Time/Ikkinz geared. Pre-time guilds will want at least 3 groups of well equipped players, 4 if you want to be safe.</div></div><hr />

I think that what happened was one set was obtained because of the repop of zone so there would be one set layin around however if they have not addressed the respawning issues, since they never metioned anything about ours just the verant babies monks. Then there wouldnt be any respawning. Unless we can get solid info that it has actually been fixed I really dont think it has. Camped myself at the 3rd page spawn so I will check and hope later.

<br />
Also, the NPC doesnt say beef anymore. So, we needa focus on the horse and stars clues.  That has to be the key.<br />
<br />
So. I went and tried to speak with the centaurs in POJustice today, with no luck. The far one wouldnt speak to me, and the close one jsut went on about some silly ranger junk.<br />
<br />
Horse however, doesnt neccesarily refer to centaurs. Its been assumed that because of the star referreces. Heres another idea - Maybe it has something to do with the Pegasus Isle in Plane of Sky? Or, perhaps some Ixt model mob in Gates...<br />
WIll be going to sky tomorrow to check it out. It could be some new drop on the keeper of souls or something. Its a horse, its in the sky, etc<br />
<br />
Also, it was mentioned earlier today that the Kyv Whetstone was changed from whatever to combineable. Anyone tried that yet please?<br />

PS - ****Jason!**** why is the eqgamebox not letting me loot Epic pieces today? I am at the Vxed stage, but guild went to Bloodfields today. We were very dissaapointed after killing the Girplan Devourer that none of our warriors could loot. Same with the dragon champion. yet, others could loot the Gulak tome no problems, and the Hilt and champ eye no problems yesterday..... is this intentional?????? If so, why is it not affecting other peoples epics?? Am very dissapointed if this is intentional. Please comment. Thanks</div></div><hr />

who in gods name would try to bypass the non-epic 1.5 starter by goign to PoSky? the non-epic 1.5 quest is pretty easy vs convincing people to go Posky and clearing to spiroc isle...<br />
<br />
also, anyone doing that would ahve no idea about the mold part of epic 1.5 and may have let it rot / not taken note of it, considering the million other quest pieces from PoA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Quick update on my potential bug:<br />
<br />
1.  Did not need the pages/cover as suggested.  Said &quot;smith&quot; to the ogre and got another set of Plans.  Handed him my Ore for good measure and got the expected response to find the [smith].  All was good.<br />
<br />
2. Went back to Nedaria, &quot;a blacksmith&quot; did not respond to hails, did not change name.  Handed in 5 waters (1, then 4) and got the &quot;thanks, how can I help you?&quot; type message.  Name still &quot;a blacksmith&quot;.  Gave her the Ore and Plans, she popped down the to forges and the blade appeared on my cursor within 15 seconds.  Never changed her name.<br />

Same with the dragon champion. yet, others could loot the Gulak tome no problems, and the Hilt and champ eye no problems yesterday..... is this intentional?????? If so, why is it not affecting other peoples epics?? Am very dissapointed if this is intentional. Please comment. Thanks<br />

<br />
I can confirm this.. My guild whacked the champion in WoS (aggroed raid) tonight, eye was awarded to me since I was only one that had even started epic (and am at the vxed stage) and I could not loot.. nor could anyone else in guild.... when yesterday anyone could....<br />

barely at the level? The raw stats are compatible, but the heart and soul of warrior weapons is the agro.  No where near at the level.  If it didn't have shielding it would be a questionable upgrade to EoE.  <br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity and CE don't efffect the proc rate of augs and innates, right?  I think I remember hearing that....<br />
<br />
Oh, and the best thing about the clicky... it takes 2 buff slots.  Good thing it will dissipate after 1 combat round, and is only usable once every 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
And the focus.... sheesh, from guildies who have similar focuses to discs, it would appear to shave 5% off of the reuse of incite.... so.. 1.5 seconds off the reuse... yeah..... that's noticable.  It could be broken, and we'd never know.<br />
<br />
It's a sorta decent offhander... pretime warriors will have a good upgrade in it.. time warriors a questionable upgrade.. and any warrior in a KT+ raid is going to take a dps and agro hit for 3% shielding, and a little prestige.  <br />
On the bright side.. it's decent AC.</div></div><hr />

I would like to either but I bet it would work like buff proc : when you have more than one buff proc, only the first can actually fires. So going this way I suppose that if you put A3 in slot 4 and Ykesha in slot 8 only A3 would proc.<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, the stats and ratio are awesome for what it is, and slightly superior to what I expected.<br />
<br />
My complaints are based entirely on the apparent uselessness of the spell lines, especially the disparity between ours and some other class. If  the devs want to put forward the argument that the stats are superior therefore an inferior effect line is justified, then I'm quite willing to have that debate<br />
<br />
One thing's for sure though, it's superior to Epic1 in the context of the game when both appeared.</div></div><hr />

It looks like there will be more dat needs to be done than just what we have so far. In any case, I know how to get da sword put back together. It'll involve a trip to see my brother, [Krekk].'<br />

[Fri Sep 24 02:39:27 2004] Korbuk Brimblade says 'He's become one of da finest sword makers I've ever known. He'll know just how to put da hilt and da sword together to make a finely balanced weapon. He had come with me to this place, but went ahead to find new and precious metals he could use to make new blades. I think he mentioned visiting a ruined city somewhere, but I'm not certain.'<br />

At this point you have the hilt / potion / blade. Make your way to Ruined City of Dranik clear to Krekk and you're ready for the last fight. 3+ groups advised ( Endo did it with 12+ time equipped people) Hand in the items, he attacks you kill loot the sword.<br />

Useful for those times when you're not tanking, and don't need to do dps.  I get the feeling that most wars are going to be equipting this for 0.8 every 10 minutes.. if they remember...

There is a nice thread on this board with some great screenshots of some of the other class 1.5's, and when you look at those pics you say 'Yep that is without a doubt the 1.5'.  They are distinct.  Looking at the screenshot of the war 1.5 in post #613 in this thread, one would be hard pressed to have any clue that the weapon is the 1.5 and not some generic weapon.<br />

Maybe it's because it's wielded by a short race thus the sword is miniturized?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be common sense I would imagine?  Korbuk gets everything you've done handed to him at one point, why would the last hilt be any different?  I mean, how do you find out about Krekk at all? You have to hand the hilt to him, for him to even tell you about Krekk.<br />
<br />
Krekk was KoS to me as well, I hailed him first, he didn't respond, I tried handing one item in, and it said &quot;All quest items must be turned in at this point of the quest&quot;, so I handed in all 3, and it worked fine for me.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
On a side note, I complained about the epic 1.5/2.0 graphic long before it was even in the game, and the devs disregarded it.  Myself along with a slew of other Guild Summit warriors saw the epic art, and said that sword is stupid.  Its bland, boring, and looks like fine steel with a bigger hilt.  Whereas the Shadow Knight epic looks hard core distinct, and bad ass, as does the rogue epic.<br />
<br />
I mean, we're warriors, we battle, thats our life, I want a blade thats rugged, has knicks in it, looks like its been beat to hell and yet still remains in tact to kill another foe.<br />
<br />
But in the end, we get a weapon that looks barely distinguishable from a weapon any newbie can get out of BoT.<br />

Gemming mold is what results in the finished hilt though, so why would that make sense that the hilt would be finished and you'd still need a gemming tool?

This is a line of procs that gives me warm fuzzies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey Moruk, where do those procs come from?  Any idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Ktok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">Well, Im slightly disappointed but only slightly. For what it is and for the effort it takes, this is a very nice item. There is also the prestige factor, which is the only reason I did 1.0 in the first place back when I was wielding Bloodfrenzy and Hategiver.<br />
<br />
However, it looks retarded. I hope the eyes glow or something at last. When I saw the screen shot here, I thought for a moment the offhand weapon was that BoT weapon.<br />
<br />
My other complaint is that its not a 2HS. I was really hoping that this would be a good replacement for my Blade of War, but that ideas been shot all to hell<br />
<br />
However, factoring in the OoW Shield Block AA, using this with some good aggro proc augs and a high end shield (thinking Aegis of the Earth or better) could be superior to a Blade of War. Its slow enough that youll not riposte yourself to death on mobs with jacked up defensive abilities, and Shield Block should, in theory, greatly reduce the damage you take.<br />
<br />
All in all, its not bad, even with the odd clicky effect. Im very disappointed with the look, but Im still excited to try it and see how it + a shield + Shield Block stacks up to a BoW for high end encounters. If nothing else, itll be a fun experiment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">i dont get it. people have been griping about how there are no good offhand weapons for warriors and all the *uber* warrior only weapons are primary only. but when a weapon purely designed for a warrior drops in on us, that only took about 1 week to actually achive (which isnt even the end result), everyone still shits a brick and complains. given what we've learned over the years about agro, procs, stuns, debuffs, taunt, with the more current additions of the provoke line, weapon augments, and health of targets target ability (imo *THE* best ability for a tank)...<br />
do we really need EVERY weapon to be the next incarnation of &quot;The End All Be All&quot; of warrior agro? <br />
<br />
personally, i think the stats on this thing are amazing given the effort involved. half the freaken quest is walking around picking up shit off the ground and taking it to NPCs. its damn time we get origional focus effects and procs/clickies that arent just another cookie cutter extension of the same hate and stun procs we've used since bronze armor and a yak were uber. <br />
<br />
this weapon will survive the ages. how many top raiders still use a BoC and SoD? how many of those same people still keep their cobalt greaves or bracer? blazing armor of fennin ro? orb of the sky/AHR gloves/SotPM? ornate gauntlets/BP? these items have survived for so long because they exist outside off the norm of a warriors day to day life.</div></div><hr />

I do agree, somewhat, that the effects on the sword are kind of ehhh. It should be insta-cast since we have no spell casting capability, 0.8 seconds is still long enough for a mob to get a hit in...unless the spell is unstoppable. I think it is somewhat under powered compared to the SK 1.5 epic 61/35 vs. our 28/26 ......though not much considering that ours is 1handed and theirs being 2handed.  I think it should be more 30/25ish, and it has 45 AC, which is not that bad for a one hander. SK's is only 55 AC. My biggest gripe is that those who are super uber are complaining because they aren't getting more uber.  ;)  I still think that our epic 1.0 (which I need one more piece for  :p  ) was one of the coolect ideas at the time. The fact that we could either use two 1handers or a 2hander was pretty cool IMHO. I would like to see them continue this tradition.....then again they could accidentally balance us.  :eek: <br />

This is terrible news. I had no idea he had been so corrupted by this place. I had no idea he'd turn into a monster and try to steal away dat which we have been charged to protect! Luckily you were able to stop him and recover da sword. You should keep it in your possesion. I have a feeling you're da [one] I've been waiting for.<br />
<br />
Korbuke Brimblade says 'Only da one who had da power to combine da sword could have come so far. You have it in you to make dat sword great! Right now, its power is minor. With some time and effort, you might be able to bring it into da light and make it da most powerful sword ever known! When i touched da sword, i sensed a presence within it.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I can't explain it really. It's as if da sword was part of a being at one time. Perhaps da sword was a being but was changed into a sword by some terrible means. All I know is dat it keeps calling to me, leading me... and you... to da next step of da puzzle. Right now it's telling me dat da next step of da puzzle resides in da labryinth. We've already been there, I wonder what more we could find from [going back].'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Well, if you want to continue, you'll go back. Da vision I had showed a beast possessed by an evil spirit. It almost seemed like dat spirit was part of da presence dat I've felt from da sword. You should find da beast and destroy it, then see if you can recapture whatever spirit is trapped in its body.'<br />
<br />
I hope we can continue updating information as we go, until 2.0 is complete. <br />
<br />
*side note*<br />
For the most part i loved the concept art, but i think sony went wrong making it so DULL looking..Almost a Dull rust color..<br />
<br />
&quot;With some time and effort, you might be able to bring it into da light&quot; <br />

I'm hoping this is true with 2.0, maybe the 2.0 version is brighter has character and doesnt look like we pulled it out of the ground.<br />

We can only wish....<br />
<br />
The ratio (guessing) looks like 20-25 complete epics vs 5-6 turn ins &quot;eaten&quot; by krekk.<br />
<br />
If it's possible could a dev that checks this maybe enlighten us on anything that could of caused this problem, I don't think it has anything to do with going about turning things in wrong (prior to being told to go to krekk). The way it is setup, npcs wont respond to your turn ins until you have the previous steps complete iirc.<br />
<br />
Either way, epic 1.5 is a upgrade to me and I was looking foward to actually completing it, it's graphic having less then desired appeal means little to me, I personaly am happy they put epic weapon quests back in the game.<br />

<br />
Yeah, he does corpse camp, and in retrospect fighting him right at the zi (or rooms there) would have been much easier.<br />
<br />
I really have to say I like most of these epic fights. a lot of them are very creative and enjoyable experiences (killing the bards for rogue epic was great). Other than the groundspawns, I give this quest a thumbs up for overall fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u215"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p215">OK word is out, some people are just bugged. Im one of them, if your BUGGED, do not hand in a 2nd time, it will make no difference, just a warning because of an internal faction issue of some sort, perhaps related to omens beta, its not officially known yet. Just hang on to your pieces and wait for a Dev's &quot;Go ahead&quot; in some official statement or otherwise.<br />
<br />
Are you shitting me? I could have been like 2nd or 3rd serverwide to compelete this and now I gotta just wait for them to fix it?<br />
<br />
I was in owens beta and helped test alot of events and now my epic is bugged cause of it?<br />
<br />
Maybe its just my e-penis talking but it would mean alot to me me to be the first on our server to complete it. Now Im 2 days behind cause of an issue I have no control of?</div></div><hr />

Theres about 0.0000000000000000000000001% chance being in beta affected your character in anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
Devourer can be spawned any time.  Kill the 4 static Slashers and Devourer spawns in a preset location.  Respawn time on slashers is roughly 30 minutes.<br />
We did it tonight back-to-back with another guild.<br />
<br />
We were at zi setting up and they started zoning in; I asked several what they were targeting and got no reply and when we brought our 11 folks over to the Slashers we found 6 of their folks starting to clear and engaging the slashers so we just backed off and let them go. When they finished we did ours.  They did it with 9 Time/qvic equipped.  We did it with 11 ele/time equipped.  There's took longer but hey they only had 9 people.  We had no cleric -- 2 druids chaining cheal on MT was enough even when I screwed up and forgot to click off junkbuff before pull and so i had the 500hp/tick dot on the whole fight. Too funny. Did I mention I ate rage?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I forgot to mention we had two shaman and neither could land a slow.  Not sure if any new 66+ spells will do the trick or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u238"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p238">The decaying lord spawns in the far northeast corner.  You can get there if you alternate with IVU and regular invis all the way until you get to the Garudon area, then you need to kill maybe 10 mobs, drop down off a bridge to a level70 dragorn used for ranger/monk epics, and he's pullable from there.  Also, he corpse camps, so theoretically you can pull him to the zone in if you can get to him.  It's technically soloable for me, but there's a lot of downtime just to get there.<br />

<br />
i would like to point out that the energy receptor is almost totaly useless to finding the ore in draniks scar.   bag it  <br />
<br />
use the Ground spawn map availible on this site. You will get your ore many times faster.<br />
<br />
having said that. the energy receptor appears to only track the borer.  nothing else. so you can have ore laying around and yah won't be able to track it.   fun fun.<br />
<br />
I spent 2 hours waiting for it to report  something other then &quot; the energy receptor does not appear to be active&quot;<br />
<br />
also would like to possibly update the &quot;a blacksmith&quot; in nedaria's<br />
<br />
locating the &quot;a blacksmith&quot; i hailed and it turned into the named NPC. soon as i handed in the water it turned right back to &quot;a blacksmith&quot; then turned in my smelting plans and ore.  npc poofed with both saying brb. 10 secs later never seeing the npc again i get a msg here yah go and i get the sword.  npc did not respawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well first off there's no real info on the fight. He's probably a 4 group fight if you know what to expect. Maybe 3 groups if they are 70's and Qvic equiped and full aaxp.  <br />
<br />
He has a knock back (so get lev up). This was the biggest surprise.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice how hard he hit because I was laughing so hard the first time he threw my butt up against a fort wall. I had no idea what to expect so those fights are usaully fun.  And the fact that I was happy as all heck he didn't eat my turn in.<br />
<br />
Personally, don't put lev up. The fight is alot more fun that way.<br />
<br />
I am glad we killed all the snakes in the area or we would have had 15 adds.</div></div><hr />
