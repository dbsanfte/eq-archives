Authentic magelo profile, looking for some gear check.  By looking in inventory, you see I have 2 blood earings and 2 vallorium (waiting on 46 to wear finally) - so ignore my current rings and earings?<br />
<br />
Looking for anything that is &quot;out of place&quot;... Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only thing I see is your shoulder.  Chokadi Spualders will be good for you. Or even barbed Dragonscale.<br />
<br />
Everything else is good enough to 65+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SpicedHam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Update - decided that having 2 levels seperate me from new gear was silly so went ahead and dinged 46.  <br />
<br />
Magelo found in first post is up to date.. will check on shoulders (those are a bad spot for me) - any other ideas please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snarl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">now that there is a twink if i've ever seen one... WOW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Greklak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why did you not just go ahead and use two fierce heraldic bracers and fierce heraldic pauldrons?  They're both better than what you currently are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SpicedHam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I am a GM smith - but unluckily I am a barbarian smith (helanic tundra armor for worshipers of tribunal).  So I cant just up and make some fierce  =(<br />
<br />
As you can see, money was no option for this little guy - its just that I can not find a human smith to make me some, and there are none for sale in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Shame really...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SpicedHam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Took you guys advice and finally found someone selling fierce heraldic pauldrons.  Leveled this guy up and here I stand.<br />
<br />
Still looking for some more advice.. anything that might be better... Going for the HP items I can get but also AC is lacking enough to make me want to fix it. <br />
<br />
Only 1163 ac unbuffed makes me sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WOW!  I'd say your little guy is juuuust fine for the grind to 65. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You're AC is lower that most magelo's on here because of your level, which is capping your AC.  Once you level up and hit the max, your AC will adjust accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SpicedHam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Current request for gear check?  =)<br />
<br />
Gear Link (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=926960) <br />
<br />
Since my first post, I have leveled and upgraded more than a few slots of my gear.  Looking for things that are &quot;out of place&quot; or that I need to work on.<br />
<br />
My current focus is on new weapons.  My second box (left) has the weapons I use the most in there... <br />
<br />
I am currently trying to find a BoC for sale for a reasonable price (on my server, when that happens, they are bought and the person tries to resell 300-400k more).  Ideas please?  (Working on an anger3 proc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As you can see, money was no option for this little guy - <br />
Shame really...<br />
<br />
If you got tons of cash and are serious about this guy, here are a few items you can pick up<br />
<br />
1) Blade of Carnage + CHoS or SotB<br />
2) Crystallized Acid Bracer &gt; Fierce Heraldic<br />
3) Boots of the Storm &gt; Fierce Heraldic<br />
4) Iron Cog Earring<br />
5) Black Plated Collar<br />
6) If ya really got cash and can afford it an Ornate BP Mold<br />
7) Amygdalan's Chain Mask<br />
<br />
Then you'd be twinked!   :D</div></div><hr />
