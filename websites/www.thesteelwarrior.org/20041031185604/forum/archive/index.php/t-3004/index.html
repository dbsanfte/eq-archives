<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far it seems the concensus is to get the best Ykesha proc you can afford.  Does this hold true for Primal 1handers?  Anyone aug'd their Primal/Prismatic yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why *wouldn't* you want the best agro proc on your primal?  (Unless you were using it to boost your dps while not tanking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A proc is a proc.  Which weapon you are putting it in is irrelevant.  The proc augment you would want to use is the same for primal as any other weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, a windblade with a stun proc will own<br />
<br />
Yes, a war marshalls bladed staff with a stun proc will own<br />
<br />
Yes, your primal with a stun proc will own.<br />
<br />
YES YOUR NON STUN PROCCING WEAPON WITH A STUN PROC WILL OWN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, there's a lot more to deciding on procs than just what will aggro the most.  My opinions only here obviously, but I personally carry a bunch of different weapons for different situations.  For instance, I'm planning on adding the biggest lifetap I can get to a scimmy of lifestealing- cause when I equip that, it's cause healing is tight, and I WANT healing when I'm using it.  If they put in a snare proc, I'd add that to my snare weapon, etc.  For my not-MT-max-DPS-but-don't-steal-aggro weapons, I'd consider one of the damage reduction procs perhaps (for rampage), in place of a high aggro DD/stun.<br />
<br />
So, for primal, I'd probably consider a non-stun/aggro proc actually, since when I'm MTing/want aggro, I get kitty avatar.  Will have to think about it a bit and pay attention when I do swap it in for procs (not much lately actually), and see what makes sense for those situations.<br />
<br />
Hope they got creative with the auguments, and have much more variety in the drop tables and/or high point vendor selection.  Some I'd love to see:<br />
-tash<br />
-cripple<br />
-slow<br />
-snare (root?)<br />
-low and high aggro dots<br />
-lure DDs<br />
-MoK/MoR effects<br />
-fun effects (spin, gflux/knockback, blind, etc.) <br />
-and, of course, the Holy Grail of pure melee pvp, a dispel-target proc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you Remf, that was the kind of response I was after.   You touched on a good point, for MT situation we probably want to put aggro procs on top of aggro procs to wind up with 2 aggro procs per weapon.  Then in an exp group situation, where I really need to have the Primal doing its thing, I could add possibly something more geared toward the exp situation, like lifetap.<br />

QUIT TROLLIN ITS THREADS!!!!! IT HATES YOUSES!!!!!  HATES!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My question about the Windblade had more to do with using the stun on it vs adding a second stun to a GSoT.  There is no question about whether it is better or worst than some fire based DD proc or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I ain't trolling, there's just like 5 damned threads now asking the same thing.<br />
<br />
Do you think that my XXXX will be teh rox0r's with a stun augment?<br />
<br />
WELL DUH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would have to agree that the best proc for one weapon is not going to be the best proc for another weapon by any stretch. I carry weapons with different procs for different situations, why would I want them all to have the same proc? You can bet I won't be putting +hate or stun+DD procs on my DPS weapons. Those will certainly be getting +damage procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well naturally if you carry a weapon that's just for doing low-aggro dps, then you won't put an aggro proc in it.  :p  But do you need to discuss that on a message board?  No offense to the posters here, but if you want aggro, then put in an aggro proc.  If you don't want aggro, don't.  What's the mystery here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The number one question I want answered is how high does the point system go? We know what we can get for 500, 1000, and now 1500 points in certain themes. We also know there are some damn good procs for that amount. <br />
<br />
But what is available for 2k, 5k, hell 10k points?<br />
<br />
Right now the force of ykesha seems like a great proc for the points it costs (750 I think). I think the points are going to be like AA is for me, it gets real hard not to spend them when you have a bunch saved up. <br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We know from Lucy what procs have been added, and Anger only goes up to Anger III, and Wrath of Ykesha is the highest effect in that line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gonna post and ask anyway...<br />
<br />
I use GBoS and SotB.  Although I believe adding a Ykesha augment will be better aggro than Anger 2, both the procs on the above weapons have a 1 pushback factor and when I'm really proccing i'm also really pushing.  Adding another 1 pushback proc like Ykesha doesn't appeal to me.  I use a GSotFW for dps and occasionally aggro depending on the group makeup.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the question...<br />
<br />
Which do you think will be better aggro?<br />
<br />
1. GBoS with Anger 2 (200 hate) + SotB with  Vampiric Talon (50 LT) for 850 points<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2. GSotFW with Force of Ykesha (125 dd and 0.0 stun) for 760 points<br />
<br />
haha, dont flame me, i already know which way i think is better but want another opinion ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I have seen you shouldn't be afraid to spend 1,150 points on a proc and assume it is top end. There is nothign better in the Lucy data at any rate.<br />
<br />
There ARE some other augmentations out there that run in the 1500-2000 range but these are mostly items and high end Regeneration FT (Regen VI and up, FT2 and up). I would bet there are weapons at the 2k+ mark that might make you drool but I don't think there are new procs that high up (unless they are to be added to the spell data in a later patch).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kergin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm going to get the lifetap procs for my weapons.  Prolly not the best aggro, but I like the idea of doing 100 damage and recieving 100hps from a nearly unresistable proc.  IMO BoC + Lifetap will be awesome :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I actually want a straight DMG augment for most of my weapons.<br />
<br />
Then again, I'm weird that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm.. have to admit the LT procs are appealing. +300hp per fight on average. But I guess I'm still stuck to the idea of trying to reduce broken aggro as much as possible.<br />
<br />
I'd RATHER have the LTs on my two main 1h'ers and then put Guard IV on my Crescent Blades of Luclin (could be as much as +500hp boost) but I feel that I have to go Ykesha instead in order to do my most basic job, tank. :/</div></div><hr />

There is nothign better in the Lucy data at any rate. This is assuming that only the recently added effects are going to be used for augmenting. I have a Heated Blade augment.... it's been in the database for awhile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very tempted by the lifetap procs as well.  I may think about putting one in my GBoS.  If I don't and wind up with dual aggro procs for my tanking weapons I will probably try to put another lifetap on my Dark Blade of the Shai`Din (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=61209)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jateki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was going to add Vampire Kiss to my Emp sword, an extra 75pt lifetap would own.<br />

Then maybe Force of Ykesha to my bow, the 125dd/stun would be a good addition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As pointed out above:<br />
<br />
1. An existing effect in Lucy's might be available at 10k etc<br />
2. Thet might ADD stuff in 3 weeks when folks start getting that many pts<br />
<br />
rarely is anything black &amp; white</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;rarely is anything black &amp; white&quot;<br />
<br />
Straight up augmented damage is usually black and white.<br />
<br />
Although I guess the case can be made that it's really more Black and BLUE.<br />
