We zoned in to do the stomach event and the baron was up already.  I guess someone else wiped on the stomach event.  So we got the Mouths of Baraguj Szuul ~10 min into the zone and didn't have to do the stomach part.<br />
<br />
We then tried to get Avatars to spawn but have had no luck in ~3 hrs.  Where do they spawn?  Allak has weak info on this quest.<br />
<br />
Kindly advise if you have some details on locations and PH's.</div></div><hr />

Uhhmmm...I can't say I agree with this.  I dont know of any time that I've seen the avatar up upon zoning in.  You have to clear its PH to make it spawn, or at least that's what everybody has told me...</div></div><hr />

It took about 8 hrs to get all 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all.  We spent 10 hours camping and we got three of the four.  One of em spawned twice in 4 hours so they are definately not 3 day spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">do you need to kill these mobs and get some drop off of them in order to do Saryn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, you need to kill them for the key to get into the Saryrn area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the key used up so you have to replace it each raid?  I hope not.  Hopefully it's more like getting an agnarr key or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There appear to be 4 two story areas on this map -- http://www.eqatlas.com/planes/planeoftormentmap.html<br />
<br />
that's where the PHs for each avatar are located?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A big f&amp;&amp;k you, Sony, for this key quest.  I spent 5 hours with my group tonight killing constructs and other mobs in the way in a couple of the areas that avatars are supposed to spawn.  Not a single freaking avatar even popped.  And you need 4 plus the container for the key.  I thought Sony learned with Luclin that people hate quests with stupidly rare spawn.  Guess not.  /rude.</div></div><hr />

The above statement is a retarded one. You can clear out one of the 4 little stops along the way to saryrn's chambers/szuul castle. Just kill the spawns in the rooms on the sides, or when you go up steps, the mobs on the top will be PH's for the avatars.  <br />
 <br />
Do szuul event for loot a few times (and key boxes for your rogues) and be sure to take a different path each time, chances are you'll get an avatar to spawn.</div></div><hr />
