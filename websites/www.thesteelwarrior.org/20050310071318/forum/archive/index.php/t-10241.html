Well, I dont see too much progression wise in this article....  i dont think it will see too well if it doesnt offer any further advancement.  Some of the features are nice and helful though!</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you can trade gear for other gear also based on a common price for the item? Hell if I know, I don't know how they're going to make that work if that's what it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be nice if theyre going to make it so that there is an item your looking for and you have a couple of items your willing to trade for it, then that is how you set it up.  Not sure how they would code this though.  Itll be interesting to see.</div></div><hr />

I agree.  If that means buying items for RL cash from SoE, EQ is truly dead and gone.<br />

What Ugle suggested seemed to make more sense to me, but I wonder how often someone would have the item you're actually looking for and be willing to trade it at the same value.<br />
<br />
I just assumed from them saying Barter System then meant trading of some sort, but you can do that already so I don't see what the point would be except to let lazy people be lazier.</div></div><hr />

What specifically are you talking about?  EQ seems about as unbroken as it ever gets to me but maybe I'm missing something?   I wouldn't mind if they slowed down the expansions a bit though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That sounds like the most likely feature to me.  Would be nice to be able to trade offline, especially for people on dialup that can't keep a vendor up all day long.</div></div><hr />

Did you expect anything less?  Plus given most games share many mechanics now adays, you can't make any new content without being accused of &quot;stealing it&quot; from another competing game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I don't think WoW even has a simple &quot;weapon switch&quot; unless you make a macro for it or use comsos, granted it was in D2 which was also a Blizz game. Heh, it's a silly argument in the first place, it wouldn't suprise me if Sony did any of that based on Blizzard games, but so what?<br />
<br />
An offline trader would make a lot of sense, but I don' know what Sony's malfunction is that they can't just say &quot;offline trader mode&quot; for the next expansion. Let me guess, they call blenders 'push-button automatic blade ridden fruit and vegetable liquifiers'.<br />
<br />
I guess what can we expect from a company that tends to make simple things needlessly complex?</div></div><hr />

but they are smart enougth to adapt things so well that you don't find easily where they come from. But SoE just made an expension with outside features  solely (at least on this given list) and just try to mask its origin with strange sentences (see above post for exemple). Moreover I never heard of SoE acknowledging other game company for their idees.<br />
<br />
the only thing I like in it, outside all the great features (afterall they are mainly not their own) is that they do rspect their words &quot;ok, we understood! we won't make alien mob again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks SoE, only for this you are giving me back some hope for Everquest's future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it is quite funny how they seem to take other game's old features, toss them in an expansion and claim &quot;Brand new game features!&quot; - Please, atleast give us some credit.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there will be more to the expansion than that, but I hope for your guy's sake that they don't half assed rush it like they have a habbit of doing. Maybe if they're actually reading feedback and notice that people want to fight mythological creatures instead of aliens, they would've also noticed that people would rather wait a year for a good expansion than a couple months for a rushed one with unfinished content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think anyone thinks the reason why WoW's so good is because of a colored map, potion belt, etc.<br />
<br />
It's because you can meaningfully accomplish something in under an hour, without requiring the assistance of 53 other people.<br />
<br />
Unless there are going to be warrior-soloable dwagons in this expansion? Yeah, right.<br />
<br />
If you're in a raiding guild, and have gotten bored of GoD, grats. You get something new to do. To me, I don't see anything here worthwhile for a non-raider.</div></div><hr />

EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath is bursting with new adventures and intense battles for players of all levels.<br />

<br />
Looking at the list of features, I can't find one thing that makes me excited. It looks like LOY, but without the must have features like bank slots or dyes. <br />
<br />
I guess they are planning on people not caring about the broken promises and lies from the last year, or the fact that the end zones from the last two expansions still aren't finished, because OMG WE GET TO FIGHT DRAGONS!!!111one</div></div><hr />

Atleast they listen to people at the summit in some ways.<br />
<br />
Even though, putting sutff into an expansion that was supposed to be free, is kinda crappy, I think they are atleast trying. Maybe seeing 10page rants on how bad SoE sucks will make them start to put out quality expansion.<br />

The 10 Cleric 10 wizard era is long gone with the arrival of WoW/EQ2 (at least on my server).<br />
54 People (which assumes 1 cleric/druid per group minimum) isnt even possible.<br />

Just look back on the dev chats, and how they had mentioned that they were working on the character graphics on the side, and even considering having an outside art company come on to help, and that it would be given out to players for free once it was done.<br />
<br />
I hate how quickly the ink fades and means nothing, and guild houses were an idea they were kicking around back in luclin... takes them a long time to do anything really, and dispite how they hold our hands and make promisses it will always end up in a box on a bestbuy shelf.</div></div><hr />

and I really wish they'd hold back the release date on this til like late march, or april even...Theres what? maybe 1 anguish guild on every server... if that, meaning OoW is really undiscovered to the rest of these servers/guilds and I think they should just slow it down a bit. Maybe add another zone off of RCoD that requires a certain key or flag to get into but is lower then anguish but &gt; qvic?        Maybe i'm just blabbing.

Oh and kinda funny how they release expansion after expansion while the old ones are still unbeaten. Should give them a clue that maybe, just maybe they arent properly tuned still(at least with regards to GoD, still early days with regards to mata muram I guess).</div></div><hr />

But what make me nervous the most with this new expension is that they are ofering registration for beta test... and we all know the difference between GoD (open beta test) and OoW (restricted beta to some guilds only)...</div></div><hr />

After all, the UI changes came out about the same time as Luclin, but weren't part of the expansion.  Same deal with the DX9 stuff and GoD.  /shudder</div></div><hr />

but don't worry, the feature list is not complete, they can still add some lines for new graphics, new AA, new horse (anybody has ever dreamed to ride a drake ?), new pet ala wow's familiar, whatever else.<br />
an improvement to the bazard I would like to see is the possibility to add discrimination on the selling list. I mean that I can configure my bot to sell, for exemple, my BoC 300k to a warrior lvl 70, 400k to a lvl 50 and higher, 800k to a lvl 30 and higher, and 10 000k to a non warrior or a warrior below lvl 30.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you release a new expansion, and the &quot;uber&quot; guilds on the server have had too much time to conquer the prior, they focus 100% on the new expansion, thus finishing it, and putting it under &quot;farm-status&quot; in no time.  Then what do you get?  Whiney people who piss and moan constantly that there isn't enough content in the game, blah blah blah.  <br />
<br />
By doing this, and potentially even &quot;blocking&quot; the end of GoD and OoW, they give the &quot;uber guilds&quot; time to finish things unfinished.  <br />
<br />
How you people can complain about problems EQ had in the past, and yet complain again when they finally offer an expansion (allbeit ill-timed)  fixing some of the said problems is beyond me.  Where is the book that contains the rule, &quot;An Expansion must be completed 100% by a guild before another Expansion is released or IT IS WRONG.&quot; eh?<br />
<br />
If anything, releasing a new expansion prevents blocking of higher end zones by competing guilds, and requires them to do less instanced zones which we all know they can't get working worth a damn.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what they fix, when they fix it, and how bad they make this game, 90% of the people on this forum, plus 90% of the other people on all other class forums will continue to play, and will continue to pay them monthly.  Deny it if you must, but this is cold hard fact.<br />
<br />
EQ has and always will be about the hardcore gamer.  You casual players can petition for equality all you want, but it won't do any good.  If you can't invest the time needed to actually do &quot;fun&quot; things in this game, then just don't play it.  Others shouldn't have to suffer from crap implementations and side-junk just so you casuals can have your equality.  Deal with it.<br />
<br />
I've watched Sony screw up (and even get right at times, GOSH) end game content for over 5 years now.  And yes, i'll openly admit i'm still a sap who pays them monthly.  But i'm still having fun.</div></div><hr />

You expect them to give away an entire expansion for free?  You guys will whine about ANYTHING.  It will surely cost $30, if you don't think you'll get $30 of enjoyment out of it, don't buy it- it's OPT-IN.  I think it looks cool.  If you aren't having fun in EQ, just stop playing.<br />

I have no idea what &quot;graphics&quot; you're referring to.  The next expansion is not only a graphics engine upgrade, it contains new content, new gameplay features, new loot, etc.   One of the features in this expansion may be improved graphics, but so what?  Each expansion to date has had improved graphics.  When Sony upgraded the EQ engine to support DX9 features, it was free.  So what is your problem?</div></div><hr />

MMORPG's are some of the cheapest forms of entertainment on the market.  For you to think Sony is robbing us to charge us for graphic updates, pc model improvements, and new shaders to be included with new expansions is like me argueing a $0.05 piece of bubble gum at the local &quot;Quikie-Mart&quot; is too expensive.</div></div><hr />

They are the only ones who tend to speak up against things such as this.<br />

I'm not the one pissing and whining about the new expansion.  I still have fun playing EQ.  See if I cling on to message boards, fansites and the like after I quit like some of you do.  For a game thats so horribly screwed up and broken you'd think letting go would be more simple than you lurkers make it out to be.<br />
<br />
A bit of advice:  Don't comment on anything you haven't the first clue about and/or don't play anymore.  &quot;Back in the day&quot; stories aren't near as interesting as they sound from the storytellers mouth.

The PC Models are not promised yet, nor are they going to be a part of any expansion if they make it live.<br />

The new in-game messaging service will work for everyone regardless of whether you've bought the expansion.<br />

<br />
Blizzard manages to somehow run battle.net just fine for atleast five different games, multiple realms each (some games which have been supported a good ten years), and they still do it absolutely free. I don't remember having to fork out some cash anytime SC, WC3 or Diablo was patched, you know why? Because I already paid for the damn game.

Well last time I checked almost every single online game has to deal with those same problems, yet I don't see them charging 10-15$/mo. for them.<br />
What MMORPG are you playing that doesn't charge $10-15 a month?  Do you live on a different planet than the rest of us?  Blizzard charges $15 a month also, the price seems reasonable to me for the amount of enjoyment I get.<br />
<br />
Retarded shit about B.NET<br />
First off, would you say the quality of Battle.NET is anywhere near the level of service people expect from a modern MMORPG?  If you say &quot;yes&quot;, you're being dishonest.   Second, MMORPGs are persistent worlds that require a lot more hardware, bandwidth, and support in general.  Comparing EQ, WoW, DAOC, UO, or any MMORPG to Diablo 2 is apples and oranges.  You're posting on an EQ forum, don't you know the difference by now? <br />
<br />
I hope the poor guy can make those payments on his brand new mansion, garage full of cars and the new bathing suit he's going to need so he can take a nice little dip in his swimming pool full of money.<br />

Think of the email system as tells that stay until the person reads them.  Whether they are online or not.

What game doesn't have to deal with any of that shit? <br />
<br />
What MMORPG are you playing that doesn't charge $10-15 a month?<br />
<br />
Who said anything about MMoRGs only? <br />
<br />
I'll explain since you're completely oblivous to what you just said youself ten minuts ago. Every online game has to deal every single one of those problems, yet they don't have to charge to support them, why is Everquest any different? Because the original idea behind the monthly payment was for the in game support, and supposedly the events which GMs were supposed to run. I don't know about you, but I haven't seen any of that shit in months or even years. You're basicly paying them over 150$ a year for nothing. Every game has tech support, I'm sure battle.net supports just as many users over all (even if it is between all of the free blizzard games) and they aren't giving you free content or even shit which they promised to do for free, so what is it for? <br />
<br />
Apparently you don't play WoW or you would know that blizzard has been patching in content for free constantly including new instances, battlegrounds in the near future, and hero classes were all promised as free content. Do I expect their next boxed expansion to be free? No, I don't, but atleast they're giving us the content they promised for free instead of turning around and trying to seel it to us like Sony.<br />
<br />
First off, would you say the quality of Battle.NET is anywhere near the level of service people expect from a modern MMORPG?<br />
<br />
It may not be near what people expect from a modern MMoRG, but it's damn near what people actually get from a MMoRG. Have you actually ever tried to get customer support on Everquest? I don't think you have, I've played EQ for six years, customer service was/is/and always will be fucking horrible. It's only gotten worse over the years, but of course, let me guess, it magicly got all better right after I quit right?<br />
<br />
Comparing EQ, WoW, DAOC, UO, or any MMORPG to Diablo 2 is apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
Indeed it is, but last time I checked I said that battle.net manages to support atleast five different games at once, not just D2, learn how to read smart guy. Not only does it support those five games, SC, Diablo and WC2 are all older than EQ I believe, let alone WC3/D2 which pre-date PoP. They still patch these games and add new &quot;content&quot; (granted it's not on as large of a scale) and still support these 5+ year old games for free. Blizzard tech support is the exact same as EQ tech support, get in chat, wait in a line, or call their toll free number.<br />
<br />
I guess I paid monthly just so I could have a EQ GM get back to me almost two days after I petitioned the once in six months when I actually had a in game problem?<br />
<br />
They also have to pay bills just like you and I.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against success, but you make it sound like a fucking sob story, please spare me. I probably work harder in a week than he does in a month, yet I still make a hell of a lot less. My point was, when is enough money enough? I do agree, 10-15$ a month is pretty cheap, but when was the last time Sony actually earned it?<br />
<br />

Sony has never taken your wallet in order to be able to play this game.  You may spend, what, $100 every 6 months to play this game, expansions included?  Fuck, I could blow $100 easily just on a Friday.<br />
<br />
MMORPG's are some of the cheapest forms of entertainment on the market.  For you to think Sony is robbing us to charge us for graphic updates, pc model improvements, and new shaders to be included with new expansions is like me argueing a $0.05 piece of bubble gum at the local &quot;Quikie-Mart&quot; is too expensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
What work did they do? it was fucking DX9 dipshit... the basically applied someone elses work to their game and made it work togeather... yeah nice work! I would be impressed if they took what DX9 provided and made it their own in their lighting programming or their own shaders(I mean hell, it looks like a shadow saw is trying to molest my armor, not my own shadow casting across it), but with all the problems and chugging it shows how much thought was put into it.<br />
<br />
Cheap eh? looking into guildwars, you buy it once and then your set, how about unreal 2k4? that thing even has a pirates mod that turns it into an RPG that stores stats on the home server... don't tell me its not one of the cheapest because frankly it isn't when you consider add ons and upgrades.<br />
<br />
Frod, (those that hate my use of curses, excuse me for this but) bite my fucking ass ok pal? I don't give a shit what their &quot;update&quot; is, what was said was said and changing the tune is just as bad as saying nothing at all (which was the old game plan)<br />
<br />
I am sick of you riding my ass with all your pompas bullshit, you know as well as I do they change their tune just as often as the wind changes direction, features and plans go missing left and right... remember the combat moves? matching the melee damage to be closer to caster damage? remember fixing acrylia caverns? the list goes on and on about shit that has fallen by the wayside... and I have all faith that the important bits will come back as features to be charged for... hell player housing or at least guild houses have been kicked around how long?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I am not falling for another fucking LoY, which has been hailed as one of the worst if not the worst expantion... since my account is still payed up to that point I think I will just jump off the top of the PoK tower and let the corpse rot before I finally uninstall everquest... WoW is better anyway  :p<br />
<br />
Oh yeah you asked for where I was getting new player models from, if you look at the reports and screenshots sony is feeding out you can see a human in chain armor near a monster, that armor is currently not in game, nor is a model with that many polys so I beleave that is our first look at a new character model, the expantion does have &quot;improved graphics&quot; listed.... that is a further clue because that was also on the luclin feature list.</div></div><hr />

If EQ sucks so bad and Sony is the devil like you are trying to make them out to be but fail to provide any evidence of through quotes or links, stop playing now and play WoW.

I'll always come back to TSW as long as there is rant section, people on here I can contact of a quick game of something else, and a WoW section because this is a community that has gone further than everquest, while my status may amount to that as a loud mouthed bum standing on the corner speaking of the end of days but hell, I enjoy it.<br />

<br />
You can never please everybody.<br />
Somebody is always going to bitch.<br />
Bitchers are always 100x louder than happy people.<br />
Bitchers often justify their bitching with the &quot;I'm looking out for others&quot; excuse.<br />
People think their opinions actually matter to other people.<br />
<br />
Here are some facts of life:<br />
If people will pay for a service, regardless of if the service could be provided for free, a company would be stupid not to charge for it.<br />
If people will pay for a product improvement, regardless of if the improvement could be provided for free, a company would be stupid not to charge for it.<br />
As long as people are paying for something, a company would be stupid to stop charging for it.<br />
Business is like politics.  Companies (like cantidates) will say whatever they think you want to hear to buy their products (or vote for them), then turn around and do whatever they like once you've shelled out the cash (or voted).<br />
<br />
Cry all you want about SOE, their game, their business model, war, underground nuclear weapons testing, affirmative action, clubbing baby seals to death with foam batons and whatever else offends you.  The bottom line is that SOE is a successful company with a successful business model, whether you like it or not.  Deal with it.<br />

<br />
Thats what I was talking about, thats the human model but it has more muscles than before, thats why I think its an updated model even if not by much, also notice that the monsters shadow effects the player model, currently that doesn't happen, the world is effected by player shadow, and player shadows do not effect other players at that level, and monster shadows don't do that at all (that or radeon sucks)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://everquest.station.sony.com/dragonsofnorrath/images/screenshots/EQ000067.jpg <br />

is what I am talking about by improvements, no jig saw shadow and its pushing alot of polys, it also is using smooth shader which I don't see in the game currently... my point being, however stealth there are improvements here.</div></div><hr />

Jesus Christ, you're still persisting in this fantasy world you've created for yourself where promises were made?  (They weren't... note the &quot;if&quot;) And then not followed up on for &quot;free&quot; (which they weren't, just because the person taking the SS's had a better video card than you doesn't mean there were PC model changes).   <br />
<br />
Drop it Gerick, you're wrong, period.. there's no new character models, nor were they ever promised.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, invoking &quot;classes arent' that out of balance&quot; is easily the height of retardation.  That is what is referred to as a Logical Fallacy.  You are taking two completely unconnected statements, from two different people, neither of which are alike, and trying to &quot;find a connection&quot;.

Brenlo has been stressing since before the Fan Faire and specifically AT the Fan Faire that they were a definite *if*, not a promise, not a when, an *if*.  Every time someone brought it up, he'd cut them off and make sure they realized it was an if, not a when.<br />

Unrelated to this, but Blizzard PR is way worse than SoE.

When you buy a computer part from a store and they have a 30 day return policy, you expect them to keep their word right?<br />

<br />
What did you expect?  It was inevitable, and both the subjects are inextricably linked.  Given you are making a comment on a post for a game i'm guessing you don't even play anymore, i'm assuming you were a casual player?  They are the only ones who tend to speak up against things such as this.<br />
<br />
I'm not the one pissing and whining about the new expansion.  I still have fun playing EQ.  See if I cling on to message boards, fansites and the like after I quit like some of you do.  For a game thats so horribly screwed up and broken you'd think letting go would be more simple than you lurkers make it out to be.<br />
<br />
A bit of advice:  Don't comment on anything you haven't the first clue about and/or don't play anymore.  &quot;Back in the day&quot; stories aren't near as interesting as they sound from the storytellers mouth.  Your &quot;expert&quot; opinion and witty remarks help no one but your ego.<br />
<br />
Hmm, considering my &quot;back-in-the-day&quot; was only about 1.5 months ago, I think I still have a clue.  Also, I spent time on both sides of the fence, Brother.  Lvl 70/442AA and on the casual side later after burn-out military obligations side-lined me.  There was no bittersweet nonsense (&quot;Back in my day&quot;) spewing from my piehole.  I was basically calling Bullshit on your nonsensical arguement.<br />
<br />
As far as clinging...I have been a part of this community since well before we moved to this format.  A'la' old school TSW fanboard.  So before you come here spouting your BS, remember communities like this survive/thrive because of the folks who &quot;live&quot; here.<br />
<br />
Now for one so eager to dispense advice, Id advise you to mind your own fucking business.  This thread was meandering through the &quot;General Section&quot; just fine without your semi-moronic musing on the state of the game regarding the two factions of EQ.  <br />
<br />
If you took the time to think about it...I post almost exclusively in the General, Rants, and Wow Forums...because in a way I agree with you.  Since I no longer play I dont have a lot to contribute to the other forums.<br />

True, but according to the old stories, Velious was where all the dragons started from. Then they spread out to kunark and the classic continents. Now they are basically saying, &quot;screw that, it doesnt fit with our revamp schedule, so we are saying they started in antonicia now!&quot; Whats next? Revealing in the revamp of kunark that the original home of the dwarves was deep underground beneath Dalnirs crypt?

I guess if you could blame it on microsoft for having a crappy line of operating systems, we should all switch back to the TI line of computer, back with computing meant something.<br />
<br />
Also the game doesn't cost that much, but I can seriously think of much better things to do with $100 for 6 months, like buy sodie, cause other energy drinks are for fags.<br />

The new expansion looks like it has many new features that everybody would enjoy.  But I have to agree with the fact that it doesn't seem to add anything they could give out for free at this point.  The one main thing I would like to see in an expansion is more custom armor, the shit you get from the armor quest is so retarded looking.  Some of the best looking armor I've gotten was between level 6 and 14, after that it goes down for awhile, till you hit 40.  I hate how everyone between level 20 and 40 has the same basic armor as everyone else. There should be much more custom shit like that for much cheaper prices.  It should be ridiculously high in price.<br />

Well, as for any relpys to this, I will most likely never look apon this forum again.  I fear the day when something is made perfect in the first try.  And I fear the day when people stop bitching.  But I do hope people become more inteligent in there complaints.<br />

As an aside, I find it humorous Skirv would go through all the trouble of registering and on his very first post state he &quot;will most likely never look apon this forum again&quot;.  Drama Queen, anyone?<br />
<br />
Now, Skirv...dont get me wrong.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but it seems like a lot of trouble for such a thing.  Why not just close out the window, delete the favorite, and move on?  Either way...have a good one.<br />
