<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dewman Glugalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you picked up a paper in the last week or so, you probably got the impression that George Bush spent a year demanding an Iraqi invasion based on claims that Saddam had reconstituted nuclear weapons with uranium bought in Niger. But now that the war is over, we've found out that it was all a lie &amp; there were never any weapons of mass destruction to begin with. So far, nobody has suggested putting Saddam back in power, apologizing, and sending him a fruit basket, but just give them time. <br />
<br />
Of course, that wasn't how it actually happened. While the Bush administration certainly talked extensively about weapons of mass destruction, they also continuously discussed Iraq's breaking of UN Resolutions, freedom for the Iraqi people, and Iraq's ties to Al Qaeda &amp; terrorism. But I'm sure many of Bush's critics were too busy screaming about a &quot;war for oil&quot; &amp; &quot;US imperialism&quot; to pay attention to what the Bush administration was actually saying; so we'll have to forgive them. <br />
<br />
However, I want to address these claims that Bush lied in the build-up to the Iraq war. So let's take on the big issues, one by one. First off, Bush certainly said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Here's just one of Bush's quotes on the subject, <br />
<br />
&quot;The community of nations may see more and more of the very kind of threat Iraq poses now: a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction, ready to use them or provide them to terrorists. If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
Whoops, I'm sorry! That was actually Bill Clinton in 1998. Gosh, it just sounds so much like what President Bush was saying during the build-up to the Iraqi war that it must have just slipped in. So let's try this again. Here's just one of Bush's quotes on the subject of WMD &amp; Iraq, <br />
<br />
&quot;In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of September 11, 2001. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons. Should he succeed in that endeavor, he could alter the political and security landscape of the Middle East, which as we know all too well affects American security.&quot; <br />
<br />
Shoot, I did it again. That's actually Hillary Clinton in October of 2002. How did that get in there? <br />
<br />
OK, OK...that's enough shenanigans for one editorial. The point is that there was very little dispute between the GOP &amp; Democrats over whether Hussein had WMD or not. <br />
<br />
So why haven't we found them already? Since just about everyone expected to have already run across WMD by now, that's hard to say. But that doesn't mean there never were any WMD in Iraq. After all, we haven't found Saddam yet, but that doesn't mean he didn't exist. Besides, as I said before the war, every sign points to the fact that Iraq had WMD, <br />
<br />
&quot;To come to the conclusion that Hussein doesn't have WMD, you have to believe that after the inspectors left in 98, Saddam Hussein destroyed all of his WMD and then decided that he'd lose billions of dollars in oil revenue because of the sanctions rather than tell anyone about it. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, Saddam has refused to let his scientists and their families leave the country, defectors have talked about Hussein's WMD, rockets with empty chemical warheads have been found, and the inspectors have actually found artillery shells tipped with mustard gas. So yes, Saddam does have WMD, and to be honest, that has been patently obvious since the Gulf War.&quot; <br />
<br />
So where are the weapons? They may still be buried in Iraq, or perhaps they were destroyed before the war, given to Syria or terrorists, looted, or some combination thereof. I still believe we will find WMD in Iraq, but we're just going to have to be patient &amp; see what turns up. <br />
<br />
Next up on the agenda is a throwaway line from Bush's state of the Union speech that is now getting a lot of attention. Here's what Bush had to say about Uranium coming out of Africa / Niger during his 2003 SOTU address, <br />
<br />
&quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&quot; <br />
<br />
At first glance, that would seem to be relatively uncontroversial given that to this day, the British government stands by its reports that Saddam tried to buy uranium in Africa. However, the US based its intelligence assessment not only on what the Brits said, but on other data including a document that turned out to be forged . Without that document, the Bush administration didn't feel sure of the claim that Hussein bought uranium in Africa, so they withdrew it. <br />
<br />
Well this has sparked ceaseless caterwauling on the left. Democrats are claiming Bush lied and are falling all over themselves to call for an inquiries and investigations. I'm sure they're working on a flashy name for the whole thing too. There are probably focus groups out there right now trying to decide whether &quot;Nigergate&quot; or &quot;Uraniumgate&quot; would make a better name for a scandal. <br />
<br />
But like the other &quot;scandals&quot; the Dems have tried to cook up since Bush came into office, this one has very little to it. In short, the CIA gave Bush a piece of intelligence info and told him it was genuine, Bush shared it with the American people, then the administration was told it was bogus, and they later told the American people about it. Had the CIA done a better job of keeping the President informed of what they knew, it would have never made the SOTU speech in the first place. But as the Washington Post reported back on June 12th of 2003, <br />
<br />
&quot;A key component of President Bush's claim in his State of the Union address last January that Iraq had an active nuclear weapons program -- its alleged attempt to buy uranium in Niger -- was disputed by a CIA-directed mission to the central African nation in early 2002, according to senior administration officials and a former government official. But the CIA did not pass on the detailed results of its investigation to the White House or other government agencies, the officials said. <br />
<br />
The CIA's failure to share what it knew, which has not been disclosed previously, was one of a number of steps in the Bush administration that helped keep the uranium story alive until the eve of the war in Iraq, when the United Nations' chief nuclear inspector told the Security Council that the claim was based on fabricated evidence. <br />
<br />
A senior intelligence official said the CIA's action was the result of &quot;extremely sloppy&quot; handling of a central piece of evidence in the administration's case against then-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But, the official added, &quot;It is only one fact and not the reason we went to war. There was a lot more.&quot; <br />
<br />
Democrats should understand that the CIA sometimes makes mistakes, especially since Bill Clinton once bombed an aspirin factory in Sudan based on bogus intelligence info he received. In any case, this is a lot of hot air over one relatively unimportant sentence in a 5000 word speech. The fact that the anti-war left is trying to make a huge stink over it lets you know how desperate they are to distract the American voters from how many of them were on the wrong side of history when we went into Iraq. <br />
<br />
But there's one more subject we've got to cover and that's Dick Cheney's claim that Iraq had nuclear weapons. From Eason Jordan's CNN, here’s Wolf Blitzer with all the dastardly details, <br />
<br />
&quot;Two months after the President's address to Congress, Vice President Dick Cheney appeared on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and went further than the president in alleging Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons program. <br />
<br />
&quot;He's had years to get good at it and we know he has been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons,&quot; Cheney said.&quot; <br />
<br />
Wow, so the vice president said Saddam had nukes two months before the war? Isn't it funny that we didn't hear more about that at the time? I mean after all, you'd think that would have been a hot story. So where were the articles at the New York Times that began, &quot;Iraq has been confirmed to be a nuclear power! If a nuclear war erupts, women and minorities are expected to be the hardest hit&quot;? <br />
<br />
That can be answered by actually going to the March 16th, 2003 transcript of &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. First off, Blitzer's quote above is correct. However, Cheney also said, <br />
<br />
&quot;...I think that would be the fear here, that even if he were tomorrow to give everything up, if he stays in power, we have to assume that as soon as the world is looking the other way and preoccupied with other issues, he will be back again rebuilding his BW and CW capabilities, and once again reconstituting his nuclear program.&quot; <br />
<br />
So as we can see, earlier in the same interview Cheney said Saddam was &quot;reconstituting&quot; his program, not that he had &quot;reconstituted nuclear weapons&quot;. Later in the interview, Cheney says, <br />
<br />
&quot;We know (Saddam)'s out trying once again to produce nuclear weapons and we know that he has a long-standing relationship with various terrorist groups, including the al-Qaeda organization.&quot; <br />
<br />
Again, notice that Cheney says Saddam is &quot;trying...to produce nuclear weapons&quot;, not that he has them. <br />
<br />
So at best (from the anti-war left’s perspective), what we have here is Cheney misspeaking. At worst, the transcript is simply wrong. You almost have to wonder if that's the case given that it's hard to imagine Tim Russert blithely ignoring the VP of the United States revealing for the first time that Iraq had nukes. But Blitzer and the other people who are using this quote are so desperate to nail the Bush administration that they're willing to deliberately mislead their audiences by leaving out the context of the situation. I would say &quot;for shame&quot;, but anyone who'd try to trick their audience the way Blitzer &amp; his ilk are doing probably isn't capable of being shamed. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Americans are fighting two wars right now. Conservatives are focused on fighting a war against terrorists who want to murder Americans. While on the other hand, the anti-war left is spending much of its time and energy trying to rewrite history and find minutiae it can distort in its never ending quest to smear the President. If they spent all that energy coming up with ways to fight against America's real enemies instead of nipping at the ankles of the President, all Americans would be better off. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is all well and good, but I'd like to first point out to you that this isn't the forum for your post.<br />
<br />
But let's look at a couple of things. First off Bush supplied the American media and the American public with some fairly specific lists of WMD that could be expected to be found in Iraq.  The intelligence even pointed to specific sites where they expected these weapons to be stored (does anyone else remember the aerial photos of Iraqi bunkers with large circles around them that were indicated as being WMD storage sites?)<br />
<br />
Yet when all is said and done all of these WMD have vanished into thin air.  American intelligence could locate them prior to the invasion, but once we have complete control of the country, no one knows where they are.  Could we have possibly allowed a complete arsenal of WMD slip off into the night without our intelligence community having some indication as to where they went, when they left, and who might have done it?  It strikes one as interesting that on the one hand we can locate them prior to the war with scientific certainty yet afterwards everything is 'muddled'.  What were our intelligence communities doing during the conflict if not trying to keep track of these so very important weapons?  This all seems very dubious given the satellite capabilities of U.S. intelligence, the arial photos that can be produced, let alone the humint (human intelligence) that could be tapped.   So when did our intelligence community go wrong, before or after the war?  Were the weapons there and they lost complete track of them, or were the weapons never there in significant quantities to begin with?  Which do we believe?  I don't believe anyone can dispute that they certainly haven't been found in sufficient quantities to justify a war, regardless of how vile Saddam may have in fact been.<br />
<br />
If we begin to use small quantities of WMD to justify invasions, there is a whole list of nations we need to start invading.  Many with leaders as repulsive as Saddam.  North Korea for example seems to be at the top of the list.  We know for a fact they have some nuclear capability.  We certainly believe they'd like nuclear weapons or may even be working on them as we speak.  The fact they have refused to allow U.N. monitoring of their nuclear plants speaks volumes.  They are believed to be a potential threat to the entire region.  But you notice that the U.S. Government, specifically the Bush administration, is very quiet on the use of force.  Morally and ethically the case is even more compelling than the one made for the Iraqi invasion, but silence is the word of the day.  It appears that morals and ethics aren't the only reasons for the Iraqi invasion, otherwise our morals and ethics would have us setting up for North Korea.  So if that is not the reason, what was?  Certainly the fact that George Bush Senior had a history with Saddam might have played a factor.  Sons do often feel the need to finish what their fathers started and didn't complete.  And certainly Iraq has a lot more oil than North Korea, which might be a consideration.  Freeing up that oil and making it available to world would do very interesting things to the world economy, wouldn't you think?  This might be something to think about.<br />
<br />
Lets talk sponsoring terrorisism.  Do you realize that one of the biggest sponsors of terrorisism has been believed to be Saudi Arabia?  Hmmm.   And many countries have allowed terrorist organizations to either hide or train within their borders?  Are we going to consider invading Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and various other middle Eastern countries that have at one time or another harbored international terrorists?  If so, we'd better be gearing up big time because if occupying Iraq is straining our resources to the figure of 3.9 billion a month, these other places are going to really break the bank.<br />
<br />
For some reason George Bush JR wanted to invade Iraq.  He did so even over the desires of the U.N.  His reasoning for doing so is somewhat weak and doesn't seem to hold up well to close examination.  And even the intelligence he based his actions on can't be confirmed several months after having completely occupied the country.  I don't know what was going on, I do know that as an American citizen I don't like it.  While I believe the U.S. military did a super job in executing the orders of their Commander in Chief, I have some serious questions about the reasoning why those orders were given in the first place and those questions have yet to be answered in an acceptable fashion.</div></div><hr />

Not really, since prices are set by OPEC regardless.<br />
<br />
In the end I'm sure that the war will cost us economically a lot more than it benefits us economically. Whether it was worth that cost is a matter of opinion.</div></div><hr />

Yup, OPEC sets the prices, and then the members cheat on the quotas.  They are in fact their own worst enemies.</div></div><hr />

Very nice summation of my general feelings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am very ambivalent on the whole topic.  No one is going to claim that Hussein was anything other than a 'bad' person, and a bad leader.  I do, whoever, dislike the way that the events leading up to the war where handled(the concept that 2 countries basically defied the UN, as we were claiming Hussein was, the apparent deceptions and misleading intelligence reports, etc.).  Overall right or wrong, I do not think I, or any of us, with limited information, is in a good position to judge.<br />
<br />
I do think however, and this most importantly, that this topic does not  belong here.  There are many forums out there with places to discuss world issues.  This is not one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1: What does Iraq possibly have in common with the war on terror, other than purely speculative statements?<br />
<br />
2: If it's ok to attack Iraq because they broke U.N. resolutions, then I think we should be getting bombed right now, because we broke a U.N. Resolution to attack them.<br />
<br />
Whole thing was inspired by Bush wanting to follow daddy's footsteps.  After Desert Storm, Bush Sr's ratings SOARED... I have seen absolutely no proof to contradict my feelings that Bush Jr did it for the same reason.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't try and label myself liberal or conservative: I think the conservatives are morally wrong in this matter, and I think the liberals are being quite cowardly in not jumping all over the fiasco and trashing G.W.'s reputation.  All in all, I think the whole thing was rather tragic, because here we are, sitting in Iraq, getting 1?  2?  3?  soldiers picked off daily.  Thats 3 americans that are dying every day because we don't have jack to do there, and they rejected democracy the last time it was attempted to be forced upon them.<br />
<br />
Saddam was a bad man.  He did bad things.  He broke U.N. resolutions.<br />
<br />
But we broke them too, and I am under the firm belief that we had saddam right where we wanted him; right under our thumbs, with the whole world staring STRAIGHT at him.  Just look at what he's done in the past 11 years... not all that impressive, I wonder why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep and to keep him under 'our' thumb, we made his people starve and bombed em everyso often causing more and more casualties (who's families aren't going to be too understanding) whilst Saddam sat pretty in his guilded palaces and milked the PR for all it was worth. The situation before this was totally Fked up anyway after the massive cop out that was the end of the Gulf War. If you think the status quo prior to this was anything but a dangerous mess then that just shows how little thought you give to the consequences of actions and the smugly insular thinking that characterised american policy prior to 9/11.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How was ridding Iraq of Saddam a good thing?<br />
<br />
Yes he was a dictator (but there are 100s of WORSE Dictators out there)... why isnt USA doing anything about all those african dictators?... i wonder..<br />
Why has USA IMPLEMENTED Pinochet as a dictator??.... yes USA created that dictator...<br />
but obviously, the war vs irak was to free the people and kill the dictator.. <br />
<br />
You know what's going to happen in Irak now don't you?<br />
<br />
the Chiit are 60% of the country's population. Now with Sadam gone, the country will become extreme Islam.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of people not being able to choose their Leader...<br />
they won't be able to choose their religion,<br />
their women will be forced to wear veils and will be lapidated to death for the smallest things...<br />
Sweet!! Thank you America for liberating the people from the evil hands of Sadam.<br />
<br />
Oooh, and btw, what did Saddam do that was bad? other then being a dictator.<br />
<br />
Ah yes, the war in Koweit... <br />
<br />
in case you didn't know, Koweit was taking Irak's petrol at the time. Which was a bit of a call for war...<br />
AND America seemed to have told Irak, that it was OK if they attacked Koweit, they would stay out of it...<br />
<br />
So Irak attacks, Americans promptly jump in to save the day and they find themselves with power of koweit and their oil..<br />
<br />
how nifty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Carlyle Group has long wanted a pipeline running from afghanistan to turkey.  There is untapped oil in certain areas of the middle east that can't be trucked or flown out, it has to be piped out.  Saddam was on board for a while but, when he decided he wanted more money and a bigger piece of the action to play ball, well, Regime Change!  <br />
<br />
Don't be so god damn naive.  Saddam was a ruthless dickhead way back when we were financially supporting him during their major hostilities with Iran.  But, he was on board.  <br />
<br />
Which company got the rights to handle environmental clean up of the iraqi oil fields to the tune of $489.3 million following the war without even submitting a bid for the work?  Hmm, Halliburton, wow Dick Cheney was CEO there before he became VP.  It also is the company that owns Brown and Root who, while heading up Bush SRs defense dept years ago he steered a $10 million dollar report to them and then awarded them a huge defense budget 5 year contract to assist the core of engineers.  Hmm, I wonder why they hired him after Bush Sr lost the election to run their company.<br />
<br />
Guys...these are just a few of the examples.  War makes money, and good money.  Our troops can't seem to get the electricity on in Baghdad but, Damn Straight! We took control of the oil fields first and it is business as usual.  The only difference is we have confiscated the wealth and told the Iraqis we are gonna continute to produce and export the oil while holding the money garnered to rebuild your country and offset some of our own expenses.  Hehe, yeah!<br />
<br />
The war in Iraq will cost more than it earns from oil etc.  But it will cost more to the american people as a whole, many individuals will get filthy ass rich, war is not a cost, it is a repositioning of wealth taking alot from the many and steering it towards the few.<br />
<br />
WAKE UP!<br />
<br />
There were no WMD.  The Iraq military was crippled after the Persian Gulf War.  The government used the left over momentum from 9/11 to get the american people to support a war in iraq that had more to do with gaining wealth and influence in the region than actually helping anyone.  You think we were there to help improve the situation for the Iraqi people?  HAHAHA LOLOL look at the current state of Afghanistan now?  <br />
<br />
One last point:  These are good reasons to go to War and all were used for Iraq...<br />
<br />
1) Humanitarian reasons - to liberate a people from oppression and help them<br />
2) Remove a ruthless dictator<br />
3) Stop a potential threat to the Uniterd States<br />
<br />
well, why the Fuck didnt we go into North Korea instead?  North Korea far overshadows Iraq in all three or those areas...ALL THREE !<br />
<br />
Got it yet?  There ain't no money to be made in North Korea.</div></div><hr />

OH, by the way,  ya know the current President of Afghanistan put into power by the United States is Harmid Karzai right?  Hmm, what did he do before the US took out the taliban for the sake or getting osama bin laden and ending terrorism?  LOL, he just HAPPENED to be a consultant for the company which was trying to run the pipeline through, Unocal.  Hmm, Bush was unable to negotiate and come to an agreement with the taliban on this matter and, well, it is fortunate for us they were involved with Bin Laden and Al Quaeda, now we could get them gone too and replace them with someone who would &quot;play ball&quot;.  That pipeline will only creat ethe 5th largest oil reserve in the world and be controlled by American interests.<br />
<br />
Don't be alarmed either at the Bin Ladens (Osama's wealthy Saudi family) who are members of the Carlyle Group and heavy investors, basically business partners with Bush, Cheney and those guys.  The Carlyle Group was at least smart enough to make them sell their stock and investments to avoid &quot;the appearance of impropriety&quot;.  See any of the above.

I expect the government people to use connections to make a bit of money.  They ALL do, republican or democrat.  No problem.  There should be perks of the job and lobbying benefits.  When done behind the scenes and in moderation, great, get blown by your secretary, secure a nice job for when you end your political career, vote for a cement plant and earn a fat political campaign contribution, etc.  This is ALL acceptable to me in moderation.  BUT, LIE to the american people and go to war while blatantly thumbing your nose at the inability or unwillingness of the American people to find out why or even care and, well, I'm out on that.<br />

I have no doubts about it, this war had one and only MAIN purpose which was to make money for select few. Probably not Bush directly but his associates for sure.<br />
<br />
Another thing what fucking right US has to impose democracy on Iraq. Sure Iraq was not a good place to live from my point of view, but its their culture and their country. They way I understand it a lot of Americans still think they have every right to go into other countries with thousands of years of history that maybe involved in answering the question why the country is the way it is and &quot;helping&quot; the people. The way I see it people of Iraq will not turn a blind eye on this and you will see more not less acts of terror directed to America. Pissing off Middle East was not a smart thing to do. People there have totaly different way of thinking which I certanly cant comprehend and neither can US administration and what they are doing their will and already has left scars on Iraqy people and you will see some kind of retrebution.</div></div><hr />

I'm rather numb to the whole thing.  I have a twisted context about the whole subject though.  I live around and work in New York City.  I work about 3 blocks from the world trade center site.  I walk by it every day on my way to work.  I was in the city on 9/11 and lost two friends who were attending the Waters Risk mgmt conference.  I saw live news feed of people dropping from 100 floors into the pavement.  I've had a friend who works in the federal building describe it to me.  Needless to say its still incomprehensible that it ever happened...until you see the incredibely large open spot where it used to be.<br />
<br />
All I can say is I am thoroughly disgusted by the misappropriation of this event to perpetuate still MORE violence (both parties...I find democrats such as Joe Lieberman equally accountable).  <br />
<br />
There are NO WMD, there is no link to Al-quaeda and the people of the United States are no safer now than before we invaded Iraq.  And just think now we get a major political convention taking place just before the 9/11 anniversary IN NEW YORK CITY(completely tasteless).  <br />

War is Hell. People die who don't deserve death. Others live who don't deserve to live. It's basically my view on it all ( and yeah it is quoted from somewhere you all know ).

Check out this platform quadmire:<br />
For example, how can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty?  (Republicans who argue that you cannot kill an unborn baby but can kill a criminal because their life is less valuable shows a lack of consistency to me.)  <br />
<br />
How can you be pro-abortion and anti-death penalty?  (Democrats who argue that it is simply a woman's body and she can decide what she wants to a fetus that is actually viable outside the womb given today's technology for the majority of abortions and how they can argue that it is better to let criminals get life in prison instead of the inhumanity of a death sentence... The fetus is a viable life in a majority of these cases, but these innocents may die while the guilty must be allowed to live.)<br />
<br />
That's why I argue people MUST be pro-life and anti-death penalty (protect life) or MUST be pro-choice and pro-death penalty (life and death is allowed to be determined by choice).  However, there is no party that has that platform that I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There are, or were WMD. They will or the proof they existed, will be discovered.<br />
<br />
My reading indicates that yes at one time Saddam had a fairly decent stockpile of WMD, mostly in the form of chemical weapons.  This was prior to the Gulf War though.  He used up at least some of these chemical weapons suppressing the various opposing groups in the north and the south.  Did he use most of them?  We have no way to know for sure.  Could he have had some remaining?  Certainly within the realm of plausibility.  Was he trying to create more and different WMD?  That is completely believeable.  Did he have a huge world threatening stockpile?  Well, the current evidence certainly doesn't support that.<br />
<br />
If after several months of having complete liberty to search the entire country from top to bottom, to question anyone and everyone who might possibly have been involved with any WMD programs or storage, and to come up basically empty, why should we believe that new information will suddenly come to light?<br />
<br />
Saddam's regime never struck anyone as being particularly sophisticated, I would wager.  To credit them with being able to secretly transport large amounts (we're talking tons here) of WMD without leaving a trace.  No satillite photos.  No aerial photos.  No eye witness accounts.  No factories that were obviously involved.  No paper trail.  Nothing.  Well that just seems a bit far fetched to me.  Possible?  Perhaps.  Likely?  Well, it doesn't seem like it to me.<br />
<br />
So on what do you base the belief that the evidence is there waiting to be found?  Have I missed something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i would like to point out there is proof that bush stole the election for anyone supporting his ill gotten presidecy.<br />
<br />
it has been found that his brother jeb bush, gov. of florida helped make a scrub list and interfer with close to 3,000 voters that were almost certanly going to vote democatic as the were poor/african/mexican <br />
<br />
these were voters who were misslabeled as felons when they had mistomeners, the &quot;scrub list&quot; was provided by DBT who had been asked to make the new lists for jeb bush's voter purge, also another 1,000 something voters were left out because they were felons in other states that restored the felon's rights after they did their time. now you may wonder whats wrong with this? well because of the federal law if you do your time in states that restore your citizinship after jail time your are allowd to retain your voting rights, even if you move to states that DO not restore them,<br />
<br />
worst of all is there innocent people had no idea they couldnt vote couldnt appel it as most were last min. voters and they had to wait 14 days for a appeal to get their rights back.<br />
<br />
the election in florida went to bush by less than 2,000 votes, i can see why he made sure his brother made a new list.<br />
<br />
this is why i dont support bush or anything he does, its because he is doing it on a stolen presidency and also is using &quot;homeland security&quot; to land his campain finace friends some easy money, such as DBT and also the partriot tank that was found to be usless in shooting down missles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Like I posted earlier, I am independent.  I am not GOP or Democrat.  However, Gerick's post shows just one side of the possible problems with the Florida voting.  <br />
<br />
I am in government and accordingly am very interested in fair voting processes.  The Democrats had many misdeeds in Florida as well.  They also did some horrible things in Chicago, Wisconsin, South Dakota and New Mexico.  Any of those states could have further swung the electoral college to Bush, but since Florida was the most electoral votes, the GOP focused their efforts there.<br />
<br />
This doesn't even begin to look at how our military people were treated in the election.<br />
<br />
As a non-member of any political party, from my point-of-view, Bush should have won even more electoral votes.  However, Gore definitely would have won the popular vote no matter how you look at it.  Bush won a greater percentage of votes than Clinton did in either of his presidential elections.<br />
<br />
When it comes right down to it, the GOP, the Democrats, they are both power hungry money wasters more interested in re-election than sound leadership.<br />
<br />
The Democrats are weakening, the GOP isn't leading well, and we need a viable third party that reflects the views of young, multi-ethnic, hard working Americans.</div></div><hr />

I did beleive that Sadam had them. In fact, his army, technically was the most experianced in using. Both in the Iran Iraq war and on the Kurds. <br />
<br />
I aslo beleive that Sadam presented no risk to the United States and this entire affiar was a matter of personel honor (between Bush Sr though Jr) and money. <br />
<br />
I find the US's lack of will to make things right in both Afganistan and Iraq reprehencable. I also beleive that a commitment like this is for a generation or more--and our leaders seem to be too blind to see it. <br />
<br />
We are willing to topple goverments--for any number of reason. However we are not willing to look that the responcibilites that thrusts upon us--we are not even willing to send a big enough force to Afganistan so that it has a better police presence after our invasion than under the Taliban. <br />
<br />
If we want to be the Boy Scouts of the world (a position that I am not wholely uncomfortable with) then we damned well better see the lady all the way across the friggin street.<br />

Again, in Iraq we seemed to have expected the indiginous population to evaporate for all the planning we had in place for food, water and electrisity.

The people behind the scenes, in the intelligence field, give Bush what they have to to get him to do what they think needs to be done.  I believe they had good reasons for it, for the people there are people who are like my grandfather (who also was once one of them).

<br />
If I am pro-death penalty and pro-life I am inconsistent?  Hypocritical?  Hmm, I don't think so and here is why and my thinking.<br />
<br />
A fetus is innocent (not to mention helpless).  Someone on death row for the rape/murder of three women is not.  I have no problem justifying these two positions.<br />
<br />
<br />
--There are no WMD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Buun I am the oppiset<br />
<br />
I anti death penelty: our system is based on the idea that is better to let 99 guilty go free than punish 1 innocent man. Given that IL found that 50% of the men on death row were innocent, you can't say we are punishing the guilty. The poor maybe... Given that there is no restituion possible for taking someone's life, just on the practical basis of not killing innocent civilians I rather see life in prison.<br />
<br />
I would rather see abortion then the results of cronic negelect, resentment, poverty. There are already more minority babies than families looking to adopt them. If you are going to force a woman to have a child, you have a huge responcibilty to that child then.<br />
<br />
Though you have led me to an intersting thought: how long as abortion been practiced? I would suspect that it predates agriculture, myself, but I have no basis for that feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Bah!  Darn you Buun.  You are dragging it our of me.<br />
<br />
I am Anti-Death Penalty and Pro-Life ethically, but not legally.<br />
<br />
I don't believe that individuals have the right to kill another individual except in self-defense or defense of another (directly).  I believe that war is justifiable and that groups can kill other groups (I know, they are made up of individuals).<br />
<br />
I don't believe that abortion is the best solution to the &quot;problem&quot; of pregnancy.  Science has made it so that extremely premature babies can exist outside the womb and survive.  I think it is wrong to have an abortion.  However, I think that if the government makes abortion illegal, the means of obtaining an abortion will be brutal, still sought, and dangerous for the mother.  So while I disagree with it, I do not want to see it made illegal. (Personally, I think this is the ultimate in being Pro-Choice, but my Pro-Choice friends disagree.)</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry for your loss.  It is frustrating to lose people when there is clear reason why it had to happen.<br />
<br />
Side point: regarding &quot;looting and going nuts&quot;.  In 1967 there was a power failure that knocked pretty much the entire eastern seaboard off the grid.  The amount of looting &amp; violence that broke out in THE UNITED STATES was rather astonishing (there are other examples to be drawn from hurricane and natural disasters but this is probably the best analogy).<br />
<br />
My point: we sit in the luxury of a state of hyper order in the US and tend to look down our noses when other states fall into anarchy.  It is a mistake to believe we are &quot;better&quot; than them...we are merely more fortunate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Somewhat, but not completely true.  We, as a nation, have struggled to establish this luxury.  We struggle regularly to maintain it.  We spend huge amounts of tax dollars on a yearly basis to keep it going.  A significant portion of our productivity goes towards it's maintenance.  People die for it.  It isn't something we just 'lucked' into.  However, we are very fortunate to have our efforts pay off in the way they have.<br />
<br />
I don't think this luxury is beyond the ability of other nations who don't currently have it.  However, they're going to have to want it and they're going to have to pay for it, no one can just hand it to them.  Part of that payment will come in the expenditure of their own blood, because someone somewhere at some point is going to have to be willing to die to establish it and then others are going to have to be willing to die to maintain it.<br />
<br />
We may not be better than they are, but we have paid our dues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Somewhat, but not completely true <br />
<br />
We have a splendid structure (sometimes too much structure) and I'm no knocking any of our military, police officers, fire men, post office folks, hell even tax collectors that are a part of it. It is a stupendous achievement that we have the system we do that allows order and a measure of individual choice.  <br />
<br />
My point was not we &quot;lucked into anything&quot;.  Its that we need to keep a measure of humility regarding ourselves; we are not intrinsically better than any other people....it takes work to keep it all intact.  <br />
<br />
I think what I meant by luxury was that a number of folks don't realize that this structure is not automatic and that without it we devolve to be just like any other nation.  <br />
<br />
What I meant about fortunate was that the majority of us all were born into this system (nothing other than good luck)...and collectively paying our dues as a country over 200+ years means nothing if we don't keep doing it in a responsible way.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, however one man actively evading discovery is far different from an extensive infrastructure, storage facilities, and multiple tons of final product.

I would think so, there would have to be traces and signs of them all over the place even if the actual weapons had been successfully removed without detection, which is pretty hard to believe.  At the very least, someone had to be working at the factories.  Someone had to be guarding the storage facilities.  Someone had to be working at the various labratories.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">IF it can be shown (as seems to be ocurring) that the current US administration cherry picked intelligence and carefully worded their arguments to avoid outright falsehood while maximizing  emotional impact and exagerating the immediacy of the threat, no country on Earth will listen to them again. Every time Bush or Chenney speak a sign will light up on their forehead.<br />
<br />
Not having most of our allies and the UN refuse to support the War on Iraq was infuriating, but now it appears pretty obvious why they didn't sign on - whoops!<br />
<br />
The argument that Saddam was a bad guy and needed to go is a pleasant fiction. Where was the US when Idi Amin and the Khmer Rouge were mass murdering. For that matter, where was the right-wing when FDR was trying to preserve Great Brittan as the last light of hope in a Europe overrun by Hitler?<br />
<br />
At best, US foreign policy understood Iraq to be unfinished business with the potential of being a serious threat. With their military decimated by the previous war (and I mean decimated - they weren't even a regional power any more) no time was better than the present for their unconditional surrender and occupation for 20 years (in post-WWII Berlin the OSS and Russian assassination squads, Nuremberg trials, and a twenty year occupation etc. insured Nazism would not reemerge).<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was a warning shot across the bow of Middle Eastern nationalism or even anti-Western Islamic fundamentalism. Maybe the national pyche needed to pay-back somebody, anybody, for September 11.<br />
<br />
Whatever the reason, it wasn't the removal of a regime that was an imminent worldwide threat because of their massive stockpiles of WMD's or a humanitarian action. We (I'm a US citizen) are neither that stupid or that kind.<br />

Only a week or so before the hammer came down the iraqi's themselves made a gambit to put off invasion by 'showing willing' with the destruction of an amount of VX gas canisters. Therefore there was at least some biological warfare agents in that country.<br />
<br />
Also biological weaponry is very easy to produce with a minimum amount of very basic laboratory equipment it's one of the most scary things about this technology. Storing enough to be a threat on a conventional battlefield would be very difficult, but production wouldn't require massive or obvious resources.<br />

The current situation is pretty messed up. So to was the situation prior to the attack. Sanctions against Saddam kept his people in poverty whilst the iraqi regime skimmed off large amounts of the humanitarian aid cash gained from 'UN regulated' sales of oil and used it to maintain his stranglehold, to keep a lid on him military forces were in operation to 'suppress' threatening moves (no doubt causing more deaths that the people of the country were unlikely to be philosophical about, and outrage at the high and mighty west for what it was doing to their fellow arabs around the mid-east. The situation was untenable, it's a shame that the way Bush, Blair and co. chose to resolve it was so shot through with corruption and idiocy.</div></div><hr />

Actually, biological and chemical warfare are the poor man's nuke. They allow countries currently incapable of producing nuclear weapons of still pretending they are a &quot;power not to be trifled with&quot;.<br />
<br />
Several countries have nuclear weapons that we don't concider a threat - Isreal, India, and Pakastan for example. The reason is that such weapons are of necessity weapons of last resort. Your cotry is losing a war and about to be overrun and its payback time.<br />
<br />
If any event would cause Iraq to use it's WMD arsenal if it had one, it was invasion (according to our own intelligence analysis). The fact that they didn't use them either shows how reluctant they really were even with their backs to the wall or the fact that they didn't after all and as they had claimed for several months currently possess them.<br />

Storing enough to be a threat on a conventional battlefield would be very difficult to hide.<br />

Thanks for the correction on the VX thing.</div></div><hr />

What I believe is that a significant portion of the U.S. intelligence machine was in all likelihood focused on monitoring the movement of any substantial amount of material potentially involved with WMD within Iraq prior to and during the war.  I do not believe that, given the shear volume of weapons claimed to exist by the Bush Administration, it was possible for the Iraqi government to make it all disappear without leaving a trace and without the U.S. intelligence community having detected at least a portion of the operation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I love when people leave out parts they dont like. It was not just american intell it was the whole dam worlds intell. Even the French belived they had it, and the fact that it has not been found does not mean its not there. We didnt know he had planes buried in the desert but there they are. They had years to hide the WMD after the first inspectors left. Do you really believe that he got rid of his WMD? I don't believe you do, this is just a way for you to bash Bush. As far a volume even if you believe there was enough to fill a wearhouse or even many waerhouses we are talking about a country that has 160000 sq miles. Our intelligence is not good enough to track every truck that leaves every wearhouse in the country. If it is buried in the deep desert we may never find it and guess what I don't care if we ever do  the threat has been reduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">No, it wasn't the whole world's intell.  The French didn't publish a shopping list of what Iraq was believed to have including 8X10 color glossy photographs with circles and arrows of places believed to be storage sites of WMD in order to convince the American public and the world that the invasion was righteous.<br />
<br />
As far as we not knowing that he had planes buried in the desert, so what?  We weren't focused on planes.  We weren't worried about planes.  We weren't invading over planes.   If you mean to tell me that in fact we were so concerned about the WMDs Iraq had that we had to invade, but weren't concerned enough to monitor where they were and where they went with all of our resources, then all I can say to you is huh?  That makes no sense.<br />
<br />
Our intelligence isn't good enough to track every truck within a country.  But it is good enough to monitor specific sites.  And the volume of material that was supposedly involved was huge.  You don't move that amount of material in a truck or two.  It takes a convoy.  Probably a number of convoys over a period of days.<br />
<br />
I've been in the U.S. military.  I've actually monitored the communications of hostile countries as my job while in the U.S. military for 4 years.  I had some access to the kind of information our intelligence community can aquire.  You can't convince me that the size of operation the Iraqis would have had to undertake to move all these WMD that we claimed they had and we could pinpoint storage sites for could have gotten by us without leaving a trace.  It's completely unbelieveable, based on my knowledge of how these things work.<br />
<br />
So, that leaves a number of possibilities.  It could be that the specifics of the situation prior to the war were blown out of proportion based on low quality intelligence.   If this is the case then either the intelligence community deceived the adminstration as to how high of quality the intelligence was or the adminstration chose to ignore its poor quality.  Either way, you have to question what happened.  It could be that the intelligence community completely dropped the ball on monitoring the storage sites before and during the war.  Which is pretty hard to understand or believe.  And would leave their credibility under deep suspicion.  And the final option, the one you seem to find most credible, the Iraqi government, well known for being pretty blundering, managed to pull a fast one on the U.S. intelligence community and spirit tons upon tons of WMD off into the desert like smoke in the night.  Which also would leave the U.S. intelligence community looking kind of foolish.<br />
<br />
Any way you look at it, something just isn't right.  Someone somewhere screwed up.  The only question left is who and when.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>dandaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I am sorry but the French did say they believed Iraq had WMD did they give a shoping list as you put it no but they did not disagree that Iraq had them. As to the planes being buried in the desert If you think that the CIA or military intelligence would not want to know where threats to our military were then its know wonder we cant find WMD.<br />
<br />
A convoy yep if you don't want to hide it thats how you move it but if you do want to hide it you move it one truck at a time you do it during normal hours of operation so you don't draw attention You move it in cars in buses by cammel if you have to rember they had years to hide it. As to pinpointing storage sites if you don't want to hide it you put it in conventional storage sites if you do want to hide it you bury it in peoples back yards you bury it the deep desert. <br />
<br />
Since you choose to use your knowledge of the military in this post Ill use my knowledge of Transportation and Warehouseing Ive been the this industry for 20 years. You seem to think there is some huge amount of material, not as much as you might think I can get 24 to 28 pallets on a truck if i double stack thats 48 to 56 pallets. Now each pallet will hold 4 55 gal drums so thats 192 to 224  55 gal drums per truck or 10780 to 12320 gals per truck. Like I said not as much as you might think.<br />
<br />
I never said the Iraqi government blundered at all as a matter of fact they seemed to be pretty smart. They kept the world at bay for years. As to the intelligence community looking foolish once again I say he had years to hide this stuff it did not all have to be moved at one time. Did the intelligence community make a mistake perhaps but you seem to lean toward some conspiracy theroy where the US and UK lied to the world to justify war. I simply do not believe that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">And if all we are talking are things that can be safely stored in 55 gallon drums, you might have a point.  So what happens if a 55 gallon drum of sarin gas tumbles off the back of a truck and leaks?  And what about the equipment used to make all these things, they had to move that too, right?<br />
<br />
And as far as having years to hide the stuff, the reports we based our invasion on said that he was supposed to have the stuff at specific sites.  Not in some hole in the desert.  It's here, here and here, so they claimed.  Pinpointing the exact locations.  So he had at most a few weeks to move the stuff from those sites to someplace else.<br />
<br />
You give the Iraqi government far more credit then they are due.  They've shown themselves to be canny but not clever.  They have a survival instinct second to none, but they haven't shown themselves to be very intelligent.  If they were really intelligent, they'd have allowed the inspectors in, let them inspect to their hearts content, particularly since, if as you claim, they had already had years to hide the stuff.  Lulled the world into a false sense of security with their openess and willingness to be forthcoming, and then when everyone's attention was focused elsewhere, restarted their WMD program.  <br />

Actually if we're talking personal beliefs, I'll give you my personal belief.  I believe that President Bush had his own reasons for wanting to invade Iraq and they weren't based primarily on Iraq's WMD.  He used every tool at his disposal to justify an invasion that he wanted to have happen and WMDs just happened to be the best leverage.  I don't think the U.S. intelligence community screwed up, I think the Bush administration did because they let politics and their desire to achieve a goal interfere with a cold evaluation of the facts.<br />
<br />
But that's my personal belief and so far the evidence supports a number of possibilities of which this is only one.</div></div><hr />
