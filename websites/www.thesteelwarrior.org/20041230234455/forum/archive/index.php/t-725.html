<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kumek</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am main tank for my guild and am trying to get upgraded so we can make some runs on some bigger mobs and such. Wondering what would be my best bet for upgrades. Will note that I have Crimson Darkscale BP, Legs, Arms, Boots, Mask, and Bracers on the way when the smith gets back from vacation. I feel that my weapons will be my biggest lacking point after that. Any suggestions aas to what I should go after weapons or otherwise?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">get a VBoY (12/21 effect ykesha) or sarnak warhammer (9/20 effect stun) and you should be set. with those new upgrades your gear is extremely good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear is looking pretty good. Id ditch the lodizal shield at some stage in the future for something with decent hps. Frosty will serve you still, but not sure what snowchipper is like for aggro. <br />
<br />
you should also look for hp items for your neck and mask. with the new upgrades you have comiing you should get a decent hp boost from those as well. <br />
<br />
i also didnt see a 2hander in your profile. theres quite a few out there which will help your DPS and maintain solid aggro, so maybe you want to consider getting one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mask from AC is rather nice, Grimling Contraption and doable with a single group (its in the former inner Acrylia area and we had a few drop while camping shards for VT key).<br />
I'd replace shrouded medaillon for a clattering bone necklace and keep medaillon for resist set.<br />
Cloak of the Maelstrom for back and keep lodizal for resists.<br />
Frostbringer served me well even into the Halls of Testing/West ToV/NToV days until i got a willsapper.<br />
Your offhand is pure dps (frostcall is a cold based dd) so you should be fine for now unless you want to spent major pp or<br />
get an upgrade on a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaderock Amulet<br />
Gantru Warmask<br />
Earring of Endless Speed (change belt to Heavy Rubicite)<br />
Hierophant's Cloak (if you can wear it)<br />

BB<br />
Battleblade Burlydorf</div></div><hr />

Now to see what I can put together over the next week or so while I wait for the smith to return.</div></div><hr />

Get a greatstaff of thunder. Unless you can get EB or an SoD, you will not find a better agro weapon. Planar stun is flat uber.</div></div><hr />
