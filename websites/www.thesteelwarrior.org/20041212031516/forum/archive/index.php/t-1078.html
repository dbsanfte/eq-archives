<br />
I am new to this site, as far as posting, but have been reading it for while, and would ask some advice of you Warlords.<br />
<br />
I recently made a warrior (Tired of playing a cleric). He is a barbarian, and just made level 6. I had talked to a guildmate who played one and he suggested getting weapons with low delay, and low damage to work my melee skills up. The theory being, I would hit a lot, but for little damage, thus getting a lot of skill checks.<br />
<br />
So far havent seen many on weapons, but Offense skill is staying maxed. The problem is my Defense skill is only at 4, and I cant figure out why it isnt going up.<br />
<br />
I have a Iskar chestplate on him that gives regen, so I found a white mob, and just sat there and let him pound me for about 20 minutes, but never saw a increase.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong? Or does it take a while for this to raise? Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />

Also, if you're really low level, like under 10 or so, leveling is so easy now it's almost broken, (old school eq'er here, took forever to get to 20 back in the day) so it may take a while to get your skills to catch up to your level.  If you still have a problem after about level 10, strip off the high end gear, put on some banded, and go to the lowbie zone of your choice and get pounded on by a bunch of dark blue mobs.  <br />
On a side note, for quick weapons, gnoll hide lariats are the most fun weapons in the game for the level they can be attained and the level they proc.   3/20, proc stun, dual wielding them you wont do crap for damage, but with these and haste you are a casting mob's worst nightmare and you WILL have aggro. Used them in Dalnir against the healers there at lvl 30ish, between them and slam the healers were screwed. :)<br />

It takes a while to learn new skills with such a low int.  When the levels start coming slower you'l chatch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read somewhere that the higher DEX, the faster you learn defensive skills (I.E. defense and weapon skills) and the higher AGI, the faster you learn offensive skills (I.E. offense, dodge, riposte, etc.). Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stats that influence skill gains for various abilities:<br />
<br />
Str = Offense gains (damage shield hits also raise this)<br />
Dex = Weapon skill gains<br />
Agi = Defense gains<br />
<br />
Some say int has an influence over this as well, but i'm of mind it only applies to non combat skill sets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Defense always took a while for me to max, and my agi isnt too bad as a Halfling.<br />
<br />
Levelled 56 today, was in a raid for at least 3h getting beated on constantly (MT) and I got 2 skill ups (235 -&gt; 237)<br />
<br />
On the other hand Offense and weapon skills maxes faster</div></div><hr />
