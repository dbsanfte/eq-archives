<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, first of all great board and hello! This is my first post, but had many as EQ_Warlord on Everlore. I know and respect Rodney (who posts here and Everlore), but don't like that Paladin (blech) moderator on Everlore unfortunately from Tunare also....<br />
<br />
I need a great plat making zone with great exp. I have hunted these (pay attention you younglings).<br />
<br />
Spectres in Feerrott--level 42-48 at 48th exp drops off (approx 200-400pp an hour)<br />
<br />
Burning Woods Giant fort--level 48-51 exp hasn't dropped off yet but the 55th Shaman gets horrid exp (aprox 200-500pp an hour)<br />
<br />
My question, where next? I two box a Shaman, level 55, not so hot equipment (about 235 wisdom unbuffed but not a lot of extra mana),  but the Warrior is at 1200AC aprox 3700 Unbuffed hps, Dragonrib Club and Copper hammer of Striking, 41% haste item (Yelinak's talisman)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also look into LDoN, you can level and get decent cash at  t he same time.</div></div><hr />

I hope trolls don't abound here, or worse Paladins like Everlore, were the Warrior board has everything except Warriors posting.<br />
<br />
Seb is a good idea, maybe it is no longer camped to death. A friend's cleric wants to head there, and though she is level 42, would make it easier. I know a 51 Monk that may also be interested. I will post how it goes.</div></div><hr />

There's a lot of nameds now that are easily taken with slow, cash drops are seb-like, and you can stay till 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both Seb and Chardok are good advice, but not because of the plat drops. Right now, plat is not worth camping, it has been devalued so much by the macrofags that anything worth buying (other than GSoT) is way over priced. I would recommend hunting for drops - they are far more valuable right now. LDoN for smithing temper ingredients, Sebilis for loot, Chardok for loot, and PoI for tinkering parts are all good sources of income.</div></div><hr />

Mobs range high 40s to mid 50s depending which section you choose.  Soloing there on my bst alt in high 50s, I could get 1-1.5k pure plat per hour.  Duoing you'd yield a little more.  With drops, you can make another few grand depending on what you get to drop.</div></div><hr />

Trolls, hmmm, dunno, paladins maybe, shikarii makes us be nice to stuff.<br />

No way that would even attract a trolls attention.<br />

Now down to answerness.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It probably wont be camped to death, especially since it got hit with the nerf bat. Apparently from what i've read, pyra was one of the hot spots plat companys were parking zombies. Sony finally took notice and hit the drop rate on gems bad.<br />
<br />
Money, AND exp at 55, no, pick one or the other. Get high enough to do BoT and roll on gravy patterns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basement in Plane of Justice is still really good cash, fast respawn, exp isn't tragic, and can make money in a hurry there.  Went down there after helpin a friend with PoJ trials to talk to mavuin, and picked up over 1000 pp for the group in one run through; not bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">12-11-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt;Seb was a disaster, Ranger 51, Warrior 51 (me), Cleric 43, Shaman 55(me). Ranger no snare one time (bad, bad ranger). Nasty train, because some dingy (trying to close quarter kite in Seb???) Druid had a train crossing past also. Couldn't kill fast enough, ranger using wurmslayer (ouch) and no crowd control, or crack.<br />
&gt;Giant fort, 2000pp in less than 4 hours, warrior handled 2 Ancients and 2 adds easily. Just Shaman(with 4hr KEI, never below 40m) and Warrior there. Better exp, better plat,  plus running room.<br />
&gt;Thanks for idea of basement in PoJ! Did that turning in after trials also, nice pp and decent exp with a 61 warrior, should be awesome at my level. We had a solid group of 5 (I main tanked with my 61 Warrior) and were filling spot #6 with guildies to get everyone flagged long ago. <br />
&gt;Made 52 (war), 56 (shaman), 44 (friends cleric) and maybe will teach Ranger to always snare, and find him some better weapons. <br />
&gt;I have leveled 46-52 in just over a week, and made about 7500pp. No PLing, but I have played a Warrior to level 61 already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I truly think the name should be changed from Veksar to &quot;farmville&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/nod<br />
<br />
if you get real lucky you can get the shops and farm the soulscream belt since you have better haste.. thats ~30K plat right there.<br />
Even gobs at the entrance drop nice plat and weapons that sell ~5pp ea or traded in in LIO for exp.<br />
Veskar is a great zone..<br />
exp, plat and decent loot that not to tough to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peorth12</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly, im going to vote Ebay/PA as well.  Granted its against the EULA there is almost nothing that can be done to stop it.  In addition, plat is dirt cheap right now.  I know some ppl who bough hundreds of thousands of plat to twink their alts.<br />
<br />
When considering the amount of plat vs. time, can't really beat Ebay/PA.<br />
<br />
Of course, if u want to do it legit (i do it legit :)) Sol A, Veskar, and oddly enough BoT are good (if u are flagged).  In BoT u wont be duoing, but groups are pretty easy to get there, and lots of drops.<br />
<br />
If u are flagged for Sol Ro Tower, and PoEarth, good money to be made there too in the form of drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish the ebayers would burn in hell, not buying plat, I rather put the time in and not reward the cheaters.</div></div><hr />

besides that...ice giants in EF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pass me what you're smoking please.  LDoN runs are generally more than 30 minutes (PLUS the time to organize, buff, get decent mission...) 60-90 minutes in a nonuber pickup group just for the dungeon.  If he had uber gear it probably wouldn't that big a money issue, and if he could get reg groups, he probably wouldn't ask for duo advice.  250pp is an average split NOT a minimum.  I've seen 50pp splits and I've seen 400pp splits.  Both times I was MLing.  Exp runs from shitty to decent depending on what level you are (it tends to be better for time to the low end).  Augs? Yes, rarely you'll get to fight the melees for the sole str/sta/agi/dex/hp aug.  Sometimes, you get zero augs in 3 runs or 4 cha augs in 1 run.  Drops? You mean like the Glacierbone Hammer (20/22,1hb,Pal/Sk only, drops in level 63 ef normal)?  It sells in the bazaar off traders for 9pp.</div></div><hr />
