<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kickbutt</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a 54 Warrior and since the patch yesterday will have to wait on my epic.  I currently have in my weapon inventory a wavecasher, snowchipper and a gavel of justice.  No matter what combine nation I use I'm unable to hold aggro, and when a 47 warrior out aggros me there is something wrong.<br />
<br />
So is there another weapon I should be look at to add to my arsonal?<br />
<br />
Please help this frustrated warrior.<br />

You are gtting the point where 21% haste is going to really make life rough for you agro wise no matter what weapon you use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If youre just looking for a weapon solution to the aggro problem, you may want to think about selling the gavel and snowchipper and get a Frostbringer, or save up a bit of cash, sell all 3 and get ya a Windblade.<br />
<br />
Upgraded haste would also be a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kilamthorngage</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Windblade != aggro!!! Please don't waste hard earned cash on a windblade for aggro. It is a pure DPS weapon.  If you're going to spend that kind of cash, buy a Sebilisan Berzerker Cloak for haste.<br />
<br />
If you want another aggro weapon, buy a frostbringer and equip it offhand. <br />
<br />
If you do get a better haste item, you can replace the neck with a clattering bone necklace. You also might want to think about ditching the Lodizal shell boots and the IGS. You can sell the IGS for ~6k and buy something from the dragonwing mantle line (the ones that drop from the WW dragons).<br />
<br />
Also think about getting STA boosting items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the windblade is pretty good agro from DPS alone.  It's not perfect, but it's not too shabby.  I tanked many an xp group with it and didn't lose agro.  Shoot, one time a group thought I was a paladin I could hold agro so well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Raun, what stuns are you using&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh...kick&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow, I didn't know paladins got kick!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a long, long time, from the low-50s to 62, my main aggro set was a Frosty main hand and Longsword of Freedom off Tawro.  Although I did use a Tae Ew War Maul to good effect as well in the mid-50s.  For haste I had FBSS and later upgraded to Shadowed Assassin Sash.<br />
<br />
If you can afford either Greatstaff of Thunder or War Marshal's Bladed Staff, either is good (although I think you may be too low for GoT just yet).  GoT is a great aggro weapon.  WMBS is good for dps, at least as good as Windblade and far cheaper as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do you have to wait on your epic?<br />
<br />
Surely not because of the Hate Revamp.<br />
<br />
Go to new hate, check it out. I'm pretty sure you don't have to kill NEW Maestro to get your hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find yourself a Greatstaff of Thunder. Outside of a BoC (yup, I would equip this over a SoD), the best tradeable agro weapon you can buy. While not quite the DPS of a Windblade or a bladed staff, still better than the majority of the 1h combos out there and way better agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you wanna get some haste and a good fall back combo while your selling, im using my frostbringer mainhand, black blade of tormenting offhand and im doing great with that combo, and if you had to sell the frostbringer for some reason Prateor's blade of debility should be open to you, since your a vah shir, and just get some haste<br />
<br />
though i cant believe the WC isnt working for you, i dont want one now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the 47 warrior is pressing the taunt key then ofcourse he will be able to take agro off you... for 6 seconds or so till you can taunt it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually one second. unless taunt is already used.<br />
<br />
whats PC on Greatstaff on your guyses/gals servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fekkonu</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just bought a greatstaff last week for 32k on CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam3</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">got mine for 9k on Karana, but current price is between 15-20k :p<br />
I was lucky to find a 65 war who need money quickly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've recently seen Greatstaff's on Errollsi Marr for 30 to 40...but I've only seen a few in the last month and they were never up for long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can probably sell the snowchipper and pick up a Frostbringer with that money.  The proc on the snowchipper generates little aggro aside from the damage.  Frostbringer's proc is excellent for aggro, and it has a decent ratio as well, and any more they are pretty cheap to obtain.  I still use mine at 61 when I feel the need to bag my windblade.</div></div><hr />
