<br />
March 25th, 2004 <br />
-------------------------- <br />
<br />
Headlines <br />
-------------------------- <br />
<br />
-Refining some DX9 functionality. <br />
<br />
-Some adjustments have been made to pets. <br />
<br />
-Some general bug fixes. <br />
<br />
-Added a new rogue discipline line, Assassins Strike. The tomes can be found in the East Commonlands and the Plane of Knowledge. <br />
<br />
<br />
DirectX 9 <br />
-------------------------- <br />
-The center of collision for all players <br />
-We have made improvements to position processing which should alleviate some of the problems related to getting stuck in geometry. <br />
-Improved collision and movement when near overhangs. <br />
-The auto-duck mechanism is now an user-enabled option. It can be set in the General tab of the options window. This feature forces your character to duck automatically to get into small places. If set to off, you will need to manually duck to enter those places. It is &quot;on&quot; by default. <br />
-Warping of very small NPCs (e.g., giant rats in Qeynos) has been resolved. <br />
-Rain now has visible weather. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets <br />
-------------------------- <br />
60+ player pets have been improved in a number of ways. Most notably, the effects of pet foci will be more dramatic as a player progresses with more powerful equipment. There have also been a number of inconsistencies between different tiers of pet foci that have been fixed. All of the existing foci should never show a power decrease in any aspect when upgrading from a lower tier foci to a higher tier foci. The most dramatic changes in pet stats are in the following aspects: <br />
<br />
Level - Most tiers of Foci will add one level to the pet. <br />
Max HP - Most tiers of foci will add max hit points to the pet, some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items. <br />
Mitigation (AC, Agility) -- Most tiers of foci will add mitigation to the pet. Some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items. <br />
Damage Output - Generally the pets did not receive a significant change in their damage output, although there are certain pets that have had their max hit and offense increased. <br />
<br />
Overall, the player pets have received a significant boost. There are instances where you will see no change in a specific aspect of a specific pet. For example, the Rathe’’s Son pet summoned with Minion of Eternity has not received an improvement in max hit points, but it has received a significant mitigation improvement. <br />
<br />
These changes affect the pets summoned by the following spells: <br />
<br />
Ward of Xegony <br />
Child of Ro <br />
Servant of Marr <br />
Rathe’s Son <br />
Legacy of Zek <br />
Saryrn’s Companion <br />
Child of Bertoxxulous <br />
Spirit of Sorsha <br />
Spirit of Arag <br />
<br />
The most profound changes were made to the magician pets as they were most in need of improvement to maintain class balance. Beastlord and necromancer pets also received upgrades, but not of the same magnitude. <br />
<br />
-- The EverQuest Team <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, what the hell? They havent finished melee balancing part 2, and they're improving caster pets now?!? Apparantly mages are now &quot;most in need of improvement to maintain class balance.&quot; Welcome back to CasterQuest. And here I was thinking we might be making some progress with the peeps at soe. hah. hah. Oh and props to rogues for the discs, they waited long enough. Still, bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They broke pets in the last patch so 1. they fixed them and 2. they added the upgrade they've been working on for a while. I'm pretty sure they have different groups of devs working on different classes.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if melee is THAT broken then how come everything has been killed in the game (other than the cragbeast queen)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What melee upgrade part 2? the way the last big patch read, that was it... +endurance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2nd what Payne said. I also believe they have different teams/people working on melee and caster balance. Nothing to bitch about here. It seems to have been indicated that they are still working on phase 2 of the melee balancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell.<br />
In GoD were the ONLY tank.<br />
Paladins on the PoN board are not to keen about us.<br />

Asking for more when were looked at as the new superior tank is kinda well.. Greedy.</div></div><hr />

It's a conspiracy to bring down teh warrior class starting out the farthest reaches....<br />

Just like when the Goa'uld  come to take over our solar system, they're gonna start  at pluto, and work their way to us!!<br />
<br />
HOLY CRAP!! RUN FOR THE HILLS OMG!<br />

<br />
....<br />
<br />
Dude, chill..... on top of the fact that imo war class is pretty even now,  they have SAID they are bringing melee part 2 to the table soon.  <br />
<br />
Just sit back, and chill for a few weeks man.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Casters need upgrades about as much as bards do. :mad: This is just more BS.  It's been Casterquest since PoP basically doubled the power of caster spells without giving meleers a similarly huge boost.  That's part of what the meleer changes are supposed to help correct.  I'll reserve judgment until part 2 is done, but it's sure been a long time.  And how do they expect to redress the problem of overpowering casters relative to meleers in PoP when they're just going around giving casters even MORE upgrades?  Every year it seems there's another &quot;caster balancing&quot; phase that isn't really balancing.  It's upgrades.  No wonder people complain that the game gets made too trivial.  <br />
<br />
Next thing you know they'll make charm even more powerful... :p</div></div><hr />

Guess you didn't hear?  Assassin's Strike is completely broken/useless.  It's one Tome they gave us, and I wish they hadn't bothered. No rogue at any level with any equipment is ever going to use this in its current state, never (and no I'm not exaggerating).</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see more of them start playing again. They do good DPS while providing utility. They can make an OK group kick ass when played well.</div></div><hr />

i also recall them saying that there is a large gap between melee damage and spell damage( i thought they ment players melee, not FUCKING PETS melee damage, i mean come on sony!) <br />
<br />
they say alot of shit that just float away as vapor, i dont think we need much more than something to use all that endurance with, something like zerker skills (like the rogues got, i think)<br />
<br />
here is the thing, has any caster REALLY needed new spells, focus effects, and all this other bullshit? not really but they wanted their toys and they got them, whats wrong with us having a few toys?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, no, mobs will still warp on occasion or just decide that staying inside the wall is much safer for them since no one can nuke or hit them due to line of sight issues.</div></div><hr />

And then summon you into the wall when you try to pull them out causing you to fall through the world and splat.  SoE really has collision messed up atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The mages changes were not to damage but to pet mitigation.  From talking to a mage friend, apparently their 65 Earth pet is actually worth using now since it no longer mitigates like paper.  For the most part it sounds like the pets got an increase in survivability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pure meleers fell behind casters with PoP.  Sony has admitted as much when they started working on the meleer upgrades, which have been far too long in the coming (big surprise there).  So I don't see how buffing up pets is appropriate.  It does effect class balance and continues the rounds of buffing up all the classes.  <br />
<br />
Pets are the devils work.<br />
<br />
Here, here!<br />
<br />
I remember a time during Luclin when it was better to tank many exp mobs with a friend's epic mage pet than to actually use my warrior.  I didn't have high end raid gear, but I didn't have total crap either.  Maybe we can go back to that BS.  That would be sweet!  :p</div></div><hr />

Actually, I did know a rogue who used his throwing knives from time to time, but only to show off his Assassinate. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The problem with mages (and beastlords) was that pets didnt scale with the level of the mage. <br />
A time geared mage used almost the same pet as a PoV leveled casual mage.<br />
Now pets are designed so they may scale with level in different areas, meaning more reward for pet classes in the future. <br />
<br />
Maybe now mages will be able to solo some correct blue stuff again :D.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't heard.  How's it broked?  <br />
Basically, you click it on and you get a 30 second timer. Within those 30 seconds, you can either use a bow or a throwing weapon, and the first attack will always hit for very high damage. How high? My rogue uses a Stonewood compound bow with 3 dam/150 rng arrows; he typically hits for 85 or so on average. Last night I tried Assassin's Strike several times and almost always got hits for 180 or so.<br />
<br />
Basically, it's a 340 END-cost way to make sure you get the equivalent of a bow crit every 30 seconds or so. It sucks...was a waste of 320pp for the tome.<br />
<br />
Given the functionality that warriors and monks have gotten from their unique abilities, the rogue ability is even weaker. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Mage pets arent the end all be all.<br />
They basically gave Rathe's son 10% Mitigation<br />
There was something floating around that showed player mitigation vrs pet. and warriors had 43% or so Mitigation, Knights had 39% and pets had 1%<br />
<br />
So they uped pet mitigation with Selected focus up to 10 - 15%ish to help mages out. Which is fair and not completely unbalancing.<br />
<br />
And yes I do play a mage <br />
<br />
Kadah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Same here.  My ex-main is a magician.  I quit playing him cause I gave up hope.  I'm *very* glad for these changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Originally posted by Eriatha Egan <br />
Have you ever played a mage?  <br />
<br />
what spells were added in GoD that you need to be able to play your mage/Bl/wiz? probibly none because you cant get them unless your the best of the best, my point here is we dont need 10 new spells for each casting and hybrid class per expantion, i can say that with much certainty.<br />
<br />
i have no major beef with their mitigation, like said my beef is with their damage, because the dev team said that melee classes had fallen behind the casting classes and pets are tools of casters to put out their damage, so in effect they made the gap wider.<br />
<br />
now you may ask me &quot;gerick are you dense? the patch said it improved this and that&quot; <br />
<br />
trust me, necro pets and beastlord pets now do more DPS post 60, i know this because i have friends that let me 2 box now and then, the BL and necro pets live longer and do more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I dont think it will help mages solo in any upper areas because till PoFire most mobs summon or just hit too much to have anyone tank them unslowed. That leaves PoV and PoJ for sub elemental mages and PoF 2nd castle (groups) for after, I mean hey why would any mage wana solo for shit exp when they can join a kite group and get an AA every 30 min?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">PoV and PoJ don't need anyone soloing in them, its crowded enough with groups already.</div></div><hr />

At least thats what I always thought yet &quot;SOLOING&quot; is one of the first arguments people use to defend these pet changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zypheron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">this makes mages more viable for doing XP in the pre-elemental stage.  What happens if your idiot puller brings 3 mobs in the camp and you arent geared well enough to tank all of them...you have the mage pet take one.  If anything, this HELPS warriors in the pre-elemental stage that dont have an EB/Anger3 proc, as well as helps shaman (since they can now go into places like the Tactics Pit without needing a shaman or a necro as well).  The only real class that you can say is hurt by this are the chanters, since now there is a more viable pet offtank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">&lt;&lt;this game isnt about soloing&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
soloing has been around for 5 years so this sounds like the whine of a group oriented player who envies others.<br />
<br />
allowing soloers into zones does make the zones more crowded for grouping types but allowing groups into zones makes the same zones more crowded for soloers. children stop whining you arent going to get the zone all to yourself no matter how much you scheme.</div></div><hr />

Give Warriors Pacification that works up to level 70 mobs to pull! After all our discs are spells(per Paladins), lets go all the way and combine Paladins/SK/Warrior to shut Paladins up.</div></div><hr />
