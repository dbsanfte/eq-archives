<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 53 (soon to be 54) WAR who has SCHW (22% haste) and always groups with a 54 ENC, who casts Aanya's Quickening (whatever it's called).  Can I just add 22% to whatever Lucy lists as AQ's haste, to determine total haste?  And what's the limit for haste (haste cap)?  And does it change with your level.  I know BRD haste can go over the cap, but am ignoring that for now, as I rarely group with a BRD.<br />
<br />
The root of my desire to know is, I have a limited budget, and haste items are quite expensive.  If I'll be close to the cap with just SCHW and ENC haste, then I may skip upgrading the haste item.  Especially since I always group with the chanter, and she'll be getting better haste spells as time goes by.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 30 = 50% max haste<br />
Level 50 = 74% max haste<br />
Level 54 = 84% max haste<br />
Level 59 = 94% max haste<br />
Level 60 = 100% max haste<br />
<br />
If you have two Haste buffs on, the one with the biggest Haste component will overrule the other buffs haste component, but both buffs will add other stats if they have any .. like +ATK, AC, etc. etc. Same goes for Item Haste, biggest one prevails.<br />
<br />
Also, Haste increases your attack rate, not directly lower the delay but a good approximation on delay CAN be calculated.<br />
<br />
Delay / (1 + (Haste% / 100) ) = hasted delay<br />
<br />
So let's say you have a Centi Longsword (27 Delay), wear the SCHW (22% haste) and have the Aanya's Quickening (64% haste) buff on you. Let's say 86% haste for simplicity. The full calculation, step-by-step, would look something like this :<br />
<br />
27 Delay / (1 + (86%/100) ) = hasted delay<br />
27 Delay / (1 + 0.86) = hasted delay<br />
27 Delay / 1.86 = hasted delay<br />
14,51~ delay = hasted delay<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge, EverQuest actually use floating numbers niternally on delays, which is why I haven't rounded it up or down.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tatanka7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Excellent, thanks so much!<br />
<br />
Well, with SCHW and AQ, looks like I'm covered until level 59.  22% + 64% = 86%, and cap is 84% until I ding 59.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I think there's some incremental increases between those points noted, but I didn't wanna go guess at them.<br />
<br />
In fact, I have heard other places that cap at level 50 is 80% and increases by 2% until level 60. But the sources for that is &quot;anecdotal&quot;, ie. just as uncertain as those numbers I posted earlier. Still, if that is true it would make level 54 about 88% haste cap. On the other hand, Enchanters get a 70% haste spell at level 58, so that helps some too when the two of you reach that level.<br />
<br />
But I'm not sure if anyone have completely verified the caps,and SOE have never told us details about the haste cap as far as I know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, either way the gloves you have can last you a bit longer, but getting a 30+ Haste item before level 60 would be a good idea. Which would also open the hand slot for some gauntlets with more AC + HP. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">does anyone know a good place with a good up to date list of what haste is on some items<br />
<br />
and how do people know what the haste is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Search for items with Haste effect on Alla'Khazam and if in doubt about haste % - Check what Magelo lists it as, since it reads the % directly from the ingame Item ID and stuffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just have to ask.....is it SO friggin hard to type out BARD rather than BRD??  Being that I know how to type, and type at a moderate speed, I actually found it faster to type a real word, rather than the abbreviation.  Either way, it is at MOST 1/10 of a second more work to type out the full word....<br />
<br />
This is a forum, not everquest.  There isnt any reason to abbreviate such things here, and abbreviating a 4 letter word to a 3 letter word is just plain lazy.  What next?  A machine to open pickle jars for you....no, wait, they have those too now.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/off topic<br />
<br />
Where the hell do you get off accusing someone of being lazy for using an accepted abbreviation, especially when you clearly understood exactly what he was saying? <br />
<br />
Hell, I applaud the efficiency of his communication!!<br />

Why is it any of your business anyway? People are permitted to post any way they damn well please, within the guidelines established by the owners and moderators of this board  - I don't see you listed as a mod so why don't you quit trying to nitpick people how to do their data entry for God's sake...get a life and stop trying to tell others how they should run theirs so as to avoid annoying YOU! If you don't like it, you don't need to read it.<br />

So then for a 65 warrior with a 41% haste item, and from a pure haste perspective (i.e. not including other stats), there is no advantage to a 68% spell haste over a 60% spell haste, is this correct?<br />
<br />
Also, I understand there are 2 bard songs that can take one over the haste cap - warsong of the vah shir (or was it warsong of zek?) is one, what's the other(s)? And are these additive? e.g. [41% item + 68% spell] + 35% song = [~100% (item/spell cap)] + 35% song = ~135% total?<br />
<br />
Gwarf - check the compendium link that Anker posted - it lists a ton of useful info, including item name, drop mob/zone, add'l stats, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct, unless the 68% one also have other stats such as AC / AGI / ATK and such.<br />
<br />
And are these additive? e.g. [41% item + 68% spell] + 35% song = [~100% (item/spell cap)] + 35% song = ~135% total?<br />
<br />
No, strongest one overules the weaker.<br />
<br />
So in short :<br />
(Strongest item haste + strongest buff haste) capped by  (haste cap + strongest overhaste) = your haste<br />
<br />
So lets say 41% item haste, 70% buff haste, 10% overhaste on a level 65 character.<br />
(41+70 = 111%) capped by (100+10 = 110%) = 110% haste<br />
<br />
I hope it was clear enough. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Soulenticer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As you can see the haste cap just keeps getting better and better. Now that the highest level is no longer 60 but 65 is that haste raised?<br />
Level 30 = 50% max haste<br />
Level 50 = 74% max haste<br />
Level 54 = 84% max haste<br />
Level 59 = 94% max haste<br />
Level 60 = 100% max haste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually Anker, they had it right.  They just had the wrong percentage for the bard overhaste.<br />
<br />
As for the highest overhaste, it's 30% on Call of the Muse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4112&amp;source=Live) and Rizlona's Call of Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3362&amp;source=Live).  Haste v3 is overhaste.</div></div><hr />
