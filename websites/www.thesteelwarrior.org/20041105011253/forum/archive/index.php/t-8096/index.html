Although this is the better way to find out for yourself, I would hesitate doing so as some of the distillers to move augs around can get a lil pricey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Moving the class XII aug (anger 3) is about 600-700pp not so bad to get the right weapon in play/personal feel.<br />
<br />
I own both the GBoS and CHSD...I aug'd GBoS with Anger 3 and the CHSD with a guard 3 (very nice with high WA as it is almost perpetually up).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Does guard3 produce any aggro like a rune proc does? Otherwise wouldn't it be better to just use a lifetap for more damage reduction. Personally i'm an aggro proc guy all the way right now, but if i ever did get to say i didn't need every possible chance for snap aggro i can get I'd be interested to know if guard 3 is worth anything. <br />
<br />
Seems like it's so/so, since a double proc would have almost no effect, just cancel the previous proc out, it uses a buff slot, and it doesn't stack with bulwark of vie does it? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dont waste your time with Guard 3 sir...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guard 3 takes a buff slot....<br />
<br />
wasted buff slots make bebe jebus cry!</div></div><hr />
