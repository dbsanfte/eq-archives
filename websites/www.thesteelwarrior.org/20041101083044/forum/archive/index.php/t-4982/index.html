<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tear me up give me some ideas please all my weapons are in my bags. <br />
<br />
Caldron's Armor and Toys (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=573315)<br />
<br />
My main is a 63 Druid Tradeskiller so I am new to tanking. My guild is not a raid guild by any means but I do have access to decent cash. <br />
<br />
I have been primary healer on my Druid in BOT enough to know HP are the main stat to have as I have seen tanks with low HP look like rag dolls. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My best advice to you is to not wear a single piece of gear that does not have raw hps on it (Other than your haste cloak).<br />
<br />
Two things matter for warriors. AC and Hps. Everything else takes a back seat. <br />
<br />
Look in the bazaar at every slot that you do not have raw hps on. See what items cost on your server vs how much you have to spend. Look at the magelo's of other warriors at and above your level, see what they are using.<br />
<br />
Specific advice: lose that neckpiece now. Same goes for the bracelet of quickness.</div></div><hr />
