<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about possible new AAs and came up with one that I think would be pretty cool.  It's basically a very toned down version of warrior MOB enrage ability.  Call it Adrenaline Rush or something:<br />
<br />
Adrenaline Rush: <br />
3 levels<br />
Increases the chance of defensive skill checks like dodge, parry, riposte to fire off when we go berserk.  Level 1 10% more than usual, level 2, 25% more than usual, level 3 50% more than usual.  Tweak percentages as needed for balance.<br />
<br />
Note, this is a 10/25/50% bonus to our CURRENT levels.  This is not a straight 10/25/50% chance for all of those skills to fire so in reality it would just be a moderate increase in avoidance while we're berserk.</div></div><hr />

Another AA I would like to see is some form of constant riposte reduction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like that Idea, and agree with Paean too :P<br />
<br />
It'd be great as an AA in omens if they put in an aa that required you to have Tactical Mastery maxed... Make it cost 15aa and make you avoid the damage from ripostes as well when tactical mastery goes off. Thats pricey, and i'd pay it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea. I love it. I am also very pro riposte aa's. I hoping to see a mass of riposte oriented aa's coming this next expansion. I would like to see avoid riposte, and increase successrate of riposte. Possible an aa that allows a dual wield check with ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about a riposte AA that lets your riposte be for the damage that the mob would have hit you for?  <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Fennin Ro tries to hit you but you riposte and hit Fennin Ro for 1875 damage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oo, I like, totally unbalancing, but I like. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seraz</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the idea, seems pretty cool, you should of posted this when SoE was asking for suggestions :)<br />
But the name sounds weird lol, wouldn't you get an adrenaline rush after a mob swings at you and smacks for 400 damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the Adrenaline Rush AA is cool, I like it.<br />
the Improved Tactical Mastery AA (to avoid ripost) is very sweet, I deffinitly want it.<br />
the idee from Bonequest is good but if tweak a bit :<br />
AA : Deflect. for Monk (no restriction), for Knights (need to equip a shield, next two melee round will be simple, ie no DA/TA/Flurry/Critical), for Warrior (need to equip a shield).<br />
the firing chance would depend on classes to balance things.<br />
and the emote would better be something like : <br />
Fennin Ro tries to hit you but you Deflect !<br />
Fennin Ro hits himself for 1875 damage!<br />
the Aggro from it would be a (Furious)Bash aggro for Knights and warrior (they used a shield) and none (or normal ripost aggro, I am not sure of the best solution) for Monk.</div></div><hr />

What about rangers?  Can we use our massive peckers to deflect the attack back against the mob?  Or do we just miss out ;( /sniffles</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry, it's just that I've never saw a ranger with a shield ... <br />
maybe we can try to make a partial deflect for DW setup (so other option for war, and good news for ranger and lol for bards). what about a 75%  deflect if DW then next melee round (on both hand) will be simple, ie no DA/TA/Flurry/Critical and no DW.<br />
<br />
Happy ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semp</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a good idea I think Yoda, honestly I could care less if us rangers get it(unless of course I deflect with my pecker), but the reduced success rate for a warrior might be good, especially considering that you might just be clicking that AA button on reaction to watching your HPs plummet and might not always have time to swap in a shield to do the full success.  Would be very interesting imho</div></div><hr />
