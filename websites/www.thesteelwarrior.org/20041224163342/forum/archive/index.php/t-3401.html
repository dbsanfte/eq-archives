<br />
<br />
All they need to do to fix most all of warriors issues is to make every weapon , minus epics, to be warrior useable. Masters of all weapons we are called. then let us use all weapons. would solve Agro and Dps in one shot. There are Paly, SK, Rog weapons out there that if warriors could use then we would NEVER lose agro one it was established ( established being the key as to not nerf palys and SKs).<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted we still have to build agro.  But once its there and with those weapons it would be faster it would stay there I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me the simplest way to give all warriors more aggro is give them a small built aggro multiplier.  That would give us the aggro without all sorts of other complications, such as changing our dps or having to change a whole mess of weapons in the database.  Moreover, if they found out the aggro multiplier was too high or too low, it would be very easy to readjust it; just change one variable.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.<br />

<br />
Yeah, it's long past the time to make the piercing cap for warriors 250. It's pointless to have it that way. The best piercers are ROG only anyways. And the DPS difference doesn't come from the skill cap difference, it comes from the rogue special attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;and higher h2h cap, as well as access to some h2h weapons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not in a million years should this happen. It would be an indirect NERF on Beastlords. And god forbid beastlords and their hand to hand mastery be encroached upon. They're actually one of the few BALANCED classes in the game after all.</div></div><hr />

No. Bad idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree totally on the skill caps.  H2H I wouldnt raise much.  We are the masters of weapons,   monks/Blords are the masters of H2H.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input, was just Curious what the Community thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some easily attainable 1hs/1hb knight weapons with a ratio greater than 1:1. And there are insane ratio/proc caster weapons out there. These would be kinda out of hand in our hands, especially if they were able to be used in secondary. On the other hand, I don't see why we can't use their 2handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior can already wield 2 stun proccing weapons, I don't see the point. Paladins usually use 2 handers, you want warriors to be able to dual weild 2 handers?<br />
<br />
As to paladins outaggroing warriors, then either the paladin is using a weapon they shouldn't be using, or the warrior is does not have adequate weapons, or the paladin is jumping in too early, or you just got really unlucky. Without casting, a knight will generate less DPS, and therefor less aggro then a warrior with similar weaponry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's not a question of a paladin and a warrior in the same group.  I think the complaint a lot of the warriors have is they feel they are unfairly shunted out of groups and some raids because more and more people prefer paladin tanks to warrior tanks.  People seem to prefer paladin tanks because they can more easily get and keep aggro and can still reasonably take enough damage to act as the tank.  What the warriors want is to be able to generate a little more aggro than they currently do.<br />
<br />
So the problem is more a matter of general perception and warriors getting groups.  It's not about a paladin accidentally outaggroing a warrior in a given group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arnan</div><div class="date">10-04-2003, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am glad I dont play on the same server as some of you.  I never have a hard time finding a group.  And I have never been told, no, sorry we are waiting on a knight to tank.  Though I have had fun poked at me for my &quot;broken class&quot;  ie ~opps we got a warrior tank, better not slow as early~ but they didnt change the way they played and just dealt with the fact that I didnt get instant agro.  <br />
<br />
In my experience (I am not in EP) warriors are still prefered for DPS and HPs over knights.  Not that knights arnt this or that or the other thing, but simply put, there are enough people on my server (Brell) who prefer warriors, that I dont have a hard time finding groups.  Especially in LDoN (normal level) where the mobs dont hit hard enough to make much difference if it takes a little while to grab agro, cause makin the mobs dead is more important then throwin heals around the group.<br />
<br />
IMO the instant agro the knights get is what is broken, not our ability to get it(usually once I get agro, I dont loose it).  Hell the game is so damn easy now it isnt worth playing.  SoE needs to fix the instant agro of the knights in a way as to not over nerf them in their ability to serve as a tank.(leave them with damage mit and HPs)  Maybe by reducing the hate of some of their spells, to balance it out.  Or not giving hate to resisted spells(saw this idea in another post)<br />
<br />
I remember 3 years ago my buddy was playing a ranger, and loved it.  Then he started reading ranger forums and realized how hosed rangers were.. he retired the ranger to play a cleric.  I believe these forums where folks bemoan their fate fuel their classes own demise.  Just my opinion though<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brackon</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer is pretty simple really.  It is all about Aggro.  With our abilities to mitigate damage, they do not want us to be able to have and hold aggro without some effort by the rest of the raid. <br />
<br />
 As far as it is concerned, I think it is pretty balanced in that respect.  Frustrating, but balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion,<br />
<br />
Paladin only weapons, SHOULD always have a Diety requirement.<br />
<br />
But then thats my roleplaying opinion.<br />
<br />
Besides diety specific paladin weapons, Warriors should be able to use any weapon, all types and styles. In every role playing game, they have, and they should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togr</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want SoE to make weapons how they should be then it would be by making every class able to hold every weapon, but having its ability seriuosly hindered like level restrictions/reqs.  So sure, I can pickup a monks fists, but they're more like 14/35 since all warriors only bother learning uppercuts, and a paladin can pickup a wizards staff, but the FT5 is now FT1 and no mana conservation etc.<br />
<br />
BUT this is SoE we're talking about, play the game for what you enjoy.  I'm a lucky one to only group with guildies and even when I get a hybrid in group there is never a question of if I'm tanking or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, about one year ago a warrior friend get awarded a Narandi's Lance... still refer to him as the ghey pally to this day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">good players dont have problems with good (skill not gear) warriors tanking.<br />
<br />
I routinely group with a set of friends (Cleric, BST, Pally, wizard, mage) and there is never ever a disparity between whether me or the pally tanks.  Im always MA, and the pally plays CC, yes, they make decent chantertypes with their root line/stun line.<br />
<br />
Skilled warriors tend to be better tanks than skilled knights.  Good players know this.  Good players would rather have the HP/AC/Mitigation of a warrior between them and death.<br />
<br />
Its the lazy twinked PLed fucks that like knights, because they then have to know how to play the game instead of mindlessly pounding a button.<br />
<br />
EQ is not a game for mindlessly hitting a button.  To some it may be, but thats not what it was designed as.  If you want to mash buttons all day, go play Soul Calibre 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are quite a few paladins that wouldn't mind seeing more deity only weapons.  One of the big hopes of PoP was that non-Tunare paladins would get a deity associated weapon, much as the high-elves get Nature's Defender.<br />
<br />
Sadly, no such luck.  They didn't even have the decency to put in the diety of my main.<br />
