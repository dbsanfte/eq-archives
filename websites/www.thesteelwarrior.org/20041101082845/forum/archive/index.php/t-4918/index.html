<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if its common knowledge but there is a buyable ear hast item (27percent). <br />
<br />
Becuase Head slot is best with WDH or HoRZ, and back slot best with Pernicity cloak, and belt with Rubicite Girdle, at least for those of us who have to buy gear, this item might free up those slots for good stat items instead of something with haste on it. <br />
<br />
27 is not the highest haste but with SoV you are almost to the haste cap anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your STA is high/capped, Crinose Cape of the Werewolf is better for a back item actually. They're only 1-2k in the bazaar on my server. Sadly I'm wearing one and I'm almost in Plane of Time  :D. I was wearing a CoF for the longest time, which is actually probably the 2nd best buyable haste item still (if you have a HoRZ or WDH), behind the Belt of Raging Nature. I snagged a haste ring from PoAir, and picked up one of those cloaks until I can get a new back item off one of the Charm birds in PoFire or perhaps better. Don't forget the fact that Ear Symbol of the Veteran and Tear of the Rainmaker are 55 and 50 HP upgrades over that earring haste item. You'd still be better off using those and getting haste elsewhere if you're a bazaar warrior.<br />
<br />
If you like HP above all else, the best solution is<br />
<br />
Head: White Dragon Helm / Helmet of Rallos Zek<br />
Back: Crinose Cape of the Werewolf<br />
Waist: Belt of Raging Nature<br />
Ears: Ear Symbol of the Veteran / Tear of the Rainmaker<br />
<br />
2nd best would be<br />
<br />
Head: White Dragon Helm / Helmet of Rallos Zek<br />
Back: Cloak of Flames<br />
Waist: Heavy Rubicite Girdle<br />
Ears: Ear Symbol of the Veteran / Tear of the Rainmaker</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Uhh Sam?  You do realize you can put quite a bit more HP and Stamina on the ear also?  Bloodmetal Ears come immediately to mind.  Belt of Raging Nature is the best purchaseable haste item, followed closely by the good old Cloak of Flames.  Resell that earring and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I never got it I have a CoM for haste, ya well you are right also the blood ear does add some solid HP. That 25Cha (not to mention the 25STR) on the Penicity cloak is good for DI when you get it cast on you (I use it all the time now) ... I can't see using a different cape. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of ways to go for sure...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Speed of the Shissar and Vallon's Quickening is only 68 percent haste.<br />
<br />
So with a 27 percent haste item, you're losing valuable DPS.<br />
<br />
Heck even a 31 percent haste item won't &quot;cap&quot; you like a 36 percent item will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was surprised to find that wonderous rappidity stacks with SoV... so that 2percent more heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taliefer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the haste effects dont stack on those 2 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah but he means you get the 70% haste from wonderous and then stats from SoV eh if you want to deal with spending mana to keep those two up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you want to choose CHA over HP, go play an enchanter (and even then that's still not a good idea in my opinion). If you're STA is not capped, and you get more HP from the other cloak, that's a different story. If you're using DI in groups, you've got more problems than choosing equipment :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No Sam, there are not alot of ways to go.  For optimal return Warriors should purchase Belt of Raging Nature first, then Cloak of Flames.  Anything else is a compromise or a NO DROP.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you are right. Basically you lose 14AC, say 12AC when consider reissits and others stuffs. Thats about 40HP say.<br />

Big mismatch there, I cant even see that there would be any consideration of the werewolf cape...  You have to assume that STR is maxed and STA is maxed to even remotly consider it and I still wouldnt take it for 25CH vs. 30HP 12scold and 7dex.... well maybe but if both STA and STR and not capped forget it.<br />

Ok no comparison there eiher if you have HoRZ or WDH then go for the Belt you suggest and the pernicity<br />
<br />
Well I guess you always get the haste in the belt slot... and use the pernicity and whatever helm you can get even if its just the raldukan.... <br />

Ya the ear is complete trash forget it....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But if you dont have the belt I would still go with the CoM/Penicity instead of the Raduken/CoF. If you have the WDH or HoRZ then go for the CoF but still the belt is the better...<br />

For what reason would you not use DI in groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For what reason would you not use DI in groups?<br />
<br />
/boggle... the real question is why WOULD you use DI in groups.<br />
<br />
DI is a FIVE HUNDRED MANA spell. It only lasts ten minutes. Not only that, it has a rather significant component cost of two emeralds, which cost what, 15 plat each?<br />
<br />
SO you're wasting the equivalent of 2 cheals or so of mana (after specialization checks and the like) plus what, 30 plat? every 10 minutes... just on the off chance a heal won't land in time. The only time you always want to have DI up in experience groups is if your cleric is completely incompetent and you don't trust them to keep you alive, and you're willing to have a cash split that's close to nothing after costs of all those emeralds, plus the extra downtime from all that wasted mana... or if you're tanking in a zone which is too tough for your gear and AA's to handle.<br />
<br />
Due to its high cost and limited duration, DI is only really used when you think you've got a very high chance of not surviving the next 10 minutes. If you're dying enough in an experience group that you need DI up at all times, you've got some serious problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Strength is meaningless to a warrior once you're up there to where you're making these decisions. You're crazy if you'd rather have 25 CHA over 30 HP and 12 SV cold :rolleyes:. STA I can understand if you're not capped, but for CHA???? No question which one will benefit you more. The only time I go for charisma is when a charisma aug drops on an LDoN adventure and nobody wants it. Then I put it on an item :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Usually we DI the enchanter in ldon groups - that way he can charm and haste the pet without too much fear of getting owned.<br />
<br />
As far as 25cha or 30hp...I know quite a few warriors who use Invigoration of Rytan over brells..thats 20cha for 30hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">DI is a FIVE HUNDRED MANA spell. It only lasts ten minutes. Not only that, it has a rather significant component cost of two emeralds, which cost what, 15 plat each?<br />
<br />
I dont have a mana issue with my cleric in general. I have like 150K in bank... CH is 400 mana. DI is 500 mana that can save you 400mana and casts exactly when you most need it heh... <br />
<br />
Also my cleric has all the AA for extending stuff (my HoT spells go for 6 ticks instead of 4).. I never timed it but if DI is effected like Supnal Exilair then I should be getting 15 mintues or so... <br />
<br />
<br />
I see not the slightest downside to this spell at all. I am working on my CHA and my next cleric AA will be the final max of this spell's efficiency.<br />
<br />
<br />
Humm never thought to DI the chanter. Never thought to charm in LDoN either.... [I have DC and CoD and all the charm AA's on my chanter but charm is so random that I never use it just use animation] Very good infos there Raaj.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Divine Intervention is, indeed, a nice spell and all, but not worth using unless the Cleric have the AA skill &quot;unfailing divinity&quot; ... then it's nice and fun, except it's low duration.<br />
<br />
And yes, Focus items and skills does work with DI, for a maximum of 50% focus + AA skills I think, cannot remember precisely how all this stacks.<br />
<br />
Emeralds can be gotten as low as 13p 6g 5s a piece with good faction / charisma ... etc., but remember you use two of them. So that's 27pp 3g at the best for one cast. To expect a Cleric to use this in an exp group would be rather rude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">DI is 500 mana that can save you 400mana and casts exactly when you most need it heh... <br />
<br />
You mean, CAN cast exactly when you most need it. DI fails often, which is another reason why it's a waste of t ime in XP groups unless you think you've got a real good chance onf dying in the next 10 minutes... and if you're dying that often, you shouldn't be fighting there.<br />
<br />
Not only that, a lot of the time it doesn't even save you the 400 mana that you lciam, many tiems DI only provides a partial heal that's not even close to a cheal.<br />
<br />
You're aobut the only warrior I've ever known who thinks it's a good spell for XP groups. /boggle<br />
<br />
You'd think a person that uses it all the time would know these things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While that's still questionable which is better, I'm assuming that's in a raid situation, and not an experience group situation :p. There's a big difference there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ya I have 2 of the 3 in unfailing divinity, and just a few more AA to get the last, right you are its essential to have it on the cleric.<br />
<br />
And with my AA I would assume it is going out to 15 mintues.... <br />
<br />
Well your main agruments seem to be the cost, thats just nothing to me, not even a tiny consideration. So removing the cost of emeralds from the consideration, I again see no downside.<br />
<br />
Ya if I were running a cleric in pick up exp group I am sure I would not be casting DI on anyone, unless some deal was made in advance to share the cost. <br />
<br />
Still on boss mobs if I was cleric I would cast on MT, and myself no doubt. <br />
<br />
I guess one of the advantages of boxing is that you can do things like this, if my warrior goes down then its 50/50 that the whole group goes down... 120pp per hour to prevent even one wipe is nothing and well worth it. I mean in 10 hours i will get a 30,000pp item, in general speaking, so thats like 3000pp per hour - a wipe sets me back 15 minites to 30 minites, 120pp to prevent a wipe is a very solid investment.<br />
<br />
I even DI my cleric as well... alhtough I dont really recomend that as any kind of general stratagy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Suffice to say that DI is only a good investment if you're doing what you're doing, and running your own group. In the real world that most of us live in of groups involving a full group of real people, DI is a complete waste of time to keep up on the MT, for the reasons I have listed above. Just because they aren't a consideration for YOU specifically, doesn't mean they're invalid. They still apply to most other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bah, relatively easy quests are you friend!  Considering Sam is a dark elf though, he might have to do some faction work first.<br />
<br />
Loyalist Shield of Honor - 50ac 15str 15wis 75hp  BACK/SECONDARY<br />
<br />
The 15str and 15wis are useless, but you can't beat 50ac and 75hp in a BACK slot.  Look it up!  :)</div></div><hr />

LOL<br />
<br />
That's not a relatively easy quest.<br />
<br />
The stupid named vampire is maddeningly rare.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Not to mention the first few sub-quests are annoying as hell due to luclin named spawns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Not to mention the first few sub-quests are annoying as hell due to luclin named spawns. <br />
<br />
The quest, minus the Valdanov part, takes roughly 4-6 hours to complete, and most of that is just running around.  Considering he has his own cleric, enchanter, and wizard crew, this would be a very easy quest for him and he can make some cash on the side while camping that vampyre.  I mean seriously, once you have the ashes, the quest is essentially complete.<br />
<br />
The quest is easy in a sense of what exactly you have to do, but I will agree, it's still a bitch.  My friend and I spent a total of 85 man hours camping him, but made 30k in the process.  We missed him twice, of course.  Gah!  :)<br />
<br />
Considering the reward at the end, this shield is amazing for warriors... and Pallywankers too.  It's especially awesome for ones who don't have access things places like Vex Thal (Cloak of Icy Shadows?) and NToV (Lady Nev Cloak).</div></div><hr />
