<br />
Now I need Queen in dok, Fear golem, PoA, and Maestros Hand.  <br />
<br />
Which one of those is the easiest pieces to get?  What is the best way to drop the mob?  I mean how many ppl do I need?  Specifically essential classes?  <br />
<br />
I would never want to ask for help going after a epic piece without specific details first.  Unfortunately I have little experience with Fear, Dok, and Hate 'cause lots of ppl won't go there.  I have been to each only once, and each time I was just a follower.  <br />
<br />
Which should I do next?</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many peeps does it take to get the hand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 group of 65's? 2 groups of ~60s? That might even be overkill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks Like Queen in Dok or Fear next.  Any idea which of those is easier?  Like how many groups needed? (thanks for the help btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on your guild's raid ability and whatnot. I think Fear's potentially easier, assuming you don't wipe on the break. Killing trash is easy. Golems aren't tough, just get them dead fast before they cycle the DT.<br />
<br />
Queen's a pain in the ass, but keep her back turned to everyone else and burn her fast. Like most of the kunark mobs, it's all about how much DPS you can muster. Easiest way to do queen is to clear King room, and pull her in there and have a non KOS person hail her for the quest text until all her guards path back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nihnyes Lanys</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both are easy imo except I've heard that the Ball from fear doesnt drop that often. Everyone gets intimidated by the Queen cause of her AE and such but she's not that bad. To my knowledge she only has 18k hp, just have everyone blow disc on engage, bring along a few wizzies.<br />
<br />
 You can probably grab 2-3 groups and fight down there and kill her np as long as people listen to directions. There always seems to be people that go ahead when they aren't supposed to, or fall down traps or train the raid etc. I did my blade with 5 people but  had some good people, and we managed to get a  CoH down to safe hall.<br />
I've helped open queen raids and found its noobies that don't listen that wipe the raids.  Many warriors fail a few times on queen cause of that, but don't give up if you fail, cause you WILL get it.<br />
<br />
Remember, the ball from fear is MQable so possibly look at that as an option, if you don't have the money try to get on some open PoF raids.<br />
GL sir</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much does the MQ go for typically?<br />
<br />
I need to burn favors from friends to go on raids, and I am NOT going to MQ the Spiroc Wingblade for the followin reasons:<br />
1) A friend of mine just completed his wizzy epic, but on the turn in his stuff just poofed.  A GM had to give him an epic.  <br />
2) Verant said that they will not do this for MQs<br />
3) The Spiroc Wingblade as you know is for the Red Scabbard, and if i lose that I lost the scales...ouch.  <br />
<br />
So I think I need to buy the MQs for the stuff thats not too hard to come by like the Ball of Golem, cause if i lose it all i really lose is the block of permafrost...not too hard to get again (and the hilt is easy too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">newbbarsher</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been on lots of fear raids, and I've never seen the ball once.<br />
<br />
I got the Queen piece awhile back, not too hard too get. Back then we had a few groups, average level probably 55. I agree with Nihnyes, 2-3 groups should do fine for queen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Queen's a pain in the ass, but keep her back turned to everyone else and burn her fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen's getting easier these days.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure her AoE is resistable (at least that's what a bunch of my guildmates said when we did her twice a couple of weeks ago).<br />
<br />
She doesn't have that many hit points. DPS, with the current state of the game has gone WAY up, so she's easy to burn down quick.<br />
<br />
In any event, I'd rank what he's got left in his epic this way:<br />
<br />
Easiest to Hardest:<br />
<br />
1) Hate. Pre-revamp, Maestro is gimp. Hand is easy and it's just a short raid. Post-revamp, the hand drops off easier mobs, supposedly.<br />
<br />
2) Queen. Royals are getting rather trivial of late.<br />
<br />
3) Fear. Break-in is still really tough. If you can get break-in done, then it's pretty simple.<br />
<br />
4) Spiroc Wingblade. Sky's just an organizational nightmare. Sirran, and necro's, and whacky pathing, and summoning, and the islands, and not falling off, and sirran, and the keys, and sirran, and summoning, and the spawn cycles, and then FINALLY getting up to Spiroc Isle and having to remember who/what to leave UP to keep repopping the damn Death-Touching machine because he won't drop enough Wingblades. Oh yeah ... ooooodles of fun for the whole family.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knocked off numbers on and two on the list, Hate and Dok, and they were progressively harder.  <br />
<br />
Tried Fear last night and got wiped fast on the break.  Logged alt Monk and and sent him in to drag and help with CR.  Had ads in camp so we fought and we were able to kill a couple, but kept gettin adds, then i finally just started kiting and told them to gate/camp. <br />
<br />
So they did and they didnt come back.  Woot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah fear breaks... the memories...<br />
<br />
Invis and evacs,  my friend, invis and evacs...<br />
<br />
Just remember when you go to Sky, <br />
1) that talking to Sirran is bad (you'll make the bunnies very angry!), <br />
2) to leave one other mob alive other than the Spiroc Lord (so you can farm him as you need) and <br />
3) to have your DT soakers for the Spiroc Lord think of plenty of witty sayings they can /shout as they aggro him.<br />
<br />
That and be prepared for a slow, careful,  and methodical clearing unless you want to spend thousands on port stones and coffins as you CR...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the best way to break fear?  I have heard of a couple methods, but what is one that you suggest? More important, which classes and levels would you use? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, Queen's AoE *is* resistable these days. 65 helps a ton. it's the same effect as Rak'Ashiir in CoM, and we 1-group him for our shamans these days.<br />
<br />
Side note: I had over 500 MR fighting Cazic-Thule the other day. Goddamn I love bards. Fear? What fear?<br />
<br />
And speaking of Fear, breaking it depends on levels/gear, as always. I can break it with 1 group of 65s or less, but I don't know where your guild stands as regards progression..<br />
<br />
Levels - The higher the better.<br />
Classes - Bring clerics and enchanters. You *will* get adds.<br />
<br />
So, assuming average gear, with most folks around 60 or up. Two groups, both with clerics and chanters. Bring tanks and damage dealers. Everything in Fear sees invis, so don't worry about that.<br />
<br />
Zone in, and run to the SW corner, and bring everything with you that aggros. Kill it all there, that's a safe spot.<br />
<br />
Without knowing more, I can't give much more help. Golem ball isn't that rare, you should get at least 1 if you kill all 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably the easiest way to break fear is the west wall break. The trick is not to pull anything, let them come to you until most of the roamers are clear. Some problems you will run into are the scarlings when they shadow step you. If someone gets ported far from the main camp, its best that they just die if mobs agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roehm</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does the North Wall break not work anymore?<br />
<br />
Haven't been to Fear in ages and the last 8 or 9 times we did an AOE break at West wall. IMHO, if you can handle it, West wall AOE break is the funnest fastest way to break Fear. However for a guild of low mid 50's the best way was the run to North Wall safe spot (if it even exists anymore :) )</div></div><hr />
