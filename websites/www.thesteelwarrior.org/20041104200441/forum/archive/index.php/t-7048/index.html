<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Graiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Im in an Elemental guild right now and need new haste. Soulscream isnt cutting it atm  :rolleyes:  I was just wondering what combo i should get?<br />
<br />
Bracers of Earthen Energy + Raex Bracer And Girdle of Earthen Stability And My Shoulders Or<br />
<br />
Flowing Moss Mantle + 2 Raex Bracers and Girdle of Earthen Stability OR<br />
<br />
Get a XP group and get Flame Gilded Cloak ?<br />
<br />
I dunno which combo is best reallly. My magelo is in my sig ~!~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get the haste ring from one of the Avatars in Plane of Air.  It has 135hp which is decent for a ring, which leaves you open up for different items for your shoulders, bracers and back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I currently have the flowing moss mantle + two Raex bracers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go for the flame gilded immediately - It will give you a significant bonus to your damage (and aggro) output, it's not a particularly bad cloak, and, as the real bonus, you don't have to spend raid points / worry about Merit/counciling for it. <br />
<br />
Once you have the flame gilded, you can afford to wait for a better haste item, and may be able to score larger raid gear upgrades in other areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't worry about it, the various haste items are rare enough and in enough demand that you should get whatever one(s) you can.  If you find yourself without haste then just use tribute haste for a while.  Its cheap enough and at 36% you can keep that going for ages for pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Arathena has the right idea, go do some exp in the 2nd field and get your haste taken care of without spending any DKP.  Then if one of the others drops and it makes sense to pick it up, you can do so at your leisure.  Frankly though, EP cloaks are nothing to write home about, so I would feel bad about wearing that Flame guilded cloak to plane of time where haste items are plentiful.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I went with the bracer in hopes of getting a puresteel mantle eventually.  There's a bigger ac/hp difference between the puresteel mantle and the haste shoulder than there is between the BoEE and the raex bracer.  Of course that assumes the mantle will drop and you will win it hehe.  Raex is much more of a sure thing, so taking the flowing moss mantle wouldn't be a horrible thing to do, especially if you're wearing a crappy shoulder piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey, Gorlab is back.  Good point on the tribute haste.  It's really not smart to give up a lot of ac/hp for haste when you can just harvest some junk and get your haste with no drawbacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm sort of back, not much play time at all since I got married so I'm just fiddling around at the moment. :)  I'm still in like 1/3 velious era gear, haven't broken 10k hps yet, etc. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey, I haven't broken 10k yet and I never left so you're not doin too bad 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, why not Tribute? I've been thinking about selling off my CoF, buying a bunch of racial armor for cheap, hocking it for tons of Tribute, and using the rest to maybe snag a Kizrak's or two. <br />
<br />
Um ... just out of curiosity: what does Raex's wrist have anything to do with haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">its the choice between haste bracer and raex bracer or 2 raex bracers.<br />
<br />
Personally I think bracer of earthen energy + 1 raex is the way to go.  Mudwalker is the quickest of the earth rings so you should see a few of them and with that combo you lose 8 raw AC.  Using the Haste shoulders vs Puresteel you lose 15 raw AC there, and the air haste ring is low AC aswell (and air rings suck so don't count on seeing alot of them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/shrug, you could also do hard Everfrost LDoN's and get a decent 15ish ac, 90 hp, 36% haste cloak...no DKP or whatever spent. (can't remember the freaking name atm)<br />
<br />
Personaly, I wouldn't buy a single non Raex item from the EP's other than Puresteel Mantle, Bracer of Earthen Energy or the Flowing Moss Mantle. Everything else is horribly low ac. Get your Raex, and save your DKP or Merit or whatever for PoTime drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>FurryCrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">IMHO if you wanna save ya DKP go for the cape....I always thought there was nothing much wrong with the Haste belt of Mith Marr 125HPs...decent AC and enough resists....should be cheap if you're in elementals and do a wrong of backflagging</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Morimoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not sure trying to hold out for Puresteel Mantle is the best idea, my guild never had a single one drop in all the times we did PoAir.  I'd go with Gorlab's suggestion and just go with whichever one you can get your hands on, both the bracer and mantle from Earth are good items, and the cloak from Fire would be a fine holdover until you can get one of them.  There are a lot of cloaks out there with much better hp/ac though, so probably best not to be dependent long-term on that slot for haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grongl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Flame Gilded Cloak hands down - pretty easy to get if you have a group of folks willing to jump the wall with you when there's a named up.  Back in the days of field 2 shakerpage we pulled like 7-8 of em outta there.  Put em on a couple new tags, couple twinks, even a few on clerics with shitty cloaks.  It's got reasonable stats, it's separate from whatever loot system your guild has, and you can pop a MM 10ac aug on it for 510 pts to make it last longer.  There really aren't really any &quot;wow&quot; cloaks from Elementals.  It's a good slot to stick haste in til you hit Time.<br />
<br />
Haste ring really sucks longterm - locks you into a low AC haste item and ring when there are much better rings to be had.<br />
<br />
MM Belt is a myth and guilds rarely do MM again once everybody's flagged.<br />
<br />
FMM is a solid item but loses you the basically freebie Puresteel AC.  Some guilds have bad luck with them, but we got I think 7 Puresteels out of our first 8 kills.  If your guild is still in or has yet to do PoAir farming, hold off on FMM.<br />
<br />
Earth bracer eats AC away from Raex and you'll get competition from clerics for the focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm assuming your guild isn't doing VT - otherwise there are a couple really solid alternatives in there.</div></div><hr />
