I am using a Maul with damage at 11-25, but with a delay of 2.4.  should i trade down for a faster hitting weapon with less damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">could you give us the link of your weapon and of the weapon you want to get ?<br />
it would be much easier to give correct answer.<br />
in the meanwhile I would pronostic a negative answer : stay with what you have. But a I said first, without knowing your situation it's even worse than just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimelf</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off...here is my profile page: <br />
<br />
http://eq2players.station.sony.com/en/pplayer.vm?characterId=141236108<br />
<br />
As far as a link to my current weapon, apparently the united states millitary doesn't want to allow me to visit that link, nor tell you what it is.  Suffice it to say that i am using a Iron War Axe.  And i was previously using a Blackened Maul.  Hopefully thats enough info for ya'll to go on.  And thanks in advance, i'm sure your advice will both witty, and ingenius. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/bonk myself<br />
sorry, I can't help, I don't know anything about EQ2, I should have cheked the forum section I was in before answering you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnimelf</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that was neither witty nor ingenius...however we all make mistakes, and i must remind myself not to hold other to my impossibly hi standards...j/k.  Thanks anyway i'm sure whatever game you play, your very knowledgeable in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curdlex</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a guess, so please don't take this as law.  I would take the median of the damge (I.e. 5-19 Damge would be median of 12 damage) and divide by the delay.  ((Max damge - Min Damage)/2  + Min Damage) / Delay.  <br />
<br />
Just a rough guess, but figure it is a good starting point.  Still haven't seen any ingame items with procs, have any idea how often the off hand weapon will duel wield, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taldra</div><div class="date">11-23-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what style of tank you will end up being, but I went guardian.  For the interest of tanking in the warrior tree you get a skill called stand firm, which roots you but adds an agro proc for each successful hit.  <br />
<br />
For this ability I use the lowest delay weapon I can without sacrificing too much damage, I have the hammer from Fallen Gate (doh forgot name), 30 damage, 2.0 delay right now and it works fine.  I taunt once with shout then can tank the rest of the fight with only the procs to hold agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're just considering auto-attack agro, given 2 weapons with the same DPS, the faster weapon will provide more agro. Theres seems to be a bonus of hate applied each swing, and it looks to be very small.<br />
<br />
That said, if you're a tank, you have plenty of tools at your disposal for managing agro. Here's a few tips to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
Abilities with agro increasers<br />
<br />
1. Taunt - single target taunt<br />
2. Shout - encounter targeted taunt (taunts ever mob in the encounter)<br />
3. Taunting blow - taunting attack<br />
4. Hold the Line - self-root with encounter taunt on each attack<br />
<br />
Abilities with agro increasing side effects<br />
<br />
1. Mangle - the debuff adds extra hate as a side effect<br />
2. Wound - Dot adds extra hate over time from damage<br />
3.Concussion - power drain effect adds extra hate<br />
4. Shield bash - stun, who likes to be stuned, I don't, neither do mobs<br />
5. Assault - Can be used as a really weak pbaoe taunt<br />
6. Call to Arms - Buff your group during combat to make mobs like you more, they love it<br />
7. Rallying Cry - yet more group buffing goodness that mobs love so much<br />
8.Toughness - really weak, but its a buff, mobs uniformly hate even self buffing<br />
<br />
Hero Oportunities agro<br />
<br />
1. The mangle self HO is great agro.<br />
<br />
Agro decreasing abilities<br />
<br />
1. Hunker down - use it manage a tank switch or lose agro if you aren't MTing<br />
<br />
Really, if you are losing agro easily, you are doing something very wrong. Taunt, auto-attack, Shout, and Call to Arms pretty much makes me a wanted man in each and every encounter. On really tough encounters with many opponents, spamming group buffs is great agro when combined with your taunts.</div></div><hr />

I'm not being mean either, if you can't handle doing a maximum 7 simple math operations in a second or 2, you've got a mental handycap or something.</div></div><hr />
