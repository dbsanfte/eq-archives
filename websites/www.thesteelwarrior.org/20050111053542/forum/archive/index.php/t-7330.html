<br />
Money grubbin'... (5/26)<br />
<br />
 <br />
Today's comic is pretty much the depiction of how I feel about the Omens of War expansion for EverQuest. <br />
<br />
SOE's rapid push for this next expansion is little more than a money grab attempt by the corporate big whigs before the well runs dry. In other words, Smedley and his peers has his hand buried elbow deep in our pockets digging for every scrap of our cash that they can get. Unlike the Devs and CS staff, these people in the company echelon are not concerned with the quality of the game, or the feelings of the players and fans. Their only interest is in the financial gain. Smedley has said as much himself. <br />
<br />
In my opinion EQ is not ready for another expansion. I agree with one of my SOE contacts that OoW should not be released until Q4, and the dev staff should be allowed to work on EQ throughout the summer to shore up the system, correct bugs, work with graphics, optimization, etc. <br />
<br />
Like I said, it's not the dev staff or cs team that are to blame for the state of EQ right now. The entire burden rests on the shoulders of the money grubbers. And, the only way we're going to effect change within the game is if we affect the bottom line. What I'm saying to you is... <br />
<br />
Don't purchase Omens of War. <br />
<br />
We will only convince Smedley and his ilk to give the devs the go ahead to change the game, if we absolutely REFUSE to buy any more trash exansions in the HOPES that we'll actually get our money's worth. <br />
<br />
We have to put our proverbial foot down, force them to extract their fingers from our wallets, and engender an atmosphere of &quot;no more money without change&quot;. <br />
<br />
For most of us, EQ is no longer fun. It's no longer the game we fell in love with. I for one want that game back. I want the devs to have their way with the game. Looking at the other popular MMOG's on the market, I want the devs to be allowed to alter the game to make it fun again. And, they want to. They've been begging to. But, the higher ups aren't listening. <br />
<br />
This, I guess, is my initial &quot;call to arms&quot;. This community has to rally the rest of the EQ collective to make a stand. Let's put our credit cards away. Let's show them by not paying for the game, that we're unwilling to be force fed quick-fire expansions like Omens ever again. <br />
<br />
--- <br />
<br />
When I'm fully moved and can spend the time to write, I will be drafting &quot;the EQ-Lover's Manifesto&quot; which will serve as our outline/request for change. Hopefully the rest of the community will build behind me and support the stance, and we'll get the game we deserve. We'll get our beloved EQ back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is SoE money grubbing by releasing OoW? Maybe. But just maybe financing the effort to shore up the system, correct bugs, work with graphics, optimization, etc. is maintenance which is always a cost center paid for by the revenue stream.<br />
<br />
Want that maintenace work done? Contribute to the revenue stream.<br />
<br />
Want the fun put back in and to see new innovatiove ideas? Buy expansions.<br />
<br />
EQ is in many ways a platform where SoE is learning what works, what doesn't, and what is fun.<br />
<br />
We should communicate that information, not throw them into a crises by threatening to cutdown on their revenue.<br />
<br />
Yes, EQ could use a general overhaul and have fun stressed more than beating on ever harder new contents in ever increasing new expansions in yet other newly discovered territory, lost contenents, moons, underground empires, etc.<br />
<br />
But free (to us) maintenance is not going to give us new ideas and concepts. And those new ideas are neeeded just as much as anything else. We will only see them in new expansions.<br />

You presume they have new ideas and concepts to offer.</div></div><hr />

Contribute to the revenue stream. Since I am a subscriber since june 1999,  I have contributed to the revenue stream in the form of the Original Game, 7 expansions, and monthly fees for 59 months on my main account. I have also accentuated this with additional revenue (game, expansions and monthly fees) with a mule account.<br />
<br />
Want the fun put back in and to see new innovatiove ideas? Buy expansions. I have bought 7. Most have been rushed out hack jobs that have required extensive patching/fixes (and still some issues remain unaddressed). Why the hell do I want to buy another one?<br />
<br />
But free (to us) maintenance is not going to give us new ideas and concepts. And those new ideas are neeeded just as much as anything else. We will only see them in new expansions. Sorry genius, my non-stop contributions to their revenue stream over the past 5 years say that its time for a little give to go with the take. I gladly shelled out the purchase price of the original to pay for the development costs. I enjoyed some of the older expansions and gladly payed the price for them, but the recent stuff (namely POS like Ykesha, LDoN, and GoD) are shit. I'm not quite at the point where I am about to cancel my accounts but I am not just buying anymore of these chickenshit expansions unless I start seeing some well designed, fun gameplay. I want value and of late, SOE is not providing it.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that I will refuse to purchase this one, no matter what, but I will not be buying it initially and not at all unless I recieve some very positive feedback from sources I trust.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with Woody 100% ( that is; if I still played EQ ). I just hope the current playerbase has enough chutzpah to stand up to SoE and 'not' buy the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

Also I dont know how big they want to make EQ directory. Back in Aug 2003 it was already about 3-4Gigs</div></div><hr />

However, I've sat on the other side and worked some 36 hour days or 105 hour weeks, or sweated blood because budget &lt; the work that needed to be done to get things right.<br />
<br />
Because of this, I'm very sympathetic. I've seen very few non-trivial projects that wouldn't benefit from 20/20 hindsight. Sort of a &quot;Now that we've finished, let's redesign and rewrite the entire project. BTW, we now realize the second effort budget needs to be twice as much as the first.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think SoE has run out of good ideas. I do agree however that some of their ideas that seem innovative ought not to see the light of day. Also, the temptation to do what you've done &quot;successfully&quot; before is huge.<br />
<br />
But no, I shan't punish them. However when they are no longer selling what I want to buy, I'm unlikely to purchase it.<br />

/nod I can understand your reasoning.  But I also see that expansion after expansion they seem to do many of the exact same things wrong as the previous one.  Boats, as an example, have been an issue for how many expansions now?  And each time they seem to be able to enhance the bugs and break them even more.  This doesn't really bode well for learning from the past, does it?</div></div><hr />

Wow, what intellectual reasoning.   I'm sure we're all highly concerned that you might perceive us as hypocrites because we eventually cave in and buy an expansion against our better judgement.  Trust me friend, if I was to change my stand your opinion of me as a result wouldn't even be a consideration.</div></div><hr />

( back on topic ) i'd go as far to say that you won't be able to level past 65 without the new expansion; like having new models avilable only with SoL; like armour dyes and added bank_space only with PoP; and others i may have missed.<br />
<br />
but purchasing 10 tons of krap to allow one nice shiny terd is SoE's logic :D</div></div><hr />

I was happy back then charming ulthorks and stuff = )  But really, were there problems with content being bugged and other huge problems back then.  Trying to get people to boycott an expansion is like trying to get everyone to stop smoking.  You know that there's problems with it, but we've grown so used to it that the vast majority of players are going to shell out the cash for whatever SoE throws up.  Raising the level cap is a horrible, HORRIBLE gimmick to get people to buy OoW.  I think that's their trump card.  Even if the content is f-bombed all to heck, folks are still going to be able to level in previous content.  Had it not been for the cap being raised, a rally might've stood a chance : /</div></div><hr />

However, I've sat on the other side and worked some 36 hour days or 105 hour weeks, or sweated blood because budget &lt; the work that needed to be done to get things right.<br />
<br />
I used to work in a restaurant kitchen, and so I have  a pretty good sense of what the staff is up against when the lady of the house and I go out for a nibble.  I tip well, even when we can't really afford it, and I like to make that contribution cuz I know I'm coming back again and I want that friendly service when I do.  Or it's just a way of marking that I understand what a rough night on the floor is like.<br />
<br />
But sometimes, the chicken is dry, the sauce too salty, the service is bad, and the draft is flat, and I can't help but feel that some fellow in the management office is pinching the pennies to up the bottom line a little.  Mebbe money is tight, and they can't make ends meet. Either way, the only way I'll be back is if there's nothing else open and I'm starved.  After all, I'm a customer and not an investor, and I expect to feel I got my money's worth. <br />
<br />
We had already decided not to buy OoW, and will be cancelling our accounts as soon as we can get rid of all our shiny pixels to people who still enjoy the game.  But we don't have many guildies left who do, and it looks to me that many of 'em will be joining us shortly on CoH - even if a lot of us figger we are mostly waiting for WoW to come out, we're having more fun waiting there than in EQ territory.<br />
<br />
<br />
But no, I shan't punish them. However when they are no longer selling what I want to buy, I'm unlikely to purchase it.<br />
<br />
This is pretty much where I stand for now - altho it's likely that I would be boycotting OoW (I've seen nothing in it for my characters so far), the truth is that I don't think I'm a customer anymore.   The game still appeals to me, and I'd be playing it if I had different options, but I have more fun playing other games now; the last time I logged on, I found myself wondering why it had to take so long it took to start anything, and noticed that even travelling felt pointlessly long and tedious.  All I wanted to do was log off so that I could *play* a game.</div></div><hr />

Why should this one be any more real than the countless empty threats that threatened to bring EQ's playing base to a negative number?<br />
<br />
And really, just what of this game is so broken that's so horrible?  My guild is considered a high end guild according to SoE and we've done Uqua oh, 2 or 3 times before it's in the beatable state.  Aside from the raid 4 Ikk bug which is obviously not intentionally broken because it actually worked at one point until someone broke it, GoD has been working as we've been progressing through it.  Unless you're one of the few trailblazer guilds that actually played broken content I don't think any of you have a right to complain about unfinished expansions.  And even Uqua I think is merely SoE overestimating player's ability... and despite being  *broken* people came close to beating the second Tqiv.  People got the *broken* Barxt to 6%, and now people talk about how the retuned Barxt is too easy and letting all the gimps into Qvic.  Seems to me broken means just hard enough so that you can beat it but not others...<br />
<br />
Speaking of trailblazer guilds, where's the outrage that Qvic armor mobs respawn in one hour and are one groupable?  What about Ikk raids that started out barely harder than the Ikk trials and give ~Quarm level loot?  I don't see any outrage over those broken content.  Last I heard Inktu'ta was too easy and being made harder too, and I don't see the two guilds that beat it complain the content was broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  EQ ISN'T FUN FOR MOST OF US ANYMORE. It's no longer broken zones, or unbalanced classes, or bugs, or stupid quests, or bad zone layout, or poorly designed content... It's just not fun. I can't work up the energy to log in anymore, so I don't. My friends ask me to go kill XXXX with them, and it sounds so unappealing I've taken to just flat out saying no rather than hedging. I've spent countless hours on this game, I've paid tons of money into it and I know more about it than I do about my bachelor's degree. They stopped making the game fun, and so people should stop paying for new expansions that simply aren't making it fun. If you like the game, by all means go enjoy it. If you're just holding on because you think it'll be fixed, stop. It won't ever be as fun as it used to.</div></div><hr />

And as part of an enterainment budget, I probably made that back in savings from games I did not buy the first year EQ came out.<br />
<br />
But at this point they lack a consistant vision (and I use that word purposely) and having somehow gimed myself by not being in a guild that raids the EPs, I find that I can only use half of LDoN and all of GoD at release. <br />
<br />
Yes the game is top heavy. And that will be true for any game that is out 5 years+. But considering there is no non-raiding/small group path for me to see the new content, and I have grind and grind and grind for new gear (30 LDoNs for one peice) or new AA abilities with out being able to GET anywhere with it has comepltely turned me off. <br />
<br />
And, for some periods of EQ, which I have not tanked, I have amazing stats- 5k HP unbuffed, 1.2 or 1.3 K AC. But instead of playing a character (who will probably be in every on line game I play from now on), Kailyn is an alt in CoH and EQ has really broken the faith with me. <br />
<br />
Since the marketing knuckle heads aren't in control of EQ2 yet, I think there is hope there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like most people are jaded as opposed to actually having any problem with the game, which is understandable.<br />
<br />
There's actually a number of issues Phantron, which I imagine you don't see in your day to day play.  First off people who don't raid don't see any upgrade paths that don't require endless mindless hours of grinding.  It's not like you can go to a zone when you're a casual player and actually walk away at the end of the day with a shiney new BP or pair of legs that by some extreme fortune dropped, with there being like one single exception, BoT.  Most of the drops I'd see in the game these days are either bazaar trash or twink loot.   Not much of an incentive.   I used to black smith, except they haven't added anything to the game that is really within my reach to make since cultural armor was introduced, most everything better than cultural requires elemental drops, and extremely rare elemental drops.  So basically it comes down to, you can do old content for little or no rewards.  You can do LDoN endlessly for eventual rewards, if you can stomache the grinding.  Or you can do extremely hard newer content for little or no rewards.  <br />
<br />
Add to that the problems many people have suffered with having to deal with new video card drivers, replacing video cards sometimes even when the old one was supposedly supported, graphics problems, unexpected crashes in some zones for no apparent reason, getting caught in the terrain, having boats broken again and still (they might as well just yank them from the game completely), and so on and so on, people just aren't willing to spend more money to help support content for the raiding guilds and buggy content for themselves.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from within the community that we feel are important enough to push back our next expansion and spend time fixing the problems you have brought to our attention. At the end of the day, we work for you and it's important for us to demonstrate that we both understand and appreciate that. We're also inviting many members of the community to join us here at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the development team about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole. We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address.<br />
 <br />
I'm sorry if you feel we haven't been listening and reacting appropriately. We do our best to balance all of the needs and concerns you raise along with expanding Norrath and giving you new and wonderful things to do in EverQuest, but we do make mistakes. We've heard you loud and clear. <br />
 <br />
We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time to come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost is by listening to you.<br />

I have been playing since Kunark was first released and have seen alot of changes. Not all bad but definatly not all good. I don't mind grinding experience. We have all done it. I just remember when there were diffenrent places to do this and new zones to explore. Basically right now on my server if you are over 62 and not EP flagged you are in BoT. To be honest I like BoT but it does get really boring. Have done HoH but that is mainly dominated by people aggro kiting in the GY or kiting in the basements. I just want some of the fun back.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from within the community that we feel are important enough to push back our next expansion and spend time fixing the problems you have brought to our attention. At the end of the day, we work for you and it's important for us to demonstrate that we both understand and appreciate that. We're also inviting many members of the community to join us here at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the development team about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole. We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address.<br />
 <br />
I'm sorry if you feel we haven't been listening and reacting appropriately. We do our best to balance all of the needs and concerns you raise along with expanding Norrath and giving you new and wonderful things to do in EverQuest, but we do make mistakes. We've heard you loud and clear. <br />
 <br />
We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time to come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost is by listening to you.<br />

<br />
I'm willing to admit a certain amount of &quot;jadedness&quot; but when we have seen the the ongoing and recurring graphical/lock up issues of the past couple months:<br />
<br />
- the random lock ups in PoK and a few other places (usually requiring me to reboot my entire machine and spend some time getting 1018 errors)<br />
- the patching bugs where occasionally people are locking up and having to reboot just by running the patches<br />
- Players falling through the &quot;world&quot; seems to have been fixxed for now but for how long?<br />
- what about the bugs with the mobs popping through the floor and being semi-targetable (i.e. they bounce a bit so you can target them but you can't hit them when they bounce down). The same bug with players means that healers/buffers miss some chars who bob down into the floor.... sucks if your cleric can't heal you...<br />
- look at yesterday's patch: walls and corners are all screwed up again. Hell we have a whole new thread on it. <br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7343<br />
<br />
A lot of this is related to the last graphics engine revamp. OK, but so what? This is the kind of crap that makes me say &quot;why the hell are they pissing around and asking for even more of my money instead of fixxing this?&quot;. This doesn't touch the total absence of CSRs or some of the minor issues. Add in the fact that they are trying to make the next expansion a &quot;must have&quot; by upping the levels, so those that don't buy it become obsolete, and my anger/frustration level rises and I know I am not alone.<br />
<br />
I am not saying I never want to see another EQ expansion, but I think they have issues to address before they come out with more.</div></div><hr />

Unless you're one of the few trailblazer guilds that actually played broken content I don't think any of you have a right to complain about unfinished expansions.&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
so the only broken content is in zones ive never played in? how do i know its broken then? <br />
<br />
maybe its because many of the luclin and pop zones that used to be very playable for me are now so laggy and the mobs warp around so much that my caster classes even with foe cannot keep from getting hit now? dont tell me worn out line that reduced performance is the price we have to pay to have an upgraded interface. ive heard that line an amazing amount of times considering how self-contradictory it is. ldon is fairly lag free as are in general the old world zones including kunark and velius. but let me take one step into luclin pop or ykesha and my computer chokes. these devs know nothing about code optimization. some will try to tell me that rendering 50 mobs and 50 players in my clip plane requires 100million instructions to be done in a plausible manner and this is why my 533 machine can only get 5 frames per second. this is absolute nonsense especially when you consider that the large bulk of the rendering belongs in the graphics card not the main cpu. even if it were true it doesnt explain why mobs warp all over the place or why the mob i have targetted is rendered in a spot 1-2 seconds (5-10 frames) behind where it belongs. it sure doesnt explain my slow mouse. ive heard for years that people who use a mouse are a lower evolutionary class than those that hotkey everything. how long does it take to draw a mouse pointer anyway? why does the game ignore my mouse clicks and why has it done so for 4 1/2 years? i honestly cannot remember running an application on my computer EVER that ignored my mouse clicks.<br />
<br />
so sony's solution? to spam up my hard drive with a bunch of tutorial files! how much dev time did they spend writing all that code?<br />
<br />
i have nothing against adding graphical gimickery that eats through processing power if those features could be turned off. but in my experience the only thing that can be turned off is the display of the graphics content without being able to turn off the processor usage required by those same routines. i remember the days i started this game with a 128mb machine and 32mb graphics card. there was no lag whatsoever in the newbie zones i hunted in other than that provided by my 56k modem on a bad day. we never even discussed lag back then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Glatius and Kailyn (sp?) both expressed my frustrations nicely... As our group's (and guild's) main tank i am looking at spending many hours in upper-end velious and luclin encounters just to get good enough gear to begin to explore the new GoD expansion I paid $30 for - so if I'm lucky, my small friends-and-family guild and I will be able to start playing in GoD in like 6 months. Why the H3LL am I gonna spend money on OoW when I can't even play GoD yet? The WHOLE GoD expansion was tuned to high-end players with high-end gear. (Has the &quot;re-tune&quot; made it any more accessable to casual players? I haven't heard.)<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if there were some alternative paths to aquire decent upgrades for smaller guilds and casual players (LDoN was a good start). I don't mind Uber Guilds getting better drops from Uber Boss Mobs, but there should be an alternative, slightly longer path to a slightly lesser reward for those of us who aren't in uber raid guilds.</div></div><hr />

I was happy back then charming ulthorks and stuff = ) But really, were there problems with content being bugged and other huge problems back then. &quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, there were. NToV was extremely bugged for a long time; Arroynar warping just to give an example. Sleeper's Tomb was another (see Conquest situation). And there were plenty of cockblocks because the general rule of thumb was that if you killed Arry, you had dibs on the rest of NToV (because his difficulty level was on par with every other dragon except Vyemm). Or opening the door on another guild doing HoV, thats another prime one. There were LOTS of problems with the expansion. BUT, the expansion was original. It was brilliantly designed. You could tell there was actual effort put into creating the zones. My character was level 6 when Velious came out and I was 100% sure I would never see a drop of SoV content. I bought the expansion on the second day it came out, even though it wasn't inflated with false marketting strategies such as increased level cap or &quot;epic 2.0 omg&quot;; that how good Velious was. The same thing held true for Planes of Power, because while there were quite a bit of people who complained about the broken content, the expansion was great as a whole because it was well-designed, whereas Luclin, which was significantly less bugged throughout, was far less interesting and far less liked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This kind of boycotting/I'm leaving EQ deal has only been done about a few hundreds times. Why should this one be any more real than the countless empty threats that threatened to bring EQ's playing base to a negative number?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because this time it's actually happening. Because for the first time, EQ has real competition in the MMORPG market; the FFXI player-base has already surpassed EQ's, EQ's playerbase has actually dipped over 15,000 over the last 2-3 months. CoH broken 100k subscribers about 4 weeks ago. And ultimately, because people are actually being exposed to better products and better availability right now. TO give an example, imagine that right now, 5 other companies released better operating systems with no compatibility issues and less problems than Windows. Tell me, if people started boycotting Windows then, would it be different from before, when they were essentially a monopoly? Yes it would.<br />
<br />
&quot;The older expansion stuff are small groupable content. Of course you can't small group cutting edge stuff without cutting edge gear.<br />
<br />
Sounds like most people are jaded as opposed to actually having any problem with the game, which is understandable.&quot;<br />
<br />
I call bs. This your pretencious argument here is laughable. The bottom line is, GoD is not fun. I pre-ordered it, I played through the sewers and Vxed and Tipt and other zones around; the game simply wasn't fun. This has been the case for a LOT of people; if you want proof, ask around and quite a few guilds (including mine which I retired from, along with every raiding guild on our server); the attendance levels from PoTime to off-night GoD drops immensely. <br />
<br />
Bottom line; whatever EQ &quot;had&quot;, whatever that &quot;feeling&quot; was that you couldn't explain, and why you logged in night after night, even though there were tons of better games out there, it's gone. The mystique and the vision left with it. It's become nothing more than a fading cash crop and a beta test for EQ-2.</div></div><hr />

I suppose you can lump in KT and Ikkinz as zones unreachable by the masses, even though it's not as out of reach as people make it sound like.  I'm not really sure what the 'casual' wants anymore.  The whole point of the easy to get gear in GoD was balanced by their considerable difficulty.  When we get recruit_01 that gets pummeled in Qvic by a Msha the first thing we tell them is to go get an Ikkinz trial ring.  Now obviously as a casual you can't just put on a SWAT team and farm those easily but that's the difference between playing a lot or casual.  So do you want to be able to get stuff the ubers get for just being able to step inside Kod'taz (which in these days means you probably know how to charm a Pooka, in all likelihood)?

<br />
FF11's bogus numbers from a country where the players actively shun anything that's not made in Japan doesn't impress me.  The loss of ~15-30k due to FF11 is probably about the same order as the damage done by DAoC (clearly its population came from somewhere).  Only the completely clueless or SOE staff would actually believe EQ's numbers will never decline.  Anyway, it's not like you're boycotting this game out of the love of it anything along these lines.  You're just complaining like you always have.  I don't claim to know how to solve EQ's problems but I am certain if you take the opinion of this thread or the SoE meeting thread you'll end up with a far worse game than what we got right now.</div></div><hr />

Go read the thread on woody's site (www.gucomics.com) about what we casual (or even hard core but time impaired) players want. But a lot of it will boil down to:<br />
<br />
1) Fix the NGE<br />
2) Fix Quests<br />
3) Give a vaible upgrade path to those that can't/don't want to join a 72 man raiding guild to get EQ to the next level. The differances between the top warriors and those of us stuck in LDoN is huge--EP+ warriors can have x2 the HP, 1.5 the AC, etc. While there needs to be a gap between the uber and the non-uber--this is WAY too much.<br />
4) In GoD SOE basically got me to buy an expantion I can not use. Nor can I ever see using it untill I hit the lotto, quit my job and join an uber guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You use this as an example of how things worked right before, therefore they should be working fine now.  Except you're assuming everyone agrees that they were working right in PoP.  I don't think a lot of us agree.  Most of PoP is still inaccessible for the majority of the casual players.  And it will be for the foreseeable future.  People don't like paying for expansions where not just a small amount of content will be inaccessible but rather by far the majority.  It gets tiring to spend $40 to get less than $20 worth of use.  And it's not just flags, it's the combination of flags and gear requirements. <br />
<br />
I suppose you can lump in KT and Ikkinz as zones unreachable by the masses, even though it's not as out of reach as people make it sound like. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's not as far out of reach.  But if you're getting owned in PoP, you're sure not going to jump into GoD with both feet, now are you?  PoP for the most part isn't particularly fun for the casual player.  You're supposed to have &quot;geared up&quot; to proceed in PoP.  You're supposed to have &quot;AAed up&quot; to proceed in PoP.  But the only ways to gear up are to camp plat for months to buy ornate molds, camp BoT for months to hope to win ornate molds, if some blood sucking caster type doesn't snake you out of them so he can twink his alt or sell them in the bazaar, or you can hunt in LDoN for literally months, if not years, depending on the amount of time you want to spend at it each week.<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what the 'casual' wants anymore. <br />
<br />
Simple, reasonable progression that's fun, not work.  Zone drops that even someone who isn't already elemental plane geared can actually get, use, and feel like their toon has been improved in some significant fashion.  Having +5 magic resist augments dropping in a LDoN doesn't make a person feel like they've accomplished squat.  GoD is over most casual player's heads, and will be until probably OoW when they up the level cap.  But here is the real kicker, it used to be that you could go play in a zone and if you got lucky by the end of the day you'd acquired something of value for your toon.  That concept has gone by the way side in the majority of content that casual players can easily reach.   Many of the initial zones in the new expansions don't have jack for drops.  The real drops don't start until you get three or four zones in.  So the ubers quickly move on in and start reaping rewards, while the casuals stand around on the fringes and go, wtf?  I paid $40 for this crap?  Ubers are already getting raid loot, why should the zones only they can really play in also be the only ones that drop any real loot?  It doesn't have to be equal to raid loot, but damn, there should be something, right?  I mean progression shouldn't be just for uber raiders or people who can commit uber time?  Or should it?  If the answer is yes it should, SoE needs to just come out and say that if you aren't willing to raid and you don't want to grind AAs and brotherhood points endlessly, EQ isn't the game for you.  Then those of us who think that idea sucks can just take our business elsewhere and stop worrying about the possibility that they'll fix things and the game will go back to being fun, like it was once upon a time.<br />

I hate this attitude that many uber players have.  It's the &quot;we earned it, you don't deserve anything even remotely similar to it unless you earn it the exact same way, biatch!&quot;  Now, I know you probably don't really think that way, but it does come off in that fashion.  Here's the deal, the ubers are all concerned about the casuals not getting the same rewards they did without putting forth the same effort.  Well, casuals aren't saying they want &quot;the same&quot; rewards.  They just want freaking rewards!  It doesn't have to be equal to uber gear, but it does have to be progression, and it does have to be reasonably available without making it &quot;work&quot;.  And if SoE can't come up with that, then they really need to pull the plug on the game for everyone but the uber players now.  People want to log on, go someplace to hunt, and maybe get a fricking bone at the end of the day!</div></div><hr />

If you're gonna do this, have the conviction to stick it thru.  I haven't bought an EQ expansion since LoY, and I don't feel I missed a thing. &quot;Sticking it to the man&quot; is not waiting a week to buy the expansion.  You need to make them rethink their development process, and caving a week later because all your friends are level 70 and are saying how &quot;Cool&quot; the new zones are is just going to leave you disappointed in 2 months when you realize how shitty that stuff really is compared to what you spent on it.</div></div><hr />

What you asked for has already happenned in GoD.   If you look at that magelo link, you'll see that every single item can be attained in 1-2 groups in Luclin, Pre-Elemental PoP, LDoN and GoD.   More often than not, it's single group stuff.    <br />
<br />
The stuff is out there for casual players, the caveat probably being that you have a &quot;regular group&quot; who knows how to play well.    <br />

There's a guild on my server who's not elemental at all, they're raping the crap out of KodTaz/Ikkinz and bypassing the whole &quot;Raid the Elementals to gear up&quot; phase.    Every time I walk into Kod Taz I see one to two groups of these guys off doin something getting great exp and insane drops without going through too much trauma at all.  <br />
<br />
I think what's happenned primarily is that people have 'Heard it from a friend' that it's 'too hard', and have foregone GoD altogether, which is a baleful shame in my eyes, it's a fantastic expansion with great exp, great loot and a LOT of single group content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe so Frodlin, but I'm not convinced.  Most casual players aren't going to have a regular group, that's kind of part of what makes them casual.  And everyone has said GoD is tougher than PoP, so if people felt undergeared, under AAed, and owned most places in PoP, why on god's green earth are they going to waste their time trying to get a pick up group in GoD?  I mean come on, Warriors who raid buff to around 7.5K aren't exactly going to be having an easy time of it in GoD, are they now?  And if the prerequisite to playing in GoD is I go out and grind a couple of hundred AA so I can actually play acceptably, if I can find that pickup group that isn't a complete cluster fuck from the word go, then SoE can forget about it.  I'll take my money someplace where I'm not required to spend hundreds of hours grinding just to use an expansion, thank you very much.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you may be having a wonderful time.  You may think GoD is the best thing since sliced bread.  But those of us who aren't geared to the eyeballs don't want to have to get on the hamster treadmill just to play an expansion and get reasonable progression.  That's not fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what does it look like with say...less than 5k in LDoN rewards? That would be 100 LDoNs for the average player. Which, I would say, is still well north of way too many.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing more than a &quot;casual&quot; player would be able to reasonably achieve.  And of course several of the pieces are ornate, so he would have had to gathered the plat or camped BoT to get them, right?  And then most every piece has a pretty signficant augment, how much time in LDoN did you assume he would be spending?  There are a number of factors there that don't strike me as a &quot;casual&quot; player, but rather someone who plays religiously, but doesn't raid high end content per se, but probably groups with a regular group in PoP, LDoN, and I'm guessing GoD, and has done so for months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BS.  Make them offer the exact same rewards that anyone else can get.  Sure make it take more time.  Easier work should soak up more time, if you want the same reward, or why do hard raids at all.<br />
<br />
GOD imho shows up like this:<br />
1) offers Runspeed 5, but yet gives mobs bard speed (indoors)<br />
2) mobs are harder then Time mobs, yet drop less loot Time = 3 drops, rare 4.  God drops 1 to 2 (ok 3 if you include the tae stone)  And the loot aint all that much better, for the BS you got to go through to get it.<br />
3) bug bug bug and oh btw........ buggy<br />
4) absolutely nothing worth while in tradeskilling.  The ultra rare drops, make subpar items *nothing new really, tradeskillers been getting the shaft for a long time*<br />
5) No vision.  Absolutely none.  I mean really what is the story line?  We got these cave people, we dont know who or what they are, but they got gear better then time.<br />
6) Travel.  Yeah i am an old player 12/24/99, and used to the days of running from A to B.  But wth?  going from fast traveling to stoneage traveling is kind of,,,ummm backwards?  And i dont care who tells you,, CR's are not what makes raiding fun.  <br />
<br />
7** sort of tied into GOD ** is this gimp idea of endurance and 2nd taunts, mixed in with disc being double punished for being used.<br />
<br />
 I mean really, 2 taunts?  why, you that lazy you cant fix the one we STILL depend on?  Endurance is mana, slice it how you choose, but thats all it is, when we dont have it, we can incite *cast*.  <br />
<br />
Disc now is on a time, and burns endurance.  Thanks, it was better before.  Just a bit longer between uses.<br />
<br />
You can not tell me , and many millions of others, that GOD was a success.  Have you noticed many highend guilds (not players) just quitting?  Personally i dont think WoW is gonna be anymore of a game then DAoC is.  Its just new eye candy atm.  But time will prove that.<br />
<br />
OoW will be nothing but:<br />
<br />
A. Lvl 70 and more AA =  SOE screwed up, and now you have to grind to fix it.  YO~!  wake up, people are sick of grinding!  Shoving spikes under our toe nails is more pleasurable.<br />
<br />
B.  Whats this gonna offer?  Nothing but high end content, that is as retarded as Gates of Suck is.<br />
<br />
C.  Class titles.  Haha, we are actually gonna pay for that?<br />
<br />
D.  Tradeskills  *well being a master in all tradeskills 250 in all *well fishing is 200*, i have yet to see an item made at the level of play i do, that could or even would be considered good enough to put on a lvl 1 twink*  GOD has the worst tradeskill table imagined in EQ.<br />
<br />
E.  Quests.  Well the game name should say something, but like every quest ever put out, its either TOOOOOOO LOONNGG, or  CAMPED , or drops off a mob that takes 832 members to kill.  Not 839 people, cuz then you would be called a Zerg guild that sploited.<br />
<br />
F.  Epic 2.0.1.9.a subsection 3.   Um i still have yet to figure out how you could claim an epic item epic, if its not able to be done a lone.  What about being epic is it, by taking a guild or cheat to obtain?  A true epic is done by ones self.  Cong SOE on mislabeling an item, and farther seperating the elite *which left* and the casual player.<br />
<br />
SOE needs to see that the power gamers, are gone, whole guilds have left.  Honestly i say see ya.  You beat EQ.   If they dont work around that, then they are as good as over.<br />
<br />
EQ could have been / could be much better, if you got more vision then just.  Flags/Keys/Trials to get to X mob before the next guild, and farm it.  Get some quests, get some tradeskills, get some group fun (equal to raid loot) and quit thinking LDON is a viable tradeoff.<br />
<br />
*btw* this whole &quot;we cant sell aug back, gear back and get some pts back&quot; is hurting you more then your ego is.  Why waste time to aug a BoC, then get ultra lucky on a BOW drop, to have to do 20+ more runs to aug that........ Its a waste of players time, and like grinding, we're sick of it.  Just an FYI though, i mean i could be wrong.<br />

<br />
The reward in GoD is there.  Maybe too easily obtained.  It's not the game's problem that people are too afraid to even take chances.  Then again, I once suggested taking losses on purpose on hard LDoN to farm gear and that suggestion was met with a lot of 'but what about my record'.  To get any of the good single group items would require more than just having a loss on your record, so maybe it's asking too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you dont see causal players getting good loot in new expansions it is usualy because it is the bigger guilds that trial blaze finding the new content and how to beat it post spoilers debug the content. You DONT see drops in the first zones not because they are not there but because big guilds skip to the content that is revelent or chalangeing to them and do that. They dont farm lower level mobs that drop items well below what they have atm, there is no use. If anything you can blame raiders for not finding the items you want and posting spoilers that you can easily access, But rest assured they are there if you want to put the time in to find them.</div></div><hr />

Cool, so in your opinion everything is nifty kean for the casual player and if we don't like it then we should just take our money elsewhere.  Bueno, that's exactly what we're going to be doing, in droves.  Watch and see if I'm wrong.  If OoW is just GoDplus, then you can pretty much count on people bugging out to things that are A) fun, B) aren't expecting you to lay down cash for crap every six months that you can't even freaking use without having invested hundreds of man hours in a previous expansion that you can't even freaking use without investing hundreds of man hours in the expansion before that one.<br />
<br />
Bottom line.  The game is supposed to be fun.  For a big chunk of us, it isn't any more.  Either they fix it or they suffer the foreseeable consequences.  It's a very simple equation.</div></div><hr />

Oh bullshit.  What is being asked for is this.  I work as an orderly.  Every year the doctors get a pay raise.  Every year I get a much smaller percentage increase or I get none.  For several years now the only way I can get additional money is to work a hell of a lot of overtime.  I don't like overtime.  I don't want to be working overtime.  I grant you the doctors work a hell of a lot of overtime, but they're also hugely rewarded for that overtime, while I'm not.  So what I want is a feaking decent pay raise or me and people like me are going on strike, capish?</div></div><hr />

Casuals aren't look to get the same equipment that raiders get, or even 80% of it.  But we actually want an upgrade.  <br />
<br />
Raiders and Casuals want the exact same thing.  Advancement.  We all want to know our time is well spent in the game, no matter our play style...raiding or grouping.  Right?<br />
<br />
Raiding in GoD/Elemental/Time...you get access to 100-200hp+ equipment with awesome stats/saves/effects.  On the other hand, casuals have to do LDoN for 2-4 weeks to get a single upgrade, with slots open so you can get some stats/saves/effects.  More if they have real life issues, exp grinding in PoP, or their guild wants to do raids or events.  It would take me personally about a month per upgrade, doing nothing but LDoN.  That gets pretty damn boring, if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Considering I'll probably get $10, if that, out of the expansion (base $30)...I'll wait until the expansion goes down to $10.  At least then I can get what I paid for.</div></div><hr />

You did not have to be uber to get near the best gear in the game and those of us not willing or able to sacrifice (how fucked up a concept is that) for the game could say, yes, while it may take me a year longer to farm reets and raid Trak, there is nothing but time baring my way. While I can probably get a raid for a dragon together its a completely differnt story to organize a guild for PoP.<br />

There is no way I see for me to get to the 2,000 AC/10,000 HP level that is needed to get GoD+. Heck that is a 700 AC/ 5,100 HP jump from where I am now.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure you can do it with the tank you have made, but the shit wouldn't be an upgrade for him anymore at that point.  You need to actually be able to acquire the shit with lesser gear for it to be an upgrade, and GoD sure doesn't sound like that with it being a hard version of PoP.</div></div><hr />

And yes you can do that with a low mana pool/FT healer.  Just use 2 like even the almighty Ubers did when we were doing Ikkinz for the first few times.  Some people even use 3.  It is not my nor the game's concerns that you expect to beat some of these pretty challenging single group encounters that required pretty specialized groups from the ubers and you can't be bothered to find a second cleric as a casual player.  Yes the Pixtt Annihlator will demolish you if you have one low mana pool cleric with FT5.  That's why you get two instead of one clerics if that's all you got.<br />
<br />
If by fun you mean accessing more zones, the zones blocked by Uqua are all raiding zones.  The instanced raiding zones don't even have any remote use for 6 people anyway.  So that leaves you with Qvic and Txevu as zones that you can presumably do something in but aren't reachable.</div></div><hr />

I tank hard ldons just fine with a decent healer but everything I've read and most people in game seem to think taking a 5.5k / 1300 ac tank into GoD sewers is suicide. I'm seriously not excited about the thought of grinding out another 100+ aa in ldon's / bot, so the possibility of actually doing the sewers is pretty exciting if it's reasonable.</div></div><hr />

Plant might be a bit tougher than LDoN Hard but it's hard to tell with the attack nerf to GoD mobs.  The non Plant sewers parts are slightly easier than LDoN hard.  Pulls in general in Sewers aren't too bad, though the roamers can be a real pain.  But dealing with that isn't dependent on your gear.  One time I had 5 mobs roam to a spot while 3 guys were afk and we sure went down pretty fast, uber or not.  Most likely your group WILL wipe at some point in the sewers because someone will screw it up eventually.  Better gear just lets you have more room to screw up.  Anyway the margin of error in your group would most likely be dependent on your CC/slower as opposed to the tank anyway (dead CC = dead group usually).<br />
<br />
Sewers aren't much for XP grind though besides Plant.  The other 3 zones all seem to have low level mobs that still hit like EP mobs.  But the loot off the named sure are pretty nice.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if my gear makes me a gimp, an average warrior or what. More importantly, I don't care. <br />
<br />
What I do know is what I can do with my current gear and AAs<br />
<br />
1. I can tank hard LDoNs.<br />
2. I duo Qinimi trash and a few of the named with just my partner's (shaman) buffs.<br />
3. I tank in Tactics with just a druid for the main healer and we don't have to take med breaks so I don't think I qualify as a mana sponge.<br />
4. I have every intention of doing single group GoD trials within the next month with just my casual guild friends. I can't guarantee we'll succeed on the first try but I can guarantee we'll have fun pushing our limits.<br />
<br />
I don't have 5k hps unbuffed yet, I don't have all the defensive AAs done, I don't break 1.4k AC unless i'm raid buffed and yet I still manage to do the things raiding warriors are saying I'm not geared/AA'd to do.<br />
<br />
Call me contrary if you like but I think the effort it takes me, Joe Casual, to get upgrades is just fine. I think casual warriors have been misled by raiding warrior advice and gotten a tad pussified, or they've been turned down groups by spineless casters not willing to take a few chances on a non-elementally geared warrior and gotten gunshy.</div></div><hr />

Form your group appropriately and there's no mob in the sewers you can't do.   Furthermore, your group will benfit from the spells that drop in there anyhow, enabling you to do Vxed/Tipt.   Do them in order, Vxed isn't that hard, but the mobs do hit hard, so take it slowly at first, farm some nameds, get some augs, get those nice Chavoor legs, and go to town.    Then you'll find Tipt to be very similar, although it'll take a few tries before you figure out how to make it to Jhiru.

<br />
No, its not just two uber geared warriors. You bought the GoD hype and now believe you can't do anything there without elemental gear.<br />
<br />
You would be wrong.<br />
<br />
Don't like the ornate drop rate in BoT? Do the flag quest for Tactics and go kill the single groupable names there. That's where my hunting partner got her ornate chain bracer pattern.<br />
<br />
The early GoD zones have single group trials that are about the same difficulty as hard LDoNs. I haven't done them myself but I have casual friends whose abilities I trust and they have done them. <br />
<br />
I went and checked out Natimbi and Qinimi  before  they were made easier and was disappointed for letting myself be convinced I wasn't geared up enough to handle it. Three whole months I could have been working on the early trials wasted because I didn't go check it out myself.<br />
<br />
This board is full of valuable info, I don't deny it, but when it comes to figuring out  what casuals can and can't do raiders are probably not the people we need to ask. A warrior who's been farming Time for 6 months or longer just doesn't know what the game is like at our level anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because you are having hard times getting skilled players together for pickup groups to beat these trials does not mean that the trials or content is in fact broken or need to be adjusted.<br />
<br />
GoD is tough, there is no two ways about it but why have it any other way? If it's tuned down to the point that undergeared, underskilled players are able to consistently win the trials then the content is truly broken.<br />
<br />
Accomodating the lowest common denominator is not a recipe for success in this game or anywhere for that matter.<br />
<br />
Challenging people, making them earn their way and gain accomplishments over time is the way I personally prefer and for the most part GoD fits that bill.  Sure some content needed to be tuned but inevitably that will always be true but to alter the progression path is just not the answer imo.<br />
<br />
GoD and trials require teamwork and skill, gear helps but until you get to the trials past vxed it's not really as much of the problem as simply being a skilled player who does his role well.<br />
<br />
Through proper group makeup, use of disciplines and skill/teamwork, just about anyone is going to be able to put their foot into Kodtaz, blaming SoE  and the content for problems getting there is just shifting blame.<br />
<br />
In my opinion GoD shouldn't be a type of place where you can just slap together 6 /lfg people and go off and be successful.  If that means some nights you'll be doing LDoN over GoD then so be it.</div></div><hr />

You know what, that's fine.  If that's the approach SoE wants to take, then more power to them, really.  Because they'll make it clear that in fact the money from casual players really isn't of interest, it's more important they give in to the desires of the uber players and make the content challenging for them.  You know, I imagine that a large number of casual players will be happy to have a good reason to go shopping elsewhere for a MMORP and then when the number of expansions ordered drops through the floor and SoE has to raise the price to justify even creating them, then the ubers can just happily fork over the extra cash knowing that they're buying their &quot;challenge&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the problem though. A lot of times uber opinions of what it takes to tank as a casual warrior are wrong.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take ND3/CA3/CS3, much less LR5/ID5, to tank hard LDoNs. It helps and that can't be denied, but its not required. And I don't bleed my healers dry when we do them.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take 2xAnger3 augments and 5 pieces of ornate/LDoN armor to tank nameds in the early GoD zones.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take +40 hp augments in every slot possible to MT for a pickup raid in Tier 1 or 2 PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
What it does take for all these things to happen is a warrior confident in himself and his hunting partners. It takes time to find a group of people competent enough to do the difficult things without failing every time or able to accept that death might happen. Raid guilds have their apping process to do most of that for them, we casuals have to suffer sifting through the chaff of the average pickup group to find the other casuals who have a clue.</div></div><hr />

I've been a member of three guilds, one a family style guild and two that were raiding guilds.  And I've been guildless for a long time.  In both the family style guild and the raiding guild there were idiots who couldn't play their class to save their life.  These people were more frequent in the family style guild though, for one reason or another.  And through my long history of pickup groups I've found that you're almost certain in any group of 5 random strangers to be stuck with one that is a complete moron while one or two others will be marginal.<br />
<br />
If the requirement for a casual player to experience an expansion is to make certain that they have an on the ball group every time they play and otherwise expect to be spending hours on CR, then casual players won't play in the expansion.  They won't be willing, for the most part, to risk the their time and the frustration involved with trying to organize exactly the right group with exactly the right players from a random selection of available people.<br />
<br />
And if they aren't comfortable playing in the expansion, the won't buy it or they certainly won't buy further expansions along the same lines.  Why continue to purchase add ons to content you won't and don't use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gear obviously allow you to put 6 random whatever uber gear players to beat something.  There's no denying that.  But you'll be surprised the kind of things you can do without having good gear if you actually tried...<br />
<br />
If you want to apporach these trials as if they're something 6 random LFG can do, of course you'll get slapped silly.  Back when Jhiru was cutting edge my group actually sat down and discussed what kind of heals, who disc what and when, and how long the fight can go, who gets rampage, and so on.  We didn't just charge in to Jhiru and expect him to die, which seems to be the kind of effort people expect to spend to win.  Actually, that's being too generous.  Most people don't even get to where you can wipe and give up long before then.<br />
<br />
And if you want something that you can put 6 random lfgs together, that's called LDoN normal.  If the loot in LDoN normal is not good enugh for you, maybe you should start looking at LDoN Hard or early GoD zones.  <br />
<br />
And Tipt/Vxed is really a joke for the difficulty involved.  If you've a snarer and an enchanter that doesn't suck, you can kill anything in Vxed and anything besides Jhiru with no risk at all (for named just disc furious and your pooka will kill the named before furious runs out).  And no gear doesn't matter because no enchanter no matter how uber can stand against a dual wielding hasted Pooka.  So how about show some of the skills people claim to have but are being oppressed by the game's horrible design, huh?  Oh wait you need Total Domination 3, but that's what 12 AAs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you trying to say that the content should be tuned so that any riff-raff pickup group able to be put together at any time of day should be able to successfully complete the GoD trials?<br />
<br />
Let me ask you this, if there were other trials to get into a &quot;Kod'Taz Lite&quot; zone, would that be sufficient in an expansion?<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet we'd still see posts on this thread and across the EQ forums of people still complaining that it's unfair that their pickup groups aren't able to do vxed/tipt and beyond.<br />
<br />
It often seems that any content that requires flags, keys, trials or anything geared to those who choose to be a part of a guild focused on progression with lots of members is &quot;faulty&quot; in the eyes of many casual players.<br />
<br />
I don't see a problem personally with parts of expansions that will never be seen by people because they choose to not take part in that type of guild needed to progress there. <br />
<br />
Anyone having that hard of a time in god trials and vxed/tipt is actually going to be benefiting from the loot that is dropping there and getting pretty good experiance and building their aa's up as time goes by.  Sure maybe it will take them 30-40 tries to win but maybe they would have obtained 4-5 upgrades during that time to make the trials easier for them.  <br />
<br />
Your right though, if your style of game play and your choice of guilds isn't putting enough guildies around that have learned to work together as a team on a regular basis than these expansions may very well not be for you however I don't think that means the expansion is flawed, it just means you aren't part of it's target audience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, so what's the point of buying an expansion when LDoN easy is supposed to be good enough for us?  Why should we waste our money?  So what if we consider LDoN boring as hell, we really shouldn't expect to exp anywhere else without a solid on the ball group, right?  Therefore there's no need to spend the money....  I'm sure SoE will endorse that concept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, this is fine, if that's the approach SoE wants to take.  But don't package crap as being for &quot;levels 50 and up&quot; when in fact it's really for level 65s with either uber gear or a seriously on the ball group with two healers.  If you feel that people should have content that they never see, don't expect them to be willing to fork over the bucks for that content, how much easier can that get?  I don't get to see the content, I don't pay for the content.  Pretty easy formula, no?</div></div><hr />

RvR just doesn't work that way.  Glyphed Prayer Ring from Ikk 1 group trials is probably the most out of balanced RvR item (in favor of players) in the game.  <br />
<br />
Ubers used 2 healers too on some of those trials when we're learning them.  Over time they become easier due to knowledge and more gear.  Why do you expect not to use a stacked group, being a casual player, when the ubers started those trials with stacked groups and significantly better gear (and most likely skill too.  The very best equipped ubers tend to be the best players)?  <br />
<br />
Win it once and when you know what it takes to win, then you can start adjusting downward to accomodate for the weaker links.  That's what the ubers did.  The first win is always the hardest.  If no one in your group knows how to win, of course you should expect to go the extra mile in organization/preparation to win.</div></div><hr />

You misunderstand.  I'm not expecting anything.  I'm just making it clear what my stand is.  If SoE want's to design content in this fashion, that's fine.  Just market it appropriately and don't be surprised when people who can't do the content as designed decline to purchase the expansion.  If we're not going to be allowed reasonable progression through previous content in order to gear up to do current content, we just won't pay for new content, got it?  It has nothing to do with &quot;expecting&quot; SoE to do anything.  It has everything to do with a certain segment of the playing population not having their particular playing style supported beyond a certain point.  Why continue to throw good money after bad when you buy an expansion you know you're going to get very little use out of by buying a follow on expansion?</div></div><hr />

Barindu, riwii, and ferubi are all open without flagging. They aren't exactly lying, regardless of whether or not you feel the content is accessible. I do appreciate that GoD appears to have lots of good single group content, although it's accessibility to non-ep+ geared folks is still in debate.<br />

It's not as if you could get into more than 4 xp zones without flagging when PoP came out...</div></div><hr />

Good logic.  Now lets go back a step there.<br />
<br />
How many zones couldn't I get into when Luclin came out?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that would be Vex Thal and that's it.<br />
<br />
Now velious?  Sleepers Tomb, and Plane of Mischief being located where it is kinda blocked off that content.<br />
<br />
Kunark?  Veeshan's Peak.  You can't even count Seb and HS because they were both reasonable quests to complete.<br />
<br />
Now, when did people stop enjoying this game?  Oh ya, right around the time when Luclin came out, and then they started pulling more bullshit locking us out of zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's Abysmal, Natimbi, Barindu, Qinimi, Riwwi, Ferubi, and several sewer zones open from the gate.   Then Vxed and Tipt, where only one member of your group needs a flag to get the instance to, although you get the flags simply by doing sewers (or a raid encounter).   It's actually significantly more available than PoP when it started and MUCH easier to access additional zones.    The gear/spells in sewers are nice, the augs that drop in Ferubi, the saleable gear that drops in Riwwi are all pretty nice.   Heck, I'd have probably payed the money to just have the Riwwi coliseum, that place rules... nothing like fighting while being heckled by 2 comic demons reminiscent of the 2 old muppet guys.   In the coliseum, the little event for the BiC quest is rather fun as well.<br />
<br />
My primary complaint about GoD has nothing to do with content, there's LOTS of content for all levels of play.   My primary complaint has to do with the aesthetics.    There's definitely not enough mob models, and it doesn't really ever change... you got Taelosians, Taelosian Ghosts, Mastruqs, Ukuns, RaTuks, Nocs, Anueks, Ixts, snake chicks, kyvs, crags, hynids and Golems.   <br />
<br />
And pookas which are mephit ripoffs.<br />
<br />
Oh and Zun Muram Votal, which seems so far to be the only real unique mob model in the expansion.<br />
<br />
Insofar as playability is concerned, it really is a great expansion.   I can kind of see what Glatius is talking about, which is &quot;I roll the dice for a group, and the retardation level can be pretty high at times, and there's little room for compensation for my retarded groupmates&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't roll the dice.  I rarely do.  Group with people you know...casual players have friends, right?  You got to level 65, so I'd presume you made some friends along the way who don't suck.<br />
<br />
Take a group to Riwwi.  Try to start some events.  Take a group to ferubi, see how deep you can get.  Take a group to Vxed, or the sewers.<br />
<br />
I mean, really.  These expansions are not locking out any casual players but the ones who want to be more than casual players.  If you want to get the 150+ hp/mana loot, you can't be a casual player.<br />
<br />
Upon release, you could zone in to:<br />
Abysmal<br />
Natimbi<br />
Qinimi<br />
Ferubi<br />
Riwwi<br />
Vxed / Tipt<br />
Sewers<br />
<br />
The only places you CAN'T zone in:<br />
Kod Taz<br />
Ikkinz<br />
Yxxta<br />
Uqua<br />
Qvic and the zones off it, who I can't remember<br />
<br />
At level 50, you can do Natimbi (sorta like how at 35 in Velious, you could only do some of the content)<br />
<br />
At level 60, you can do Natimbi, Barindu, Riwwi<br />
<br />
At level 65, you can do Ferubi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Sewers<br />
<br />
Once you have the gear from all the previous content, plus gear from previous expansions (that don't require raids -- ornate for example), you can do all the single-group content that is opened up to you as of that point.  You should be able to get into Kod Taz as an unguilded (or non-EP guilded) character and exp there.  You will not be able to do any Ikkinz/Yxxta/Uqua or   As a matter of fact, we have a few on our server already.<br />
<br />
If that's not good enough for you, boo hoo.  When Kunark came out, I couldnt get to sebilis unless I did some quests (and I couldnt solo them).  I couldnt see half of Sebilis without a raid.  I couldnt get to HS without a quest (and I still havent done it).<br />
<br />
When Velious came out, Ssra was a pain in the ass.  Exping there without an uber group, dont even think about it.  You couldnt get into ToV, you couldnt explore half of skyshrine.<br />
<br />
What SOE did was make it so that at a certain level, you can essentially explore all of one zone, instead of a little of zone_a, and a little of zone_b.  They added all the raid/uber content in one spot, instead of a little in zone a and a little in zone b.  Casual players are still capable of grouping in Vxed, or the Sewers, or Riwwi.  You can't take a pickup group there, but ldon's are for pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

Pretty simple Daabu, because I don't have a set schedule where I sit down and play EQ for X amount of hours every day or every other day.  I play when the mood takes me (which I'll admit isn't a lot these days) and when I have time available.  Since I'm not a member of a guild any more, it's hard to find reliable players on the spur of the moment.<br />
<br />
Now, you might ask, well why aren't I a member of a guild?  For several years I was a member of a family style guild that had a group of members who wanted to step it up a notch.  They wanted to move into places like ToV HoT and move along the progression at least as far as we reasonably could.  And then we had a group within the same guild who said that they couldn't do it, the time commitment was too large, the focus was to great, no one would help them along.  And this caused a rift within the guild and a pretty large exodus.  The guild basically shut down.   I and some friends joined a raiding guild.  A hardcore raiding guild.  But I quickly tired of being not only MT number 5 or 6 in the rotation, but then also being bitched at by hyper-ambitious over achievers who felt that my every single moment in EQ should be commited to raiding.  So I changed guilds to one I felt had a more &quot;family&quot; oriented style to it, while still doing a reasonable amount of raiding.  And within six months that guild had also moved into being a hardcore raiding style guild where every single EQ moment was spent raiding.  I dropped out of that guild, so I could have some freaking flexibility in a game that I pay for every month to actually do what I enjoyed when I enjoyed it.  Of course, this meant I was no longer able to raid, which I missed.  But damn, it seems to me you should be able to play the game with some moderation, wouldn't you think?  Some balance between raid raid raid and never raiding at all?  Well, some guilds seem to be able to maintain that balance, but I sure haven't found one.<br />
<br />
So when I log on I'm pretty much required to go for a pick up group.  Pretty much the way it is.  The few friends I have are members of raiding guilds which means that when we are on at the same time, guess what they're doing?  That's right, RAIDING.<br />
<br />
Frankly, EQ has become pretty ass in the last year.  And I see GoD and OoW just making it more so.  I doubt I'll be playing EQ much longer, this is kind of my last gasp attempt to help it find some balance between the two conflicting approachs to the game.</div></div><hr />

That and adding I play a paladin.  But, I figure I'd say my piece as the conversation is interesting atleast.  <br />
<br />
What the upper level warriors here are saying about GoD is true.  There is alot accessable everyone.  Your claims are conflicting and it really is almost entirely simple bitterness that keeps you from seeing/admitting that.  &quot;Casuals&quot; complain that the time investment is too high, or the areas are too hard, or the point in question revolves too much around gear.  People complain about being stuck in normal ldons and that they want fun new things to do.  But, those new things cannot be challenging (for anyone, because if its challenging for an &quot;average&quot; player, then sub-average ones can't get by...).  Before it was that gear or aa's was required.  Now, to be honest, pretty much anyone can do sewers aside from maybe the end mob from the first trial.  But suddenly, the argument went from &quot;let the encounters be challenging to players because of skill not gear&quot; to &quot;there are just too many retards and its unfair to expect me to find 5 other people with a clue to do these things, so make it so we can fall through it.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The problem is, you are creating a contradiction in what you claim you want and making it impossible for anyone to please you, you just enjoy being bitter too much.  If normal ldon is so boring because of its easy and pitifulness and hard ldon/god is bad because it requires your group to know whats going on around them... where is the middle ground?  I mean, to be honest, it snot even that much of god is really a &quot;challenge&quot; for anyone at 65 with average gear.  Sewers/Vxed are cake.  And that is coming from someone who is not time+ and whose stats can be matched by a warrior without raiding.<br />
<br />
I know alot of casual players and few of them would actually ask for any content to be balanced around the *worst* players you could find (both skill and gearwise).  Most people enjoy a challenge when it comes to entertainment.  And no, challenge != work.  Look at other forms of entertainment, single player video games, sports, basically anything you actively take part in people prefer to be challenged during it.  Falling through everything simply isn't fun to most.   And to be honest, someone who randomly logs on whenever isn't even the standard casual player.  Most play few hours, but they are reliable and are fully capable of making groups for any of these things.  I think, especially in your case Glat, that you are misreading &quot;challenging&quot; when someone you tag as &quot;uber&quot; says it.  90% of the time they are talking about it in general, not specifically for themselves.  I think you'd be hard pressed to find a Time geared person who thought low end god was challenging at any point.  The entry zones and sewer/vxed weren't even hard for a pre-elemental paladin to deal with.  The basic premise is though, you challenge the people the particular zone is designed for.     GoD did that decently, though not perfectly and not without large flaws in many areas.  I seriously find it hard to believe that many have even attempted any of it before complaining and I think its silly to do so until you've seen it for yourself.  And creating a game around making it possible for people with no clue whats going on around them or what they are doing at all to get through every single part of it is just horrible.</div></div><hr />

You are talking about RL, sorry a game should be fun and have no real relation to real life. Thats kind of the point of games.<br />
<br />
 I dont mind how hard the content is but I do mind the time sinks put in place to keep us playing. If I can put together a group good enough to kill in a zone I should be allowed to go there. Flags, Keys and the like suck and I believe are the reason for most people quiting.<br />
<br />
I had a whole lot of fun for years then came POP and for me good by fun. I still play some but only to talk to people I have known for years. I hope they fix this game it was once a great game and alot of fun but I won't hold my breath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And creating a game around making it possible for people with no clue whats going on around them or what they are doing at all to get through every single part of it is just horrible.<br />
<br />
EQ, as with all games, leaves a whole lotta slack for people who haven't a fricken clue what they're doing to go as far as the game can go without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
I think yer tarring casual players with too wide a brush - there are lazy buggers at every level of the game, but as with most of the casual players you know, most casual players seem willing to work their butt off, and take some rather unusual risks to get things done.  I certainly know I do, it's the style of play that held my interest (added to the general humour and insanit of my guild mates).<br />
<br />
A lot of power gamers/ubers are also among those who want it *easy fast instant shiny yes!*  But it's equally unfair to imply that that's true for most of 'em.<br />
<br />
FWIW - GoD :: I went, I played, I got pushed the limits and got whalloped many times, and I dug it.  I loved the look of the zones, even if it was the same gameplay as in LDoN. I'd go again with people I trust.  But they don't log on much anymore, and frankly, spending an hour out of the 3 or 4 hours I play each night to find people I wanna play with doesn't feel like it's worth it anymore.  I am as far ahead in EQ as I am gonna get, without ditching the people who (whom?) I like to play with.  I'm not getting into EP (and certainly not beyond) without a lotta backup, and that's not available to me in EQ anymore.  What's left to me, essentially, is to be an *even more better* LDoN tank, and I do that job fine with what I got, and so I'm just spinning my wheels when I play.  It's getting hard to find challenges that aren't just the risks of a random and stupid p/u group, and I don't feel driven to try for that anymore.  And that's not bitterness, that's just life.  Hell, I don't enjoy being bitter any more than I enjoy being so bored playing a game that I spend most of my log-in time surfing the Internet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, of course, how silly of us.  The problem isn't with the game at all.  It's with us.  All the casual players who have stepped forward and said there is a problem are just wallowing in their enjoyment of bitterness and want to ruin the game for all the poor ubers.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Yeah, you have lots of credibility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really see &quot;all these casual players&quot; either.  Considering the subject of this thread it isn't all that long and a large majority of the replies are in disagreement with you, even from some casual players.<br />
<br />
You accused GoD of not having content to fit what you consider the casual players abilities and pickup groups when in reality it just doesn't fit those who choose not to put in the effort and learn.<br />
<br />
The facts of the GoD zones and what's needed to fight there are not what you stated and if you put more time into playing and less time into complaining about things on this board you might have learned the strategies needed to consistently and succesfully complete the encounters in GoD, even if your a casual player.<br />
<br />
Being a Casual Player does not mean you have to be guildless or in a small weak guild incapable of progression, that's a choice everyone makes on their own and it's your decision that's keeping the content out of your hands not SoE and their expansions.<br />
<br />
My guild is full of casual players, in fact we prefer casual players over hardcore gamers for the atmosphere and yet we're elemental and progressing along nicely in elementals and GoD and have been since early 2000, being casual doesn't mean lazy.<br />
<br />
Your credibility was lost the instant you stepped forward and made a comment about a 5500hp/1300ac tank not being able to cut it in GoD.  Someone with those statistics and a casual gamer should get their ass in LDoN and get some upgrades and augments, all available to them (wow imagine that) and actually work to improve their character rather than expecting SoE to dumb down the game to accomodate them.<br />
<br />
Eventually stupidity always gets it's way though and I am sure with enough laziness and complaining we can all get SOE to open up elementals, vex thal, all god zones and lower the content level to target the once a week player and then the game will be just perfect.<br />
<br />
While we're at it we can start some protests to eliminate honor classes in school (those are just wrong you know), lower standards for graduating from college maybe have it solely depend on attendence or maybe just have it solely depend on sending in your tuition payment.<br />
<br />
We don't want a role playing game to be designed around achievement, effort or accomplishment, what's the sense in that?<br />
<br />
I dont mind how hard the content is but I do mind the time sinks put in place to keep us playing. If I can put together a group good enough to kill in a zone I should be allowed to go there.  <br />
<br />
Earn your way there.  Rather than trying to skip progression and accomplishments actually do what's needed, other people have and can so<br />
why can't you?<br />
<br />
If you have the time to have obtained the gear, aa's and levels to fight in these zones you lack access to you have the time to run some open raids to accomplish what you want to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Join a guild or an alliance and play the game the way it was designed.<br />
<br />
Progression was a part of PoP since it was in beta, if you didn't like the idea you shouldn't have bought it.  As it stands you only don't have access to 6 zones in all of pop at level 62.  4 elemental, Tactics and Time.   The entire rest of the expansion is open to you and that was only accomplished after complaining about having to kill mobs that were extremely easy to kill even with a riff raff open raid.<br />
<br />
Why do you play a MMORPG if your looking for Unreal Tournament? It makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

Been there, tried that. However, there's one thing we 'casuals' have to fight that no long time raider ever had to - the overgeared long time raider going back to 'old content' for vague or selfish reasons and cockblocking folks trying to progress. I mean, fuck, even high end encounters from the second expansion are dead in minutes to EP flagged jackasses with a playerauctions account or a 6th level twink they think dragon loots would be swell for while they're getting PL to the 60's that week. I don't mind 'racing' folks of similar size/gear levels in older content, because that's how it was, but evidently Time bitches never heard of the real meaning of 'progression'.</div></div><hr />

On most servers you have less competition for most of those mobs and MANY stay up for days without anyone even attempting a kill. On the flip side weapons and armor are way better as well as FT gear new spells not to mention focus gear anger augs incite 5 more levels 1 DB when defensive is down to name a few. You have it much easier and less competition though you do not realize it. Just because progression is hard for you does not mean it was a cakewalk for raiders, we did our hard part leading up to it in long grinds in VT, HoT, NToV, PoGrowth and others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">06-06-2004, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry that comment offended you so, Glat.  The truth is though, while there are/maybe problems with content, there are also flaws in the players.  The interesting thing is, you will admit that in regards to &quot;ubers&quot; but never in regards to yourself.  I'm not Time+ or even Time level at all, but I've still progressed up to Tipt and can use Tipt to farm xp/loot.  I'm not sure what you are hoping for, is it a game that is devoid of both skill and progression?  Just a matter of getting 6 random people (without even having to look at level, gear, aa's or even class) and get through all content?  Because that is what it sounds like you are saying.  The point is, &quot;casuals&quot; as in people who are not in raid guilds are doing the very things you are complaining about.  <br />
<br />
In fact, some on my server who are as casual as they come actually said they ENJOYED GoD when it first came out because it gave them single group progression to work through.  Some people enjoy a challenge, it just seems you are not one of them.  Most people are, at worst they just differ on where that challenge should come from (purely player skill or purely gear/aa/level or a combination).  <br />
<br />
Message boards are great places to find information out about the game, but not about what players really think.  They are alot like closed primaries in elections, the extremists are out there in force.  At any rate, forgive me if I offended any of you.  Such was not my intent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm all for what I consider a reasonable challenge.  But I'm not one who gets his jollies by having the bar repeatedly moved upward on him without any expectation of being able to jump higher.  It makes a person feel kind of like Charlie Brown running to kick the football that Lucy is holding, knowing that she's going to pull it out from in front of him at the last possible moment, but foolishly hoping that just this once, she won't.  I put in lots of time in this game, double boxing and grouping, and I earned 50 some odd AAs, and saw no particular change in the power of my toon.  Yet each expansion the mobs hit just a little harder.  And they're not really more &quot;challenging&quot; for the most part, they just hit harder.  It doesn't take a great deal of thought process to realize that if Mob B hits harder than Mob A then Player Y with a character that hasn't changed much since the last expansion is going to have a bitch of a time, does it?<br />
<br />
Why didn't I do a couple of gazillion LDoN missions and earn enough points to gear up my toon?  A couple of reasons.  First off, pick up groups tend to be really unpleasant in as much as many times it's a complete grab bag of player skills, gear, and even ability to communicate.  And secondly, because the missions are uninteresting.  Move forward, pull mobs from next room or next chunk of hall, if the puller is decent get 1-3 mobs.  If the puller sucks, get 4+.  If you survive, rinse and repeat.  If you die, start the CR.  The geography is very similar in most of the different themes and the mobs aren't particularly inspired or interesting.  They made it boring.  So not only to you have the unpredictability of a grab bag group to look forward to, you have the monotony of LDoN to go with it.  This is not what I would define as &quot;fun&quot;.  While doing this once in a while might be worth the time, doing this repeatedly for the literally months it would take to get any decent amount of armor upgrades is unacceptable.  If it wasn't don't you think the majority of non-raider casual players would already have their armor and no one would be having a beef?  Think about it.  If the task was able to be reasonably accomplished, people would be geared up and ready to go into GoD.  But as you can see from many of the posts in this thread, if they're not raiders, they're not really ready.   Why is that?  LDoN is so quick and easy, right?  Wrong.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I look forward to their introducing opportunities for people to play solo or duo in LDoN like themes.  I would have made a lot more progress in LDoN if I had been able to pick and choose when I did the missions without being constrained by being forced to group with people I had no real inclination to group with except for the fact that I had to.  Yes, EQ is supposed to be a social game.  But if you force people to be social in a time, place, and way that they don't desire, guess what?  They stop participating.  That's what things like LDoN do, they force people to decide, do I want to participate in forced socialization or do I want to do something else?  Many people will decide to do something else.  And I'm one of them.<br />
<br />
Message boards are great places to find information out about the game, but not about what players really think.<br />
<br />
You think you better represent the majority thought process of non-raider EQ players?  That's great.  You go ahead and speak for them, because until the game changes in ways that add the enjoyment back into it for me, I'm no longer an EQ player.  You go right ahead and tell everyone how they're wrong and you have it right.  I'm sure we're all listening with baited breath on your perceptions on how great the game is and how wrong everyone who disagrees is.  And you might want to throw in some innuendos about how they're lazy, or lack skill, or aren't willing to take on challenges.  I'm sure they'll apperciate them just as much as I have.  Lead on boy wonder, the people are waiting.</div></div><hr />

Between expansion A and expansion B, you say all you got to show for yourself was 50some AAs and you didnt notice an upgrade in your character?  You got no loot, no ldon augments, and the AAs you bought were innate wisdom and improved regeneration?<br />
<br />
I dont get your argument.  Yes, over time, you're expected to equip yourself better.  If that means you exp somewhere other than Plane of Valor, then you exp somewhere other than Plane of Valor.  If that means you need to grind some LDoN, then you need to grind some LDoN.<br />
<br />
Dumbasses are everywhere.  I am guilded with a number of them.  I made many of my friends through people who WERENT in my guild...or people who were in an old guild.  There's a guild on my server, Hired Goons, that has maybe 10 active people in it.  I'm friends with a few of them, and he is constantly grouping with us when he's online.<br />
<br />
If you can't find anybody to group with, that's a whole different issue.<br />
<br />
Casual players *can* do GoD content.  Casual players *can* do hard LDoN.  Casual players *can* get flagged to the EPs, and *can* group in EP if they do (pickup groups, or a casual raiding guild who is willing to flag you).<br />
<br />
There are many guilds who do infrequent raiding, and I'd imagine there's at least one on your server.  On Luclin, there's Code of Silence.  They raid at a set time two days a week, and are flagged through to SRT.  <br />
<br />
If you have a problem with getting groups of people who aren't complete dumbasses, then you can complain about that...but don't complain that this game isnt tailored to you, because there is plenty of content out there for you if you're intelligent about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Daabu, apparently you have no respect for me or what I have to say. Fine, the feeling is mutual.  You don't like what I have to say, don't read it and sure as hell don't bother responding, because you're not going to impact my feelings and perceptions one iota, because I don't value what you have to say, just like you obviously don't value what I have to say.<br />
<br />
You got no loot, no ldon augments, and the AAs you bought were innate wisdom and improved regeneration?<br />
<br />
The AAs I purchased where the common tanking AAs.  Did they make some difference in how I tank?  I suppose they did, although I'd have to parse before and after to be able to detect the difference that I assume must be there.  Not something you can really take pride in as a major accomplishment.  Oh look, I take damage just slightly better than before if I actually parse it out!  Woohoo!  Yay me!   <br />
<br />
As far as LDoN trash augments are concerned, please, don't yank my chain.  We all know that small increases in stats yeild very small returns. Wow, I got 10 more dex and 5 more magic resist and fire resist!  That was sure worth the four groups, the three wipes, and 6 hours of my time! <br />
<br />
If that means you need to grind some LDoN, then you need to grind some LDoN.<br />
<br />
So if I understand you correctly it is your learned opinion that if one is required to spend huge amounts of time doing horribly unpleasant things so that one can gear up properly to go someplace else and spend huge amounts of time doing only slightly less unpleasant things, that's what you should do?  Gosh, and here I thought EQ was an online game where people spent time enjoying themselves by accomplishing tasks that offered them enough challenge to make them think and react well but not so much as to make their efforts seem completely meaningless.  If I want to spend huge amounts of time doing unpleasant things for little tiny rewards which only add up over a vast length of time, I'll just go get a job where they let me work a lot of over time.  Sounds like more fun and far more rewarding to me.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with getting groups of people who aren't complete dumbasses, then you can complain about that...but don't complain that this game isnt tailored to you, because there is plenty of content out there for you if you're intelligent about it.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for implying that I'm less intelligent than you are, since you can see all the obvious content out there for me that I can't.  I apperciate you coming along and trying to school me on how I ought to play the game and what I ought to enjoy.  I was under the, apparently sadly mistaken, impression that how I play the game was actually open to a certain amount of personal preference and that if I found that my personal preferences weren't being reasonably accommodated I had the right to speak up about it, along with the other people who find that how they personally prefer to play the game wasn't being supported.  I feel so much better now knowing that my opinion on how the game should be playable is completely irrelevant and in fact I should be doing what you tell me I should be doing because you're so much smarter, wiser, better looking, make more money, get all the chicks, and have a bigger member than me.  I do so love having people come along and pissing on my leg and telling me it's raining, thanks loads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To begin, you just said a mouthfull.  You want to have the challenge specially tuned to you.  EQ has never done that.  So I guess, yes, you thought wrong.<br />
<br />
You do need to put forth a little bit of work in this game.  You said your character never improved in the however many months you played him, and I call bullshit.  You improved, you got those AAs, and you most likely got at least some HP or AC upgrade.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm going to state, that your complaints are more complaining than concern-raising.  You *can* do the content you are so adamant about not being able to do.  You cannot solo it, however, and you need to bring friends along who are not dumbasses.  If you haven't made 5 friends who can play at the same time you can, make 5 new ones.  If you are having trouble making friends who are competent enough to do something more than LDoN, then you have another complaint all together.<br />
<br />

If my concept of fun was particularly unusual, you'd have a point.  It isn't.  Other people have chimmed in with similar thoughts.  Therefore I'm not the only one who feels it's improperly tuned at this time for non-raiders.  You disagree?  Wonderful.  Doesn't make a lick of difference, but thanks for piping up.</div></div><hr />

I have to say I agree with you, but I think that in their desire to obtain a mitigation ability (beyond DA, stuns, blind, Root, Fear or FD, but not a replacement for them - a free extra one), Knights have managed to convince SoE the idea is fundamentally flawed.<br />
<br />
The idea as you'll recall was auto-selection of appropriately difficult trials. The idea was immediately branded &quot;baby trials&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the absence of such a system, EQ is going to be stuck with either a hard, (medium?), normal ldon-like player choice system for instances or content where players &quot;think&quot; they ought to be able to succeed although they are NOT ready for they challange and protest vehemently when they fail. (And are locked out of content as a result.)<br />
<br />
It's a shame that in their determination to prove they must have half-Defensive, Knights scuttled the idea of auto-selection of appropriately difficult instanced content.<br />

<br />
I don't think auto-selection of appropriately difficult LDoN content is necessarily the only way to go.  A reasonably skilled group of non-raiders can succeed at LDoN missions.  The issue isn't whether or not people can win, they certainly can win, there's not doubt about that.  The issue, much like people talk about risk versus reward is aggravation versus reward.  As rewards come faster, the willingness of people to deal with the aggravation increases.  As the rewards come slower, the willingness to deal with the aggravation decreases.  I recall, back in my family guild days, raiding HoT and MTing for the guild.  Now during one of our initial sessions I must have died a dozen times in a 6 or 8 hour period.  It was extremely aggravating.  But I kept at it.  Why was that?  Because I could see that the guild was actually making gains from my efforts.  I could see the loot dropping off the mobs and people were getting the chance to gear up.  It made the aggravation acceptable because there were immediate, visible, and perceptable rewards.<br />
<br />
I don't feel LDoN does that very well.  Everything is after X amount of time and X number of missions.  Which means that any one mission isn't particularly important towards your goal.  You don't get to see any immediate, visible, and perceptable rewards.  So when things go wrong and they go wrong more than they should, the aggravation factor quickly overwhelms the drive to continue pounding your head against the wall.   They haven't made the missions themselves particularly entertaining in their own right, they don't give immediate, visible, and perceptible rewards that people value (sorry the +5 augments just don't cut it) and they've managed to increase the aggravation factor, by requiring people to group, significantly.  Basically all the things that good psychology says you shouldn't do to get desired behavior, they've done.  Rather than the dog getting a bone when the bell rings, he gets an electric shock.  And then SoE wonders why he curls up in the corner when he hears bells.</div></div><hr />

Casual players *can* do GoD content. Casual players *can* do hard LDoN. Casual players *can* get flagged to the EPs, and *can* group in EP if they do (pickup groups, or a casual raiding guild who is willing to flag you).<br />
<br />
Such hostility, and completely without need or provocation.  There's little purpose in trying to engender some clarity (especially since Glatius2 has summed up the *other side* so very, very well), but here goes anyway.<br />
<br />
For about a year, I've had a car that can do about 140 if I want it too, altho the speed limit around here is generally 90.  And I don't travel much, so it's all the same roads all the time.  I've drummed up a little cash and some bits, and now the car can hit 160 without a whole lot of effort.  Yet, the speed limit is still 90 and the roads are still the same old maps. So ... mebbe I'll start cycling more instead.  I get more payback, and I enjoy myself more.<br />
<br />
I *can* make $1,000,000.00 delivering pizza.  It will take a dog's age, and it's a very unrewarding line of work, and it will cost me $$ to do it along the way. And so, I'm likely to move on long before I earn that first million.<br />
<br />
*Aggravation vs. reward* ... Glatius2, I'm making a brass plaque in yer honour.<br />

Daabu, since you missed the repeated statements (and yet asked), the beef is that what *progress* there is left to the non-raiding or casual player at or near the 65/100 level is banal, whereas up until PoP such a player could and did successfully improve a toon to go into more difficult, interesting and challenging areas of the game.  What wasn't said is that we as a group could *not* do the content you point to.  What was said was that eventually, there wasn't any frickin' point to doing it.  And like clever little boys and girls, we took our cap and ball and went home.  <br />
<br />
BTW - Glatius2, myself, and a whole lot of others you would smear so disparagingly have put in a lot of effort into the game.  Many of us don't see any payoff for that effort, and we just ran outta fun doing it.<br />
<br />
Eh ... gonna toss off this comment, too, then go play something that loads up and plays: lemme just pick *medium* and nearly fail, or fail.  Slogging thru normal is dull and being far under-geared for hard is no more exciting.  Nutz to *auto-select* content.</div></div><hr />

The idea as you'll recall was auto-selection of appropriately difficult trials. The idea was immediately branded &quot;baby trials&quot;. <br />
<br />
I was refering to a suggestion I posted on PoN (not that it hasn't been thought of independently by everyone and their dog for 50 years) for the GoD trials.<br />
<br />
The point is that quest assignment, content, etc. ARE going to probably auto-scale eventually in MMoRPG gameworlds along with rewards. It just has too much potential to please both casual and powergamers not to do it - except of cource those who enjoy being confronted with tasks that they are guaranteed to fail if they attempt them.<br />

I expect you're right BB in that eventually MMoRPGs will generate individual environments based on the character values of the people entering the environment.  I do also see the other side of the coin though where Knights objected to the concept that even if equally geared to a Warrior, they'd have to have a less DPS oriented mission spawned for them as the tank because of the lack of defensive.  I didn't see that as much of an obstacle to the idea though as the fact that by decreasing mob DPS to accommodate a Knight tank, you also ended up decreasing it for everyone else in the group which suddenly made the idea of using a Knight tank far more attractive over a Warrior.<br />
<br />
The bottom line though with the GoD trials was that they were designed for level 70 players and not level 65.  The fact that they didn't retune the mobs once they pulled level 70 from GoD smacks of a pretty serious oversight.  SoE shot themselves in the foot pretty badly on that one and generated a whole hell of a lot of grief and aggravation for no good reason except sloppyness on their part.<br />
<br />
It does go to show though that when people like you and I were trying to preach to the Paladins at PoN that the problem wasn't with Knights not having defensive, it was with improperly tuned content, we were dead on right.  Mobs designed for level 70 characters are in fact horribly improperly tuned for level 65 characters.  I almost wish I could still post over at PoN just so I could ram a big &quot;I told you so&quot; down their throats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are mistaken.  It is completely right. While some people may have enjoyed it, it was not properly tuned for the level of characters going up against it.  What you may mean to be saying is, while yes it was improperly tuned you enjoyed it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No I am not mistaken this comment: &quot;Mobs designed for level 70 characters are in fact horribly improperly tuned for level 65 characters.&quot; is not correct because many warriors in upper level content liked how hard they were and posted such at the time. Many of the higher level warriors are tired of the kittie content that they can breeze through, GoD as it was tuned made you payatention it raised the level of play there by raising the enjoyment of the game.</div></div><hr />

I won't disagree that other people may have also liked it.  But to claim that mobs designed for level 70 characters are correctly designed for level 65 characters means either they were way underpowered for level 70 characters or way overpowered for level 65 characters.  Just because a minority of people liked it doesn't mean it was properly tuned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the main issue still remains. Knights are not Warriors. In trivial group content, we are all equally acceptable, but we have different raid roles, and when the ewgf hits the fan and you need meat, then only a Warrior will do - group or raid. When you need a Tank that can Root, stun, group heal, etc. then a Paladin is the best choice.<br />
<br />
Like it or not a damage mitigation slugfest tuned to be highly challanging to a Warrior is going to be real darned tough for a Knight. If you think about it, it makes sense. Warriors are unmatched at surviving the most brutal battles, not Knights. Knight are most effective in other kinds of battles. Hence, auto-selection of appropriately difficult content is one of the few remedies for players that are prone to complain, 'It's too hard. (But don't make it trivial for Warriors.)&quot;<br />

<br />
Well when you get to the point where every last HP counts, ever missed hit makes a big difference, having as much AC as possible gives an edge, and defensive could really be a requirement, then yes Warriors are going to shine.  But these kind of encounters are typically referred to as raid encounters versus boss mobs, not your run of the mill experience encounter.  And the fact remains that if it takes a raid geared Warrior using defensive to succeed, you can exclude all the thousands of non-raid geared Warriors from having a chance to succeed right along with the vast majority of Knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like hard content isn't there for people that wants to try it.  Everyone gets sewers and mountain passes in GoD without needing a key.  Everyone can do a level 65 Hard LDoN adventure.  The reward are considerable too.  The player base in general just isn't motivated to try anything that'd place a lot of emphasis on skill/gear/class composition, not that such content doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
And on the lower end, it should be expected that hybrids classes do better than pure classes, since easy stuff does not require specialists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I DON'T like is the ubiquitous see-invis mob that always lurks around some stupid corner or another.  I don't mind a few of em in the temples but it's really annoying to constantly run into the things and even more bloody annoying when they kill your rezzer.  I spent 45 minutes more than I should have today in Kod'taz getting prepared for Ikkinz because there was 1 lousy see-invis roamer that forced me to zone several times, first time because I didn't notice him WAY below me and on the other side.  2nd time was because he didnt path back to his spot and got stuck in the wall where I found him again.  3rd time was me running way around and getting ANOTHER see-invis mob.  Ended up having the rogue drag me.<br />
<br />
Another complaint I have is that whenever I run along a wall way up high I will get STUCK, crouched, with no way to move or cast a gate potion.  /Rewind in many cases DOESN'T WORK.<br />
<br />
It's stupid details like this that ruins the overall aspects of GoD.  This expansion has the potential to be very fun but in the time it takes to form a group and bypass 352467 see-invis mobs to the trial or camp spot, I could have done most of an LDoN, or better yet I could have done something IRL....<br />
<br />
I have no prob with certain timesinks.  You want me to camp something?  You got it, I don't mind an occasional camp.  But don't  waste my god damn time with stupid shit like see-invis mobs all over the place and getting stuck all the time...,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though a good deal of it is the player's own fault.  I don't know how many times I've seen people got killed by a 'see-invis' Kyv or Ukun when every Kyv and Ukun sees through invis from KT and up, and yet people still don't learn that you should never be anywhere close to them.  Yes pre see-invis nerf KT+ zones is literally a minefield, with all Ikaav see invis, Anueks randomly see invis, and I think some Ixts see invis (not sure though) and that's pretty excessive.  I find today's KT+ zones to be fairly reasonable.  Yes some areas are loaded with Kyvs (like Qvic) but at least you know where what to watch for.</div></div><hr />
