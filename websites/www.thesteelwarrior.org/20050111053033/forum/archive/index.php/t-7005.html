<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tested out the new melee downtime change this morning, here are the results:<br />
<br />
Testing with 8682HP.<br />
<br />
Starting at initial regen of 28Hp/tick:<br />
<br />
Regenned HP at <br />
<br />
28/tick for 10 ticks<br />
32/tick for 10 ticks<br />
44/tick<br />
56/tick<br />
68/tick<br />
80/tick<br />
92/tick<br />
104/tick<br />
116/tick<br />
128/tick<br />
 <br />
<br />
at that point I'd regenned to full. 8kHP regenned in 10 minutes. This is without bandaids.<br />
<br />
So, as we can see, after an initial bonus of only 4HP/tick in regen, every minute there is a +12HP/tick bonus to sitting regen, which is cumulative and seemingly without limit.<br />
<br />
Testing with bandaing while sitting showed 84HP/tick with 210 bandage, stacked as stated in patch message. Doesn't interrupt HP increase.<br />
<br />
Using bandages while sitting and regenning, allowed me to regen 8KHP in 8 minutes instead of 10, for an approximately 20% decrease in downtime over sitting and regenning alone.</div></div><hr />

Sitting Down, no bandaids.  I didnt time, but took 5+ mins</div></div><hr />

I may have to train up bind wounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question regarding the increase to bind wound to do 70% by default.<br />
<br />
If you have 201+ BW skill, will it go up to 100?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no. you need to get the 3 bind wound AA for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no. you need to get the 3 bind wound AA for that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I Really don't think the new people at SoE even knew that at 201+ BW you could bind to 70%..... assholes, but hey whatever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have to say that this helped me out a ton last night. Was in a LDoN with couple friends and two of them were Boxing had a SK/SHM and a Enc/Cleric then me and a ranger friend. All was going great we were about half way done and POOF LD on the 4 toons left me with just a ranger. (OUCH) We finished the mob and I bind wound while sitting to 70 he topped me off and we continued to single pull and killed 3 while the others got back (Cable had droped on them). THey got back we pulled next 2 rooms and Won with 2 minutes to spare WOOT.<br />
<br />
I know it is not fixing some of the broken stuff but I have to say this did save my bacon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say they should give a boost to the heal % per bandage now at 201.  Those of us that busted our hump to up the skill should have some reward over those who didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is already a huge jump in hp/bandage when you hit 201 :p  You go from 40 to 80 or somwhere in that range.  <br />
<br />
And yes they knew about the 70% thing, it was mentioned in the announcment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">28/tick for 10 ticks<br />

This doesn't seem accurate to me.  I raided last night and decided to see what the regen rate was like after I got ressed.  I sat down and with zero buffs was immediately regenning almost 100hps/tick.  The regen rate seemed to stay constant at that rate until I got to full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this seems to be affecting all classes. my enchanter grouping with his mage gf has no heals so they have been in the habit of binding wound to fifty percent and jumping back into action. let me tell you its nice to be able to do that while sitting and actually get manna back. and then by the time ive gotten to 70 percent (the new limit) my regen rate is usually in the ballpark of 12 (huge for a level 27 enchanter). in a way its much less useful for my warrior who almost always has a healer in group and who doesnt usually get the opportunity to sit for a few minutes at a time.<br />
<br />
what im seeing is that in fast moving groups it will be rare that people sit long enough to see the giant regen rates but for soloers and the like its really pretty cool. well since soloing has been nerfed so many times over the years im not going to complain that soloers finally were given the anti-nerf. of course warrior soloing is so slow that even this is not going to make it a viable way to get your 600 aa points. but it sure doesnt hurt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really? well good still have something to look forward to at least. <br />
<br />
Anyone know what the max hps regained per bandage that can be done? Assuming lvl 65, max binding AA's and max bind skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm<br />
<br />
When I tested this I had just temperence from my cleric bot, but I started at 13hp/tick and then:<br />
<br />
17hp/tick during 2nd minute<br />
19hp/tick duing 3rd minute<br />
21hp/tick duing 4th minute<br />
<br />
Not sure how you guys are getting 100hp/tick without using healing will disc? Maybe I'm missing something? Would regen aa's play that much into it? I only have regen 3 and no natural healing, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, not really a &quot;melee downtime change&quot; exactly, as it effects all classes.<br />
<br />
I was goofing around on my druid a bit after the patch. Level 65 with NO worn or AA regen. <br />
<br />
<br />
8/tick<br />
12/tick<br />
24/tick<br />
36/tick<br />
<br />
Seemed to increase by 12/tick every minute (except after the first minute which was 4/tick increase).  This will actually benefit casters and hybrids at high levels more than it will benefit pure melee. I'm surprised nobody's bitched about that yet. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dharh</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It scales depending on level obviously. I had heard some mention that it scales also on how may HP you have. That is hp/tick initial and the add each 10 ticks.</div></div><hr />
