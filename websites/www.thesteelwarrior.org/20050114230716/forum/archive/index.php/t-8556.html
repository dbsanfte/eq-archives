<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me or are trash mobs in KT easier than trash in Tipt?  I'm pre elem but KT flagged.  I finally had a chance to tank there last night after being flagged for a couple of weeks.  One cleric as the only healer kept me up most of the time, even when an error led to one death and I had no Focus or Brells coming back from rez, so my hit points were only at 8500 or so.  Now we didn't get any named to pop for us ( :( ) and maybe they would have kicked my butt, but the trash really wasn't as hard as I'd been led to believe.  Couple that with 3-4% AA exp per kill... wow.  Seems like it's just the AA candyland for getting yourself through all the trials to get there.<br />
<br />
I think Tipt trash now is easier than it was when GoD was released.  There was a time in there when it had been made easier but then apparently was buffed back up.  Now I think it's back down.  It still doesn't seem as hard as on release though when 2 clerics struggled to keep me alive.  I'm just baffled as to why it would be set any harder than KT trash.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but I get a feel for how bad the spikes are after awhile and for the most part, they just didn't seem as bad in KT.  *shrug*  Except for those big buggars with the flurries...</div></div><hr />

<br />
KT mobs are much much easier than mobs in Tipt.<br />
<br />
The difference is that in KT mobs tend to be hasted more often, but also tend to be fully slowable (with the except of Ra'Tuk and named).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, KT trash is pretty easy, although as said above, it really depends on if the mobs are hasted or not. A hasted red con will knock you down pretty fast if you don't get it debuffed soon enough.<br />
<br />
One word of caution, don't let the ease of the trash catch you off guard for the named. They have low HP, but they do some pretty high damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just dispel everything on incoming and then you don't have to worry about haste.  It also gets rid of annoying stuff like Chaos Guard and Focus (dex effects Chaos Claws).  <br />
<br />
Of course, you'll always get some excuse about how none of the casters in your group can possibly have another slot available for dispel so they'd rather you tank a hasted Ra'Tuk and die.<br />
<br />
But who knows, maybe you get lucky.  One time I even had a group that dispelled Protection of Discord on Mastruqs instead of having all casters go afk when a Mastruq is running at 20% with Protection of Discord on and expect the melees to kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, I doubt I'll be able to get many pickup groups there anyway.  When they note that my AC/HP levels aren't elem+ caliber, they'll look for someone else. :/  Pickup groups are notoriously lazy and just want a tank that can own the content with ease.<br />
<br />
My guild needs to get a few more flagged so I have more friends to go there with.  <br />
<br />
I hear ya on the Mastruqs.  I hate those damn things and all it takes is casters dispelling or even just nuking it down, but often they leave the meleers to chase the mob.  That happens a lot in Ferubi too.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah KT trash is much easier than tipt and even knights can tank pretty well there for xp groups.  The only thing is that some mobs like red con kyv can rip you up pretty fast, if you aren't ready.  The named are another story though.  The caster named are pretty weak because they like to cast stuipd spells instead of meleeing for 1700+ but on the melee named be ready to use furious + stonewall and have the cleric chain cast Holy Light on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanked Vxed last night with no charmed pet the whole time for the first time... definitely tougher than KT the night before.  I could do it, but even with a druid helping the cleric from time to time, he couldn't keep his mana up even with voq.  Then he lost voq.  fun.  Also had no crowd control, so we wiped when we failed to get past the roamers fast enough and one respawned on our heads. :p  Ah well, hopefully back to KT...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">KT mobs are most definately easier then tipt / vxed, even without the slowing ability issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was also caught off guard with the ease of the trash in KT.  As stated above, don't let it set  you offgaurd as the names will tear you up.  As long as the named is slowed relatively quickly and you have a cleric that is on their toes you will be fine.  Furious is defiantly your friend on named though!<br />
<br />
Now if only some armor would drop instead of silly type 8 augs I can't use until I get the armor :)</div></div><hr />

Downside if you dont have time gear or higher end god gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm grouping in Tipt, god knows who I'm with.... If I'm grouping in KT, these people have at least survived all of Tipt, Vxed, and either Sewers 1-4 or Rondo, so it's more than likely the group I'm in just &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any Tipt group I ever had.<br />
<br />
I'm sure KT mobs are probably easier than Tipt mobs, but it always helps to know I was in a group I could trust when I was in KT or Ikkinz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like stated above kinda... KT tends to have spikey dmg.  When you get a Kyv that's got haste that mob fek owns and it's kind of a wake up.  But for the most part they're pretty ez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like stated above kinda... KT tends to have spikey dmg.

<br />
<br />
KT mobs have been toned down in damage quite a bit since GoD came out.. as they realized they had tuned it around level 70 instead of level 65.   The yellow con Kyv's pre nerf were nothing short of assbeat, I think maybe they missed you 2 in 10 swings when you were lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">High con Kyvs simply never missed before the mobs got retuned, barring a riposte/dodge/parry.  This is pretty much an automatic double DPS compare to anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are some kyv deep in Ferubi that still seem to be that way.  They blow away the dps of many of the other mobs in there, but they might just be hasted.  I haven't parsed the hits/misses on them.</div></div><hr />
