<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drumni</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was asked to group with two very high players (I was a level 3 Troll Warrior) and they gave me 50 gold, and told me to go buy some armour and weapons.  This made my next several levels so much more fun as I wasn't constantly worried about getting money.  I don't remember their name but am very grateful.<br />
Thanks to whoever does that sort of thing!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Just finding a real newbie that would actually appreciate 50 gold is pretty rare these days.</div></div><hr />
