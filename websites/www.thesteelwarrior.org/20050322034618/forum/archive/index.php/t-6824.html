I've reported it as a bug and petitioned.  So far a retard GM responded back to me to reset the clock on my taskbar to fix the issue.  I'm like how the holy hell is the warrior disciplines tied with my O/S's time?  and how the hell do you reset it to default? heh.  I tried it just for the hell of it.. changed a min cuz you cant set it back to default and didnt work.  <br />

I know thats what the GM told you already, but...<br />
<br />
Well, I dunno what else to say really  :rolleyes:  petition and hope you get another GM, or e-mail for some real tech support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The GM was right. The most likely reason it isn't refreshing is because your computer clock is too far off. Check not only the time, but also the date/year. I bet you will see it's set to 2001 or something odd like that.</div></div><hr />

The funny thing was that all my discs were refreshed when I popped back in PoT... I had all my stuff on me, so no, I wasnt dead  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrtiz</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, my discs have popped up after zoning as well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinmari</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine have also repopped on zoning.  The last time though on furious, even though the button wasn't &quot;greyed&quot; out, I still could not use it until the 40 minutes was up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had two times now that Furious has refreshed as far as the button ungreying but not being ready.  Nothing better than a Vxed named beating you when you assumed Furious fired right before taunt.  While sitting at my bind point scrolling back, I see that when I hit the disc it said it wasn't available for 6 minutes and change, followed by the ever so elusive successful taunt off a puller.<br />

The GM was correct.  This is absolutely an issue with your system clock.  Period.</div></div><hr />

Also, I had my mouse lock when I tryed to hit furious right as I was killed. The only way to fix it was to camp and come back.</div></div><hr />
