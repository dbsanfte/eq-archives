<br />
I am looking at what is required to take out Lord Yeli for my guild.<br />
<br />
Yeli info:<br />
HP<br />
DPS output<br />
Pull/clear strat<br />
General force used levels/numbers<br />
Does the AoE land even if bard resist songs are playing?  I have a lot of bards.<br />
<br />
We have bazaar &amp; LDON epuipped people almost all 60+ and over 1/2 level 65.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone needs some type of levitate because you fight on ice, Yelinak is rooted to her room so you have no need to pull...there are a few mobs around her you have to clear, best way to get to her is have all the non-kos people run down and all the kos ones stay up top and have a mage COH those that are kos, i think i tanked Yelinak when i had 6.5-7k hp buffed....never tried before so im not sure if you can do it with less.  That is about all i can remember of the event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's 'Lord' Yelinak, not Lady lol. Anyway, since the revamp he has guards on a ~20 min timer (I think) that you need to clear first. Also, if you can see Yelinak, then you are agro. Even though he is rooted, his agro range is huge. If you end up wiping, make sure that whoever camped out waits until he is at full health before logging back in or he will summon people and kill them one by one.<br />
<br />
His AE is about 300dmg, cold based, and is a mana drain DoT. Make sure your clerics are out of range of the AE, if they are outside the gate they should be fine. He also procs a 400dd. I don't remember if he rampages, it's been a while since I took him down. Melee is triple or quad for 700, so pretty wimpy.<br />
<br />
Watch the push! If you push him (which will happen) make sure you constantly call for a switch because if he gets in the water you are fucked. Clerics won't be able to heal anyone under water, and if they go into the water they will be in AE range.<br />
<br />
Another thing that helped was all of our wizards had dragon's bane (2000 dmg wizard nuke, unresistable on dragons with more than 100k hp, cost of 2 peridot per cast, 400 mana, 4.5 sec recast if iirc). Long quest involving camping Myga in western wastes. <br />
<br />
As for HP I think he was originally around 350k hp and then the revamp put him at 500k hp.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can remember. It's been a while since I fought him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those HP seem high for that era &amp; such.<br />
<br />
Is that accurate?<br />
<br />
So the clerics can stand outside the AoE and cheal? That will help a ton then.<br />
<br />
Thank You!<br />
<br />
**edit**<br />
nice fooking speling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can avoid the AE by being inside his room but in the left hand side on a ramp. Your clerics can sit low enough of the ramp to not get hit by the AE.  I believe LY proc's a knock back / stun / dd. <br />
<br />
LY is rooted so I don't know where you get the push part from, he doesn't move. <br />
<br />
He's easy. Just getting to him is some what frustrating... the Crusaders are such bitches. They are the real difficulty. 75% AE slow, proc's a Banish to zone in.  I don't think they see invis though so you can Coth up as far as you can than invis right before Yeli or maybe into inside his room.  Once in the room just have everyone on the ramp, send in MA so he is close to the ramp while fighting Yeli, nuke nuke, swat swat, and you win.<br />
<br />
He's not hard at all really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just getting to him is some what frustrating... the Crusaders are such bitches <br />
<br />
Just CotH passed the Crusaders...they don't drop anything worthwhile anyway.<br />
<br />
Yelinak proc's a knockback on the MT somewhat randomly, so your MT will need to be ready to run back forward to re-acquire prox aggro.  That means no Stonewall.  The AE is timable, so if you don't trust ranges with the ramps, just have someone call it out 10 seconds prior and have everyone hide either in the water or outside the gate.  The timer on Yel's guards isn't as short as 20 mins...so unless you completely putz around you shouldn't see respawn.  The AE is also curable by RC, so it's a good idea to have an RC'er in every group just in case...and it will overwrite KEI and VoQ, so have an enchanter with ornate pants ready to run around if necessary for cleric groups.<br />
<br />
Yelinak has a lot of hit points, and in the dozen or so times we've taken him down I've never seen any noticable push like one poster mentioned.  The MT will need to have 2 extra buff slots open because most likely he'll have 2 effects on him from Yelinak, Mind Cloud and something else.<br />
<br />
He doesn't hit all that hard, just relatively fast and is unslowable.  Good idea is to have your debuffers debuff him, then the whole raid camp out to reset aggro, then log back in and immediately establish rampage tank order with arrows...then charge.<br />
<br />
Good luck, it's a fun combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you.<br />
<br />
So, in your opinion, would a force of 18 be able to do this?  Mostly 65's? Not-elemental but bazaar &amp; some ldon equipped?<br />
<br />
Seems I am stretching everyone's memory banks here now lol.<br />
<br />
So the hitpoints prob are accurate.  Thanks on that.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your help immensely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yelinak's new guards, and all other level 62+ mobs populating the upper third of Skyshrine, are on a 72-minute timer just like their siblings in TOV.  If you take forever to dish out loot, you might see them respawn, but I only ever saw that happen once.<br />
<br />
For a small force, healing mana is likely to be the issue, since the AE is a mana dot, and I think it overwrites clarity buffs (I can't remember for sure offhand, it changed so many times since Velious).  With decent FT and/or bardsong, it ought to be doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A group of 20 65s can do this easily pre-VT with good mechanics.<br />
<br />
As stated before COTH up to the spot directly across from the gate. Have everyone hug the wall.  Pull the 2 drakes by the gate then pull the guards from the inside.<br />
<br />
Also, if you can see Yelinak, then you are agro <br />
<br />
Nope not true.  You can see Yeli from the COTH spot through the gate.  Heck I have run into his room pulling guards and not drawn agro.<br />
<br />
Also you can pull his guards single at lvl 65...takes 10 mins to clear them.<br />
<br />
On engage have your MT around the opposite side of Yeli (with the short wall).  Hits quad 125 mostly against def (if you use that instead) so its really just a long fight if you have light dps.  I think we use an 8 or 9 sec CH cycle.<br />
<br />
Also as he is rooted I have never seen him pushed very far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well like I said it's been a while since I fought him, so I'm probably wrong about the agro range. (We only killed him during velious days, stopped doing him after Luclin came out).<br />
<br />
LY is rooted so I don't know where you get the push part from, he doesn't move.  <br />
<br />
Yeah I know he's rooted, but when we killed him all the melee would be opposite the MT and LY still got pushed around all over his lair. Don't know if someone had a knockback type weapon or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, thank you, thank you.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, if he is up on one of our 4 raid nights and we have the turnout we will give it a whirl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Push was a problem when Yelinak was the only rooted mob in EQ, it wasn't implemented quite right, and he'd warp occasionally if the push was too great (e.g. into the water, which is bad).<br />
<br />
After Luclin came out and lots of Velious/Luclin bosses became rooted, Yelinak stopped warping.  Push away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selucreh Herculian</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do Yelinak routinely with 20 to 24 peeps.  SOE, Lev, or DMF required due to ice floor.  The many times I have tanked LY never saw any push. <br />
<br />
When ready to engage, have MT enter call out AE, healers head to left ramp MT should engage LY on the left side (back facing heal team on left ramp), all other melee on right side.<br />
<br />
LY procs single target stun, knockback, so MT has to be ready.  As in a previous post, you need to use Def Disc, not Stonewall.  There will be proximity aggro due to MA getting knocked back, so be ready for that as well.  If you have a good strat should be no problem.  Engage, slash, nuke, rinse, repeat then loot up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caelidar</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we did it, we ran everyone just inside the door, then immediatly left and right into the water (all levi'd) the healers went all the way around to the back corners on either side of the ledge where the click out is.  The  healers floating just above the water.  all melee where on the bottom of the ramp on either side ready for the melee call in.  The MT can easily sneak around to stand just under the click out with no agro to be ready to engage.  This way the knockback doesn't throw you all around the room just back into the wall.  After our first few kills we began to expirement with a &quot;Fatty Wall&quot; placing 2 or 3 large race tanks behind the MT who is either shrunk or a medium race.  We found that this stopped about 75% of the knockbacks, as I was just thrown back into the &quot;Fatty Wall&quot; and not out of aggro range.  Lastly on of the most important things is to make sure all your melee fight Yeli at MAX melee range.<br />

<br />
Quads for 600 max unslowable.  Dps is about the same as King Tormax and Dain.  It's not terribly frightening especially now since a lot of us are used to PoP mobs, but it's nothing to scoff at either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed LY a week ago.<br />
<br />
No push issues.<br />
<br />
CoTH right outside lair worked fine.  We brought in a sacrificial KOS person and waited to see how far the aggro range was and found we had no issue.<br />
<br />
Knockback was annoying as hell but no biggie either.<br />
<br />
Suggestions were useful and they worked - THANK YOU!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just charge in and beat him down.  Honestly I think the crusader outside is harder than Yeli... the one that ae's a dot + big melee slow.<br />
<br />
He certainly takes longer to kill anyway.</div></div><hr />
