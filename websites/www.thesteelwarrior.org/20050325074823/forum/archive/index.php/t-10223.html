<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Allow me to set some background.  I have a 3 year old daughter, who's already very capable of using computers and various video game machines.  I can't beat her on some levels of this Crash Bandicoot racing game we have for the Gamecube...it's pretty ridiculous.  To keep her out of my hair while I game, I created a couple of characters (one on each of my accounts) for her to play.  Well, to be fair..she basically created them, I just did set some things up for her.<br />
<br />
Since there's no way to attach images where you want them anymore, and they just come up as thumbnails, I'll just do this as replies so it works better.  Meet Alexa, my daughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, bear in mind, my kid can't type anything to anyone, because...well, she can't really spell yet.  She can spell her name, and other than that, it's just mashing of the keyboard.  The degress that people figure this out are varying.  Some people apparantly have absolutely no idea what's going on...like this fellow, and the previous person who attempted to chat with my daughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, oddly enough, she manages to get groups, and people make her leader and follow her around.  How your life has gone so wrong as to follow a 3 year old around in a video game, I don't know.  But at any rate, she does know that the fireball kills stuff, she knows how to hit things, and she gets enough groups without saying a word that she's managed to level up to level 8.  Here's an example of what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When she got to level 5, and I could run her over to Ironforge, I looked up an Herbalism/Alchemy trainer and got her started in that.  I taught her how to click the flower button to make flowers (Peacebloom..little flower on the ground) show up on her map, and she instantly got to work gathering them up.   She can't really make anything with them, because, well, she's 3, but she sure has a lot of fun.  Peacebloom also sell to the vendor for 10c a piece, making sure that she has enough income to buy the nonsense that she likes to buy from vendors...like new shirts, and pants and gloves, and, since my wife is a Tauren Hunter, my daughter also feels that she needs to have a bag full of bullets at all times too.  What are ya gonna do? <br />
<br />
Yesterday, I found out that she has also joined a guild.  I personally am wondering how long those tards are going to keep her in the guild without her ever saying a word, to anyone, regarding anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So that's my story, that I thought I'd share.  I watch her occasionally and hit the print screen button whenever I think something amusing could occur shortly...which happens frequently.  My 3 year old, has managed, without ever saying a word to anyone, to get groups, get loot, complete a couple of quests, join a guild, and get to level 8.  I'm also pretty sure she's got a decent herbalism skill too.<br />
<br />
And the sad part of this is -- my daughter is actually better at the game than some of the fools I've seen running around paying money to be a bumbling idiot.</div></div><hr />

I'm also on Hellscream.</div></div><hr />

Don't underestimate what little kids can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I call BS simply because you'll have a hell of a time landing ANYTHING a +4 above you.<br />
<br />
You may have gotten lucky, but unless there's some extreme circumstance, I highly doubt you could land much on him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically it wasnt a duel it was a gnome warlock, I used my res-reincarnate and finished his ass off.... I guess not everyone has a stone ready heh.... he was one of those warlocks who play like an everquest shammy, canni canni canni... so really he did most of the damage to himself.<br />
<br />
Still pvp, but the differance is I could get back up and hit him again :)<br />
<br />
Being a warlock, his defense rating was really low he stuck with ol' blue all the time it seems, but I do a fair amount of my damage with my staff so my melee stats were better (and no I don't melee because I am a retard, but because it is one of the few ways to make grinding greenies fun heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think PvP is subject to the same immunity to spells if 4+ as PvE.  Higher level do enjoy a melee/spell resistance for being higher level but not nearly as harsh as the immunity faced in PvE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a younger cousin that I let play EQ while he was over once ofr the weekend. He was like 5 or so, I was pretty impressed to see that by the end of the weekend he made it to 15 or so. Even more so, since I didn't give him any other help other than show him how to move and attack. I just let him follow the new tutorial that they put in.</div></div><hr />

Yup, that's how it starts. Well, that and Nickjr.com. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to figure a way I can have Lex be the 5th in one of my groups, and give her a role that she can handle with her ability and attention span.  Won't be long I say :)<br />
<br />
That's kind of creepy, considering I just saved her from a bunch of troggs in Dun Morogh when I was collecting a bunch of copper to spam engineering up from 1. <br />

Yeah well..she's 3...she goes AFK alot, like when Spongebob comes on :)</div></div><hr />

That first picture looks like she's jumping up and down on the bed.  Reminds me of my g/f's sister...she got on and made a cute gnome...(for some reason gnomes run in this family's blood).

Yup, that's what she's doing.  Also, every time she gets a group invite she says &quot;Look Dada...someone wants to be my friend!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure it's been mentioned before.  Start paying attention :p<br />
<br />
Haass, you should make a small macro for her, I think she'd love it. Make a &quot;/train&quot; macro and I bet she'd use it all the time. <br />
<br />
I was actually thinking about making a bunch of macros like <br />
<br />
&quot;Hay, do u guys know where teh phat loots are?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I join your guild?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you Powerlevel me?&quot;<br />

&quot;Can you spare some glod plz?&quot;</div></div><hr />

I think she'd fit in group just fine, she plays atleast as well as I do. Follow group members around, hit the same thing they are and stop paying attention when cartoons come on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Truly wonderful story, Haass.  I'm not a big kid person, but not having one of my own gives me that luxury.  I agree that &quot;kids do the damndest things&quot; though, like play MMORPGs better than a good percent of the adult population.<br />
<br />
If she can get to level 8, no reason to believe she can't eventually get to level 60.  Might take a while, but doubt it's impossible.  How unnerving would that be, at level 60, grouping with a 4 or 5 year old?</div></div><hr />

Wonderful story, the guild is ooohing and awwing over it now ... but, I was wondering how the raid went? :D</div></div><hr />

Never underestimate what little kids can do.  My cousin when she was 3 was really into the computer, focussing her energies so that she didn't mess anything up was hard... too bad WoW wasn't out then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, very cool story, Haass.<br />
My 3-year-old sometimes sits on my lap and handles the &quot;slam&quot; key in EQ, occasionally hitting the /g ADDS or various other random keys, heh (&quot;Erik, we don't spam taunt. Only hit it when you dont see any red words in this box...&quot;)<br />
the other day he woke up and asked his mom, &quot;Mom, what were we looking for in my dream?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know, honey. I wasn't really there.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. Were you just pretending to be there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Generally, I'd rather group with someone I knew was 3 years old than someone I knew was 13. The three year old would be more fun to follow around, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yesterday I got bored, so rolled up a couple of toons for us to run around with.  She decided on a warlock and I figured I better be a priest to make sure I can heal her.<br />
<br />
It was basically 3 hours of me telling her &quot;Hey...we're not that good at poking things, we gotta use our magic&quot; over and over and over......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Off topic. Yes, in pvp you CAN in fact do very nice damage through spells to another player with ?? advantage over you. Dont expect to win, unless you are pl;aying a total idiot, but I was able, at 29, to land spells on a rogue who was ?? to me, (everyone else said he was 40 ish) and in fact, was almost able to kill him solo with alot of judicious kiting and regular dotting so the blighter couldnt stealth on me. Only spell I had a hard time landing was my frost shock insta nuke. I was rarely ever resisted for any of my spells.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, that is so CUTE! My 3 year old neice is playing on the computer too but we have kids games, you know, paint this picture so it matches that one, figure out which block goes in which hole to make another picture appear. Some counting games and minor spelling. Nothing too strenuous but she does it pretty well. I wonder if I could teach her how to play the game too. Oh, and that gnome has to be the single cutest creature ever to be created lol.</div></div><hr />

We've a rogue or two you might enjoy mucking about with ... technically no 3 year olds, but they play with the same *cough* elan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll bet you could.  It's amazing how fast kids pick up on this stuff.  We started her out with easy stuff, learning the mouse and controls on other games, and now she's pretty damned good at the dexterity involved with controlling a character.  After that, you've just gotta show them how to kill things, how to loot them, and how to sell and buy stuff and they're set.</div></div><hr />
