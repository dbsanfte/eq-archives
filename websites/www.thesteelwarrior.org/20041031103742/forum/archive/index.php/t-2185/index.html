<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I now have the copper hammer of striking and the sword of the bloodsworn.<br />
<br />
To anyone who cant get BoC or CoD or bloodfrenzy's id really suggest this combo, in the 4 years i have been a tank, over 3 warriors this is the happest i have ever been with being a warrior <br />
<br />
If your going to buy one id suggest you get on early morning or late evening this is when people are willing to sell low because their tolerance for the bazaar is low, id also wait untill 4 are in the bazaar, price cutter's will make it really worth it (for you hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh ya and now for my question, which should go into primary?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jazmyn637</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mainhand should probably be the copper hammer, offhand sword.<br />
<br />
I have tested both out and they seem to proc at about the same rate...<br />
<br />
Even though sword has slightly faster delay, the ratio on hammer is slightly better.  Also hammer proc is 179dd + stun, while sword is only 75dd and stun --- hence, the hammer proc will generate slightly more aggro if you are trying to tank with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my (non-parsed) opinion, the hammer seems to proc quite a bit more than the sword.  I have mine in primary over the sword...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Terail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In what camp in Droga I might find this mob that drops this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pretty sure one drops off named in king room, the other drops off named in the room right outside king. I have yet to get my sorry behind over there with some friends to get these, I plan on doing it in the near future though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Everyone should camp their own..there's really no excuse not to.<br />
<br />
Don't be suckered into buying it in the bazaar...it's really not worth the plat for how easy the camp is.  I'd like to see every 55+ warrior who can't get their hands on a BoC or SoD with those 2 weapons, that would really make EQ a better place for us all.  A lot of those aggro posts will disappear over time after you use that combo for a few days.<br />
<br />
Is it a bandage fix?  Yes.  Is it a damned well implemented one?  Absolutely.  You don't need to be uber to get them, you don't need to get AA points, you just need to spend a couple hours with the King and his buddies to get an awesome ratio weapon with an awesome proc.  We're still slaves to the RNG, but at least we got stuff we can use to get the job done now, instead of a bunch of really halfassed weapons with either shitty stats or shitty ratios with the procs we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree<br />
<br />
Fantastic combo and yes- hammer should be mainhand: I have some DPS geek friends (rogues mostly) who swear by some modal calculation by which the hammer is superior. So far I have zero complaints...<br />
<br />
I too would recommend anyone interested in it to camp it. I bought it the first day they hit the bazaar thinking &quot;OMFG- 40k for a hammer that procs stun and 179 dmg. plus a 13/20 ratio and decent stats!!!!&quot; Needless to say it's going for a lot lower now that people have figured out how easy it is to loot.<br />
<br />
/sigh.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I mainhand sword over hammer.<br />
<br />
I find that the combination holds aggro as well or better than GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">some new aggro weps were needed but the drop rate on these is way to high and its ruining what was left of the economy when it comes 2 buying and reselling weps,kinda annyoing,a friend is using the hammer in main and it gives him better aggro,so i`d go with it in main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">eh screw the economy, i find it shitty that i have to pay 40k for a BP because i dont have a god, and i find it worse i see malos going for 50k, and the people selling it are all the same, they never thought to make it lore to drop prices and farming of it, it sucks when the market is corned and controlled by a few uber guilds, this is 1 example of a smart move on SoE's part because everyone can get it while its still useful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">altho im not in an uber guild,the ppl that are,have most likely worked hard to get there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior agro is still bullshit!<br />
<br />
Gratz on your new setup btw - guess its about the best agro for non uber warriors out there. At least they added those new weapons.<br />

I still think warrior agro is pure crap. I dual wield BoC and SoD and with that setup I barely stole agro from a paladin in my last group once! <br />
<br />
I don't buy it.  Complete bullshit.  I can take aggro off ANYONE with one BoC proc.  SoD draws aggro almost every time too.  Absolute total lies.</div></div><hr />

LOL, you proberbly never grouped with a decent pally then.<br />
<br />
Below you cant see an example from my log file, if I wasnt so lazy I could show you millions of those. This one being a proc from both SoD and BoC which didnt give me agro over the pally:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And that proves what?<br />
<br />
Jack and shit.  There are so many other factors that go into aggro that a 10 second log snippet doesn't prove crap.  He also cast twice after your procs before the mob attacked again....I could just as easily draw the conclusion that he stunned twice and regained aggro before the attack delay was up.  You didn't taunt that mob once in 14 seconds either.  You obviously weren't trying real hard to tank if you claimed you &quot;couldn't get aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
Good paladin /= chain stunning paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">LOL, you proberbly never grouped with a decent pally then.<br />
<br />
If it was a good paladin, you wouldn't have to fight him/her for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yes, people seem to think it is our job to TAKE agro /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">eh screw the economy <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree! <br />
<br />
The ecomony is for ebayers who farm stuff and sell plat for cash. Screw them I say! Not like they will not find another farming camp somewhere to make plat off of.<br />
<br />
I used the Copper Hammer of Striking in main and Heartspike in off. <br />
<br />
Agro is fabulous!<br />
<br />
I SAed a monk epic mob in LoIO and when the MA+Raid where done with 1st mob the MA could not get agro from me even tho he had 5 levels on me. He ahad 87% health when MA come in. I know he was using Flesh in main not sure what he had in off.<br />
<br />
I did not camp the CHoS but I worked sellers down to 14k for it which I think it is well worth 14k and that price is what good agro weapon should be imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually the real reason I would like everyone to camp this is because it really is easier than you think.  You can go there with damned near any halfassed group and walk out with a hammer, and then you'll kick yourself for throwing plat into something like that.<br />
<br />
If you've got a tank, someone who can snare, and someone who can heal, you've got enough to do King.</div></div><hr />

Make with the info already, there are more people than just me who are curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If you must know, I can duo this camp...63 warrior, 65 shaman.  Well, i'm 64 now, but that's beside the point.<br />
<br />
It's REALLY fuckin hard, but I can do it.  I don't beat the spawn by much.  Add any other class to the mix, and it only gets easier.  You can pull singles almost everywhere in droga at 60 if you know how the pathing works, so you're on easy street.  Don't need CC, don't really even need a slower if you've got a cleric.  The majority of damage from most mobs comes from spells.  Just get a trusty snare whip or work the pathing or find some other way to deal with the runners and you're set.<br />
<br />
You may not wanna try doing what I just described on your first run, but after you're familiar with the area (Which virtually any halfassed group can do), then it's a walk in the park.  And if you wanna look at my gear as soon as magelo comes back up, it's not like i'm in plane of Time either. Shaman has FT7 inlcuding MC, 70 or so AA's, Full spellbook, KEI usually, and when I started this camp I slightly under 5khp unbuffed, 97 AA's, and was using Windblade for DPS, altho that has now changed.  I guess i'm a bit better equipped than your average non uber guild joe, but I'm not a god by any means.</div></div><hr />

Bingo! Haass nailed it, but no one seems to be paying attention. In the one of other hammer/sword threads I posted damn near the same thing. I camped the king with my 65 wiz/57 war and a 65 bard friend. We had no problem keeping the room cleared even though we had to use bard regen/thurg BP for tank healing. We where there for around 2 hours and left with a hammer and 40% of an AA. Not bad considering we had no healer and ONLY did the spawns in the room. A decent group should be able to keep the king room and the pool room clear, which gives you a pretty good shot at a hammer AND a sword.</div></div><hr />

Any group that could handle the old Chardok gate camp can do this. Shoot, if they could hold the Chardok exit they could do this. Mobs have an insanely low aggro point, you can almost stand on em and not get aggro. We went down with a group of 6 and 15mins later I gots me a new toy.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Last night I took a group down to King camp. 65 warrior (me) , 65 cleric (wife) , 60 rogue, 60 shaman, 57 druid, 65 BL. It was an easy trip down, we didn't need crowd control except pet-split tanking just to conserve mana. Druid was 50/50 on the snares being resisted. <br />
<br />
I told them there were possible upgrades here for me, but I wanted to greed roll because I don't like people making special trips just for me. After killing the king's PH once, King Dronan popped w/ hammer in hand. We take him down and continue another 45 minutes, no king in 2 spawns and it is late so we get ready to port and roll. I Actually won the roll, which freaked me out because I haven't won a /random 1000 for an upgrade weapon in a long long time.<br />
<br />
Our group had an easy time, but we were higher level w/ average-good gear, and our group worked well together. I would say it would be an easy/do-able camp for a group 58+ as long as they had crowd control, or an fd-puller. Some of you guys here can duo the camp, like Haas has, because you know exactly what the other toon will be doing.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I hope to find something good to offhand w/ my new hammer. Probably go back and camp a Bloodsworn because they compliment each other well. These weapons should hold me till I can spring the coin for a BoC. I am glad we greed-rolled because I never feel bad about selling something when I get an upgrade. If I am awarded loot and then upgrade I feel it is my duty to seek out the old group or pass it down to someone ( nothing wrong with that but when you are broke it hurts the pocket book ) .</div></div><hr />

Keep it up, it's streaky.  Assuming you are in the correct area (since the Bloodsworn ph/named spawns *above* the King area) it's just a matter of time.  My group killing both the PH's (King and sword-dropper-whose-name-escapes-me-atm) got 2 hammers and 3 swords in a little over 2 hours one evening...however, another group went about 3 hours w/o seeing  a single hammer.<br />

<br />
Hard to answer definitively...depends on the players and how well equipped everyone is.  Easiest thing to realize is that each Goblin hits for around 200 max, has alot of hit points for a Kunark mob (8-10k?), and the casters are throwing ice comets and lures...as well as malo (god...I hate malo'ing casters).<br />
<br />
Can that group handle, say, your worst case scenario of a 3 pull in those conditions?  I'd say yes...but I dunno if I'd call it 'easy'.  That group can definitely handle the King or any other PH camp, but I don't think you have the DPS needed to clear both the King and the Bloodsworn drop camp.<br />

One 1100 nuke does 4% dmg, a 1400 nuke does 5%.. figures to be around 22-24k hitpoints per mob. <br />

They sure didn't hit me hard, we rarely even slowed them, but keep the area clean with out the dps may be an issue.  If you want, runinto his room near the bed and you will get two adds, can clear from inside the hut</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Ok, I camped hammer 2 nights ago and bloodsworn last night. I have not got to do exensive testing yet in Tier 2-3 Planes yet though. Normally I can make a good judgemnt about aggro but I need a few other opinions. I really like my GSoT, but double proc stuns is hard to ignore with my new combo.<br />
<br />
I parsed several fights and had a very reliable 62.8 dps. This was with Bloodsworn in main, CHoS offhand. Unfortunately my 1hb is 215, so Im counting on perhaps 3 more dps when I max it ( probably tonight ) . When I hit HoH spirits ( NE camp ) I will have a reliable base to compare for both aggro and parsing, because I have a pretty steady group of friends that AA with me there. I will post dps parses once I get back ( within 3 days, depending on who from my group is at work, hehe ) . By then I should have a good judge of aggro vs. my GSoT.<br />
<br />
Any comments on aggro w/ this combo is appreciated, especially in comparison if you own a GSoT as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Went looking for Page of Dark Power #3 in PoI, so I decided to turn on the parser:<br />
<br />
lvl 65<br />
Ferocity 1<br />
Improved Crits 1<br />
Haste- SoV + CoF <br />
Dex was at 197<br />
<br />
After 124 fights, CHoS main SotBS offhand, I did 64.8dps. I switched out sword w/ hammer to check proc ratio and it felt like CHoS procced a good deal more than sword, but you know how the RNG is. I had only a couple fights where they did not proc till the end of the fight, but these fights were averaged to 1:03 minute fights. I did enjoy a few times where I chain procced 4 CHoS procs, within 1 second of each other and the the SotBS chained 3 times right after... That was a nice feeling.<br />
<br />
As for aggro: Group was Me, 62 chanter, 62 Necro, 56 druid ( healing at 583 per cast lmao ) and 62 warrior. The Necro is a good friend and NOTORIOUS over-nuker/doter. The Chanter is a friend who casts atleast 3 Anarchy-line of spells ( forget their name, but SoD-proc type of spell ). The Warrior had a Split Blade of Destruction mainhand and SBoZ offhand, attacking from the back. After an hour I asked my chanter buddy how he felt about the aggro and tell the truth, he said ' I have been trying to steal your aggro now and then testing, and you seem to be doing real well'. I thought maybe my friend was jacking with me till the warrior pipes up &quot; You got good aggro bro, I been taunting for the last hour and if I take it your proc pulls it right back&quot;. My necro friend only jacked my aggro about 4 times in 124 fights, so I feel good about that.<br />
<br />
We'll, for the most part I feel confident in this combo. More parsing to come from HoH and BoT very soon, as well a a better description of aggro vs. my GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>maolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I have a question, but I figured I'd add my experience with this camp before then.  I spent last night camping the King/Seer with 2 friends.  One was a 65 cleric (50 AAs, pretty good gear) and the other was a 65 enchanter (60 AAs, decent gear).  I have decent gear for a non-RZ warrior, but nothing absolutely amazing.  We had absolutely no trouble with the King or Seer camps.  The chanter had charmed pets up most of the time for DPS, and we were clearing the king room and pool room without much trouble.  Tanking these things are a joke with a slower.  Went through 2 PHes before seeing the King, and he dropped the hammer.<br />
<br />
Moved onto the Seer after that, but never saw him through about 7 PHes.  Planning on heading back tonight.<br />
<br />
Now, for my question.  I played with the Copper Hammer a bit last night, but noticed the &quot;target is immune to the stun portion of this effect&quot; message whenever it proc'd.  As I assume the stun is the majority of the taunt from it, does this mean I don't get aggro in that circumstance?  To be fair, I only tried it in Droga for a little while and haven't had time to do more rigorous testing.<br />
<br />
I also noticed the Great Blade of Storms has this same proc, but I've anecdotally heard that it has nice aggro as well.  Wouldn't it have the same problem as the Copper Hammer?<br />
<br />
Hoping that a) it still generates aggro or b) it is just certain mobs, because the GBoS is my goal atm.</div></div><hr />

HOWEVER, even tho they are immune the agro is still generated as they would almost always turn to me if I was trying to get agro.<br />

Excellent to hear this confirmed.  I was a bit worried that my research had led me astray on aggro weapons :)<br />
<br />
How well do these weapons perform in Tier 3 Planes?  I have mostly been hunting in Drunder/BoT these days.  I have been using my Sword of Ssra almost exclusively for tanking in exp groups, and don't have a big problem with it, generally.  Early tash/slow from my chanter friend will usually drag aggro off of me, but I can keep up with decently equipped rogues with no issues.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if the CHoS/SoB (eventually GBoS/CHoS, I hope) combo is going to be solid enough aggro to give up the DPS from the Ssra.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Liakim1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Hello warriors.<br />
<br />
Like Haass, I also don't think warriors should be buying these weapons considering how easy they are to obtain, unless you have no friends or you and your friends aren't at least 60ish.  Ever since Droga was revamped, I've been leading hunting trips into Droga since the plat and xp is very nice.  When we first found the hammer and sword, we did put them up for sale thinking they were ultra-rare, but now after we've collected so god-awful many of them I've actually been giving them away.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm no artist but I drew these up -<br />
<br />
King room (http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-8/78197/KING.JPG) <br />
<br />
You can invis to anywhere in the zone.  I have yet to find a mob that saw through invis.  Anyways, invis down to spot A, set up against the wall there.  #1 is the mob I always pull first (be careful sometimes he has a wandering friend near him).  I then pull #2...... for 3 and 4 if I have a pacifying class I'll have them pacify one, if not I just pull one and usually get both - not a problem if your team is on the ball.  Once 3 and 4 are dead, move your group into the entryway, pull 5 to you and kill, repeat with 6.  Move into room and turn hard right to the bed in the lower right corner on drawing..... pull 7 to you and kill him.  I usually go back to entrance area and pull #8 next, pull him down and over to the bed where my group is, however if you have pacify you can do them in whatever order.  #9 is the placeholder for King Dronan.  If he has the Copper Hammer, he'll be holding it when he pops.  If he isnt holding, he is going to drop a Devastating Maul.  Once room is broken I just move the group around the room counter-clockwise so no mobs pop under them.... if you're killing fast pull the door mobs for extra xp and loot.<br />

For the Sword of the Bloodsworn :<br />
<br />
Earth Seer area (http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2003-8/78197/SEER.JPG) <br />
<br />
Break invis and kill at mob #1.  Watch the side passages, there's a wanderer each way.  Kill #2, then pull  #3.  #3 is the placeholder for Earth Seer Gamolk.  Every time I've killed the Earth Seer, he has had sword, and wields it when fighting.<br />
<br />
Mobs in the area :<br />
Goblin bone depredator - SK mobs.  Darkness, boil blood, 1k Harm Touches.<br />
Goblin bone collector - necros.  Darkness, dots, root, dispell.<br />
Goblin cave lords - warriors.  Pure melee.<br />
Goblin ice masters - wizards.  Use a lot of lure spells, can hit for 600-900.  Also root and dispell.<br />
Goblin earth seers - shaman.  Malo, root, dispell, dots, Turgur's.<br />
Goblin dust hoodlums - rogues I think, never turned my back to them.<br />
Assorted drogan spiders - nuisance mobs.  Melee and poison.<br />
<br />
King PH is always a cave lord.  Gamolk PH is always an earth seer.<br />

P.S.  Copper Hammer proc is a stun/55.  Target immune to this effect means it's a giant/dragon or is level 55+.  Still generates agro.  Sword is a planar stun, affects mobs up to 65 that aren't flagged immune.  Target has resisted &quot;proc name&quot; means it's MR check passed and your proc didn't land, but still generates some agro.  Giants in PoS/BoT don't have the stun immunity that old world giants do in my experience either.</div></div><hr />

Well, my current weapon setup is a Great Blade of Storms and a Hategiver, and I main hand the GBoS. Since GBoS has the same proc as CHoS, I'd venture a guess that this will serve you *very* well in any tier plane till you an get your hands on better.<br />

<br />
Since I will be buying these weapons (my uber days are over), I think that the GBoS is probably the highest I can hope to attain.  I've used Hategiver a lot in the past and it's pretty nice, so if GBoS is better primary hand, I'll definitely continue to try and attain one.  Sounds like it's just what I need to round out my weapons (Ssra 2hander works great for DPS/no aggro).</div></div><hr />

Sure enough it dropped and I was awarded it. I've been using it all day and must admit when it procs the agro control is Amazing. The only downside is, at 255 Dex, it's not proc'ing all that often. Maybe it's just not a luck day for proc's. Still a REALLY good weapon though.</div></div><hr />

Using copper main and bloodsworn off (and benching my trusty red epic) I found aggro control today much easier in tov than I remembered. Seemed great really. As a bonus, the proc of the bloodsworn actually interrupted a few casting mobs trying to gate, which is very sweet. Those mobs are immune to the stun portion of the hammer, but the sword landed great and both are excellent aggro.<br />

Seems to me that since they are both great for agro wouldn't the DPS max solution be to wield the sword in main hand and hammer in off?  Are people wielding the hammer on main hand because it procs more than sword?  If that is the case then so be it.  Just wondering whats up.</div></div><hr />

Hammer has a slightly better ratio, enough to compensate for it's 1 slower delay IMHO.  The real difference is in the proc tho, 179ish hp vs 75hps.  If you figure your mainhand will proc 1-3 times in the average fight that's upwards of 225 extra damage the CHoS will do.<br />

Ease to find: moderate.  Had a guide but with the in game maps pretty easy to find<br />
Ease to camp: very easy (cleric, ranger, warr all 65).  If you have a slower its cake.<br />
Drop rate: we all had a bloodsworn sword in 45 minutes.  It was common drop of the seer.<br />
<br />
So if you dont have one get thee to Droga!!  Even if its camped because odds are as a common drop the sword will rot eventually (brings back memories of Sol B painbringer/fleshripper) and you might have a shot at one.<br />

Oh yeah...used the bloodsworn and CHSD combo in BoT and Tactics over the weekend.  It has very nice agro as a combo.  Still wound up switchin in GSOT because of high riposte damage though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I've read about this and immidiately rushed over to Droga to get these weapons. I'm a 65 warrior with 55 AA using epics, so a new main hand would be nice. Was actually extremely easy getting these weapons, and some other nice loots as well. <br />
<br />
The seer is duo-able with a healer easily. Just go invis to the seer, pull him away from the spawn on the bridge into the dark hall, and fight him there. I was using ToD to slow him and beat him down the epics with a 65 druid healing me. <br />
Dropped sword, and we greed rolled, i won. <br />
<br />
When doing king i had the same 65 druid, her 59 druid friend, and a 63 bard guildie. Was relatively easy, the bard only had 35% slow so i was slowing king myself, he took care of the rest. We went inside the house invis, and hid behind the bed. There is a small pathing bug, if someone in the corner by the bed corner gets aggro the mob will run across the room and back to get there. Anyway, i was able to single almost everything except the king, who decided to run and grab his friend by the oven instead of running straight at me. Oh, by the way, if you don't like being tashed, rooted, snared, and nuked, watch out! :P<br />
<br />
After we got 2 hammers the bard had to leave, so it was kinda tough with the occasional add, would've been able to keep the whole room cleared if we weren't lacking bards extra DPS, with the bard it was easy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, right now i have the sword, hammer, and epic. I think i'm going to keep my red blade, only move it to offhand. It's slower but the proc is slightly better then taunting blow and rarely gets resisted. I would never put away a weapon with a decent ratio and taunting blow for a weapon with a stun. <br />
<br />
Now, for the hammer and sword...they're kinda the same, and the proc rate is good on both. However, i'm not sure about their effecy. Both have a DD(the hammer slightly higher), and both have a stun...or at least i think they do. When they proc you see this:<br />
<br />
[warrior] hit [target] for 75/179 points of non-melee damage<br />
<br />
[target] has been struck<br />
<br />
That is when the proc fully effected the mob, and it got stunned. Now, i've been using the hammer in droga and ssra and i'd say 90% of the time you see this:<br />
<br />
Your target is immine to the stun part of this effect<br />
or<br />
Your target resisted the stun part of this effect<br />
<br />
however, when using the sword i *never* got that. Every time the swords proc landed and wasn't fully resisted, and full resists were rare for both weapons, the sword stunned the mob. Maybe the sword is broken and doesn't display it right, but the stun seems to work every time and the stun on the hammer gets resisted almost always. <br />
<br />
If everything is working right, my only guess would be that Planar Strike is a much higher level stun then Force Shock, that's why the planar strike stun always works. I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
I have yet to test both of these weapons in exp zones like BoT, please post your thoughts and comments on this.</div></div><hr />

From my perspective as a paladin, Actual Stun &gt; Immune to Stun &gt; Resisted Stun, although they are all very close.  In my experience, a slow spell falls between Immune and Resisted... From personal experience I've seen a mob slowed on inc, my stun gets 'resisted' and mob continues on to the slower.  Whereas if I get an immune message, 9 times out of 10 it will turn to me.  <br />

this with Veldrak's short Blade,13,23 with the same proc forceshock, which is a rare drop off hoshkar a raid mob in vp,although the ratio sucks on my blade and it is alot harder to get than the CHOS,the proc goes sick,havnt had a weapon that<br />

for me especially being from a small guild and will never see a BOC,SOD until i have saved the required amount pp,but then i have hardly ever seen either for sale on Tunare ever,and i watch the market quite often.Ok as far as the proc being resisted,i can say in BOT a tier 3 zone i get about 2 resists in about every ten<br />

1 , do some weapons with the same proc ,go off more than other weapons with the same proc, or are they all equal?<br />

2, would i be better off getting the Sword of the Bloodsworn for my off hand,does it have a good proc rate? which will generate more aggro because i know it has a better ratio 13/19 compared to 13/23 but not really concerned about dps just aggro, please dont answer saying stuff like get a boc this get a sod that because unless you know somone on Tunare who wants to part with one  im all ears, would just like to hear from somone who may have had experiance with any of these weapons, also way off getting the GBOS because  my guild has only a handfull of lev 65 folk but is a good respected family guild.and i dont wish leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">What pieces of Ornate are single groupable, btw? Everything but a BP should be single groupable by a good group. There are 3 type of named in BoT:<br />
<br />
level 64 named - these are the guys that pop in different places in each wing. They can drop the ornate, spectral parchements, and the occassional rune. They can also drop nothing, but this seems to be pretty rare since they nerfed the drop rate on ornate last patch. These are on a normal random spawn with PHs but none are particularly rare.<br />
<br />
level 65 named - these are the &quot;bosses&quot; of the wings. The spawn at the teleporter that takes you up to the Courtyard. They can drop ornate up to legs, some misc loots, runes, and spectrals. I have yet to see one drop nothing, often the drop 1 loot, 1 spec, 1 rune. These must have a spawn time since there is no PH when they are not up. However, I am unsure of the spawn time but it is going to be on the order of a few hours tops.<br />
<br />
level 67 named - these are the Tower bosses. While it is true that some of them can be 1 grouped, anyone who could 1 group them doesn't need the drops. They can drop ornate BPs, runes, and some pretty nice loot. Generally you are going to want 2 very strong groups or 3 average to take on a Tower boss. They vary in difficulty and abilities vastly so you might have to change up your raids accordingly. These guys are amazingly on a 6 hour timer.</div></div><hr />

last night in Tactics I was the main tank (only level 62 ) with my group being all 65 ( shammy wiz ench rogue mage; all with min 80 aa's or so; top notch gear+spellbook ) and my sword of the bloodsworn was absolutely incredible for aggro minus the few times ( maybe 5% that the enchanter/shammy got slow off before a proc but i got aggro back in maybe 2 rounds of combat if that ).<br />
also had red epic offhanded but only used it as a backup snap+increased hate.<br />

When we had been in Droga for some time waiting for the King camp, there was actually a 65 druid there claiming to hold it.....A few minutes later we saw his corpse being dragged past us to entrance tho :D Then while moving down another enc passed us claiming he had been holding the camp  Realizing he wouldn t be able to KS us he logged. I hate farmers; This spot is pretty sure to be perma-camped on the Nameless. :mad: <br />
<br />
As pointed out. most mobs you ll be fighting at 65 will be immune to the stun part, but aggro seemed good. As to wether it is better than a GSoT is quite a point of debate. GSoT damage&gt; most droppable 1h combos so dps aggro is higher, possibly making it slightly better in exp groups, but for longer fights where you are defensive I would guess building aggro with 2 procs would probably work better. <br />

I seriousely hope when VI does &quot;fix&quot; melee, DW is improved as the only reason to do so at the moment is for more proccage. <br />

The 14/19 and 90hps on the SBoD keep me using it vs the 12/19 or 13/20 and inferior hps of the other two weps.  In your case, forget the droga weapons. With a BoC mainhand, you don't need to worry about having a high agro offhand, just something that will crank out the DPS and make your magelo look good. SBoD is a great weapon for doing just that. Sure BoC+droga weapon would be more agro, but do you really need it? If you are not having trouble holding agro, then keep the SBoD.<br />

I see where one person said they ditched their SBoD but for which Droga wep? I like the idea of the 179DD / stun but if I really want aggro won't the 0.0stun/65 be more effective? How so? A stun generates good agro whether it lands, is resisted, or if the mob is immune. Just ask a pally how good stun works for agro on giants. The DD portion is seperate from the stun so a 179dd &gt; 75dd.</div></div><hr />

I'm not 100% on this yet, but from what I've seen the hammer proc seems to be more agro than the sword; I've never had a mob leave me after a slow after the hammer procced, while it did happen with the sword proc. I suppose the higher dd is what accounts for it, since they both stun.<br />
<br />
The fact that stun doesn't work on 55+ mobs doesn't mean much to me since you still get stun agro from it. Try is with a cleric or a pally if you have high enough and you'll see what I mean. So the only negative effect would be the unability to interrupt a mob's casting with a hammer proc, which is meaningless since it's impossible to rely on procs for spell interruption anyway.<br />
<br />
I've seen a lot of other warriors do the same thing, incidentally, and when I asked some they confirmed my feeling about it: it seems easier to hold agro with the hammer in main hand.<br />
<br />
As for everyone being the same with these two? I'll take that anyday, and I keep hoping that every warrior I know starts to use these weapons. Looking the same as others is a small price to pay for people respecting warriors more and inviting us to groups more readily. I've already made some converts myself, many groups I've tanked for have come away with a new respect for warrior tanks ;)<br />

Very easy camp and every warrior that does not have better should make his way there.  Course you may have to deal with the farmers to get in the camp (this zone seems perfect for them).<br />

Other decent loot in the zone, including some 65hp boots with other stats.<br />

Camped for them myself, but what is all this talk about clearing the room? Get a 65 cleric, pacify all mobs in King room and tag him for single pull. My little group does ALL the uncamped named in Droga whenever we go. You can invis anywhere and pacify/pull anything single. We have done as many as 6 named at one time ignoring anything but PH and target mobs ( Runri, Whip Cracker, Jailor, King, Jalpal, and Seer ). Not going to go into extreme detail, but since King seems to be the main target mob I'll give you a little hint. If you are facing the temple the mound on the left side is safe to pull to. Pacify one outside the door, then the two right in the arch, then move up and tag the rest...I pull with mark of righteousness. This way there is no clearing involved and we have done the camps with as little as 65 cleric / 56 warrior / 60 chanter.<br />

I'm glad we now have aggro weapons more accessible. Just kind of hurts that the 26k I paid for my wavecrasher will become MAYBE 11k if I'm lucky on resale. Might as well keep it in my bag in case I ever fight with no slower =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Kodi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Just one question before I run out to camp this spot.  I've read some of the posts in this thread about duel welding in BoT, HoH and such.  Aren't you all taking a beating from the ripostles in the PoP zones?  <br />
<br />
I would imagine that the upside to our aggro gain in duel welding these new toys would be countered by the downside of taking more damage from the heavy hits of Planar mobs.  Any feedback on this would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">The amount of riposte damage you will take on anything less than a 2k hitter is unsignificant compared to the agro. Take a look at the riposte parse thread, you are looking at around a 10% increase in damage due to ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Kodi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">I read all the posts under the Riposte Parse thread and from what I can tell it reflects a 10% increase in reposte damage going from DW to 2H.  But then I asked teh question straight out about the difference in damage taken from goin DW in PoP and peeps replied with differing results.  You can follow here:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2867&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=2<br />
<br />
So I guess I'm still questioning the theory that DW holds better aggro but in the long run you will take a significant amount of damage for that aggro in the Tier 1/Tier 2 PoP zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">You are asking 2 different things. By DW you will double the number of ripostes you take, but that still amounts to a 12% increase in TOTAL DPS taken.<br />
<br />
A typical Tier 1/2 mob probably does around 150 DPS. If you switch to DW, you will see an increase of around 12% total DPS taken AND your riposte rate will about double (increase 125%).<br />
<br />
If you separate mob damage and riposte damage, you can do the math to see what you end up with when switching from DW to 2h.<br />
<br />
150 TOTAL DPS = mob damage dealt + riposte damage<br />
<br />
Since the parsing show that riposte damage using 2h accounts for 10% of total damage taken:<br />
<br />
150 TOTAL 2H DPS = 135 dps (Total mob damage) + 15 dps (total riposte damage)<br />
<br />
By increasing total DPS taken by 12% by switching to DW:<br />
NEW TOTAL DPS = 150 TOTAL 2H DPS + (12% * 150 TOTAL 2H DPS)<br />
NEW TOTAL DPS = 150 TOTAL 2H DPS + 18 DPS increase<br />
NEW TOTAL DPS = 168 DPS<br />
<br />
By doubling the riposte rate by switching to DW:<br />
NEW TOTAL DPS = 135 dps (Total mob damage) + 2.25*15 dps (total riposte damage)<br />
NEW TOTAL DPS = 135 dps (Total mob damage) + 33.75 dps (total riposte damage)<br />
NEW TOTAL DPS = 168.75 dps<br />
<br />
As you can see, a 12% increase in DPS is going to be nearly equal to increasing the riposte rate 125%. At the level of damage an exp mod deals, this is largely insignificant. When you are dealing with a boss mob that does 1500 DPS the increase is much more pronounced.<br />
<br />
<br />
** EDIT ** reread the other thread and updated, was using wrong % for increase in ripostre damage and riposte rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well thats a trick question really.<br />
<br />
You can invis inside and fight him at his spawn point and you wont agro anything.<br />
<br />
You can pull each one and then him single when the others are dead <br />
<br />
I think what you asking htough is if you stand outside of the hut and target him without clearing anything... no, you will get him, and four more (the two at the door and two to his right)<br />
<br />
Its easier to either kill all the mobs leading up to him or invis and stand on his spawn and kill him there, wont agro either if you kill him at spawn and maybe one foot to his left.<br />
<br />
Again, I think your asking if you can pull him like you can pull EK bandits single if they are surrounded by 5 others, no you can not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very Easy. I showed my lvl 50 friend how to do it last night. He cleared the room with ease up until a seerer decided to 760x4 rain on them.<br />
<br />
In the hallway to the king there are 2 outter guards leading into the room for king. You can ignore them an move to the mouth of the king room. There will be a mob to the left and a mob right in front of the bed. Back up and set up camp in the hallway. Dont move further then where the hallway widens. If you move too far back you will agro the 2 door mobs.<br />
<br />
Pull the mob on the left with a arrow/spell. He will come solo. Kill him and pin him in the wall as not to agro the right bunkbed guy. <br />
<br />
Snare is your friend - Love it <br />
<br />
Pull the bunkbed guy while hugging the right wall. Again rinse and repeat. Pin/Snare/kill.<br />
<br />
Now you have 3 mobs left in the room. Pull the one on the farthest right. He will come to you without agroing, king ph or middle spawn, Kill him. At this point this is where alot of people end up killing themselves. Most groups move to the bunkbed once those 2 spawns are dead. Then they procced to pull the left most mob, which will then run across king ph and agro him. The best way to do this is to stay in the hallway and pull right mob. He will path away from king stright to you. Kill him.  The last mob is king/ph. <br />
<br />
Thats how I do this camp every time. Easy as pie. Just watch out for icemasters who tend to sunstrike and seers who love to rain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">I agree with Maemai except for one point:<br />
You must Kill the 2 guards in the inner hallway leading to the King room. I honestly dont know how anyone can walk past these 2 mobs and setup camp in front of them without agro.<br />
At 65, I always get agro from these walking into the King room.<br />
Once these are dead my pull sequence is as follows:<br />
-Kill guy to left in the barrels ( west side )<br />
-Kill guy at bunkbed ( east/south of King room)<br />
-pull gobby to the right of King PH ( at corner on right side )<br />
-pull King/Ph<br />
-kill guy to the left of King<br />
<br />
-Out of King room pull guy directly in front of fountain<br />
-then head towards ramp west to Seer kill guy before ramp up<br />
- up ramp into large room with 2 mobs at opposite sides pull east<br />
-up to top and pull BOTH seer spawn mobs<br />
**edit: just a note on pulling the Seer spawns. Make sure you &quot;hand hold&quot; these mobs back to the camp spot. If you get down to the camp before these 2 mobs have begun to move down the ramp ( possible if they try to cast on you while you are running down instead of chasing you ) they will run down the OTHER side of the ramps and bring a large train to wipe you.<br />
I have seen this first hand several times.<br />
<br />
By the time you kill all these mobs you have King room repops<br />
<br />
This is how I pull Both the King Camps and the Seer camp.<br />
Setting up at the Bed area this can also easily be done, however to avoid the atrocious pathing the mobs have in the King room if you do setup at the bed it is better to use the inner hallway as Maemai suggested. Just beware that you WILL get the agro of the 2 mobs that spawn in there. If you move further into the King room to avoid the agro of these 2 mobs you get agro of the guy in the barrels to the left in the King room.<br />
Hope this is clear.<br />

Over the course of a several hour long camp you are bound to get the agro of these 2 at some point. I find it is easier to just handle them to be certain, definitely not saying your way is wrong.<br />

The thing about the King room Goblins and for that matter all goblins in Droga is they are extremely resistant to Magic. I have seen snares never land in multiple attempts and all the King room mobs run out of the room towards the 2 mobs in that antechamber.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>doncanaidaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">me and druid bot did the king camp SO easily.. What we did was the druid went into room and snared the PH and then hit innate camo and bolted outta the room and down the hallway straight out from the king room.  Went about 20 seconds down and evaced.  Since all the mobs chased him and the king was snared I just simply grabbed the king/ph and took him to a wall that was clear from agro. <br />
<br />
We did this a few times and only once did I have to FD because I accidently threw a fang at the wrong mob.  It was cake just have the druid invis the tank before he/she goes for the pull.  Was always alone and by itself if snare lands.<br />

 Greatstaff of Thunder - Around the time I started tanking PoS, a 65 Warrior buddy recommended this. (Thanks Govno :p) Was cheap as hell, and substantially better agro than the above mentioned 1hb weapons.<br />
 Sword of the Bloodsworn + Spiked Velium Mallet - Got the SotBs and I went back to duel-wielding for agro. The GSoT became my DPS weapon for farming greenies at this point. lol<br />
 Sword of the Bloodsworn + Copper Hammer of Striking - Hmm... besides augments I don't think I'm going to be upgrading my weapons for a while. I've had a couple BoT groups since wielding this combo, and agro seems to be very solid. A good deal of the time, in the time it takes a chanter to tash/slow I've built enough agro to either not lose it on slow, or to be able to Taunt immediately after slow and have agro for the remainder of the fight.
