<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rotep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't have the knowledge to do it.Anything I say he counters and shows I am wrong on warrior aggro. Go to http://www.guildportal.com and for the choice of guild searched,put in united alliance. Under the forums heading, look for the subject category  &quot;Quests,tips,strats and misc game info&quot;.<br />
 Look for the thread called &quot;warrior aggro&quot;.I'm only a 57 with little PoP exp.Since he won't go to a warrior that has the answers,I'll tell the warriors that have the answers where to go to read what he has to say and give better responses than I can.</div></div><hr />

Don't be too concerned about what people think regarding Warrior aggro and survivability. The subjects are pretty moot atm since we are about to be turned into RNG Hybrids Without Spellbooks.<br />
