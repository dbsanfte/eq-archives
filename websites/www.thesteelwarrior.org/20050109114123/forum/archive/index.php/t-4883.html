<br />
Is there a warrior hunting guide out there?  I'm at level 54 (decently equipped) now, and experience seems to have really, really slowed down.  I've tried LDON, but the exp seems slow there as well, is there a trick to getting good exp in LDON? IE, should I try to be the lowest level in the group?<br />
<br />
I tried Dulak last night, and the armory seemed to be a super spot, but the problem is that it's really tough to find a good group there because it's out of the way.<br />
<br />
I mostly have either a 54 BST with me, or perhaps a 52 cleric.  If I can find a spot where any combo of the above would work, I'd be happy.<br />
<br />
Also, I haven't tried the planes yet, but I've heard its good exp, can anyone please point me in the right direction?  I'm hoping to find a hot spot that will give me a yellow an hour, although I don't know if thats feasible at this level.<br />

<br />
You have your pick of two options!<br />
<br />
Hunting option A.  Go to where people in your level range are exping and get a group.<br />
<br />
Hunting option B.  Get 5 other people in your level range and go to where you can kill things that give exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for some usfull advice, being the lowest level person in a group and the tank is an extreamly bad thing. You can get away with that kind of thing if you are DPS but as a tank you will just end up getting chewed up and spit to bits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've personally found that being level 56 in a group full of mostly 60s people makes for plenty of yellow con mobs, which isnt too bad for you to be tanking and gives significantly better XP than being the highest or among the 'average' group level.<br />
<br />
It really only works out well if your grouping with competent players, because people will need to be paying attention and doing well and work around the tank being a lower level than the rest of the group...</div></div><hr />

I know they are just there trying to experience whore off a high level group and they won't contribute as much.  Stuff like... &quot;L56 &lt;insert class&gt; LFG&quot; in Plane of Valor just irritates me.  I don't know if others think the same as I do or not.  Probably.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if you have higher level friends willing to group you, then experience whore away!  It's faster.  :D</div></div><hr />

Heh, me too... Maybe the fact that I couldn't tank it until I was over 62 has something to do with it... NAH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your best bet, though, is to get into a group in a tier 1 zone, probably PoI.<br />
<br />
The best experience I ever get on a toon at that level is in a full group, with one or two 65s who are there to carry the group.  They get crap exp, but everyone else rejoices.</div></div><hr />
