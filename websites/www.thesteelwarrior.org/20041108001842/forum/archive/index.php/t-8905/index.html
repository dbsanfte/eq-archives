<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever since I got (yet) another computer and retired my old bard main I've been thinking of  trying to 4-box, but I just can't decide on which classes to pick.<br />
<br />
Preferably only one melee class for ease of boxing. I want tankage, enough healing to do stupid things, slow, snare and some form of pulling.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm thinking warrior, cleric, shaman, necro as they're all classes I actually enjoy playing and as they'd fill gaps in what my friends are playing but I'm very open to suggestions.<br />
<br />
- Warrior for tankage and fairly good melee dps.<br />
- Cleric for those quick, quick heals, DvA (must be very nice when boxing), res, buffs, pacification. No dps in this setting 'tho.<br />
- Shaman for slows, haste, melee buffs, some dps.<br />
- Necro for very good dps, snare, MW when applicable, pulling, looking badass.<br />
<br />
I came up with this since I already have a 56 shaman, 57 necro on separate accounts and a full set of fierce heraldic somewhere, so obviously I'm partial to this combo, but I wouldn't post this unless I really wanted your opinion. I'm in this for the fun of it, not to reach 65 in five days.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SK / CLR / SHM / WIZ would work too, gives you an FD puller and evac, plus both SK and wiz can snare.<br />
<br />
Tank / CLR / ENC / DRU gives you snare and evac as well.<br />
<br />
Probably boils down to what you like playing the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I 3box warrior, cleric and wizzie and it works out beautifully. I 3box named in KT np (wizzie's burst dps rocks). If I were 4boxing I would add either bard or sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zaramas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4"></div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zaramas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tank / CLR / ENC / DRU gives you snare and evac as well.<br />
<br />
Thats my setup.  Currently one machine is down so i am limited to War/Dru/Enc.<br />
<br />
I had access to a 65 chanter but my friends started playing again so its back to the 56 one.  <br />
<br />
With the old 4 I could hit any tier 2 or lower plane and do fine.  That was before the warrior was time flagged and only at 6K buffed.   Now that he is 9K buffed ( just kazzad/9/WoG/Shielding from the Orante BP) I can do a LOT more.<br />
<br />
I have soloed all the dragons in WW ( Before the VP revamp ), Did almost every mob in Valor or storms...except the lords of course.  Soloed all of Keal but the big named.  Just about any non pop/god zone is a snap. <br />
<br />
Once the 4th box is up and running again and I ding the New chanter 57 for the better slow I plan to try out the exp versions of the Sewers.  I did it with just the War/Dru/Clr but having to use a proc for slow was a little too close.<br />
<br />
I have though abought Lv a Beastlord to replaxce the chanter but probally wont.  <br />
<br />
Other combos work to but the Trinity setup seems to work best for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karlious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You need a Tank Healer and Slower... the 4th could be whatever. The Wizard idea seems like a good one tho!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Avallach Whitewinds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd vote for SK/CLR/ENC/WIZ, personally.<br />
<br />
If you're only going to have one tank class, I think you'd get more benefit out of the crack from the ENC than from the SHM buffs - especially if you use a knight instead of a warrior. The only reason I'd use the SK over WAR is for dps. That and he can Zbite for the casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wizards are a great bot.  So are clerics.  Tank/Cleric/Enchanter/Wizard would be great.  You have healing, rez, buffs, haste, slow, snare, evac, mez, and dps.  4 toons is so much easier than 3 to get a solid group without giving anything up hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mmm.Just boxing my wifes shammy is enough to give me brainache after a couple hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mmm.Just boxing my wifes shammy is enough to give me brainache after a couple hours.<br />
<br />
Me too hehe.  I 3-boxed War, Cleric, Mage for a while and it was a good group, but just more work than I want to do when I'm grinding exp hehe.  Two is pretty much max for me for any extended period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Too much work omg.Let someone else heal,buff and slow...I can pull leet trains and hit stuff.That's fun:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">btw. pick a warrior as tank. You get best tankage, dps depending on the weapons, aggro by just hitting incite and attack on. The need to cast spells all the time to keep aggro sucks for multiboxing. <br />
<br />
warrior cleric  chanter and wizard is prolly the most effective AND easiest to play multibox quad team.  You might  switch a druid for the wizard for better snare, neat overall dps trough DS, dots and nukes and the assistheals but wizard burst dps for nameds probably makes up for the loss of assistheals of the druid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tyop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Very sound advice here, thank you all. The combo you're suggesting sounds very promising and should definately be less work to box than the one I first suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd suggest using an SK as well.  The SK may not be able to take on as big a hitter as the warrior, but with the SK you can at least pull them to even try in the first place.  There are a large number of areas where the extra beef the warrior will give you will be a moot point, since you'll be fighting multiples cause of the lack of feign/pet pulling.  It's gonna prove to be hectic mezzing off more than one mob while still keeping aggro off the other characters with the warrior, and he'll end up tanking more than one mob for a while.  The warrior can tank a single better than the SK, but the SK will be able to tank a single better than the warrior can tank 2, 3, or more.<br />
<br />
For example, if you ever want to attempt to box high risk LDoNs, it won't happen without a good puller.  A warrior puller is going to net you many 4 to 5 mob aggro chains, all hitting for around 990.  You won't keep the warrior alive long enough to mezz, nor slow, all of that.  The SK will net you singles, with the occasional double if you decide to go with it, through feign pulling.<br />
<br />
An SK/shaman/randomDPS can win high risk LDoNs.  A warrior/any healer/randomDPS can't even begin to attempt one.  The warrior combo can take bigger single mobs, but that's just the problem... you need a way of getting them singled, or at least very thinned depending on how hard the mobs hit.  While pacify works good in some areas in the case of a warrior/cleric combo, feign will work in far more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I currently run war/clr/dru and it works very well, I just use root for cc and truncheon of doom for slows. Oh and I play all 3 on the same box :P I need to save up for some more machines hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tyop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, I know the secret to success in hard ldons lie in consistent singles being an ex bard. :)<br />
<br />
I'm torn between warrior and shadowknight. The warrior would be far easier to &quot;twink&quot; than the shadowknight and has the best potential for when me and my friends would like to do some really stupid stuff. Then again shadowknights have a multitude of utility, besides tanking, that shouldn't be overlooked. I guess I'll have to sit down with magelo to see what I can come up with!<br />
<br />
Ps. How do you reckon wizard and mage dps would compare in this situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Avallach Whitewinds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ps. How do you reckon wizard and mage dps would compare in this situation?<br />
<br />
Wizard/mage can be pretty close to comparable in overall DPS when you add in the pet.<br />
<br />
However, running the pet efficiently in a multibox sitiuation can be a real pain. If you can get that mastered, it probably wouldn't hurt to use the mage, since the pet can offtank anything your chanter can't mez.</div></div><hr />

Yep that is they key how much back and forth do you want to do. Especially in GoD+ where mobs tend to reposition themselves :)<br />

Warrior, Chanter, Cleric, Shammy, Wizard, Ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ps. How do you reckon wizard and mage dps would compare in this situation?<br />
<br />
Either would be very nice.  It's a trade off kinda, more &quot;now&quot; damage vs. slower consistant damage with some extra frills thrown in.<br />
<br />
The wizard offers some serious burst damage, and a huge convinience factor with the ports.  The wizard is the master of nuking, and can drop a mob very quickly to defuse a potentially hazardous situation.  The best burst damage there is.  You can also get the entire group out of there in a pinch.  There's little chance of running all 4 characters to the zone out if you get into trouble, but holding off the mobs for 10 seconds for an intra zone evac is real handy to have.<br />
<br />
Myself, I think that the mage brings more to the table.<br />
<br />
The wizard offers quicker and bigger &quot;now&quot; damage, but the mage wins in the DPS department &quot;over time&quot; if you ask me.  The mage is the master of stored mana, summoning items to boost others, and more damage over time through consistant use of the pet on top of a decent amount of smaller burst damage.<br />
<br />
With the mage you can have a nice big 45 point damage shield on the tank at all times constantly adding DPS (which I would stack Mark of the Righteous from the cleric, plus a potion for those &quot;need as much DPS as possible situations&quot;.  Can get 112 DS going with all these.).<br />
<br />
The pet will always be adding constant, unwavering, computer controlled, stick to that mob like glue no matter who it runs to, DPS even if you need to forget about the mage for the rest of a tense fight to consentrate on other things.  It's easy to neglect the wizard and just forget about him for a while if things get too complicated all of a sudden while boxing (which is also why I feel they're so easy to box with, most of the time you're not gonna lose a battle if you just forget about them for a few).  With the mage, at least his pet was still adding DPS the entire time while you're forced to neglect his nukes.  Kind of a fire and forget constant DPS that you don't have to worry about, it's always there once you've started it.  A computer controlled pet is not going to lose track of the mob.<br />
<br />
Then there's also the offtank thing someone else just touched upon.  The pet can keep a mob busy for a bit while the chanter takes care of other things.<br />
<br />
The mage can summon a number of items to boost the SK's pet, the necro's pet, the shaman's pet, and his own pet, adding yet more constant DPS to the total mix.<br />
<br />
The mage can summon other foci items for the other casters in the group if needed.  Modulation rods are nice too in a mana pinch.<br />
<br />
Also, something else to consider, though it may be rare circumstance.  The pet can take rampage damage instead of some of the squishier members of the group.  I've played a warrior/cleric/wizard combo in Ferubi before, and couldn't keep up with the mana use.  The oh so tender cleric and wizard took those rampages.  With the shaman and mage pets present, you can set them to take that rampage instead, taking some of the fast work out of the boxing all of those characters.  The pets will heal up fairly fast after combat, and leave the healing classes a bit more leeway and mana.  I've got to barrow my friends characters if I want to seriously attempt a lot of that stuff, cause even though the warrior/cleric/wizard classes are &quot;individually&quot; more specialized at their jobs than the SK/shaman/mage combo, the latter combo's diversity offers far more in the end... making things the former combo can't even attempt, easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I box 3 wiz, 1 cleric, 1 warrior, 1 chanter for pve and <br />
4 wiz, 1 cleric, 1 chanter for pvp.<br />
<br />
You dont want &quot;do it all&quot; classes cause things get to complicated, you want toons who do the best at what they do and are easy to control. <br />
<br />
Only thing i missing is bard speed and a fd splitter/puller for mobs you can't pacify.<br />
<br />
You need wizard for porting, walking with a group is a big big pain.<br />
<br />
He is right about rampage though ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I 4 box, and I lack utility hardcore. You NEED snare. I'm currently trying to explore OoW, but I have sever trouble with anything that runs. Also, a class with group invis is an amazing thing. You also need either some sort of CC or some sort of pulling tool (harmony/lull/paci). I would suggest:<br />
<br />
War/Pally/SK, your choice really<br />
Druid(unless wizards get a group invis)<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter<br />
<br />
Little low on dps, but you have paci for pulls, group invis, snare, and CC/mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tyop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I'm not too concerned with walking my group, it's the succor that I'd miss. How bad is this rampage problem really, I haven't been exploring GoD much outside the mountain trials.<br />
<br />
Also I'm fairly decided on the shadowknight, so that kind of takes care of the snare issue (which I'm all to familiar with). Maybe succor is for weenies, if you got a cleric, chanter and plate tank puller but still need succor you deserve to die, hmm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well I'm not too concerned with walking my group, it's the succor that I'd miss. How bad is this rampage problem really, I haven't been exploring GoD much outside the mountain trials.<br />
<br />
<br />
Depends on where you fight really.  Those Noc Somethingorother mobs in Ferubi rampage, and it made it too rough for me to hunt there with the casters eating it.  Shots of 600+ to the wizard and cleric often just hurt too much.  If you do a lot of hunting in areas like that, it could be a major problem, if you hunt elsewhere most of the time, it's probably not that big a deal.<br />
<br />
But, it looks like you've got a few pets in the group already.  Buffing them up, and the rampaging should be fine already.  You certainly don't need to choose mage over wizard soley for rampage reasons.  And seeing that you mention not caring about shooting to 65 as fast as possible, it's gonna be a while before you even have to worry about it anyway.  You have plenty of pets for rampage in the group already.<br />
<br />
The only reason I myself would pick mage over wizard would be cause of the damage shield, pet doing consistant damage even when nuking has to be neglected, possible pet offtanking situations, and the over all boost in DPS from all of the other pets you've got going in the group.  All of that pet damage is manafree consistant damage that's always there, and never loses track of the mob.<br />
<br />
But at the same time, mages sell those summoned items for a few plat in the bazaar constantly too.  With the new pet zoning update, you could keep your pets pretty decked most of the night without having a mage yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Go with wiz over mage for snare and evac IMO.  The pet can be nice, but it's a pain in some situations as well.  Wizard is easier to box cause you can just hit your nuke macro and not worry about the pet.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of this, I found an excellent use for the flintforged cudgel and the Steel Hilted Flint dagger (Both proc a 650 dd) -- <br />
<br />
Pet weapons.<br />
<br />
The level 61 shaman pet is high enough to proc the flint dagger, and if you plan on keeping him around for awhile, it can actually make that worthless dog do some serious fuckin bonus damage.<br />
<br />
Screw those shitty wrath of wind swords :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Your best bet is War/Clr/Dru/Enc.<br />
<br />
Hand of Ro/Ro's Illumination combined with healing from the Druid would be better than a second Cleric.<br />
<br />
Play the Enchanter as primary to help with mez on the adds have the Warrior easy access to do the tanking.<br />
<br />
I played this combo before I quit EQ (but was playing Warrior as the primary.)  It is a very very nice combo.  If I still played today, I would likely have switched to Enchanter as primary for easier targets on the adds.  It proved somewhat difficult to target / mez 3 or more adds without being primary on the Enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>fastidius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">War Enc Nec Cleric would be my choice<br />
<br />
Macro the necro - assist slower, send pet, Cast snare, Cast dots in sequence....space as required for agro not to pull off tank<br />
<br />
Autofire the warrior - use the ranger autofire proggy to hit your afro key...(kick,beg,disarm).  I macroed my incite also<br />
<br />
I have run this setup and to be honest the only thing about it i didnt like was travelling. <br />
<br />
with the necro able to FD &amp; rez Evac is not really much of a concern is it?<br />
<br />
if theres anything that is missing from this combo i found i had a more effective way around it ...<br />
<br />
Mez, slow, snare, FD, 2 rezzers, 2 different DC pets,  Invisi, IVU rah rah rah<br />
<br />
all the other combos work well also but for me i run 3 bots on 1 pc and tank on main pc.  Cleric is a 2 key character heal fast heal big,  Necro is 2 key character...send pet  &amp; lay on dots,  Warrior only need to be pointed at mob autofire will kick etc..  Chanter is the Main Keystroke needer with resisted slows and mez etc.  <br />
<br />
i worked out if i paci with the enc warrior pulls with bow while chanter runs back with mob   tank uses tashstick and agro weapon or 2 agro weapons.  chanter can tash/slow/cripple while casting those swap to cleric and fast heal warr.  once slow landed i activated the necro who pets and dots while i go back to the enc to continue debuffs.<br />
<br />
warrior shouldnt lose agro unless the enc is too fast on slow or necro stacks dots too close together so thats all you need for the learning curve.<br />
<br />
another thing i did which i did because i was toying around was autocircle on the chanter so i could hiut a key and swap to the tank and agro kite till i got agro back to tank....  <br />
<br />
I used alot of macros to 4 box but i never used any 2 or 3 boxing...i just found the 4th box was hard to use for dps without macroing or autofire...<br />
<br />
you could autofire a wizzy or mage also without much problem but necro fd and rez is nice if you dont want a GY CR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I 2 box a Warrior/Shaman, and my roommate 2 box Ranger/Cleric. On many occasions I have used all 4 myself and done just fine. Get Auto-fire for the Ranger and it is one less toon you have to worry about, just put on Auto and forget about him till the next fight.<br />
<br />
And have your casters stand right next to the Warrior. That way if they get agro you won't have to switch comps and hope you can get there in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>MistrOrnge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Currently I am 5 boxing without macros.  The war is a friend's who quit and the pal is another friend who has limited time to play.<br />
65 war (MA)<br />

63 cler (heals)<br />
65 dru (nukes, snares, evac, secondary heals)<br />
I have 5 systems on a desk and rotate through them.  The best thing to do is have a routine of how you react to certain situations.  Always use the same character on the same computer or you will get confused quick.  <br />
I single group BoT typically or use them frequently to do quest mobs (ATM I have 10 full epics and 4 that are one step or less from completion).<br />
If I had the desk space I would set up my laptop and play my 65 wiz also.  I have been thinking about single grouping LDoNs if I could get my bard up to speed (he's only 59 atm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>zeeko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">War, Clr, Enc, Mag is my current setup.  Previously I've had a shaman instead of the enchanter and a monk or rogue instead of the mage.  So my thinking went like this:  I need 1 account to tank (war), 1 to heal (clr), 1 to slow (enc/shm), and 1 dps/utilitiy/whatever (rog/mnk/mag/wiz).<br />
<br />
I found that the shaman was great as long as I could guarantee single pulls and when I wasn't pushing things as pre-camp kei would expire and I would need to leave.  Once I got into more interesting situations where I would need to deal with 2 to 5 mobs, I found having the enchanter was much better then the shaman/monk combo. <br />
<br />
The choice for the mage over a wiz or druid comes from the fact that I had leveled a mage to 60 and my wizard was only 52 at the time.  It turned out that when I'm grinding and doing high hp nameds, a low ft mage has better dps then a low ft wizard since the fights are longer.  Those mage pets at 65 are pretty nice and the DS from a mage helps while the mob is getting slowed.  Evac is not a major issue as if I really have to evac, it means that someone has died or will die before evac get cast, and therefore I will have to get back to that spot to do a recovery anyways... evac'ing a partial team is usually not very useful and with GYs many zones don't really need evac.<br />
<br />
Snare:  Snare is a major component.  With OoW and enough AAs you can compensate by getting the AA that can kill 65th and lower level mobs when they're running away with 10% health.  I used to do what with my monk and it was fine, but it's not 100% reliable.  Since I opted for a mage, I use my cleric's innurok snare necklace to snare when needed.  It's not very often that you need to snare, so it works well.  I either have two mobs in camp or I'm fighting ones that don't run.  But having the ability to snare in the 4box is pretty required or else you'll be very restricted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Update to all of this concerning the pets taking rampage.<br />
<br />
I've been 3-boxing Ferubi as of late by barrowing a friend of mine's shaman in place of my wizard.  This has been working out pretty good.  Only one slight problem... the shaman pet DOES NOT take rampage damage, the shaman himself is eating it.  This is still far better than my wizard being there, as rampages are very frequent if the mobs are not slowed, and there's no way I can heal the wizard and the warrior at the same time that often if he manages to not get one shotted from rampage in the first place.  Actually, if I had my war/cleric/wizard combo, the cleric would be the one taking rampages, which is even worse.<br />
<br />
The shaman did manage to get one shotted every so often however, so there's still a risk.  I had to leave the shaman standing to minimize the risk, as sitting him down he'd take max damage when a rampage would hit.  Every once in a while however, he'd eat a triple hit 776 rampage, with a proced 650 chaos claws, get blood lust and be flattened by these fast running buggers to another 776 double or so, all so fast it seemed like he had been one shotted.  The pet never once took any rampage.  I set the pet on the mob before the shaman ever cast, trying to set rampage, but it never happened.  Pet was full health the entire hunt, aside from any damage shields the mobs used.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if something changed recently, or if the shaman pet just never did take rampage in the first place ever, and it was my friends SK pet that took it instead.  He can't remember which pet took it when I asked him, as this was a long time ago.  He just remembers a pet eating rampage is all.  From what I've seen of the possible nasty shots coming from rampage, I know for a fact that if his shaman or cleric had taken a rampage... he would have certainly remembered, as they would have been paste.  You don't forget something like that heh, so his pet was certainly taking the rampage at that point in time.<br />
<br />
He can't remember now whether it was the SK/shaman/cleric combo, or the SK/shaman/mage combo that he used also... so a mage pet could have very well been taking rampage.  All I know, is that from recent experience, the shaman pet doesn't take rampage, the shaman does instead.<br />
<br />
No idea as to why the SK/mage pet can take rampage and the shaman pet can not however, and my friend hasn't 3-boxed any rampagers lately to see if his SK pet still indeed does take rampage as he's down to only 1 PC now and can no longer 3, nor even 2-box :(<br />
<br />
Anyone test this as of late with any other pets?  I know for a fact that the shaman pet does not take rampage.  I don't know if it's a pet by pet thing, if the shaman pet used to and now doesn't, or if the shaman pet never did in the first place while other pets do, or if SOE recently changed this entire thing, and no pet will take rampage anymore.<br />
<br />
Next time I'm in Ferubi, I think I'm gonna experiment with distance, and see if it's possible to keep the casters out of rampage distance in the first place.  Perhaps this is what my friend did, and as to why the pet took rampage instead of the caster.  I'll have to ask him next time I talk to him.</div></div><hr />
