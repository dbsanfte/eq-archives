<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BattleaxTN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Checked LdoN high risk, it works as I expected.<br />
<br />
but parsed FRO,<br />
B4 : Max hit 1962 (if 5% mitigation then Max Hit expect = 1864)<br />
But Now: Max hit 1914<br />
<br />
Is that the 5% innitie mitigation only work to SOME, not all mobs ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>issu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">5% mitigation only works to your DI value<br />
just like shielding modified only works to your DB value</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">damage=DB+(RND(20)*DI)<br />
<br />
If the change works as most agree, then it's either<br />
damage=DB+(RND(19)*DI)<br />
<br />
or<br />
damage=DB+(RND(20)*DI) - DI<br />
<br />
(we'd have to see if min hit changed to know which is right)<br />
<br />
In either event the DI for that mob is apparently 48, which is the amount of damage reduction you saw on max hit.<br />
<br />
The previous maximum Offset Damage (20*DI)  of 960 was reduced by 5% (48) to 912.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did blazzax the other day and his max hit on me was like 3380 ? I think and on one of my clerics that got ate it was 3450 I believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't been paying to much attention to it at all but the gains vary alot due to a mobs DI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kenelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Everyone really needs to stop calling the mitigation change 5% as much as possible. Aside from it causing upset to some knight players (not all, just a few 'vocal' ones) it also doesn't seem true.<br />
<br />
For clearer example of why it's not, imagine a mob with a damage bonus of 9000 and a DI of 50.<br />
<br />
This mob's min hit would be 9050 and max hit of 10000.<br />
<br />
5% would take off 500 from the max hit.<br />
<br />
However the mitigation change that we got would in theory seem to just take off 50 from the max hit so it would look like this:<br />
<br />
On a warrior min: 9050 (or 9000) max: 9950<br />
<br />
On anyone else min: 9050 max: 10000<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we don't have any mobs that hit this extreme to try it out on.<br />
<br />
Of course on a high DI low DB mob the change really shines.<br />
<br />
Trying 1000 DB with a 450 DI:<br />
<br />
On warrior min: 1450 (or 1000) max: 9550<br />
<br />
On anyone else min: 1450 max: 10000<br />
<br />
In this case, nearing 5% :)<br />
<br />
I haven't seen anyone confirm yet about whether the change effects min hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Easy to test :<br />
Take a high end Cleric, Knight and a Warrior to Plane of Nightmare.<br />
Turn parses on for both characters.<br />
Find some spot with easy MOBs.<br />
<br />
Let both Knight and Warrior pull and tank ... naked.<br />
A high end Cleric should be able to keep up with the healing.<br />
<br />
Parse the logs afterwards, look for min and max hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You don't need to fight naked to do that.  Mobs still hit you for maximum occasionally even with armor on.  In fact, all you have to do is find a greenie, aggro it, sit down to find max hit, and stand up and go afk for 10 minutes and come back and minimum hit should be very clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is not meaningful to discuss how much mitigaiton 5% translates to actual savings because you'd have to know what the mob hits for on average (and possibly a distribution of its other hits as well) and obviously no one's bother to parse that.<br />
<br />
If you want a meaningful approximation, take a run of the mill PoP mob that hits for 100-600.   Assume it always hits for exactly 10 DI.  The mitigation bonus of 5% figures out to be 3.7% more HPs under this situation compare to a Paladin with identical stats.  It'd be really strange if you can actually notice the effect of having 3.7% more HPs but it is nevertheless there so just don't worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well the parse that i haven't seen yet is what happens internally exactly to make the DI 20 not fire.<br />
<br />
There's a few possibilities<br />
<br />
DB + RNG(0,19); (still 20 intervals but min hit goes down also)<br />
<br />
DB + RNG(1,20) if RNG = 20, RNG = 19; (19 now gets hit twice as often as before)<br />
<br />
DB + RNG(1,20) if RNG = 20 do one of the following:<br />
retry till it's not 20 (even distribution)<br />
call it a miss (way too powerful mobs that have high attacks now have an innate weakness to warriors)<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
Anyone do enough parsing ot see what was actually done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the only way you will get 5% mitigation is if you sit during the whole fight.<br />
<br />
someone needs to parce to see if they are getting hit for the NEW max dmg more then they where geting hit for the 19thDI  pre change. this will tell us if 20th is removed or if we just have 2, 19DI's.<br />
<br />
at best the new mitigation is 1-2% all it basicly does is keep non 10k warriors from getting killed in 1 round and helps for 10k+ warriors while fighting quarm. <br />
<br />
its sort of cool I guess. still say innate 5% shield would be nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;the only way you will get 5% mitigation is if you sit during the whole fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if you sit the whole fight it is not 5%.<br />
<br />
It is 5% of the range between the MOBs min and max hit. Min hit 100, max hit 200, if you sit you save 5 HP per hit, or 2.5% (or very close, didnt take time to recall if you divide by 20 or 19 =p  )<br />
<br />
Which is why I agree that people need to stop saying 5%. SoE should have never said it in that chat, it was misleading. They worded it like it would have the same effect that say... Combat stability does, which it clearly does not.<br />
<br />
And yes, it should have been 5% shielding, but heres to wishful thinking =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Crysalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only have access to a naked 52 warrior, but quick parse this afternoon on a Bloodstarved Wolf in Dawnshroud Peaks.<br />
<br />
Hits for warrior were, <br />
<br />
12, x, 19, 23, 27, 30, 34, 37, 41, 45, 48, 52, 55, 59, 63, 66, 70, 73, 77, 81<br />
<br />
For my shm<br />
<br />
12, x, x, x, 28, x, 35, 38, x, 46, 50, 54, x, 61, 65, 69, 73,76, 80, 84<br />
<br />
x's i didn't have number for, just knocked it up in 15mins this afternoon, but was enough for me to be happy with.<br />
<br />
DI too low on mob to lower min hit, but it looks like that 5% off DI, which is how I would have expected it to work given how defensive works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow that's FAR more powerful then I thought it was.  Will need to ponder that some</div></div><hr />

And that defensive now shaves 45% of the DI as the innate takes the 5% remaining from the old defensive?  My impression has been that the DI for us is now 95% what the DI is for everyone else.</div></div><hr />
