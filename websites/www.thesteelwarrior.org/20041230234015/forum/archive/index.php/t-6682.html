<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanabin</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I was playing my friend's warrior in Plane of Mischief. I pulled 2 mobs then hit AE taunt. Suddently two more mobs in a neighbouring room joined the fight. And a moment later, tens of more appeared from nowhere. I was in the &quot;previous empty wing&quot; and the mobs are from chessboard, which I assume is either above or below my spot.<br />
<br />
What a nasty surprise !!! I have been using AE taunt in LDON and PoP quite a while and never knew this could happen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Hole math:<br />
<br />
Given: mobs &gt;=4<br />
<br />
if<br />
mobs + AE Taunt = x2 mobs,<br />
<br />
then<br />
6 person group = 6 dead<br />
<br />
First time I actually discovered, and regretted, using AE Taunt.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never used AE taunt in places like PoSky, I have always been afraid that AE Taunt would agro thru islands, and in your case, thru the roof up on another floor. It shouldnt and I dont think its common, or maybe Im just mistaken, but noone is gonna make me AE Taunt in Sky ever :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you stand in the court room in BoT that branches off in to all the wings and hit AE taunt you can agro some bees from the top  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That phenomenon should only happen in outdoor zones...IE any zone you can SoW yourself in.  CT, Sky, Mischief, BoT, they're all outdoors.  In real dungeons, walls are actually walls and that won't happen.<br />
<br />
So just remember that fact and be mindful of the zone geometry and you can lessen the chances of that happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarelan</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not strictly true...I ae taunted in a Guk LDoN, went through the walls in the corridors, ended up with about 18 mobs on us...and we wiped :)<br />
<br />
Never admitted to ae taunting though hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh sorry, forgot about that piece of shit expansion since I spent no time there.<br />
<br />
Okay, LDoN is outdoor trash too, no matter what you think :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, LDoN is outdoor trash too, no matter what you think :)<br />
<br />
So Velketors Lab counts as Outdoors? ;)<br />
<br />
I remember getting half of the castle onto us when hitting AE Taunt in there, or seen Wipes on Inquisitor Seru with a Warrior tanking and taunting the Mobs from the floor.<br />
<br />
So yes, AE Taunt can go through walls, definitely, no matter if it's in- or outdoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I can say is that I've never AE taunted anything above or below in any of the good dungeons ... Seb, Chardok, Guk, Sol B.  Chardok and guk are both overlaid over each other many times, and I&quot;ve never had any issues.  So, if ya don't like that answer, make yer own rule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had a warrior AE taunt in chardok library and bring the prince, king, and queen + everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hit AE tuant in the Hole once too.  Was near the top of some multiple story building at the time.  Multiple mobs on the pull, a few going straight for the cleric.  Just as I hit the key I thought, &quot;Wait, probably not a good idea&quot;.  But it was too late.  The aggro text spam was glorious.  Everything from the first floor on up all came a run'n.<br />
<br />
Purposely AEd in LDoN once to get to a mob we didn't have time to track down.  Was a rescue mission where our little hostage stopped following us saying that there was a mob nearbye and couldn't continue.  We couldn't find any mobs nearbye, and figured it must be one threw a wall.  Sure enough the tracker said there was one straight ahead behind the wall we were next to, and sorted as closest mob to us.  I snuggled up to the wall and AE taunted.  We got real lucky.    Lucky that we only got that one single running to find us, and lucky that if we had taken the time to find him we would have lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunndarr</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AET has its limitations when it comes to the z-axis.  There was a time when i was in Ssra, another guild was raiding cursed so i told my group wonder if i can taunt cursed to IZ(had used eye to get it on target). well AET didnt do anything and the IZ is directly above his spawn point. Hit taunt and poof, cursed at IZ killing everyone that zoned in. That was some funny shit and havent laughed so hard at EQ since.</div></div><hr />

So thats where they came from :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much all of PoP is made up of fake walls I thought other than like Quarm's room I think regardless if it's outdoor or not.  Luclin and below was using walls to avoid AE's then PoP is pretty much made up of either eating AE's, running in and out or avoiding them all together.  Few examples would be Solro's chamber and stuff in PoW like wise/offassa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, as it has been mentioned by a number of warriors,  there are a number of old world/older expansions that have bugs that will net you &quot;extra&quot; friends with an AE taunt.    I've had good luck in most of the zones there.  Seems like it would be better to identify the zones that are proven to have issues rather than make general rules.  Of course, your location is a major factor in all of this.  I think there are many of us that have used AE taunt in most of the zones mentioned with no problems and yet we have proof from our comrades there are possibilities for &quot;walking experiance&quot; to show up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, new generic rule :<br />
<br />
It's okay to AE taunt in zones where you are aware of the geometry of and aren't being a dumbass about.<br />
<br />
Everywhere else, it's a crap shoot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, that should cover everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always been wary of AE Taunt and z-axis.  Once I pulled every orc from the &quot;wind bridge room&quot; in one of the Rujark models.    :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to Chardok and stand in that room above the king's room and hit AE taunt.  I did and it pulled him and all his friends so I know it works through some floors and ceilings there for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best AE taunt is at the base of the temple in CT.  Try it...it is the funniest thing you'll ever see.</div></div><hr />
