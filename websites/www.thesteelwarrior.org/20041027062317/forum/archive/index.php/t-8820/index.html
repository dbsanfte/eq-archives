well... you have more hp than my own warrior full stuffed<br />
<br />
with 50-70 :<br />
- you can get mosquito leg earrings (under 10k each nowadays but hard to find)<br />
- the grimling face slot i forgot the name (10 ac, 40 or 50hp, regen 1) or try to get lodizal and stormfeather for eyepatch<br />
- cloak of greater pernicity (rather cheap or try and collect the components)<br />
- belt : soulscream or RBB/RBG<br />
<br />
for the head slot... well... if you have faction, try and get some friends to kill tormax or just stick with ldon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quick and dirty check.  Would do ok til you can afford or camp better.<br />
<br />
Head: Helm of Raldukan, velious helm (if you're on any of the factions)<br />
Face: crystal spider eyes, mask of flourishing fungus, death mask of the elysians<br />
Ears: Mosquito leg earrings, Black Sapphire earrings, Jagged Bone hoop<br />
Back: cloak of greater pernicity, hierophant's cloak, cinrose cape of the werewolf<br />
Waist: I'd really, really consider buying any haste belt you can afford, AFTER filling the other slots.  It doesn't have to be impressive if your plan is to earn a LDON helm and haste augment it.</div></div><hr />
