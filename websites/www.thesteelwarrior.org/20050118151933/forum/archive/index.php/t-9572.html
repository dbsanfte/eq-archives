like if you had 10% shielding, i'm assuming this isn't a direct reduction of 10% damage. What is it 10% of?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's my understand that shielding is pure raw mitigation and every percent you haev is one percent less damage you will take on every incoming melee hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">damage bonus?  :confused: <br />
<br />
It's my understand that shielding is pure raw mitigation and every percent you haev is one percent less damage you will take on every incoming melee hit.<br />
<br />
I'll try and explain it.<br />
<br />
There are two parts to a mob's damage, DB and DI. DB is the minimum hit that a mob can hit for. DI is multipled by a number between 0 and 20 and added to the DB to arrive at what the mob hits you for. Note that this works slightly differently for warriors with their -1DI advantage.<br />
<br />
Hit = DB + (DI*x) where x is a value between 0 and 20.<br />
<br />
Assigning random values of 250 for DB and 50 for DI, shows that a mob can hit for 250 to 1250.<br />
<br />
Now, Shielding works on the DB of the mob, and the DB alone. With 10% shielding, the DB is reduced by 10%. So for the fictional example above, 250 * .10%, = 25. 250-25 = 225.<br />
<br />
So.<br />
<br />
A warrior with no shielding  in the above fictional example would take:<br />
<br />
250-1250 per hit<br />
<br />
A warrior with 10% shielding would take:<br />
<br />
225-1225 per hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ratfink</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using that formula 10% shielding would reduce your overall damage by roughly 4%.  That would vary a huge amount from mob to mob but in general it should be accurate.  If mobs are hitting you for 50% of their max on average then an average hit of 625 or so which is reduced by 25 every time.  Of course if you're tanking a mob that's hitting for 3200 on many swings like raid mobs tend to it's not going to help as much...but on trash mobs exp grinding it would help more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember min hit / max hit ?<br />
<br />
20% shielding = -20% to the min hit, and reduce the max by the same value.<br />
<br />
1000-3000 hitter , with 20% shielding = 800 - 2800.<br />
<br />
Ps : I know its not exactly that but its the simplest way :)</div></div><hr />
