Would you take a 70ac 160hp item or a 30ac 200hp item?  Would you rather have 1900AC and 10khp, or 9.8k hp and 2k+ AC?<br />
<br />
This is with elemental and beyond in mind, although I didn't post it in the overlord sanctuary because it's also stat-related :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said most choices of AC vs HP is rather obvious.  Itemization in PoP makes it very obvious what is *plate* loot and you can't go wrong with those.  Of course there's always exceptions (Quarm cloak comes to mind beating the melee RZ cloak) but they're also often obvious (i.e. Quarm all/all cloak beats RZ melee cloak)</div></div><hr />

If that's true, I'd only take AC over HP if it's gonna carry you into the next 100-range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I do Ldon I have noticed that mobs hit alot for their lowest damage when having a high AC<br />
<br />
I am a AC freak though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would take 40 AC over 40 HP any day of the week and twice on Sundays.<br />
<br />
I think the answer is so obvious that Jumbojak has been hit in the head a few too many times while MTing (no offense Jumbo). <br />
<br />
And near as anyone can tell, its the ratio of AC vs mob attack--not steps of 100--that makes the differance. Its just that mob attack has been around 1000 for  a long time (using 'around' loosely--I would say ranging from 1000 to 1500).</div></div><hr />

Have you ran that same log thru EQCompanion?  A rogue friend mentioned to me he thought YALP was parsing incorrectly, and after trying both out on small logs EQCompanion was more accurate.  I had around 600 incoming DPS difference from time Rallos Zek YALP to EQcompanion...  (not stating your chart is wrong, just a suggestion  :)   )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've noticed that with all my defensive aa's I still parse at taking MORE dmg than my non defensive aa'd friends with as low as 1500 ac.<br />
<br />
I had always setup my gear with HP &gt; ac, and now I'm feeling the burn from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baam</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I have eqcompanion and I did run the fight through it, but the dps(approx 1050, not including the 1200dd) number alone is not very interesting. However a graph of a mobs hit distribution I find much more interesting concerning the question about hp vs ac. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AC makes a big difference on hit distribution.<br />
The TT log that was shown shows it pretty well, he had far more hits in the low end.<br />
An interesting thing btw, is how little of the overall damage the lowest hits is.<br />
(actually, I'd love to see Baam post a picture of it ... hit that &quot;Chart Damage&quot; button in the lower left corner and post it, please ? :) )<br />
<br />
Biggest thing is still level of MOB vs. your level, as far as I can see.<br />
Defense and Offense skills also plays big roles offcourse, but they are tied to levels.<br />
<br />
btw, Daabu, you didn't link a Magelo, so without knowing where your AC is at now, it's hard for people to say what is needed most.</div></div><hr />

I'm just getting into the Elemental Planes, so I'm wearing mainly pre-PoP gear...so I know that I'd be better off with ANYTHING from EP, but I'm trying to use my DKP wisely and wanted to explore my options</div></div><hr />

Chart damage instead of hits attached.<br />
<br />
Frax<br />
<br />
Comparing results between parsers is not always good. The different parsers tries to filter the fight data which might give changes in the results...<br />
<br />
As you can see in Yalp. I am using all the damage in my log from TT. The reason I can do that is because I just cleaned the log a few days ago and only have one TT fight in it. Now if I in Yalp pick out the TT fight # and parse it then it somehow seems like it misses half the fight time, so i only take approx. 200.000 dmg. No idea how that happens, but when running Eqcompanion I can verify that TT indeed did dmg me for approx 400.000 dmg in that fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, it conforms pretty much as I expected it to, you see that anything in the upper 1/4th part of the graph changes by quite abit.<br />
That is the bane of all Tanks : Spike Damage.<br />
Obviously the less hits you have there, the better.<br />
<br />
EDIT :<br />
What I was trying to say with this, is that you can use Yaulp to help you see if you have enough AC for the MOBs you are currently fighting. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, your Yalp says you took 426.439 points of Damage (a bit to the right of the &quot;Chart Damage/Hit&quot; button) ... I'm not sure where you get the 200.000 number from ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixyyn</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think his real question is What is enough AC vs HP.<br />
Obviously High HP and high AC is better, but like he asked... 1900AC and 10k HP or 2k AC and 9800 HP ?<br />
Just saying 1AC=5HP is wrong IMO..would you tank Time with 3kAC and 7kHP's ?!? Before PoP everyone said 12.5kAC was enough for max mitigation, PoP changed that, but by how much?<br />
so which would be better.. ( just imagine these were the ONLY options you had ) :<br />
1600AC 9.7kHP<br />
1700AC 9.5kHP<br />
1800AC 9.3kHP<br />
2000AC 8.9kHP</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baam</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is taken from the same log. I am picking the specific TT fight this time.<br />
<br />
However we are moving away from the original point of this thread :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not at all - You see in your graph there, that you have the right amount of AC to TT in POT, perhaps even a bit of overkill.<br />
<br />
Now, if you had a lot of hits in the upper 1/4th, AC would be the way to go. But in your case (Baam), HP and resists are more likely to net you more - Or whatever other effects you think helps more.<br />
<br />
I asked for that graph to point out where the damage lies.<br />
Which incidentally is what kills most high end tanks according to my theories.<br />
<br />
Which again moves away from the point of setting any detailed value for how much AC is worth in HP, because that changes as you move trough the challenges of EQ.<br />
<br />
Someone low on AC would say 1 Ac is wirth 10 HP, while someone with very high AC might say 1 AC = 4 HP, so cannot just set a value.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
uhmm ... I hope I make any sense here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, we do. You didn't look at the last pic proberly :). It says approx. 200.000dmg. You asked earlier where I got that number from. However a discussion about which parser is best and why it suddenly removes half the parse is moving away from the main topic. :)<br />
<br />
I know.. or got an idea on what is best for me don't worry :). The question is how to make general guidelines..., which I let others do if they want, I just posted the output from my parses :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-11-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah yes ... I notice that now, the 200k number that is.<br />
Though I have no idea why it forgets half the parse .. but as you said, that's another topic entirely - The logs are still useful however, and that's what I meant with the &quot;not at all&quot; reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I was trying to get at was to use the parser as a tool to see how your hit distribution is at (at any level against whatever you fight) vs. the damage taken.<br />
<br />
Simply compare easy exp MOBs for your level with the bosses you tank at your level and see how big the difference in distribution and damage is - If it's huge, then AC is probably needed for the Boss fights.<br />
If it spikes in the high damage hits on both type of MOBs, then AC is much needed.<br />
On the otherhand, if both types of MOBs shows up like on the graphs you posted, nice and low at the high damage hits, then things are good and more HP / effects is what is interesting.<br />
<br />
That way, the original poster might have a way to decide how much he wants HP .. or AC .. instead of having to rely on other people's opinions which are based no what they have. :)<br />
<br />
It's much like the old addage about giving someone some money, or give them a job - They are better off with a job in the long run.<br />
<br />
<br />
humm - Did I make more sense this time ?<br />
Please /bonk me if I'm not making sense. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it lost half because its displaying only one form of attack the &quot;hits&quot; or &quot;hand to hand&quot; if tt had a weapon you would need to show the chart for slash peirce ect. <br />
<br />
go to the drop down menu at the bottom next to the chart damage button and select the type.<br />
<br />
it will also fix the difference in the min hit between 610, 583 and 525(prolly kick or bash), and seperate the attacks into their intervals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baam</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mokor<br />
<br />
Take a look again and you will see that I have choosed ''hit'' on all the parses both the 400k and 200k pic. I did that on purpose, because the bash and kicks would just add noice.<br />
However I am in doubt about bov. I probably had it on when I engaged. It would explain the 20hits intervals with disc +20hits intervals without disc + some more.<br />
<br />
On a side note. Afaik none of the boss mobs in the pop expansion actually wields their weapons, so their melee damage is only showing up as hit, kick or bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, before the new mitigation changes went in, I was trying to figure out a better damage model than is currently used.<br />
<br />
DMG = DB + DI * RND(20)<br />
<br />
If this was completely true, then a MOB could only ever hit for 20 different values, which they don't. I think I've found diparicies that shows you have a small chance to have a &quot;bonus&quot; mitigation in some form which can be anything from 1 damage to about DI/2 and on top of that.<br />
<br />
Also, there seems to be changes also according to the value of the RND(20) and possibly level difference on you and the MOB, though I'm afraid I have not found any proof of that, much less a new formula. And from what I've seen, those are cumulative.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then came the new changes and I kinda forgot about the whole thing, hoping to see if someone would parse the difference from now and before, or even better, the difefrence between a Knight and a Warrior - But have yet to see one.<br />
<br />
So basically, I need new datasets on MOBs of the same level, which is kinda hard since I moved on. I had a wonderful sample from before the changes, since I had hunted quite a bit in Plane of Nightmare, the Nettling Wraiths are ALL level 55 there. That makes for good parsing, even if you yourself level up. Especially since I had about 2 months of parses from PoN while levelling there.<br />
<br />
Offcourse, the changes invalidated that data set.<br />
It was however, from before BoV went in.</div></div><hr />

Talked about this ingame a bit.<br />
For earrings, a nice choice would be Seru Earring and Gnome Quest earring, should serve you for quite a long time. <br />
Face - I'd suggest Amygaldon (however you spell it -.-) Mask, 8ac 85hp, works untill something elemental/vt (Fennin Mask, Druav Mask, Aten Mask, Miniahr mask, air mask, all work)<br />
<br />
Neck - Shaderock Amulet (3ac 100hp) Served me untill i got obsidian neck (20ac 85hp) . Same suggestion here, get AHR talisman, magma neck works too.<br />

But most people aren't going to swap AC/HP gear in and out constantly.  They just want a general rule that will work most of the time.  So maybe we could come up with some values for 1) the mid range guild game that many high levels play and 2) the uber game in elementals and beyond.  Roughly, what's a good AC/HP ratio for these levels of play?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
The reason a mob doesn't always hit for 20 different values is because the 20 different possible values are then passed through the mitigation factors of its target. So if you want a model for it....<br />
<br />
If: <br />
<br />
DMG = DB + DI * RND(20)<br />
<br />
then:<br />
<br />
ADD = DMG * [MP * MV]<br />
<br />
where:<br />
ADD = Actual Damage Dealt<br />
MP = Mitigation Percentage<br />
MV = Mitigation Variance<br />
<br />
Or you can simplify it and say....<br />
<br />
ADD = [DB + DI * RND(20)] * [MP * MV]<br />
<br />
now to further define the variables I have thrown up there.....<br />
<br />
MP = whatever mitigation percentage the war has from base + AA's, AC, etc....<br />
<br />
MV = The variance (if any exists) in mitigation, aka a check to see if and how well you mitigate etc...<br />
<br />
Overall its not that big of a stretch to think something similar to that is going on....</div></div><hr />

Hps have diminishing returns due to the fact complete heal cant heal all of it anyways.   <br />
<br />
The only real purpose of having more than 10k hps is if a mob can one round you.   Quarm for instance... but Quarm is such a rediculously easy fight it doesnt even matter when a tank gets one rounded.<br />
<br />
if i have 23% shielding i no longer need as many hit points to survive, or as fast of a rotation.<br />

Ill try to remember to log everything i tank on our next time run with a 2557+ AC    I go over 2600 with bard and druid thing up.</div></div><hr />
