<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Folks, <br />
<br />
I haven't asked a gear question before, but I'm struggling with this one.  I recently acquired epic 1.5, and I'm just not sure how to fit it into my weapons/tanking scheme.  I plan to augment it with the 125 ykesha and an anger 3.<br />
<br />
My current setup is I have an anger 3 BoW for tanking, VDD for DPS.  My 1h weapons consist of willsapper, shortsword of sludge, corded spike driver, ancient prismatic spear, and a shield (stormriders carapice).  My guild raids potime still, but we haven't seen a DBOTW in quite some time, and I'm not the only warrior in the guild who still needs one.  I understand that if I did have a dbotw, dbotw/epic is the way to go.  I'm down to about 25k in the bank, so buying a BoC or something similiar is out of bounds.<br />
<br />
The question then, is can I use epic 1.5 with these augs in a MT role?  With the BoW I have absolutely no problems locking aggro, and I would want to be on par with that.  Any comments/recommendations would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Conquerer Axxegrinder, 7th Hammer<br />

Willsapper - What? Are you joking? A time geared tank using willsapper as mainhand, are you ebay?<br />
Shortsword of sludge - What is this?<br />
Primal spear -  ...<br />
CHSD - Um no<br />
<br />
Can you use epic as MT? Yes, why wouldn't you? Why would you think a anger 3 and stun weapon wouldn't work for tanking?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you misunderstood my question.  If I do use epic in MH with those augs, whats a viable offhand out of those listed?  I currently don't have any other good 1h slash.  So my question is whether to use epic RIGHT NOW or I'm just SOL until I get another good 1h for *either* primary or offhand to go with epic.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not ebay heh, was just listing all the available 1h that I have, whether viable or not.<br />

The ones Kavariel listed would probably be the way to go if you can pick one up cheap.   Just keep in mind that what you really want is a Darkblade or a Tacvi sword for mainhand and your epic offhand, but the epic alone should match the BoW for aggro and dps, and has better stats, so whatever you put in your offhand is just gravy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he said is tanking tool was BoW+A3<br />
and looking at is 1Hers list he should have just scrapped DW from his mind schemes. and since our epic is not anymore 2Herable he's lost.<br />
so yeah the combo epic1.5+A3+FY / Whatever+A3 will do better than BoW+A3. so just put A3 in the CHSD and it will be ok untill an EoE/JOS/.../FB/DBotW.<br />
<br />
<br />
note : what is the Shortsword of the sludge ? is it Short Sword of Slaughter ? if so just forget about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he means Sludge-Covered Short Sword <br />

<br />
which sucks for aggro even with an anger proc added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go kill eindride icestorm in BoT. Loot a GBoS. Aug it with something, and be happy. Any group of time enabled toons should be able to do him easily. BoT is a ghosttown now so he's almost guaranteed to be up.<br />
<br />
What you have sucks for aggro, so if you don't have the money to buy something decent (SoMWV, BoC) eindride's gonna be your boy until you can pick up something better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or as stated above GBoS. Or even random DPS weap with agro aug for short term. Or, you just know someone in guild has a BoC on an alt they dont play....tell the stingy bastages to cough it up till you loot better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there's a attuneable 1hb/s not sure which type that had ykesha on it, 125hp etc.<br />
<br />
I just got epic 1.5 last night myself so looking to find one of those and put it in offhand, can't picture it not bieng best until I can get a dbow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BabaHanz</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also Obsidian Scimitar of War (Vallon Zek, PoTactics) is easy enough to get, definately 1 groupabable, and better than anything mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the info, I tried using epic in primary last night with CHSD offhand, and it was absolutely horrid.  I've augged it now with anger 3 and the 100 hp ykesha, and will offhand CHSD again tonight and see if that helps matters.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the input, much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might actually get more aggro from an SoTB or CHoS, and they're easy to pick up in the bazaar. Might try one of them if the CHSD isn't treating you well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah sure epic 1.5 unauged isn't an aggro weapon.<br />
BTW, epic 1.5 / CHSD is 15% less aggro than CHSD / epic 1.5.<br />
so yeah aug them both ASAP because epic 1.5 +2*A3 / CHSD +A3 is 68% better than the same setup but unauged !!<br />
<br />
and CHSD &gt; CHoS &gt; SotB even if tere is few difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dunno about the CHSD as far as potime. sure it was good in its day but your up against a hella lot better dps and aggro now with lvl 70s etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arganax</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much as I would hate to do it, I personally would have to bag the epic and use the BoW until I could find another 1her.  A CHSD may work, I dunno, but I'll pretty much guarantee you that you'd never live that down lol.  Another option is get a group together and go get a SoMW from MPG.  That mob should be cake for a time geared group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to post an update.  I got a DBOTW last night, so it's DBOTW mainhand, epic offhand.  Thanks again all for all the input, I think I'm good to go now.<br />
