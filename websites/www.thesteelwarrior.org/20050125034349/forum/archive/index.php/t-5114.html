<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In another thread going on right now,  someone said they knew their DPS was higher with some weapon combination X and they knew this because they could see it, it was so obvious.  Someone else said, &quot;Nuh uh, appearances are deceiving,  you don't know sheeet unless you parse it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I posted that I was SURE my CHSD and Claw of Lightning outdamaged my GSoT.   I proved it to myself by abusing Mr. Regen (Kromriff Recruiter?) in Kael.<br />
<br />
Then, days later, I started parsing logs.  And I found that my best 1h setup does like 70-75 DPS, and for one evening at least, my GSoT was 103 DPS.<br />
<br />
I have no explanation of how my 1h setup can indeed kick most of the snard out of MR. Regen, and my GSoT can't, while the GSoT parses up to 50% more DPS.<br />
<br />
So, a word of caution for my fellow log spelunkers.  You must be very careful when parsing and comparing results.  Are your buffs the same?  Do you have the same groupmates, and are they debuffing consistently?  Are your datasets made from parsing the same mobs in the same zones?<br />
<br />
I have enough points for an Anger3 augment, and I can't decide where to put it.  If 2h to keep Riposte damage down, then<br />
...GSoT with its DPS,<br />
...Frostreaver with its nice ratio and low-speed, which reduces riposte, or<br />
...2h epic which would sport double-aggro (Tempting!)?<br />
<br />
Or CHSD to make a sweet fast double-aggro weapon?<br />
<br />
Because I parsed poorly, all I know is that I don't know squat, and I can't decide what to augment!  The only thing I know, is that I don't know anything.<br />
<br />
Blah, rambling and lamenting.<br />
<br />
Morals of the story are:<br />
1) parse before you make decisions, and<br />
2) log parsers don't give push-button answers.  You have to set up your test environment very carefully to get meaningful results.<br />
<br />
EDIT - Claw of Lightning, not Fist of Lightning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find a good parsing mob and go to town is all I can really say. Only use buffs if you have a bot that can maintain them over the course of both fights. Longer parses are always better. <br />
<br />
Personally I went GSoT with Anger 3, because before the aug I tested SotB and CHoS vs GSoT and I felt the aggro was better and the dps was perhaps slightly better as well. The deciding factors were a) rogue and shaman friend agreed the 2h had held more aggro and caused them less pain, b) less ripostes even if it is only a truly minor reduction, c) one aug costs less than two.<br />
<br />
Now my guild has the ability to get our melee CHSD and GBoS. If I can aquire them I will indeed make the switch back to 1hs and burn the adventure points for both to have anger 3.  Aggro generation is very hard to pin down, and most testing is seat of the pants feel/ opinions of groupmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a really easy way to get consistent meaningful parses.<br />
<br />
Rules for parsing:<br />
1. Always use the same mob.<br />
2. Always parse completely unbuffed.<br />
3. Try to use a mob that doesn't hit back, there are a couple you can use.<br />
4. Attack from behind so you can a pure parse with no special attacks effecting your results.<br />
5. Always use the same equipment for an accurate comparison.</div></div><hr />

Banker in Katta ... what else please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thers's some robot in POI factory .. cannot remember which one, red con at 65 I think. Problem with the banker and the reqruiter is tha they are low level MOBs and you get rather odd results now and then.<br />
<br />
Also, try to parse without any buffs ane preferred for 4-5 hours + to get a decent sample.<br />
Also, if you have any AA's and the likes, make sure to note it down along with main stats, ATK, level, offense skill, weapon skille .. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That all being said, the GSoT is not a bad weapon and makes for surprisingly good DPS for such a cheap weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since some weapon choices I can not parse (buyable LDON) and i've no idea on ratio equivlance for weapons:<br />
<br />
Timeworn Desert Blade + 3dmg aug + anger3 = 40/35<br />
War Marshall's Bladed Staff +anger 3 = 31/28<br />
<br />
Is the Timeworn Blade &gt; WMBS ?<br />
<br />
Is the WMBS pushing the point of &quot;too fast&quot; so that it in itself will start getting &quot;more ripostes&quot; like a 15/21 weapon would?<br />
<br />
I thought I read that duel wield / ambi only gave a marginal increase in DPS, so would I just be better with a 17/20+anger3 main hand and shield off hand?<br />
<br />
/scratches her head</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minna</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In terms of ratio, the timeworn blade is equivalent to an obsidian greatblade.  Which has a better ratio/dps than both the windblade and wmbs.  I plan to make it my poor mans BoW with anger 3.  You would have to have access to Sol Ro tower to get an equivalent weapon.  However if you just want rock solid, unbreakable aggro and don't have access to Sol Ro or EP's, GSoT + Anger 3 is the way to go.  However DPS will be much less than the timeworn blade.  Anger 3 on its own does not proc nearly often enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;too fast&quot; point on a two hander has nothing to do with ripostes, though they are a factor that has to be calculated for. Instead, at delays of 27 and below, the damage bonus on any two hander is a whopping 14 at level 65. At 28 delay, the damage bonus jumps significantly(Sorry, don't recall humbers off hand), and therefore, your damage jumps accordingly. Thus, 28 delay is the fastest 2 hander desirable for DPS without large amounts of vengeance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DB on 2h at 28 delay is 31.<br />
<br />
And I would completely disagree on parcing methods and the number to look at!<br />
<br />
First off, don't parce something that you don't XP on. 1) Its a waste of time and 2) you then have to figure out how attack/ac interact and what the reletive ACs of the mobs are (between your test mob and your XP mobs). <br />
<br />
Two, don't parce for DPS, its about 100% useless and makes data harder to make consistant. Look at average hit and for average hit/delay when comairing weapons. (Since you are not going for DPS--you don't have to worry about haste buffs.)<br />
<br />
I would rather have fuzzier number collected under my playing conditions than more percise numbers collected under conditions that are nothing like what you play with.<br />
<br />
What you should do, while parcing and XPing and try and parce the same camp. With reasonably sized samples, mob variation should balance out and you might beable to see how DPS varries with mobs (how does Damage/swing compair between Krigers and brann's or what have you).<br />
<br />
PS My first thought about differances in DPS is that there are larger differances between the AC of Mr Regen and your XP mobs and that the proportion of AC (mitigation) vs attack favor your 2h more in your XP spots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might be off-topic, but back to the original poster... how the hell did you get GSoT to parse at 103 dps?!? In most LDoN groups, with myself tanking, and hasted by either shammy or ench, I average around 80dps with 41/31 with 75dd proc and punishing blade 2. C'mon man, let me in on your secret =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">easy explanation<br />
orginal poster's parse was done on green con mob from 2 expansions back.<br />
<br />
Personally I just leave the log on for a night while xping with one type of weapon then I compare it with another log done in same zone with different weapon setup. The results always mean something for me that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, the parsing was in LDoN, probably hard missions.<br />
<br />
Which means, I suspect, that the parser (EQCompanion) isn't accurate.<br />
<br />
And I have started doing what Casai said - just play the way you normally way, and you can determine how effective you are.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I put the Anger3 on the CHSD.</div></div><hr />
