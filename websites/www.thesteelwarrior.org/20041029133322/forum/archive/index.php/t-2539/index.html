<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else encountered some problems with him warping ?<br />
<br />
I know about the blurr and everthing. We pull him him at the first left corner.<br />
(the one left when you enter PoEB arena)<br />
<br />
Our 3 first kills went perfectly.<br />
<br />
Our 3 last attempts at 30% he warped to a spot near his pop point<br />
and his 2 mephit guards warped to his side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes he warps sometimes right after he blurs. Dont know how to fix this except to restart the pull. Very unlucky to have him warp 3 times in a row..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, had this happen a  few times.  I used /bug to report it so i'm sure SOE has all their top people working on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I sense a slight bit of sarcasm in that last post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We havent had him warp yet afaik. Our first 2-3 kills are in the corner you speak about. <br />
<br />
Lately we have killed him in the second left corner, so we dont have to worry about respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never seen him warp.  Seen him pwn 5+ peeps after the rage and blurr tho ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya see, there's a reason I always turn off attack immediately upon rage, whether a mob is facing me or not. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He used to warp on us when we first started playing around with him, it usually happened as he neared 40% or so. We have started fighting him in the back corner, to the left of his door and havent had it happen since. Just in case, we clear everything from around the door prior to the last cheiftan pull, so if he does warp on us now, its only him that returns rather than him bringing friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">never had him warp on us, that blur sucks though, but i just kept a snare gland handy =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can mitigate the warping haven't had it happen to us in a few months...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hes warped on us 1 in about 10 kills...but the memblur is fun.  Every 3 minutes like clockwork, at 730 and 430 into disc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We had it occur a number of times for us but I made one change to how we pull him, not fight and he has yet to warp when he blurs.<br />
<br />
All I changed is that I do not tag him even when he's alone, if he is in return mode, meaning walking back towards his home spot.<br />
<br />
The theory being that if he is in return mode when he blurs, there is a distinctly higher chance that he just warps away before he can be re-engaged.  So far it's worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can mitigate the warping <br />
<br />
Now that got me curious.<br />
<br />
Mmmm now that you say it ... <br />
On the first 3 kills i didnt bow tag him once he hit the arena wall.<br />
On the 3 warps i did .... might actually be as stupid as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's because a part of his body is in the wall, when he blurs.<br />
<br />
The game doesn't like that, so it resets him to bind.</div></div><hr />
