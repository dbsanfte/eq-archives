Now...I have seen a few people use this skill from time to time, but is it really anything that people are going to want to spend hard earned points in??<br />
<br />
I've had an idea for a while that they let us use a shield and a 2 hand weapon at the same time (I know, using 1 hand for a 2 hand weapon sounds like something sony would come up with an excuse for). This would give use for all those shields we have sitting in the bank and let us keep decent DPS.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just food for thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield is our only non tanking utility.  If I am not tanking on a raid I use shield every time I see a healer or CC member getting beat on.<br />
<br />
Its a good skill for lots of reasons - you can save clerics, save chanters, save the MT, save offtanks, and the biggest drawback of /shield is its range.<br />
<br />
It wont be the first AA I go for from GoD, but will probably look at it after the HP AAs and the Proc AAs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this really shouldn't be an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why not? when you shield a person you are supposedly throwing your body infront of them so it makes sence that you need to be close.  The required range as it is doesn't make the ability useless, just means you have to be aware of where you are and the person you are shielding is and you need to yell at headless chicken chanters to stand the fuck still when they pull agro off you.<br />
<br />
/shield as it is now is a good ability.  Get living shield and its a better ability, get the new AA and its better again.  Its not the first time an ability has been added to the game which is mediocre but gets enhanced by AAs - DI/unfailing divinity? Rangers and Archery?<br />
<br />
People got shield and feedbacked that it needed longer range so now they are giving you the opportunity to extend its range.  please dont cry that its going to cost a few AA points to get.</div></div><hr />

Now...I have seen a few people use this skill from time to time, but is it really anything that people are going to want to spend hard earned points in??<br />
<br />
In my opinion, Shield is one of the defining skills of the Warrior class.  I have used it extensively since I was able, and it is a core part of my tanking technique, inasmuch as I spend most of my time in single group dungeon crawls.<br />
<br />
I routinely employ two socials on my main hotkey setup, one for the enchanter/wizard and one for the cleric/healer.<br />
<br />
In those instances where the Taunt key has not popped, and a fragile caster pulls aggro, Shield is the difference between life and death.<br />
<br />
Training casters to come near me and stand still is always an ongoing battle, but all my regular groupies are now secure and confident.<br />
<br />
Anything that lengthens the duration or extends the range of Shield is an exceptionally good thing.  In my mind, a Warrior who does not make regular use of this ability is not fully capable or worthy to consider himself &quot;skilled&quot;.<br />
<br />
In groups with undisciplined Monks or Rangers wielding fast, high-proc value weapons, this discipline is exceedingly helpful in reducing the healing burden on the Cleric.  Let alone reducing the frequency of &quot;Ranger down&quot; eventualities.<br />
<br />
Although I have no scientific basis, it is my observation that shielding in close proximity, such as sparing the hide of an inattentive Ranger, generates some hatred towards me as well.  Often the mob will spin to me upon shielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shield really isn't a defining skill tho..it's a skill to make up for the fact that our aggro ability used to be shit.<br />
<br />
I use shield whenever an unslowed mob is hitting someone else.  That basically amounts to about once a nite.  If you teach everyone how to contro their aggro better, shield becomes infinitely less useful.  I'll say it again....the better your group plays, the less you need shield.<br />
<br />
Now that incite is in the game, I'm using shield far, far less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps, however the same could be said for many skills.  If you are playing with the same people night after night, the need for additional measures of any sort will be lessened.<br />
<br />
My view on the reasons for enhancements to the game is quite a bit less jaundiced than your own, and really not particularly relevant to when and why such an enhancement is used.<br />
<br />
We should all be lucky enough to group each day with a personally trained, ideal group of partners.<br />
<br />
Out here in the real game, Shield is a skill that the superior warrior does not want to neglect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm happy this &quot;real game&quot; only exists in your mind, because it sure would be a lot less enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Go thru and check magelos, see how many people have Living Shield trained and are under 200 AA's.  You'll have your answer of how useful it is, and you'll have a wide cross section of people of all gear levels.  Shield was a bandaid to fix a broken system, nothing more.  A nifty trick for the bag, no doubt, but it was not a make or break skill by any means.</div></div><hr />

The real game?  Would that be the game where you have no friends/guilds to group with whatsoever because they're useless?<br />
<br />
No, the real game is where we hang out with the whole world, and don't consider everyone outside of our personal clique to be &quot;fucktards&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unlike the inbred Ozark Mountains hillbilly culture of the uberguildy, where dancing outside the family is considered an act to be scorned.  As you yourself opined in an earlier post.<br />
<br />
In the real game, one associates with huge numbers of people of varying experience and playstyle.  Guildies are friends and socializers more than over-specialized clones with few and predictable reactions in every situation.<br />
<br />
Ghetto groups with unconventional (non &quot;vision&quot;) composition are common and considered quite fun.<br />
<br />
Though one strives to reduce the need to use Shield, and the Provoke line is quite helpful in that regard, Shield remains a unique and essential characteristic of the Warrior class.<br />
<br />
As you all whine here in the forum about how the distinctions between classes are being erased, and everyone is getting stuff that belongs to other classes, it is silly at the least and hypocritical at the worst to minimize the one skill that is absolutely unique to the Warrior.<br />
<br />
Pallys and Sk's can hold aggro and take punishment.  Only a Warrior can shield another.</div></div><hr />

Lately i have been doing a lot of Adventures with out crowd control and have found a use for all the skills to esentially become the crowd control when 3 or more come to camp.

<br />
i prefer to use shied rather then have people hold back because of percived warrior agro. if you dont lose agro once a fight your group is treating you with kid gloves. if your not hitting incite every refresh poping a shield on someone and haveing casters scream oom then your group is holding back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many people come to these boards to share ideas, ask for opions, or to learn things about the game they love to play that they didn't know before. However, some come here for the sole purpose to shred others and stroke their egos to make them feel superior to others.<br />
<br />
These are the same people who are 16 year old punks who spend 15 hours a day in front of their computer, smoking two packs of cigerettes a day and, when not playing EQ or trolling the boards, masturbate to screenshots of naked Half Elves.<br />
<br />
I find it disappointing, and somewhat annoying, that when I come here, I have to filter through all the macho postering, cynical slandering, and just general being a jackass, to find useful information.<br />
<br />
Whether it is the jackass in the zippy mart who makes minimum wage and is pissed off at the world for his lot in life, or the posters who come here with all the tact of a turkey buzzard, such is the world. Has been and probably will always be.<br />
<br />
As to the subject at hand, I totally agree with you Shaik. Shield is a unique ability, and, in the real world, some actually find it noble and applaudable that I had the presence of mind to use the ability on the rare occasion when someone is getting beat down that isn't supposed to be. I would look forward to updrading this ability (in its due time).<br />

I know if a pali burns their LoH on me in an xp group, I feel quite honored.</div></div><hr />

If you resort to suggesting that the person you disagree with is a bad person and couldn't have an intellegent observation because A) he is age 12 or younger B) Doesn't have a megahigh paying career and is compensating by playing EQ........<br />
<br />
Do either of those and you LOSE the arguement - its kind of like the nazi rule (compare someone to a Nazi and you lose).<br />
<br />
And just so you know, I am a 9 year old Nazi that is and will always be forever stuck in a dead-end loser job at Dairy Queen while living in my basement with my mother and I'll never, ever have any girlfriends and my teeth are green and I am so fat I can't even wash my butt.<br />

<br />
Heh heh.  The most frustrating part of discussion boards related to EQ is that in the main you don't get useful information, what you get is &quot;everyone with a brain wants to be like *me*, cuz I'm so leet&quot; or &quot;anyone who doesn't wanna be like *me* is a fucktard&quot;.<br />
<br />
Being an uber-god of high-end Intel networking in the real world, I run into this sort of thing all the time.  But it generally comes from the insecure.<br />
<br />
When I'm dealing with young engineers, I try to frame my advice to fit their position and standing and to give them information useful to their needs.  Though I could stand around and tell them how they can never be as awesome as I am, it wouldn't serve any purpose, and might deter someone who someday could be a valuable asset to me.<br />
<br />
The leet uber types among us, who belong to leet uber guilds, very likely have a tremendous amount to offer.  We already know they are leet, they don't need to point it out, it serves no purpose.<br />
<br />
What would be useful is for them to share from their knowledge, realizing that their methods are narrowly specialized for raiding exceptionally difficult mobs, but that they may have useful knowledge for those of us who single group mobs of a somewhat lesser order.<br />
<br />
There exists a forum on this board dedicated to the high-level uber types, moderated to ensure that leetness prevails.  This is not that forum.<br />
<br />
The posturing and sneering is *always* going to provoke the sort of reactions you decry.  So it is a little disingenuous to say that if someone sneeringly disrespects you that should just be accepted.  Yet if you react by characterizing them as the sort of person one expects sneering disrespect from, you lose the argument.<br />
<br />
The stereotyping, and the sneering, are equally poor.  But the sneering is what comes first, and so is the most ill of the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'm pretty happy with most of SoE's recent decisions, their decisions regarding AA's is often lacking, especially when it comes to offensive skills. 2 expansions now has SoE been adding offensive AA's to various classes, and yet they still don't see the simplest way to address offensive damage AA.<br />
<br />
Combat Expertice:<br />
3 ranks, war/monk/rog/ran only. <br />
rank 1: 5 AA<br />
rank 2: 10 AA<br />
rank 3: 15 AA<br />
Increases the innate damage bonus on all weapons wielded (including bows) by 1, 2, and 5 points respectively. <br />
<br />
What does this accomplish you ask? Well, it's simple, the new aa:<br />
- Adds a very powerful but costly melee offensive AA (I mean, PoP was great, but considering how powerful the skills were, PB and Ferocity were WAYYY too cheap cost-wize)<br />
- Addresses and balances the duel-wield issue. Because the AA would affect all weapons wielded, off-hand weapons would receive an additional damage bonus. The aa would boost the DB on primary 1hs to 18 (at rank 3), and in essence, would increase the the damage bonus by 10 while duel-wielding vs. only 5 from using 2 handers.<br />
- Gives melee classes the only offensive aa's they receive in this expansion (with exception to monks).<br />
<br />
Combat Expertice; add it.</div></div><hr />

On a onehander, a 5 dmg bonus is insane, on a 2hander...well...it's certainly not. Nice, but it seems an AA like that would have to scale somehow with a weapon's delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could adjust it to net higher DB for 30+ delay. But really, the point is to re-balance duel-wielding, which has been out of sink since 2001.

I didn't make my comments because i'm better than anyone, i'm merely stating a fact.  Shield becomes less useful the more skilled you are, not the other way around.  When you stop having aggro issues with other people, via gear, via intelligence, via just plain having worked together for 4 years, /shield becomes nearly useless.  It's not an elitist attitude, it's a downright fact.  I'm sorry you're taking things like that incorrectly.  I'm not trying to tell you I'm a better player than you, or I have better gear, i'm just stating that AA's to increase the duration or range of a skill that by all means SHOULD be worthless once you reach the level of play where you would be spending points on it is non-productive.</div></div><hr />

How exactly is that the real game?  Because it's the way you prefer?  How is that any better than the &quot;ubers&quot; who only care about their raiding?  Sounds very hypocritical to me.<br />
<br />
The &quot;real game&quot; is whatever the person playing prefers.  I don't care about the equip of people I'm playing with too much, but to not have a basic amount of skill means I don't want to group with them.  I'm not going to waste my time grouping with someone who is going to keep screwing things up.  But like I said, skill and equipment are independant of eachother.<br />
<br />
But back to the main point.  One aa that I would love to see is an ability to pull a mob towards you.  Since we do a lot of moving around to position mobs properly, it would be very helpful for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a fact .....<br />
<br />
So knowing my class means that I will have to use /sh less?<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm <br />
<br />
<br />
  Fact , unless the people you are grouping / raiding with know their classes with the same facility you know yours , then Warr's will need Shield .<br />
<br />
  Shield is unique in that it gives the whole group , and on a really rough attempt perhaps , the whole raid ,a chance to survive .<br />
<br />
  If some 'over keen' person should make a mistake , and therefore get summoned , /sh can make the difference between theirs-and groups - life and death ,<br />
<br />
  Remember that the new 'Agro' abilities are not guaranteed to grab , hold and keep agro -even though a lot of non-warriors think that they are .<br />
<br />
  So when the group chanter dies and his pet (fully buffed of course ) then becomes an 'add' does saying that 'Shield is not needed as much because I know my class ' really going to prevent mayhem?<br />
<br />
<br />
  Of course . when in a group of 'properly trained'(or experienced ,whatever) players then /sh is not the hotkey that I reach for BUT ... I always have a '/sh (slower  name)' key set because if I DON'T . I'll wish I had .<br />
<br />
  Only warriors can do this , if you have a damage shield it even helps with overall group DPS , I LIKE to shield , albeit with a shield equipped to counteract damage recieved (but only when applicable , FB Sheild for example ).<br />
<br />
  So KEEP the over-enthusiastic alive (feel free to 'instruct' them afterwards of course ,and if they don't listen ,take what steps you consider necessary ), especially if it's someone healing you , or even the guy who has three mobs mezzed and a really nasty pet , and you are more likely to enjoy the game , rather then calling for a Rez , because the healer died off the agro from his/her first CH .<br />
  <br />
  Shield is too useful a skill to NOT use . <br />
<br />
  But then , thats my opinion , it's just something that seems like common sense to me .If you keep people alive , they will remember you when it's time to grab a replacement tank .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know what the rest of this paragraph is, but I can't remember the last time a healer pulled aggro off me with a CH.  Other than that tho, the best way people learn things is at their bind point.  It gives them time to think about their choices in game plan.  If you've got the cleric on your side too, who is coming up with reasons to delay rezzes on said people, they learn VERY fast that they either have to figure it out, or get the fuck out of the group.</div></div><hr />

With POK, the nexus, Graveyards, ad naseum, people spend less time doing CR's.  While I don't think CR should be painful, it should be a learning experience.<br />

I grew up hunting in SK bound in Qeynos.  When I fucked up, I had a lot of time to think about it on my unsowed, un-run 3 15 minute jog back to my corpse.  People don't do that these days, and as a result, never learn crucial lessons that old timers learned.  How many human characters died in unrest and forgot to bind in kaladim or Gfay?  You only did that once.</div></div><hr />

As I understand it though Haass, you're not a big raider and yeah in an XP group if someone does something real stupid they can get a rez and we'll carry on, but on a raid while sure having 40-70 people at their bind point really pissed with you will make you want to log off for a week and think real hard about what you did wrong I'd rather just /shield them and save myself the hassle.<br />
<br />
Not that Ive ever had a situation where I could clearly say that 1 /shield saved from a wipe.<br />

To the people saying only a warrior can /shield someone, well a paladin can heal / LoH them which has much the same effect.<br />

One could also say that an SK can harm touch, which if it kills the mob might also have &quot;much the same effect&quot;.<br />

However, we are neither Paladins or Shadowknights, but rather Warriors.<br />
<br />
Since /shield is *our* unique ability, and has great facility, it is rather ludicrous to minimize it.<br />

I seriously doubt the Paladins argue amongst themselves about the uselesness of LH, simply because it has &quot;much the same effect&quot; as the Warrior's /shield.</div></div><hr />

If, as you seem to indicate, the primary reason your getting a group is your &quot;unique&quot; ability to /shield people you will be in for a BIG surprise soon :)  People do NOT group warriors for the /shield ability...  Saying this is laughable... Saying that the /shield ability is &quot;unique&quot; or &quot;class-defining&quot; is equally, if not outright, hysterical.</div></div><hr />

Ack! Flashbacks! In retrospect, I think the runs back to Grobb to sell my bronze weapons and deposit my coppers were more harrying than the CRs. I still think they should put a banker in EC =- |<br />

You have become better at being slain by Dorn because you are too encumbered to run away! (3)<br />

I agree, long CRs build character. I was bound in Innothule until Luclin came out. I had someone bind me in shadowhaven, but I think I forgot to be grouped with them because next time I died I was back in the swamp. Now THAT was a shitty CR lol. <br />
<br />
Getting back to the subject, personally I use /shield liberally. Whenever taunt fails, BAM /assist /shield. Has it ever saved a life? Not that I can recall. Has it ever gotten me groups? Doubtful. Has the target PC ever been out of range? Sure, every now and then. Is an extended range worth as many AA as it costs? Sure, when there's nothing else to get =-/</div></div><hr />

Well, if you were a bit more intelligent, you would stop with your very idiotic idea to get as many aas as you want before leveling, and then actually get AEtaunt.<br />

When doing a hard LDoN, your chanter WILL get a mez resisted, he WILL get agro, your taunt WILL fail, and the chanter WILL get mashed into a pile of bloody goo. If you toss your /sh hotkey because you 'teach everyone how to contro their aggro better', then you are bypassing one of the tools that could have saved that chanters life. Obviously, /sh is not the end all, be all, chanter saving device, but you can bet, if there is an AA to improve it, and I have worked for and have gotten the more important ones, then I will be spending my AA on this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok i've been drinking coffee and thinkin about this fer about 5 mins:<br />
<br />
1) The better the agro skills the less need for /shield....sorry but this is fact.  With 4x EB procs, incite and AE taunt rarely do I see an unslowed mob making a beeline for a group member...the nice thing is rarely do I feel powerless anymore when it does.  Now if you don't have all these tools maybe /shield is the best thing since sliced bread...and thats cool.<br />
<br />
2) I don't have the AAs extending /shield duration.  Also not sure what the God skill extending its range will do (my #1 complaint about this skill...I hit it and look like an idiot when the person goes OOR).  It *could* be very cool in the future (Emilia posted it was cool so I'd think indeed yes it is such)<br />
<br />
3) On raids if someone sits/grabs low health agro they die.  With proper mechanics this shouldn't happen very often.  At least this is the way it used to be on raids.  /shield still a nice tool if you have a bunch of extra warrs and they see &quot;DEF DOWN&quot; and its a critical moment and all that.<br />
<br />
4) There a ton of things that make a good warrior.  However, rarely do you find a &quot;great&quot; warrior calling themselves such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do these '/shield' usability arguments seem to spawn every so often?  It's just a tool.  Either put it in your bag and use it, or choose not to.  It has uses...and yes, in a 'single-pull-mob-slowed-on-inc' group they are smaller than some might experience in other situations.  But that doesn't ever make it useless.  <br />
<br />
Extended shielding duration has pretty much always been sort of a joke because we usually see shield used in situations where you're trying to save someone from inadvertant aggro (like a paper-caster or healer)...and usually that is short lived (CC still being worked out, just need a few seconds more to survive it...not something extreme like 30 seconds).  Extended RANGE shielding is something completely different...since it would make the shield skill itself more useful (again, just another tool...but perhaps more useful than before the AA).<br />
<br />
Lets not argue about how useful a jigsaw is compared to a circular saw...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rarely use /shield. <br />
<br />
What I find with casters is that if they are inept enough to draw aggro, most of the time they don't stay still enough for it to be effective. Maybe extended range will help. maybe it won't. I am fortunate in that my weapon set ups are good enough that I can gain aggro back even if they do gank it and run a bit and with incite, it gets even easier.<br />
<br />
The other thing is if a caster does aggro prematurely, I may let one instance go by, but I will politely discuss things with them on the second. If they ignore aggro control after that, they can &quot;learn from their bind point&quot;.<br />
<br />
Raids are a bit different. Depending on the mob and how it is positioned, the MT or healers etc, may not be in range to /shield. <br />
1) The better the agro skills the less need for /shield....sorry but this is fact.

<br />
I agree with that but I also think that good positioning and communication in a group can serve to lessen the necessity and thus value of /shield. There is more than one way to do just about anything and maybe once Shaik learns that, he/she can drop the pretentious attitude.</div></div><hr />

For xp groups I have 2 /shield hotkeys that I do use occasionally.  One for the slower/CCer and one for the healer.  Unfortunately because of the ridiculously short range on it, it usually fails.  I don't see any point to the extended duration /shield AA but the extended range /shield AA will be pretty high on my list.<br />
<br />
I have very good aggro control for a warrior and generally don't need /shield but there ARE situations especially in LDON hard missions where taunt fails multiple times in a row, Incite isn't enough to overcome resisted slow + successful slow or a charm pet breaks and starts beating the chanter into a bloody pulp.  In those situations /shield is VERY nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure why you'd take offense to this.  You know it was sarcastic right?  Shaik says guilds are useless, and then talks about playing the real game where you have to group with fucktards.  That's not the real game, that's the game you choose for yourself because you don't make enough friends to have a steady hunting group.  If having the same group to do shit on EQ with every nite makes me a 16 year old punk, well then I guess you can knock 8 years off my birth certificate and call me a punk, cuz that's what I do.<br />

<br />
I think you're confusing my animosity towards idiocy with animosity towards /shield.  I have no quarrels with /shield.  In fact, as I stated earlier, I use it every time an unslowed mob is hitting someone other than me.  Of course I know that people get resisted and draw aggro..well fuckin duh.  I have been playing this game long enough to see a few resists in my day.  However I seem to know the difference between a resist and someone who's an idiot.  I save people who get resists, I don't save idiots.  Understand a little better now?<br />
<br />
There is a necro in my guild who luckily i don't get to group with very often because of opposite schedules.  One nite I let him sit at his bind point for about half of the time we were XP'ing because he kept doing dumbass shit like snaring before i even got the mob back to camp.  I'm not gonna fight with people over aggro.  If you want to do that stuff repeatedly, well then you're gonna have a little time out, until you figure out what you did wrong.  I'll save you once.  Twice is pushing it, and you're gonna die the 3rd time, because I'll let it beat on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, let me begin by apologizing for not making the last paragraph of my last post apparent that is was in response to the general topic, and not directed towards refuting your opinion of the use of /sh. In fact, I think we are in total agreement on this point, ie. it is needed much less now that we have new tools to prevent agro loss, and, grouping with people who apparently want to die, deserves the same. I am with you 100%.<br />
<br />
My problem is: <br />
Shaik says guilds are useless, and then talks about playing the real game where you have to group with fucktards. <br />
<br />
For the life of me, I can not see anywhere where he made this statement, directly or implicitly. Furthermore, I don't believe he said he HAD to group with fucktards, but, not everyone is lucky like you, and gets to group with 'regular groups', therefore, on any given adventure, you have a 1-5 chance that at least 1 of them will be a fucktard. In such cases, a fucktard who is a REALLY good fucktard doesn't just die, and gets to think about what he/she has done at their bind point, but could easily cause the deaths of the entire group. In this context, being good at using every tool available to a warrior can overcome any fucktards you encounter. Perhaps even really good fucktards.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, you took a cheap shot at him, and it bugs me that this kinda thing takes place far too often on this board (we are not the exception, mind you), and it provoked me to say something about it. You took a cheap shot at me too, but I asked for it, so I can not fault you for that. In this post, however, I don't think Shaik did.</div></div><hr />

In the few hard adventures I've done, the only people who have died a lot have been me (the puller) and my SK friend (the tank).<br />
<br />
Many times the tank has died and the enchanter has stood up to the mob while we finished it off. And many times the mob hasn't even eaten through the runes by the time we finish it off.<br />

And yes, this has been on hards.<br />

<br />
Range has to be higher ok thers aa (but cost is hefty and makes it still not usefull) unless i dont have any aas to spend anymore<br />
<br />
Duration has to be longer ok thers aa  (but cost is hefty and makes it still not usefull)<br />
<br />
<br />
The damage absorbed has to be 100 % &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; to make it worth it . AA ? wheres aa ...(anyway shouldn be aa)<br />
<br />
but the most usefull thing would be if you auto shield a selected person if that person goes under 70 60 50% hps ..then i could even see a use if it doesnt absorb 100% ...but thoose 50% absorbed damage really should be increased<br />
<br />
if i target somone i cant taunt anymore till i switch back to the npc ..wich often help making shield not used and if i use it thers a 3 mins reuse and next mob comes in 1 min .. 95% of the time if i would decide to use it the shielded person doesnt get hit by the time i have decided to ..or is too low already for shield to save him and he dies anyway ...and i really have no fun at shielding somone for no seens use 95% of the time and the 5% you then finally would have used it it isnt up because of the 3mins reuse .<br />
<br />
after all i never saw a situation where i could have been fast enough to decide to use shield and save somone ...if somone dies he does it in wayy to fast time to decide ...or the cleric has had enough time to heal him anyway ..<br />
<br />
wich makes shield useless in its current shape for me unless you are NEO and have the option to slow down the timeflow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclussion:<br />
<br />
either make it absorb 100% ...that would be an option...you could rescue a person in the very last second that way ...<br />
<br />
or make auto shield option, so you can choose a person ,...raise the damage absorbed to 80% ... since a person doesnt qualify to be shielded till hes low hps most time its too late for shield to have an use at that time ,it only takes 50% damage and this person still dies not in 2 seconds but in 4 seconds :) thoose extra 2 secs if you should have a lucky moment with your shield disc arent worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - Doing LDoN-easy, and the next mob I pull reaches camp before the previous mob is dead. Definitely doesn't save anyone, since they don't hit hard.<br />
<br />
2 - When I was still guilded, raiding elementals, warriors shielded me all the time while clearing trash. I was one of the lead clerics, and timed a CH to land ~6 seconds after tank engaged a trash mob; I got summoned a whole lot (though, since a lot of those heals did 4-8k, putting myself on the line for a few seconds every few mobs was a lot better than losing the MA to a few quick damage spikes). When I didn't have DvA up to count on, /shield actually helped. Usually kept me going for a few more seconds when I couldn't channel my own heal or another healer couldn't land one on me in time, and since it only took a few seconds for the MA to get aggro back from me, it saved me often.<br />
<br />
If you've got the cleric on your side too, who is coming up with reasons to delay rezzes on said people <br />
<br />
One trick I always enjoyed when I was grinding xp in Valor would be to watch the rez timer, then have rez land on the corpse 3 seconds before it graveyards; person rezzed gets a trip to where their corpse was, wondering where the fuck their corpse is. Mostly used it on tards that just drag a corpse to the cleric's face and say &quot;Hail, Tard's corpse&quot;, but a group member without a clue, and too lazy to run back, was also fair game.</div></div><hr />

Something like lowering refresh (1 sec per level! 3 levels!) or doing something like giving a chance for a second taunt to fire when you push the button, something like 3 levels 20, 50, 100% chance. I think both of those woulda been far from overpowering and been just nice little helpful additions. Oh yah, and of course as long s they are tricking otu the shield line change the ratio of dmg thats spread around.</div></div><hr />
