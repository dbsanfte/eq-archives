<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doctor Choddy C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondered what the bare minimum was required for<br />
<br />
a) Taking the nameds in HoT<br />
b) Taking Dozekar himself<br />
<br />
Would like some firsthand knowledge, thanks much for info posted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. What's your raiding experience?<br />
2. what's your raidforce size now?<br />
<br />
Hell; dozekar can be 3 boxed by the right people :D<br />
<br />
All in all; a group of sub-60's in velious gear...4 groups for a good HoT run if it's your first time..than as you know the zone and get better equip...goes down to 2 groups or even 10 people or so to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Doctor Choddy C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm talking about level 65s, and boxing people....<br />
<br />
Fairly good gear, but not amazing (Ssrae, VT, Early planes) - I just wondered how many of us it would take for the 2 different types of fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">prob 2 groups would be overkill.<br />
<br />
the nameds who drop tears in HoT are cake; dozer's hardest part is not letting your cleric's go oom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once Doze is slowed, it's just an endurance test of mana vs his insane hp. The less people you have, the more mana/mana regen you'd better have to keep everyone healed for longer. The only problem with HoT trash is gating mobs, so if you have that taken care of you're pretty much set with 1 group. 2 good, solid groups should be able to own Doze and the drakes with little worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Doctor Choddy C</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have I believe:<br />
<br />
65 BST<br />
65 MNK<br />
65 CLR<br />
65? Chanter<br />
65 WAR (I hope)<br />
maybe a 65 WIZ too<br />
<br />
All well equipped, just wondered whether this was doable.<br />
<br />
Cleric has FT 15, will have SD from BST, KEI or better from chanter.....what do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The tough part you'd have there is healing until Doze is slowed. Looks like the DPS is just fine, and if the warrior defensives on inc he should be able to tank fine until it's slowed. Once it's slowed, just make sure to refresh it well before it wears, and just slowly kill him dead. <br />
<br />
  For the drakes and trash, just make sure any gating mobs are pushed. BL pet pushes like no ones business, and monk, warrior and BL pet should be able to interrupt gating mobs without much trouble. Otherwise, the monk should be able to pull fine and things will die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Breogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have done it with 2 people playing 2 and 3 chars respectively: 65 Warrior, 65 Ranger, 65 Cleric, 65 Shaman and 65 Bard for Manasong (nothing spectacular gear-wise, cleric didn't have max FT and our guild hadn't entered elementals yet by that time so we had a mix of Ornate / VT gear). It took a while and I forgot to reslow with the shaman, so I died and ranger had to finish him tanking :p.<br />
<br />
With the setup you posted should be doable, just need to slow him real quick. You only need to pull the 2 mobs in pit and about 3 roamers (also mobs can be harmonized with the bard, so I guess your cleric can do the same :)) <br />
<br />
We used to fight cornering him in the pit, right under the stairs, and leaving the cleric and bardbot between both of the stairs, covered from the AE.</div></div><hr />
