<br />
40ac 20str 15dex 15stamina 135hp 20cold 20magic 10 poison<br />
clickey shield of pain 5sec cast time<br />
warrior only<br />
<br />
probably will be cheap being warrior only, but i'd wager it's the best shoulder item you will see till time.<br />
<br />
Some other items you could get<br />
1. a full set of raex<br />
2. some real aggro weapons to put aggro augs on (iffir wtf?)<br />
3. Leaf jointed cloak from earth<br />
4. Fang of flame from fire<br />
<br />
... there are lots of stuff you can get, but honestly i would look to Hard Ldon for some easy nodrop upgrades such as the follow slots in my magelo:<br />
<br />
-ear<br />
-neck<br />
-eroded royal facemask<br />
-my ring (lost elven)<br />
<br />
There are several upgrades you can get from single groupable content which are significant upgrades.  Upgrading these lesser/minor slots now means you save dkp later and get to spend it on what really counts: Raex, raex, and more raex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Flowing Moss Mantle is decent for elemental shoulders. Its haste and a good chunk of hps more than what youre wearing currently. I also dunno if I would hold out specifically for the Puresteel Mantle, in all our months and months of Air farming and avatar clearings we ended up with only one single pair. Dunno if we were just horribly unlucky or if it's really that rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gawd, we still haven't seen one of those.Got lots of flowing moss mantle tho.Nice item to carry haste on for ep ppl imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you want a quick purchasable upgrade look at Fierce Heraldic Pauldrons.  They are better HP wise then what you have now and the same AC.  They will last you until you get the ones from Air ring.<br />
<br />
They are cultural so you can buy them in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Farm Dozekar and pick up Pauldrons of the Deep Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31472) You can do it in your spare time with a single group, as well as getting some of the other HoT quest pieces like the Silver Bracelet of Speed. The shoulders are very decent, probably the second or third best pre-Time, and the SBoS is also very decent as both a wrist and a haste item. It's always good to keep your haste options decent and replacable.</div></div><hr />

I'd say get the shoulders from Vhaksiz the Shade in PoNightmare to hold you over. I've one-grouped him several times, and tanked him as a rogue easily (granted my gear might be better than some rogues, but it should be very doable for you). Shouldn't be a problem, and can save you some plat... or if you have lots of plat to throw around, they're also tradeable.<br />
