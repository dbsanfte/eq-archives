<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have room to play with your Sta (your a Half-Elf, so prolly) I'd personally swap the Blood Earring of Rage for a BloodMetal Earrring of Engagement.<br />
<br />
Nice stats( inc Sta), AC and HP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have an Iron Cog Earring, but got it from a guild event escorting the gnome. With STA max buffed it shines, but when you don't have a shaman in group and have average gear it isn't quite so efficient. Im lucky to have plenty of STA and shaman friends.<br />
<br />
Bloodmetal is the way to go if you are buying an earring, i would say. All the stats + raw HP and on my server they have dropped to 24k, pushing Mosquito Leg down to 16k. If you by a Mosquito you will look at the bloodmetal as a future upgrade and not be fully satisfied. By then Mosquito's might not re-sell as high as they do now, especially if you look back at Luclin the MLE was selling for 60k ( atleast on Torv ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Solstice + Mosquito.  It's a damn good droppable combo, save the huge amount of money you'd have to spend on the other two and maybe buy other upgrades heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depends on your money situation. If you are on a tight budget, then just get a Solstice earring to replace your Ring of the Warlord. The 2 STA loss is well worth the 55hp raw.<br />
<br />
If you have a truck load of plats laying around, you can buy a couple of bloodmetal earring, they will last a long time. If your truckoad is small, then maybe a couple of Mosquito ears are almost as good for about half the price.<br />
<br />
You might consider running the escort the gnome event a few times to farm earrings. The event is pretty easy and can be done with 1 group, 2 groups makes it pretty trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use Bloodmetal and  Earring of Rage, and I personally love em :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bloodmetal + Bloodmetal.  Not sure why you'd voluntarily wear anything else.  If you're gonna upgrade, just do it once and do it right.</div></div><hr />
