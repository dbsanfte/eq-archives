<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're looking for some parses akin to tthe dps ones.<br />
<br />
If anyoine can complete them, even if you have onlky 1 of ther items parse 5+jrs (I know, its a lotO That would be fantastic.<br />
<br />
Brael posteded some Parry parses on Sk.org but with skill caps and le ngths...Its a liittle off. Any class parses are welcome, however, as long as they're long enough.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you guys know how to set up a  controlled environment, if we could get <br />
Just post like<br />
<br />
Name - Magelo<br />
Class<br />
Length<br />
misses(and %)<br />
dodgeand %)<br />
parryand %)<br />
riposteand %)<br />
Parry/Didge rate (depending on item)<br />
<br />
Of course we need a control, meaning do the same thing witnout the mod, list ac/effect differeces.<br />
<br />
and tne results. Include any sielding/avoidance if at all possible. Cut/past and attafch thre log to thre bottom i you dont have too much cyber, either.<br />
<br />
I realize these take time and all, but it'd be a big help to everyone not to metion prtjspd a fix if they're broken.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought I did pretty well, so i wont edit it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unfortunately I dont have the data anymore, but I did do 2 overnight test sessions with and without my Improved Parry 2 shoulder. The data suggested that improved parry 2 does exactly what Lucy says it does: &quot;Increase Chance to Parry by 16%&quot;. Which is also what Brael finds on SK.org I believe(http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=22474).<br />
<br />
I am not sure I agree with his conclusions that it is useless though. The mob type(lvl 50 mob) I tested on went from a 43% to a 44% hitrate when I remove the shoulder, which(correct me if I am wrong), is equivalent to a 2.3% increase in damage. <br />
<br />
Of course end-game mobs like Xxeric in Tacvi have hitrates closer to 65%, so going from 65-&gt;64% hitrate would &quot;only&quot; be a 1.5% reduction in average damage, but its still great bang for the buck for a single item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going with the parry/dodge 3 items because as far as I know, there's no mobs that have any form of tactical mastery so the avoidance from those mods always work, whereas every other form of damage mitigation/avoidance can be circumvented (attack for AC, DI for shielding, increased to hit for avoidance, DB for defensive).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Question about LDoN dodge augments, do they stack (8% and 5%) and can you go over your cap with them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
No they dont and parry 1 2 3 ect is a completely different animal than parry 8%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No they dont and parry 1 2 3 ect is a completely different animal than parry 8%.<br />
<br />
The no they don't is to the not stacking btw, they do take you over your class cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Right Phant but from what I found the majority of the extra Parrys recieved would have been caught by Riposte/Dodge/Miss anyways.  If a mob has insanely high accuracy sure the mod would be excellent but when it has regular accuracy (The mob I used in those parses was 65 btw) the value plummets sharply.  A large hit to AC in most cases for a 0.28% boost (Parry) is kinda useless.  Whispering Amice/Earhoop of the Eighteen Eyes are good choices of items to take with the mods but Cape of Woven Steel, and the Imp Parry 3 shawl (name escapes me atm) are not.<br />
<br />
The skillcap difference is a valid issue but since the parses show exactly how the mod would work, you can apply that to your own caps knowing the base rates without actual parses.<br />
<br />
Also, whats wrong with 20k swing parses btw?  Thats quite a few swings I let the mob take at me.  The one that is 16k though is a bit short I admit, meant to retest that but didn't have the time.<br />
<br />
If you're going to do this though let me suggest something, everyone use the same mob.  That way you have the same hit rate, if one person parses on a mob that hits you normally 60% of the time and another parses on something that hits 30% of the time the results are going to be very far off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well im not expecting a huge turnout,just someone has to have these items to test.<br />
<br />
20k swings isn't *that* long, 50k would be a bette rnumber imo. Course im also wrong a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually I started these a week or so ago to test some questions I had from another thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8503).<br />
<br />
The log files have already been edited for just parse data. Sorry I don't have access to a 65 warrior (just started playing a little over a year ago), but I have provided the appropriate skill values as they were during the test as well as other information that my prove useful.<br />
<br />
Both are with 1 AGI (only baseline I could reach), encumbered, same skill values, no buffs, vs the Exterminator in Ak'Anon, only AC changes. defense/dodge/parry/reposte values are 241/175/222/223.<br />
<br />
Vikken<br />
58 Warrior<br />
<br />
600 AC test (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=525&amp;stc=1)<br />
attacks - 10901<br />
misses - 4283 - 39.29%<br />
dodge - 517 - 4.74%<br />
parry - 729 - 6.69%<br />
reposte - 547 - 5.02%<br />
<br />
1100 AC test<br />
attacks - 28215<br />
misses - 11360 - 40.26%<br />
dodge - 1179 - 4.18%<br />
parry - 1792 - 6.35%<br />
reposte - 1461 - 5.18%<br />
<br />
Total change from 600 AC<br />
misses +.97%<br />
dodge -.56%<br />
parry -.34%<br />
reposte +.16%<br />
<br />
I pretty sure that well within the margin of error. In any case, I have the ability to extend these parses for longer length if it would be useful. <br />
<br />
I found out what I wanted to know, which is the effect of worn AC on avoidance. Maybe we could put these up since it appears that all the old data was lost. Drop my a line if you need more.<br />
<br />
note: can't upload 1100 AC log (zipped) because of filesize limit of 146.5KB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Disregard that last post. I just noticed you were lokking for dodge/parry I/II/III parses. I'm an idiot, I'll go hide in a hole now.</div></div><hr />
