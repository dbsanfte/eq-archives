<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, we're getting a second computer (my wife finally got tired of me hogging the PC all the time playing EQ  :D ) and now I have to decide which character to switch to the new account. I've got 3 'main' characters:<br />
- 55 druid<br />
- 57 warrior<br />
- 49 shaman<br />
<br />
So, which one would you move to the new account to 2 box with the others?<br />
<br />
Note:  I'm usually grouped with friends that have the following, although I do solo a bit occasionally:<br />
#1 - Druid only<br />
#2 - 60 cleric (but he's kinda burnt on this one), 57 mage (preferred), 47 SK and monk<br />
#3 - 59 enchie (and occasionally 2 boxing with 55 druid)<br />
<br />
Abinormal<br />
57 Troll Warrior</div></div><hr />

I have a guildmate who's an SK and he 2boxes a shaman. He can pretty much go anywhere and get xp with that combo. The SK is now lvl 56 and his shammy is at lvl 55. When he started out there was a lvl difference of about 10lvls but the shammy caught up very fast. I know that warriors require a bit more healing than some sk's due to lifetaps but once that mob is slowed and your hasted things are easyier :) He spent hours in dulak grinding xp in armory easily.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you :)</div></div><hr />

so you can 2box with Shammy or Druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say move the warrior, if you dont need the druid for ports. Then he could group with either the druid or shaman (both are good powerlevelers and duo partners).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good thinkin.  That's what I would do.  You will probably never want to 2-box the shaman and druid together, but either of them can come in real handy to a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup move the warrior!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm...how well does a warrior/druid combo work?  <br />
<br />
I know warrior/shammy and druid/shammy are both great, but I wouldn't think warrior/druid would be that good once you get to PoP mobs because they hit so hard I'm not sure the druid can keep up with the healing of an unslowed mob.  (of course, the port ability of the druid is definitely nice)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krauth Isuber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd definitly say move the warrior.  I've duo'd in pretty much all tier-2 / tier-3 PoP zones with just a druid or a shaman.  Druids CAN rock with the heals if they know what their doing / have ALL their heal spells (I'm in love with teh druids AA abilities), and Shaman...Shaman are the epitome of pwn.  Gotta &lt;3 teh shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, you know what? If you moved the shaman or druid, then you would have a good powerleveler on both accounts. That way if you decided to make a new character some day, you could make him on either account and there would be somebody to help him level on the other one. <br />
<br />
Like, if you wanted to make a cleric to duo with warrior someday. If you move the warrior now, then both your powerlevelers are on the same account that cleric would have to go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree, move one of the healers.  <br />
(Nothing says &quot;indestructable&quot; like a lvl 44 twinklord tearing up reds/yellows with a 60 clr babysitting it, hehehe :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So like your wife was sick of you hogging the PC playing EQ so you're buying a new PC and starting a new account so you can hog both PCs playing EQ now ?</div></div><hr />
