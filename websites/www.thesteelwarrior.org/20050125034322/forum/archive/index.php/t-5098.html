<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a raid last night, I got the Ore from the Hole needed for Strength of the Elements, and I already had the Phinny drop, so I should get the groundspawn and the WW ore fairly easily tonight, allowing me to sell off my barbed rubi pauldrons. On the nameless, I've seen 2 pauldrons for sale recently, both for 95k, and neither of them have sold in the past week, so I'll probably sell mine for around 75k if I'm persistant. I'm also close to obtaining the NRo BP, and I can sell of my Fierce Heraldic bp for around 10k. I already have 16k in the bank, so all in all, I'll have roughly 100k to blow on upgrades. <br />
<br />
My question is, how would I get the biggest bang for the buck?<br />
<br />
Possible upgrades I'm considering are Ornate Bracer to replace BoB (30k), Ornate Gauntlets maybe (27k), 2nd Bloodmetal Ear (20k), some sort of 100hp bow (55kish), or maybe Ornate Legs (100k).<br />
<br />
I don't really see many other buyable upgrades that will do much for me. I'm happy with my weapons, and am gradually obtaining more nro armor and some augs for it. I've got a haste item that I'll be sticking with for some time, and the pieces of Kizrak's that I already have seem fine to me.<br />
<br />
If anyone sees other upgrades that will give me more of an improvement that various pieces of Ornate, please let me know. It'll probably take me a few days to unload that barbed rubi pauldrons anyway, so take your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another earring can be nice Look for the BoT earring too, Tear of the Rainmaker.<br />
 <br />
Steel ring of earthen Resiliance would be good upgrade dunno how much they run for you there might be a bit too much. <br />
<br />
The guantlets would not be an upgrade really since yours have more hps gives you a nice clicky though. Same with Legs.<br />
<br />
A nice 100hp range item would be nice if stonewood bow avail I'd look into that adds some attack and regen too.<br />
<br />
Also a new cloak like the 80hp ones might (Crinose cape of the werewofl, Fierce Heraldic) help some but not much. <br />
<br />
<br />
 Ear to either Bloodmetal or Tear +35hp<br />
 Range Upgrade +50hp<br />
 Rings to Steel Ring +25hp<br />
 Gauntlets to Ornate -30hps<br />
 Greaves to ornate +10hps<br />
 bracer to ornate +15hps<br />
 Cloak to 80hp one +30hps<br />
 Boots to KT or Bloodied boots of the beserker +15hps and +25hps respectively</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrtiz</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can upgrade your Cloak for under 1k, Crinose Cape of the Werewolf, look at my magelo if your want to see the statts :)<br />
<br />
The rest looks very good, maybe a new earring...<br />
<br />
I have seen those Acid bracers (+100hp) for 100k on my server as well...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... I have a Crinoose, and have had it for a while now, thought it was in my magelo. Also Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience runs 80-90k, way too much for me to even consider it, being a minimal upgrade. I do plan on upgrading one of my rings to 10th coldain ring soonish, just need to get a group of friends together for 7-9, and then plan a raid.<br />
<br />
I guess a 2nd bloodmetal ear, and a nice bow would probably do the most for me, since I can eventually get nro legs/boots/gloves/bracers if i wait long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For your back slot, I'd look at doing the Loyalist Shield of Honor quest.  Spend a smidgeon of your 100K and you can get some Illusion: Human potions if you're Ogre or other dark race.  It'll save you MASSIVE factioning.  (I went from Dubious to Warmly I think)<br />
<br />
If you wanna spend a little more, you might be able to buy Valdanov's ashes in the Bazaar... Do some research on this first, as there are two sets of ashes (Valdanov's and Heradius's, you want Valdanov's) with the exact same name.  Anyways, it makes a great back-slot item, especially aug'd with 10AC from MMC.<br />
<br />
From there, 2nd Bloodmetal earring and the bow are still doable within you budget likely.</div></div><hr />
