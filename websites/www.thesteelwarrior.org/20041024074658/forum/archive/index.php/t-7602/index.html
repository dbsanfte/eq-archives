 The quest is borked right now, I've redone the quest 3 times already and each time that stupid Kerzar Clawtore respawns after beating him down, submits to questioning and then goes poof before giving you the whatever after talking to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you given him the item you should give him before beating him down?<br />
Hi will then attack you after hand in. Maybe this could be the problem.<br />
I did it with the hand in, then killed him, did the Questioning and got the key. No problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got it to work not too long last month.  Note if you continue to attack him once he surrenders he fights on, Crystal.   Its not the quest that is bugged.</div></div><hr />

 Lets not assume I'm an idiot, I've followed the complete quest through to this point.<br />
<br />
Yes, I handed him the item given to me and he agros, beat him down dead and he will respawn on top himself with a new verios that you can talk to. If you try to talk to him, he then despawns and the rest of the script continues with the generals spawning and so forth. But he has never given me the item to move on.<br />
<br />
You then have to start over, because each time you had someone the medalion or whatever the they give back a different one. Kerzar will not take the item after he gives it back to you, so you have to destroy it and start again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I HIGHLY recommend /petition for that. There are transaction logs that the GM's can consult to show that you did all the steps yet failed to get the reward. In your write up of your issue, give them dates, if you recall them. I've had problems with quests get cleared up a couple of weeks later by a GM. (Most recently was actually a problem in this particular quest, actually.) The GM placed the missing item in my inventory while I was in trader mode.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it turns out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BikamarNeebiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did you talk to the legionairre at the gates before attacking him?<br />
I had a similar problem with the kitty vampire, and solved it by making sure I ran through the text with the legionairre first... then thumped kitty and got the item.</div></div><hr />

I've petitioned eveytime, only the time before last did I get a responce from a GM. They ofcourse didn't take the time to give me the correct badge so it was useless to me. FYI each time you turn in the badge you are given a different one although the look exactly the same. So if you fail a step where you had to turn in the badge, you can't use the same badge to turn in again. That was my problem, they gave me the same one you get back from Kerzar Clawtore, coupled with a LORE flag, making the badge go poof.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll get around to doing again soon, I'm running out of upgrade options without selling my soul for ornate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Caught heratius up finally earlier today and after like 5 hours of running around managed to get my shield.</div></div><hr />
