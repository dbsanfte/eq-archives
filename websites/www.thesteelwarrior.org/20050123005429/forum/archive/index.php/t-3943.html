<br />
<br />
Upcoming for Magelo<br />
<br />
Work on the implementation of Augments is progressing nicely, now that Jelan has more time to work on Magelo. With some luck, this weekend might be when he can finally implement the long-awaited Augmentation slots (with apologies from us for the delay). <br />
<br />
Further down the road, Jelan also revealed his future plans for Magelo. Of course bug-fixing will remain something that is getting attention, that is not going to change. But, now that Jelan has worked so long on Magelo, he has also learned a lot - and when looking back, there are things that could and should have been implemented differently from the way they are now. <br />
<br />
As such, Jelan has decided to return to the roots of Magelo once the augments have been implemented. The code will be re-written, which would result in a website and program that is much more robust and which can be maintained, modified and expanded more easily - which will result in less downtime. <br />
<br />
Stay tuned for updates!</div></div><hr />
