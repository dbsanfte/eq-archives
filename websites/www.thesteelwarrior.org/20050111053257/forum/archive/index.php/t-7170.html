<br />
Group with friends and split PP from sell of items when they sell, or hope your dice roll high.<br />
<br />
At your lvl I was pharming UP named.  At the time was upgrade in equipment, and the +15 stat bracers sold for nice.  Pulled to entrance, will need ranger or druid to track for named.<br />
<br />
UP with a strong group your lvl can be very fun, can hit the caves and get some named that drop very good items for there lvls.<br />
<br />
Pharm Lodi if you can get spawn time.  For about 2 weeks around lvl 60, me and 2 others (cleric, chanter/druid (2 boxer) hit him every spawn (11.5 hours-12.5 hours).  Just make sure you never mention spawn time of Lodi, can be highly contested.<br />
<br />
MS (mid south on my server) in BoT is a good place to pharm ornate bracers that sell good too.<br />
<br />
I also pharmed Top in Velks, but assume those drops are not worth much anymore.<br />
<br />
If you are strong enough when you hit 65, LDoN hard missions also have some very nice dropable gear that sells good.  Lots are warrior wearable, so might be good to just loot and wear too.<br />
<br />
If I were to be high 50's, low 60's again, what I would probably do is:<br />
- Get some decent cheaper gear, culteral or anything else that is easy to get.<br />
- Lvl to 65 asap, hit PoV, then BoT in a few lvls, in BoT hope to get some ornate drops.<br />
- Hit LDoN's at 63ish-65, save points to replace your weakest gear.<br />
- Hit Hard LDoN's once you get to about 8k hp buffed, will get a big upgrades from these.<br />
- After done with hard LDoN loot, or when you want a change, hit some GoD zones.  Bari has nice earring that drops off trash (FT ring for casters too).  Ferbi has some very nice loot off 1 grouable mobs, and very doable with defensive AA's and LDoN gear.<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn't directly answer your question, but warriors are not strong solo types, we do best grouped with others.  When it comes to PP pharming, best to group with friends with same goals.  It is better to group with 2-3 friends, and get 1/3-1/4 the PP from items sold, then relly on your dice to get 100% off the loot.</div></div><hr />
