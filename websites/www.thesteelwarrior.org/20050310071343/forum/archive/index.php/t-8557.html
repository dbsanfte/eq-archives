Frog usually would not come here because Frog not Warrior but Frog finds this:<br />

Attention SBC Yahoo! customers who use <br />
Windows XP Operating System <br />
<br />
Dear SBC Yahoo! Member: <br />
<br />
If you are using the Windows XP Operating System on any of your computers connected to SBC Yahoo! Dial or SBC Yahoo! DSL, this courtesy message is for you. Users of other operating systems are not affected. <br />
<br />
In August, Microsoft Corporation will be offering Windows XP users an update called &quot;Service Pack 2&quot;. You may hear about the Service Pack 2 update in the news, on the Internet, or by seeing prompts on your computer screen telling you to load a &quot;Critical Upgrade&quot; to Windows. <br />
<br />
Service Pack 2 provides a series of security enhancements for the Windows XP operating system. These new updates and features may cause SBC Yahoo! and other software on your computer to behave differently. <br />
<br />
Based on our testing, SBC has determined that some users will experience changes after loading Service Pack 2 when using the customized SBC Yahoo! Browser, Parental Controls, SBC Yahoo! Web mail, and Instant Messenger. SBC and Yahoo! have prepared an update for these software components that you should load to ensure compatibility with Service Pack 2. <br />
<br />
Please copy and paste the below URL into your browser to download the software update. <br />
http://download.yahoo.com/dl/sbcy/xpsp2fix.exe <br />
<br />
In addition, if you are using a firewall on your XP computer, you will need to go to the firewall manufacturer's website and load any software updates they provide for Service Pack 2. Although we do not provide support for firewall software, you can find information and web-links for the major firewall companies at: <br />
<br />
* Zone Alarm: http://www.zonelabs.com <br />
* Norton Personal Firewall: http://www.symantec.com/sabu/nis/npf/ <br />
* McAfee Personal Firewall Plus: http://www.secureie.com/c/002/firewall2004/firewall2004_02.asp?source=goog&amp;keyword=firewall&amp; <br />
<br />
If you experience changes with other software on your computer, check the software manufacturer's website for information regarding Service Pack 2 software updates. <br />
<br />
Please refer to the SBC Yahoo! Help Site, http://help.sbcglobal.net/ , for more details on Windows XP Service Pack 2 and SBC Yahoo! software updates that are available for your computer. <br />
<br />
If you want to know more about the Windows XP Service Pack 2 update, please refer to the Microsoft site at http://support.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2 or call 1.888.SP2.HELP (1.888.772.4357). If you need additional help with SBC Yahoo!, please refer to the SBC Yahoo! Help Site at http://help.sbcglobal.net <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
SBC Yahoo! Member Services <br />

Uninstall any and all Yahoo! software from your system. It is nothing but system hogging spyware. It's quite possible to setup a network connection, or even a dial-up connection without any software besides the native Microsoft ones. This also goes for Gateway,Compact,etc. software. None of it actually benefits you.</div></div><hr />

SP2 is causing some conflicts, but the most severe I've seen are on systems that have *dun da duuun* lots of spyware installed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Windows 98 ownz, except when I need to use this wireless USB drive, and it's finiky as hell, but it's cool !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarva</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meh Windows 98 was the pwn , I never got a Virus or Worm on 95/98 but they both were like cars with no brakes always crashing and breaking.         <br />
<br />
I remember first time I ran XP after I installed it no more then 10 minutes after I got it going the fxxker got a worm from the net it was all too soon to set up a firewall I was downloading patches from Windows update when it happend and next boot up a few of my programs were gone and I ran virus check and came up with 2 worms. <br />
<br />
<br />
Same thing happend with my Windows 2000 install some worm came and took over explorer.exe and I had to boot in to Linux to get rid of it. So you need so many thing just to run a WinNT based OS Firewall,Anti-virus,Ad-Remover,Tarpit,etc beh I miss MS-DOS   :D</div></div><hr />

98 still suits me fine! for now ^_~</div></div><hr />

I spent my days leading customers though uninstalling the sbc yahoo software as the solution to most of their annoyaces and problems. with the most common forms of DSL out there win xp will work with out any added software and all other OSs need only pppoe software to make your internet connection.</div></div><hr />
