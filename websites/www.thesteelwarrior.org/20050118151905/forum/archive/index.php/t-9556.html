<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What should I buy?  See Magelo to the left.  I usually group with the same three folks, clr/shm/enc, so we're a little light on dps, but oftentimes we add dps to our group.  I just recently stepped into a ST role for a casual raiding guild also.  We do relatively simple targets so far, Inny in Nadox, PoS named, BoT tower type mobs, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm leaving towards a HoRZ or a BoC.  Also leaning towards just a few other misc upgrades like Fiercely Hooked Claw and Enduring Bracer of Flame or Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet and Suelthresh(?) Ring or another Steel Ring.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Other slots like ear, finger, wrist, etc might give you roughly the same hp, but will cost almost as much and won't do jack for ac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kinda like the resists (especially the 30svm) and the endurance from the WDH, but HoRZ does have over twice the AC and the ability to see inv which is always nice.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

HoRZ - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25209<br />
<br />
HRoZ has 23ac 5 str 3sta and see inv over WDH<br />
<br />
WDH has 60endurance/mana, 10svp/10svd/10svf/10svc/15svm over HoRZ and the ability to sell faster because it's all/all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already own a BoC, check my magelo below my name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Picked up a HoRZ for 185k.  I'm happy.   :) <br />
<br />
I'm not sure now if I'm going to save for a BoC or start upgrading other slots for more HP's.  Fiercely Hooked claws are coming down, so I might pick up one of those then start saving for a BoC.<br />
<br />
I need to do the loyalist shield quest still, but have already spent hours camping for the ashes, and am dreading doing that again.  Any other quests anyone can recommend that aren't too dreadful and are one-groupable that I can do for nice upgrades?<br />
<br />
Right now the group I'm in is focusing on HS, NC, and BF, and are planning on progressing to RCoD.  I think there may be some upgrades in RCoD, but I know it's going to be rough going for me tanking there, I need some AA's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I won one for my monk on the 2nd day. 99% of the time if you say it's an upgrade they will default the item to you unless it's an upgrade for someone else aswell, it's how my monk won his.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70219 - Drops off of Ukan Fleshflayer<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70237 - Drops off of random trash mobs<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70235 - Also drops off of random trash mobs<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70215 -  Drops off of Kyv Assassin<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70226 - Drops off of Dragorn Strategist<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71134 - From SH<br />
<br />
All of these items (with the exception of the granite scepter) can be obtained from one camp spot... hill or cubby. I've grouped in that spot from 66 to 70 on my monk so I know where all the nameds spawn and exactly when they spawn.<br />
<br />
Also, some nameds drop items such as duskfall chronicles or shard of energy(sp?) which are basically the new ornate (kizrak) of OoW. (The new ele (raex) from OoW are from Anguish)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittachi</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and earring drops off a named Noc, forgot his name in the same ruined building the Kyv Assassin spawns. The Earring is his rare drop. The armplates are the kyv's common drop (sword of disruption being his rare) the bracer is the ukan's rare drop (with no drop 40HP aug being his common)<br />
<br />
The shoulder and neck items are extremely rare drops, they drop like 1 in 1000.</div></div><hr />

By the way, a warrior without AE taunt who is MT/ST is not fully prepared, in my opinion.  Make your next AA purchase area taunt, and make it a priority!</div></div><hr />
