Does anyone know exactly where I was ported to and if I invis myself could I make it back to the group ok. I am a lvl 51.</div></div><hr />

Only logical answer I could think of is maybe the Giant gated and summoned you but doesn't sound like that is what happened /shrug</div></div><hr />

If you were hunting in the Arena or in the Tormax area then no, those mobs see invis.  If you were around the bank, then yes you could, those mobs dont see invis.</div></div><hr />

A number of giants in the arena can gate(which is what must have happened), and they then summoned you to them.  It is part of what makes hunting in Kael arena so exciting at your level(it certainly did when I hunted there).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You most likely had a mob gate on you, then summon you.<br />
<br />
Here's a way to keep the mobs from gating.  Giants cannot be stunned so you cannot stun them to keep them from running.  Giants cannot be mezzed either, so using mez to break casting wont work.  And when something gets charmed, you cannot attack them, so it makes it difficult.<br />
<br />
When a mob gets to gating health, have all your casters go full burn till its dead, this ensures it gets dead before it has a chance to gate.<br />
<br />
Also, have you melee push the mob.  Yes, pushing is good here, a moving mob is a mob that has a harder chance of channeling a spell.  If its moving, it has a much lower chance of gating.<br />
<br />
Again, Adjutants are the ones you must worry about, all the rest are melee mobs.  Cept the named, but dont worry bout those just yet, get the normals under control first, before you tackle Kallis and his PoZs, or the named Gladiators.</div></div><hr />

Since they can't mezz anything, and won't be charming what you're fighting, they have little else besides keeping speed and crack up anyway.  Gives them something combat related to do, incase they start to feel like buff whores while in Kael.  Plus it's a huge help to the raid.  You won't have to worry about pushing, nor the frantic nuking at the end.</div></div><hr />
