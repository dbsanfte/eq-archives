<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Curious here what ppl's opinions are. I'm in Time/Ikkinz and working on uqua and am playing around with new expansion. What are ppl's opinions on aggro augs at this stage of the game? I'm currently using EOE and JoS both with A3 augs, but wonder if Ykesha might be better?</div></div><hr />

Has some discussion on this topic, although it didn't start off that way hehe.  I think the answer is &quot;maybe&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I get the feeling that if aggro from stuns does scale with level as Brael's tests seem to indicate, then Ykesha for level 65 mobs is roughly equivalent to anger 3 in aggro and also has some DD.  I put Ykesha on my EoE and I've been pleased with it so far.  I have Anger 3 on DB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Busstin1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also do the same thing here as khum i put Anger 3 on my DB and 125dd stun on my offhand seems to work great  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since Busstin hacked into my comp and held my account as hostage till i paid him irl... i couldnt play for 3 months, so my gear is behind everyone else's... That said i have SEWS with A3 and GBoS with stun aug in it. Everytime i group in PG, i use GBoS/shield combo and hold aggro just fine. Can even keep aggro with SEWS.<br />
I've always been into stun augs myself and from what i exprience everyday... i wont be buying another A3 unless i already have the 2 stuns equiped.</div></div><hr />
