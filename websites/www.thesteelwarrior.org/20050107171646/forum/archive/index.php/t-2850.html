<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uira Tawhaki</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in a group the other day with a paladin the same level as me who kept stealing aggro while using a 2 hander.. He swears he wasn't taunting or stunning but my 65 pally friend (on his BST) says he was and I use a CHoS and Frostbring both of which proc fairly regularly for me (149 DEX).<br />
<br />
It unnerved me because it just rubbed my face in that whole aggro business we have all been discussing and he was doing it intentionally.<br />
<br />
I have two questions..<br />
<br />
First, of the following arsenal which primary secondary combo would hold the most aggro:<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (179 mr DD  and 0.0 stun)<br />
Frostbringer (60 cr DD and -15 ac)<br />
Barnacle Covered Axe (pique)<br />
Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood (85 pr DD)<br />
Kunzar Ku'juch (engulfing darkness)<br />
<br />
I've been using CHoS in Primary and Frostbringer in secondary but it wasn't enough to keep aggro 100% of the time with this pally. Should I have used BCA in primary and CHoS in secondary? Or some other combo?<br />
<br />
Second, has anyone ever tested the aggro/proc rate on this weapon:<br />
Journeyman's Walking Stick<br />
MAGIC ITEM<br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY<br />
Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 24<br />
DMG: 9<br />
STR: +4 WIS: +4 INT: +4<br />
Effect: Tashani (Combat)<br />
WT: 1.6 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: ALL except NEC WIZ MAG ENC<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
The tash is only a level 20 ENC spell but if I know one thing from my ENC it's that nothing beats tash for hate..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knikanek</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I carry the Tash stick.  I do snag agro with it sometimes when I'm not MT.  Typically the only time I use it is when I'm SA and there's no snarer.  I use tash stick till proc, then put on snare whip till proc.  After both proc, I tend to take agro for just a bit even without taunting.<br />
<br />
Think about how that agro works this way...how many times have you been tanking and a caster tash the mob...and they take agro for just a bit!<br />
<br />
As far as using it at a MT to get and hold agro...it's to slow and doesn't proc often enough to worry about it...I tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tash is decent aggro (and tash sticks do proc a lot - but have a terrible damage/delay). It's certainly not as much as a high level slow,  a dd + stun, or eb proc though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If he's stunning and/or taunting, then you simply will lose aggro at times, even with dual eb, BoW, etc.  I'd stick with CHoS main and Frosty off.  Tash sticks are nice utility, but just don't proc often enough to use as a primary weapon above 50 imo.  And it certainly doesn't compare to the combo you have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A journeyman's walking staff won't do much for your aggro, but many carry them for utility.  I don't know your pally's weapon, but quite possibly with 2h he was doing more dps than you, and several pally weapons have aggroing procs.  In general, if you engage the mob a couple rounds before him, you shouldn't have many problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, i used my tash stick when the snare weapon i had ( kunzar ku'juch or snare whip ) wouldn't take hold.<br />
it's basically a handy utility item. if your bags got room for it it's nice; but not worth losing DPS over from your other weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uira Tawhaki</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice guys. :)</div></div><hr />

I rarely pull it out but I can't remember the last time it procced</div></div><hr />
