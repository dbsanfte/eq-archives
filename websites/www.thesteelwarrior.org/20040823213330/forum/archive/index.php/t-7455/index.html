I would think that doing something as drastic as that could change the game and make it feel less competitive. But then again there could possibly be no change at all for some parts and a complete destruction of others.<br />

So what do you all think of the subject?</div></div><hr />

So no such thing as vendors or droppable gears in other words..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In a nutshell yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So would everything be no-drop?  You either looted it and used it or it rotted?  Or would things still be tradeable, but there wouldn't be platinum in the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some form of no-drop to prevent an economy based on bartering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">some would love it, some would hate it.<br />
<br />
one thing it would do for those who currently use the bazaar. it would force them to exp in a wide variety of zones (good for the game) the way raid guilds already raid a wide variety of zones to equip everyone. unless of course they mixed up the drops so that anything could drop anywhere (based on level obviously). it COULD be made into a very good system that everyone likes. it could also be horribly done. it would be a lot of work to implement so i dont think this is very likely to happen.<br />
<br />
if they do implement this system though i would strongly recommend they make corpses lootable only by the group that got the kill. otherwise vulturing for rotting loot would be even worse than it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was wondering more along the lines of the competitive feel of the game.<br />
<br />
Would something like this make players spend more time in content designed for them, preventing things such as bottom feeding and farming while encouraging positive player interaction? Or would it be just the opposite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">only no drop will slow bottom feeding.<br />
<br />
as long as you can solo or small group something for loot to sell o transfer to others or farm plat to buy. bottom feeding will exist.<br />
<br />
i routeenly go back and bottom feed hillgiants for plat for tradeskills. mor fun then just wipping out hords of spiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes that would stop it, but what kind of effect would you expect it to have on player perception and interaction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">more pain then anything. fabled would prolly be an example. but that only works as long as people are willing to help each other. eventualy people will buy/sell places in line.<br />
<br />
then again imagine what would happen if say elemental molds/patterns were dropable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What it would require is that SoE tune things very carefully for the targetted player/level range.  They couldn't just make things overpowered and then ignore it because players had the ability to gear up through the bazaar in order to meet the challenge.  And I don't think SoE could do it.</div></div><hr />

I can't answer to the competitive feel of the game ... I've never given a dam* about how anyone else was doing in the game compared to me.  I don't care if they can get better shinies than I can, and faster, or vice versa.  All I care about is *what's in it for me*.<br />
<br />
I think, given the scale and complexity and depth (granted, they miss sometimes, but the sure do make a good effort) of EQ, a player-based economy (even if it was just raw barter, no currency) of some sort is vital.  I don't miss it in CoH, but I think it's a good part of EQ as well.  To remove it would be a step towards a completely new, and very different game.  Not better, just ... different.  Tho not much of a participant myself (just a casual shopper), I have no qualms against a player economy in an MMOG.</div></div><hr />
