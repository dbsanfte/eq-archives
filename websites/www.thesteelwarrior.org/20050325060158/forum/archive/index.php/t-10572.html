It doesn't seem to ALWAYS block for max, though.  I know I've seen 2 blocks in a row (Imp. Shield Block) that have blocked for something like 27 and then 35.<br />
<br />
Just something to keep in mind for testing.<br />

<br />
You know, looking at my combat log from a couple of days ago, I noticed something sort of odd. I partially block, but get hit for 1 A LOT more often than any other number. I guess it could just be an odd coincidence that my strength and shield match up with the mobs average hit so well, but figured I'd post it.<br />
<br />
* These mobs were 3-5 levels below me and non-elite, so take the percentages with a grain of salt. This is only intended to show the oddness I mentioned, NOT to give an accurate block model for equal level mobs.<br />
<br />
A &quot;Full block&quot; would be a block that eliminates all the damage of a hit, as in:<br />
&quot;Feral Rabbit attacks. You block.&quot;<br />
<br />
A &quot;Partial block&quot; would be a block that only partially eliminates the damage of a hit, as in:<br />
&quot;Feral Rabbit hits you for 1. (35 blocked)&quot;<br />
<br />
Total blocks: 225<br />
Full blocks: 73<br />
Partial blocks: 152<br />
<br />
After a &quot;Partial block&quot;, I took this much damage:<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage Taken		Times			Percentage<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
1			76 		        50.0%<br />
2			6			3.9%<br />
3			3			2.0%<br />
4			5			3.3%<br />
5			4			2.6%<br />
6			9			5.9%<br />
7			3			2.0%<br />
8			0			0.0%<br />
9			3			2.0%<br />
10			4			2.6%<br />
11			5			3.3%<br />
12			5			3.3%<br />
13			4			2.6%<br />
14			7			4.6%<br />
15			1			0.65%<br />
16			2			1.3%<br />
17			2			1.3%<br />
18			2			1.3%<br />
19			0			0.0%<br />
20			0			0.0%<br />
21			4			2.6%<br />
22			1			0.65%<br />
23			3			2.0%<br />
24			1			0.65%<br />
25			0			0.0%<br />
26			1			0.65%<br />
27			1			0.65%<br />
<br />
<br />
So half the time I do a Partial block, I take 1 damage from the hit as a result.<br />
<br />
ANOTHER odd thing is that all of the non-standard blocks come when I get hit for 1 after the block. Every other hit I take blocks for full (35-36, had MotW in there somewhere). However, all those hits where I Partially block, but take 1 damage as a result, are all over the map in terms of damage blocked:<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage Blocked		Times<br />
-----------------------------<br />
18			3<br />
19			2<br />
20			6<br />
21			7<br />
22			6<br />
23			7<br />
24			7<br />
25			5<br />

27			1<br />
28			4<br />
29			2<br />
30			5<br />
31			1<br />
32			3<br />
33			6<br />
35			9<br />
36			2<br />
<br />
<br />
Whereas, with the second highest &quot;Damage Taken&quot; of 6, we see this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage Blocked		Times<br />
-----------------------------<br />
35			7<br />
36			2<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really understand what happened (hit, block, partial block, partial hit, ???). Could you please reshape your data into something of the same kind:<br />
<br />
mob's output	#	Block	#	…	…	Block	#<br />
20?			36				18	<br />
…							<br />
1							<br />
0 (miss, dodge, parry)							<br />
<br />
<br />
the format would be: first colonm: mob's hit before block and their occurance number, and the next are all the block you made (one colonm for each block power) and their respective occurance number for this particular hit power. So obviously if the mob hit for 20 you can't block more than 20 and the result in this particular case would be a hit avoided by a complete shield block, and not a block at max power.<br />
with a structure like this we would be able to separate the AC bump (from shield) effect from the block skill.<br />

<br />
Reformatted a little.  May try to get the data into your suggested format, but will take some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinuvas</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the table.  This makes what I was saying apparent, as the only time a hit is blocked for a number other than 35 or 36 is when it is blocked for 1 damage less than the hit.<br />
<br />
My guess here is that &quot;Full Block&quot; is a different computation than a &quot;Partial Block&quot;.  So when a hit lands, a &quot;Full Block&quot; fails, but a &quot;Partial Block&quot; succeeds, you block for your Block Rating (shield's block rating + strength).  However, when the hit (after mitigation, maybe?) is less than the Block Rating, the damage gets set to 1.<br />
<br />
That actually kind of makes sense, since they could independently control the &quot;Full Block&quot; frequency separately from the Block Rating on shields...  Perhaps once you get past the &quot;you've  been hit&quot; part of the code, there is no way to say &quot;err, never mind, you've not been hit&quot;, so they just smack you with 1 damage and call it a day.<br />
<br />
That's all speculation, but I can kind of see it.<br />

well now you can clearly see that if you don't fully block a swing, then you will receive 1 point of domage untill a given threshold.<br />
ok, first try on shield block formula:<br />
T=Shield_block_rating+str/???<br />
<br />
swing incomming for a given power<br />
check chance to block (1)<br />
if check failed then swing lands for full power (normal hit)<br />
else, <br />
check for Shield_block_rating <br />
if second check succeed then swing is fully blocked (2)<br />
else,<br />
swing lands for dimished power max(1;swing_power-T) (3)<br />
endif<br />
endif<br />
<br />
(1) don't how much it is. should depend on lots of thing.<br />
(2) 73 upon 225 is 32.44%, it's close enougth to 35% (or T?) to let me assume we face a RNG behaviors on small sample.<br />
(3) you partially block up to T, but always for the best result: you always get only 1 domage if the mob didn't swing to hard (above T+1).<br />
T being a floating value, it's rounding is taken into account in the RNG between 35 and 36 block power. here I get 35.29% for T... I wonder if str is the only factor into account (what's your str btw?)...<br />
<br />
ok, it's lacking much parses, but I think it's a good start. what do you think of it ?<br />

<br />
Regarding this, I would be willing to bet only your strength bonus (not your base strength) is taken into account for this calculation.  I don't have anything to back that up with, it's just my gut feeling based on the way they calculate hitpoints from Stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
swing incomming -&gt; check chance to block (1)<br />
if check failed then hit lands for full<br />
else, <br />

<br />
ok, it's lacking much parses, but I think it's a good start. what do you think of it ?<br />
<br />
Regarding the procedure, I think it's hard to determine what the code is doing without knowing more about it than we do.   A guess is that it has something to do with the mitigation calculations, but this is pure theory.  I would think that they would FIRST calculate mitigation, and then check for things like block and whatnot.  But if they did it the other way, I could see this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Incoming Hit for X damage<br />
Check Block_Skill<br />
  if Block_Success<br />
    if Block_Rating &gt; X<br />
      Full_Block<br />
      Damage = 0<br />
    else<br />
      Damage = X * Mitigation<br />
      If Block_Rating &gt; Damage<br />
        # Oops, Rating IS greater than the damage after mitigation!<br />
        Damage = 1<br />
      endif<br />
    endif<br />
  endif<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, it seems extremely unlikely to me that that kind of kludge would be allowed into the code.  Furthermore, I doubt we'd be seeing nearly as many Full Blocks, if that were the case.  So, in all likelyhood, I think it's close to your procedure.<br />
<br />
(1) Easily determined in the Skill window.  I think mine is around 10.48% at level 58 with Shield Spec and +12 Defense.<br />
<br />
(2) That ~35% jumped out at me too.  Obviously need to parse more to be sure.<br />
<br />
(3) I don't think the block value is a floating value.  The 36 blocks were from when I had Mark of the Wild, which upped my strength.  I'm not sure what rank it was, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so basically it runs a check for whether or not any block would be applied, then if that succeeds then it runs a check to see if it will be a full block or not, if this check fails then it is a partial block, it then checks the amount of the block vs the amount of incoming damage, if the amount of the block exceeds the amount of damage that would otherwise be caused, you end up taking 1 damage, as otherwise, it wouldn't be a partial block, it would be a full block...<br />
<br />
in other words: if the first check to determine full block/not full block fails then you will definitely take at least 1 point of damage, you can't fully block on a partial block.  Or whatever.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Kailyn, I don't have access to Excel at the moment, or would have done that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kErosion</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before we make things FAR more complicated than it necessarily has to be, I looked into this a while back and found that..<br />
<br />
Deflection = ListedShieldValue@BaseStrength, +1 for every +10 Strength over Base<br />
<br />
As long as the damage being received is greater than the value you block for, the actual Deflection remains constant. <br />
<br />
Given Marshall's initial scenario, &quot;Say my warrior has 200 str and a shield &quot;32 block&quot; value .. what will be the added effect of the 200 str to this value of 32?,&quot; Marshall will Deflect 32 + [ (200 - BaseStrength) / 10] every time he receives more than that amount of damage.<br />
<br />
Block will never Deflect more than would leave the damage taken at 1 however. If one has a potential Deflection of 25 (Shield: 19, + 64 Strength: 6), and they are hit for 14 damage, the Combat Tab will list 13 damage having been Deflected and the Warrior will take 1 damage.<br />
<br />
In testing this I started by removing all my equipment that affected my Strength for the first test. In an hour of testing at my Base Strength it became clear that the value being Deflected was constant at the value listed on my shield unless what I was fighting was capable of striking under what I was capable of Deflecting. I began adding Strength slowly and discovered no change until I broke +10 over Base, at which point I consistantly blocked 1 over the value listed on my shield. This pattern continued over +20, +30, +40, etc as I've leveled further and upgraded equipment since the initial tests.<br />
<br />
This has looked consistent all through the 40's, but I have yet to repeat the test across a wide range of levels so am unsure whether the amount of Strength necessary for each extra point of Deflection scales similar to the affect of Agility on ones chance to Dodge. <br />
<br />
As far as I've noticed from occasionally glancing down at my combat tab this has appeared consistent for Green, Yellow, and Red conned enemies. I have not thoroughly tested across a wide difference between my Warrior's level and the enemies level. When Block takes place it has always appeared to result in the full value being deflected, or however much of that full deflection would result in 1 damage being received.</div></div><hr />

I get full blocks all the time if I'm fighting greens.  So that can't be right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My current Deflection is at 27. I fight numerous greens that are still able to whack me for 28 damage or more.<br />
<br />
I have not seen evidence of anything other than a Full Block. So long as Block goes off, the Deflected value is constant, Block attempts to Deflect the full value capable every time. The only time this does not occur is when the damage received falls below what the Full Block would be.<br />
<br />
Hypothetical situation..<br />
<br />
Deflection: 38<br />
Enemy Damage Range: 14-52 (After armor and other reductions are applied)<br />
<br />
Hit1, 27 Damage: 26 Deflected, 1 Actual Damage<br />
Hit2, 43 Damage: 38 Deflected, 5 Actual Damage<br />
Hit3, 17 Damage: 16 Deflected, 1 Actual Damage<br />

<br />
Same here.<br />
<br />
The only explanation for this would be if you could Fully Block WITHOUT your Block Rating being more than what you were hit for.  Possible I suppose, but  Kailyn's post regarding this sounds like maybe that isn't the case.</div></div><hr />

I've seen all of your hypotheticals, except that I see<br />
<br />
Knucklehead attacks. You block<br />
<br />
Far more than I see 1 damage hits.  I've also seen it where my shield dosen't block it's full value, but I take a lot more than 1 damage.  I think thats a good guideline to look at for shield block, but not the be all end to answers.</div></div><hr />

That said, looking at my blocks, I have something completely different going on. Now I was playing wiht mobs that are 55-57 (at 55). Each and every one of my blocks are partial blocks for 33 damage. <br />

I have an Overlord's Shield of Defense (26 block) and +59 str  and 2 base racial strength that gives me a block rating of 32. I have no clue where the last point of block is coming from.</div></div><hr />

I think his &quot;Deflection term&quot; is confusing because it is another totally different game mechanic.  I think he means what I've been calling &quot;Block Rating&quot; when he says that.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's probably reasonable that you'd never see a Full Block fighting stuff higher level than you are, especially in that area.  Assuming of course that Full Blocks work they way we think, which has not been proven by any means.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to say about the formula not working, can't vouch for that.</div></div><hr />

Been pulled away from homework long enough to try and replicate a less than full block from any hit greater than what I can Deflect. =)  So far I can't do it.<br />
<br />
Tinuvis may be right with the usage of the Deflection term. I use Deflection to signify the amount of Damage which is Avoided by Block. I shy away from Block Rating due to easy confusion with the percentage chance one has for Block to occur.</div></div><hr />

/combatlog will toggle it on and off.  It shows up in &lt;wow_directory&gt;\Logs\PlayerCombatLog.txt<br />
<br />
I don't know that I've ever seen a block that wasn't my full Block Rating that ended in me taking more than 1 damage, though.  Would need lots of parsing to be reasonably sure that it couldn't happen, however.</div></div><hr />

As above, the only time I remember seeing variable block amounts is when I partially block and end up getting hit for 1.</div></div><hr />

Shield: 20 Block<br />
Strength: 159 (93+66)<br />

<br />
Comparing with when I tried this initially around level 42 it's definately looking like the benefit of Strength on Block diminishes as we reach higher levels similar to Agility and Dodge.<br />
<br />
At level 49 it's looking like I get +1 Block every 10.606... Strength.</div></div><hr />

Houston we have a problem... I am level 55...<br />
<br />
I have an Overlord's Shield of Defense (26 block) and +59 str and 2 base racial strength that gives me a block rating of 32. I have no clue where the last point of block is coming from.</div></div><hr />

Are you all actually getting deflected messages at other times. As far as I know I have never deflected at thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
If you do a cleave or heroic strike and your target parries you will get a 'Deflected' popup ( the log still says parry though).  This probably applies to all special attacks.<br />
<br />
I assume this is just a popup message bug rather than having any deeper underlying meaning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tinuvas</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Logged some more last night, against Deadwind Ogres (55-58).  I am 58.  The &quot;max&quot; block values are a little off again because people kept buffing me and I wasn't paying attention most of the time.<br />
<br />
The numbers:<br />
<br />
Total Blocks: 437<br />
Full Blocks: 29<br />
Partial: 408<br />
<br />
Excel file of the table is attached.  The trend from the last parse continues, although it scales more rapidly because my shield quality is pretty poor against this stuff.<br />
<br />
Based on this data, and the data Kailyn is seeing, I'm pretty sure we can say that Full Blocks are directly tied to the shield's block value, and not just something that happens a given % of the time.  Therefore, I think that saying any time you block for more than what you would have been hit for, you take 1 damage, is false and that there is still some oddness here left to explain.<br />
<br />
I personally think it is still like I explained initially, in that there are separate checks.  They are BOTH linked to the shield's block value, with differing results based on your initial Block Check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theory:<br />

You receive a full block if the total amount of damage that the monster hits you for is less than the unmodified value of your shield's block.  If the attack is greater, it then takes mobs total dmg - the adjusted blocking amount based upon strength.  If that last value is less than 1, it rounds up to 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
scenario:<br />
Draconian deflector<br />
block value 40<br />
<br />
Strength:  base + 90<br />
<br />
Then you should block for roughly 49 on each successful block.  If mob hits you for 37 dmg, you'll receive the full block message.  If mob hits you for 45 damage, you end up taking 1 dmg.<br />

Interesting theory.  Should be testable, but I don't know that it's that important in the grand scheme of things.  It's not like 1 damage is going to make or break anything.</div></div><hr />

That seemed to me the most elegant explanation looking at it initially, but the results that you posted suggest otherwise. Your list of blocks resulting in 1 damage include several hits for 18 - given your normal block is 37 I'd assume the block rating on your shield is significantly higher than that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point.  The block rating on my shield was 28  in both those logs I parsed.<br />
<br />
In that case, I guess the separate checks on the full and partial block is still the best theory going, but I just can't come up with a good reason for doing it that way.</div></div><hr />
