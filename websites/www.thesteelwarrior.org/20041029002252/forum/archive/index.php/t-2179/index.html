<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bring a sleeping bag and a pillow, this has to be the most boring ring of all time. I forget how many waves come, just kill everything that spawns, then go take a nap or read a book. Waves are on timers that have never been adjusted so when it you kill everything in the first 3 minutes of a 20 minute wave, you get to pick your nose for 17 minutes. The loot can be very good, but there is no way I would endure this craptastic 3 hour encounter on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />

Pre-Ring information:<br />
1) Set up camp on the bridge. Stay in the middle area. Buff up properly.<br />
2) When everyone is ready, start the ring.<br />
3) ONLY one monk goes into the ring. This is the Ring Trigger (RT)<br />
4) RT stays standing until mobs spawn. RT feigns once mobs spawn.<br />
4a) If the RT dies, a Backup Ring Trigger takes his place until the RT is back.<br />
4b) RT stays grouped with a shaman to heal and a small enchanter team.<br />
4c) The RT and BRT should use hotkeys to alert the guild to every SPAWN and SPLIT.<br />
5) Once the ring is clear of mobs, the RT stands again and repeats.<br />
6) Before every boss, and sometimes after as well, a CH/Gain Mana will cast on raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">don't die on any ring AT ALL, on certian ones, even not carrion it seems a death = two adds. <br />
<br />
and don't think about rezing up and AEing them after a wipe, they are immune to stun =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NorokFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the flurry drakes are probably the only real semi-difficult part of the ring cuz they can drop you fast if you're not prepared... also be careful with the large splitters. you need some crazy DPS to get them all dead before the next wave so don't be afraid to offtank one or two while you wait for the flurry drakes to spawn and finish them up after the flurries are dead. if you don't you could get caught off guard and it wont be pretty. Vulak himself is such a wuss its not even funny... we had a wizard tank him last time, for the entire fight :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i mean the actual ring is killed regularly by 22 person pickup guilds on weekends then Vulaak himself, from what i hear on other servers friends do the same. Vulaak himself was never &quot;hard&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">don't think about rezing up and AEing them after a wipe, they are immune to stun =(<br />
<br />
You dont need to be able to stun to do AE.  Most elemental guilds clear the Peregrin rockskull event via AE, and thats 20+ 800ish hitting mobs that are level 66 and therefore unstunnable.</div></div><hr />
