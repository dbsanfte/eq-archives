<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cop</div><div class="date">09-11-2005, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The tests were performed by proximity aggro'ing a level 56 melee mob with the warrior.  I first found a ratio of damagehate:healinghate, a number that came out to 4.0 in defensive stance with my warrior/priest combo.  For the trials, I would perform each skill anywhere form 1 to 6 or more times, then begin healing.  At the point the priest got aggro, I summed the healing, subtracted (damage dealt * 4.0), and divided by the number of times the skill was done.  Each trial has been repeated at least 10 times, and my results were extremely consistent.  This is primarily useful as a guide to relative hate values.<br />
<br />
This is the post's third iteration.  Data has been retested thoroughly and updated as of the 1.7 patch on the test server.<br />
<br />
If you see an errors please point them out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Assumptions<br />
 All healing spells create the same hate per point healing. Crudely confirmed before tests.<br />
 Hate does not decay over time. Observation suggests this holds true.<br />
 Initial hate is negligible (a 50 point heal pulls aggro)<br />
<br />
Findings<br />
 They fixed shield slam!  Before 1.7 the innate hate value worked out to around 200, it is now closer to 1000.  See its entry for the test results as of the 1.7 test patch.<br />
 The damage done by skills (such as the 450-550 of shield slam) incurs hate equal to normal melee damage. Each skill has a set amount of hate attached (I call it &quot;innate&quot; hate) when the skill lands on a mob.  The existance of this &quot;innate&quot; hate is determined mainly through crits.  A heroic strike crit, for example, will do (innate hate+damage) worth of hate, not (2*total hate).<br />
 Cleave has extra hate attached to it much like heroic strike.<br />
 Whirlwind, Mortal Strike, and Bloodthirst have no innate hate.<br />
 Piercing howl is absolutely zero (or an immesurably low amount of) hate.<br />
 Sunder armor is the same amount of hate per application, regardless of how many sunders are already on.  The same is true for demoralizing shout and thunderclap.<br />
 The sunder armor debuff seems completely independent of the hate it generates.  Hate does not decrease when the debuff wears off and, as mentioned above, multiple applications, even beyond the stackable limit, will give just as much hate as the first.<br />
 Shield bash damage is independent of the innate hate it produces, as with other skills.  Thus, shield bash crits only produce hate equal to the extra 44 or 45 damage.<br />
 Heroic strike is a surprisingly high amount of hate, and has very acceptable efficiency with talents, against low armor, and with a fast weapon.<br />
 The shield block/revenge combo is only marginally better for hate generation than sunder armor (with talents). The exception is that shield block (with talents) often forces two consecutive revenge openings, and the mitigated damage is an obvious bonus.<br />
 Shield slam was about 200 innate hate in 1.6.  It is close to 1000 now.<br />
 Skills and attacks create roughly 1.65 times more hate in defensive stance than in battle stance.<br />
<br />
Notes<br />
 No number is exact.  This is more of a loose guide.<br />
 I was very careful and methodical in my tests. Overhealing and other interfering factors were kept to a minimum (hopefully zero!).<br />
 All attacks were done by a warrior with defiance and in defensive stance unless otherwise noted.<br />
 The warrior has improved shield bash and does not have any level of improved revenge.<br />
 All healing was done by a holy/disc priest with the 20% threat reducing talent and inspiration (which I have determined to be aggro-free).<br />
 With this setup, tests were performed beforehand to determine the healing/damage hate ratio. 1 point of damage = 4.0 points of healing = 4.0 hate <br />
 Hate per point of rage does include damage.<br />
 There is a margin of error, but I tried to minimize it as much as possible. The primary source of error is the fact that the minimum healing increment is 52.<br />

<br />
<br />
Final words<br />
Shield slam is very effective in its improved form, especially in raid situations where rage is hard to spend.  Revenge is best used whenever possible, as any warrior could have told you before.<br />
<br />
Although it may be unrelated to this thread, protection warriors need a tanking edge of more than 10% armor. Managing hate is the only thing protection warriors have a clear advantage in, but honestly, in the raiding game any warrior can hold aggro just fine.  I came up with the idea of removing anticipation and replacing it with a high-tier protection talent that adds 33% to defense from items, but...well, that probably won't happen.<br />
<br />
Certain skills like shield slam heavily favor low armor targets. The skill is immensely more useful on a fully sunderered or naturally low armor monster.<br />
<br />
And finally, note that the 4.0 healing to damage ratio is only useful for a protection warrior in defensive stance with a priest that has the -20% threat talent. That number is more of a reference point for measuring everything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone who helped me make corrections and adjustments along the way, especially Greysen and Olona.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: P.S. Since your original tests, there have been some anectodal comments about hate being variable based on when someone enters combat (stuff like 1700 damage needed to out-aggro 1000 damage). Is it safe to assume the relative timing of each trial in your tests was pretty consistent? Have you observed this &quot;time joining fight affecting hate&quot; phenomenon yourself?<br />
<br />
P.P.S. Have you had a chance to check out the (very techincal) discussion of your results over at the Lurker Lounge? link (http://www.lurkerlounge.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6293)</div></div><hr />

I don't think that makes this anywhere nearly invalid, however it does reduce it to something more of an &quot;aggro snapshot&quot; of this particular level mob, using his aggro and healing methods.  You may not be able to show exact values useable for all mobs with this, but it definetely shows their values in relation to one another.  I doubt cop would've posted consistant results if they weren't. ^^</div></div><hr />

I don't think Cop could generate the quantity of tests required to post these results without at least inadvertently getting fairly consistent in the pacing of the tests. As long as the methodology between trials was consistent, the relative skill vs. skill performance is definitely valid, and definitely appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celandro</div><div class="date">10-10-2005, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been meaing to post here regarding this.<br />
<br />
The major flaw I see in these numbers is that they disregard the effects of crits, deep wounds, impale, flurry, bonus attacks from sword spec, etc.  All of these additional sources of dps increase the agro generated from damage abilties. (Aside: mortal strike and bloodthirst numbers for offtanks would be useful.)<br />
<br />
The attacks affected by this ignoring Impale are:<br />
Revenge : cheapest way to trigger deep wounds/flurry, minor hate bonus on crits<br />
Shield Slam : most expensive way to trigger deep wounds/flurry, huge hate bonus on crits<br />
Sunder Armor : None. However, increases hate of all other attacks and crits.  Should always have 5 up<br />
Shield Bash : Second cheapest way to trigger deep wounds/flurry, extra 45 damage from crits<br />
Heroic Strike : No change in deep wounds/flurry, extra 138 damage from crits<br />
Cleave : If it hits 2 targets, far better than heroic strike. Extra attack can trigger deep wounds/flurry. <br />
<br />
Mortal Strike/Bloodthirst : Both expensive ways to trigger deep wounds/flurry. Crit agro can approach crit shield slam. Agro is highly dependent on gear and scales with gear more than any other ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">10-10-2005, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note about Revenge. I find (anecdotal, I realize) that a good helping of dodge/parry/block skill mods and talents make it pop fairly regularly without needing to use shield block. Very handy earlier in a fight and hey, it's mitigation/evasion. Win-win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cib</div><div class="date">10-11-2005, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a little confused with the wording of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sunder armor debuff seems completely independent of the hate it generates. Hate does not decrease when the debuff wears off and, as mentioned above, multiple applications, even beyond the stackable limit, will give just as much hate as the first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does this mean that 1 sunder armor application, being 1050 hate, is that same as 6 applications, meaning the total would be 1050 hate?  Or do es the hate of sunder continuely stack, no matter the number of applications?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">10-11-2005, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It continually stacks on each successful Sunder.<br />
<br />
Generally after 5 though you just hit it every now and then to keep it active.  It will continue to add hate if you continue to spam it.  It just does zero damage.<br />
<br />
I usually start HSing at that point so I can contribute some damage in the process.  Though admittedly, I have improved HS and not improved Sunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-11-2005, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it means that the hate of &quot;sunder armor&quot; is attached to the hit and not to the effect (the icon that appears on the mob). So if the icon deappear you won't loose the aggro that you have built with the &quot;sunder armor&quot; attacks, samely, the effect is actually sbdivised into five level, but the aggro isn't linked to them either since it isn't linked to the effect at all.<br />
<br />
So it means that if you apply &quot;sunder armor&quot; once you will have 1050 hate, if you apply it twice you will have 2100 hate, and if you apply it ten times then you will have 10500 hate (even if latter five will overight the first five in the effect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">10-11-2005, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do both.<br />
<br />
Since the 1.7 patch, you can buffer heroic strikes to fire in between repeated sunders.  Was a lot easier to fire off big crit heroic strikes when I was using a 2.5 speed weapon, but lately, since I switched to a 1.9 speed weapon, its a bit trickier to keep Heroic Strike buffered in, but its that much more aggro that I'm building so thats always a plus.<br />
<br />
Gone are the days where I have oodles of rage, but no idea what to do with it all.  Even Arms specced, if I'm not careful, I can fire off enough abilities to overtake our protection tank's aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok maybe not as cool (or intstant) as beta taunt was but its definatly a warrior &quot;I WIN&quot; button once you have 5 sunders on the mob.</div></div><hr />

Was doing an UBRS run and some other warrior kept taking aggro off me with his Silent Fang.  This was after I'd been slapping sunder, revenge, etc on the mob for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I pulled my own Silent Fang out of my bag and all my problems disappeared.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't HS for quite as much, and have to be a lot more careful of my pace, but the new 1.8 buff to fast weapons definitely is nice.</div></div><hr />
