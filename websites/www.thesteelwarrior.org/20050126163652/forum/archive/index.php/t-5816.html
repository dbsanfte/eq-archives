<br />
 That said, I'm not a big fan of using FB shields, but those weapons should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yes .. and would either combos (GBoS or OSoW + anger) plus the shield suffice for aggro on hard ldon runs where extra ripostes are annoying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT + yak holds enough agro at that level, tho the DPS is kinda sucky.<br />
<br />
GBoS (with yak) + CHSD with Weapon Affinity 2 holds some kick ass agro tho =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i know that GSoT + yak will hold aggro ... hell a GSoT will hold aggro without the yak.<br />
<br />
<br />
what i want to know is .. will GreatBlade of Storms (14/18 1hs with innate force strike proc) with an added anger3 be sufficient for aggro tanking bosses in PoP, LDoN, Velious, Luclin, as well as trash mobs while offtanking for raids etc ... or would i need to be duel wielding for more procs?<br />
<br />
if i CAN hold aggro just fine with that setup ... it would, imo, be better than simply using a 2hander aggro weapon (higher ac and hps/stats) or duel wield (less ripostes).<br />
<br />
but if its not good enough .. what kind of weapon would suffice for aggro with a shield ... i know lots of high end warriors use auged-BF + shield  or auged-DBoTW + shield for tanking heavy hitters and/or trash mobs in elementals etc.</div></div><hr />

Those that have really weren't impressed. Most people don't want to give up the extra procs and DPS of DW or the DPS and lessened procs of a 2 hander for a shield. What I would suggest is letting your guild know what you're trying to do, and just go test it for yourself. I'd suggest it isn't worth it, but that's only from what I've read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is possible to tank mobs with your GBoS auged with Anger III and the Stormrider shield.  The question you and your raid will have to ask though if it is worth throttleing the raid back that much cause believe me, you will see a noticeable drop in aggro.  I see it every time a warrior in my guild gets one of those shields and tries tanking with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GroovinFV</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how about an aegis of earth/stormrider carapace with an anger3 aug'd bloodfrenzy?  that should be like 5 procs a minute avg...<br />
<br />
anyone know if anyone is doing this/has tried it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what zynth said...<br />
<br />
personally ive tanked everything in Velious, Luclin (up to Aten), and PoP right up to pre-elementals with a DW setup and didn't get too f'ed up from ripostes....so I can just about safely say if you're getting jabowned DW-ing in Luclin on down you really don't belong in PoP yet.<br />
<br />
I'd keep DWing to ensure aggro is solid until you get a good rythmn. Than maybe try some FB krap out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Anger 3 aug'd GBoS with SC does work for tanking.  My guild's MT used that in certain situations (heavy hitters and situations where healers peeled off to heal off tanks) with no issues.<br />
<br />
I have an Anger 3 aug's Hategiver and will do the same, it works fine.<br />
<br />
You may have aggro issues over a long fight but just make people aware and you should be ok.</div></div><hr />
