<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In this thread about DPS AAs <br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6770<br />
<br />
Some suggestions for the poster about what to get next for AA's came up.  He doesn't have AE Taunt yet and a lot of people listed that as the #1 AA for him to get next.<br />
<br />
I wanted to chime in my 32 coppers worth, but rather than derail a good discussion about DPS AA's, I thought I'd kick off a new thread. <br />
<br />
As for myself, I got AE Taunt as soon as I could.  I basically followed the &quot;cookie cutter&quot; AA path and now at 124 AA (defensive all done, grunting out the GoD aa's /cry), I have a hard time remembering life without AE Taunt.<br />
<br />
It is definately an awesome ability to have in my bag of tricks.  Allow me to list some of my better uses for AETaunt:<br />
<br />
Single Group<br />
1. The shit hits the Fan (for example a 4 pull on Hard LDoN).  You have Crowd Control (Enchanter, Bard) but your group WILL probably die before they can get locked down.  <br />
<br />
AETaunt, followed by FORTITUDE (or Furious if they are all facing you) + hotkey that says &quot;I HAVE AGRO FROM AE TAUNT ~ REGROUP AND LET'S DO THIS!!!&quot; allows you to hold all the critters at bay for 15 seconds.  <br />
<br />
You know what, a good CC guy can probably lock down 2 of them in that time, and once Fortitude is over, you can probably tank 2 by turning on defensive long enough for the 3rd to get locked down, rooted, slowed or otherwise mitigated.<br />
<br />
Guess what, you just saved a wipe. T3h Win!<br />
<br />
2. Overagro (Usual pull happens, maybe an add, but long and the short of it, someone besides you has agro and even with /shield they will probably bite it.. np, just AE Taunt for a guaranteed agro)<br />
<br />
Guess what, you just kept your group mate from dying. T3h Win! <br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Setting<br />
1. All time best use of new discipline timer splits - the tank switch.<br />
Your MT dies, your ST dies, a few other peeps are dying along the way, wipe could happen but someone has to get on that bitch ass mob NOW or its nekked party at the GY time!<br />
<br />
AE Taunt<br />
Furious (Fortitude if there are other mobs that may hit you from behind)<br />
Incite (get an agro lead on anyone else who may be hitting mob)<br />
Hotkey /rs AE TAUNT!!! I have agro on &gt;&gt; %t &lt;&lt; HEAL MY ASS NOW!!!<br />
<br />
Pray that enough healers are alive and awake to switch the ch chain over to you and then proceed to tank mr. bitch ass mob down for t3h win!<br />
<br />
<br />
2. In a zone without a Grave Yard (Vex Thall for example).  Raid about to wipe? Bunches of mobs in camp? <br />
<br />
When the raid leader starts calling for clerics to camp their asses out, you can help buy them time by doing the same as #1 above for the group setting.  <br />
<br />
AE Taunt<br />
Fortitude<br />
<br />
Hope you did it at the right time to buy some time to get a cleric out.  Hey you are going to die anyway, if you can contribute to a successful recovery, especially when faced with the possibility of a wipeout that leads to a coffin using, corpse summoning, go home no phatty loots for you kinda wipe, then that is a good thing, perhaps even t3h win!<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, sure, maybe you could pull some of that off with just normal taunt, but normal taunt doesn't work worth jack on red con boss mobs (in my experience).  So, don't neglect AE Taunt when considering your AA line up.  It is, t3h win!!!</div></div><hr />

I've used it on several occasions to get us evaced out of a bad situation or just to give the CCer time to get the adds under control.  It's still definitely one of the top AAs to get, IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny, before the aggro changes I used AE taunt more than anything else for taunting a single mob when I couldn't get aggro.  Now I use it much more often for it's actual intended purpose....taunting multiple mobs.  I  use it a lot in LDoN and events like the mud ring where lots of mobs spawn and I want to keep them off of the clerics for a few seconds until the CC people can get them under control.  Very rarely need it to get aggro on a single mob anymore though.  Still a great AA, but not as crucial as it used to be.  I have moved hastened instigation way down on my AA list, because I just don't use AE taunt as often as I used to.  Still something no tank should be without though, and I would still advise getting as soon as you can, especially if you raid or do LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is good as a Sec Tank when the MT goes down, I had that happen on Inny, MT went down, I AETed and Incited and jumped in :)<br />
<br />
Just as an example of a single mob scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know.  I am 2nd tank a lot, and lately it seems like my problem is living long enough for the CH chain to switch more than getting aggro.  If I'm using my BoW, which I usually am if I'm 2nd tank, I usually wind up being 2nd on the list without AE taunt, and my biggest problem is realizing I have aggro and getting fortitude off before I am dead.<br />
<br />
Perhaps using a low aggro weapon and AE taunt would work better on real hard hitters, but usually being #2 on the aggro list as 2nd tank is pretty desireable.  The example is a good one though, and absolutely no tank should be without AE taunt if they are expecting to tank on a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of this, I would rather be number 6-10 on the list of Agro while the MA is up, and when he dies Hit AET and fort, then switch into my agro weaps while yelling JAKLE HAS AGRO ON %T!! 10 times while the clerics get set up.<br />
<br />
If a couple nukers die during that transition, it is far better than not having the SA when you need them :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My way of looking at it Brutul is if you can't survive till the CH chain starts landing consistant heals on you then you're not the 2nd tank, you're a stop gap for the 2nd tank.  Since there exists a position called 'Stop Gap for 2nd Tank' I'd rather someone *OTHER* then me be in that position.  So on 'hard raids' I normally use pet weapon from fire and a shield w/DBoW on cursor.  If MT goes down I'll get into the position, make sure CH chain is firing on me, THEN hit AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess I am going to slightly modify the order of importance for my next AAs. Luckily, I finished the last of the tanking AAs last night. My new order will be<br />
<br />
AET<br />
WA2<br />
SE3<br />
PD2/3<br />
Strurd2<br />
PP5<br />
<br />
Then I can start working on the fun ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ernie id switch furious to fortitude, flurry hits through furious and on alot of mobs that can be devastating if he flurries on you before the cheal rotation is up, whereas youlle never have to worry about this with fortitude. unless you wanna change from furious to fortitude every time you go against a flurry mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">need to find that ablative armor thing to quote.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the new &quot;Health of Target's Target&quot; window, you no longer have any excuse for wondering whether you are the next on the hate list when tank #1 goes down, nor is there any excuse for wondering what tank #1's health is like at any given moment.  When tank #1 dies, the HoTT will show you who's next before the mob gets around to swinging again.  It is not necessary to take damage before seeing that you need to hit Alt-3 or whatever your fortitude shortcut is.</div></div><hr />
