<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">okay, i don't get this mob.  Actually I don't get his adds, the animated swords.  We tried him with what should have been massive overkill.  I've heard of people kiting the swords, but we had so many people we thought, screw it, let's just add tank the swords.<br />
<br />
It didn't work.  It didn't work at all.  Twice.  I was MT, not add, so I don't know exactly what happened, but the add tanks said that no matter what they did, they couldn't seem to keep aggro on the animated swords.  The damn things ping ponged to healers no matter what, and after awhile the healers died.  <br />
<br />
Tagrin has an AE, but it wasn't enough to put the healers at low health.  And hell, I was MT and the healers didn't even heal me much.  They got aggro and died.  So I don't see how they got aggro.  Is there something screwy with these swords that causes regular add tanking not to work?  I've never heard of that before.  /boggle<br />
<br />
It was strange.  And sad.  Wiping with overkill... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my guild and i usually do him with 3 groups. 1 or 2 CoD pets. 3 clerics, a decent tank.  mez or root/park the swords.  i've even kited the Elite that is next to tagrin during the fight....once snare lands, just kite him around the lava</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The swords might memwipe themselves.  This is something you'll have to get accustomed to as you move beyond Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're using an FD/fade class to pull Tagrin, FD him just outside his room.  Swords spawn (at least some of them do) even when Tagrin paths back and they stay up.  There will be 5 swords the entire time Tagrin is alive, ie; killing a sword makes another one spawn and obviously that's bad.  At any rate, the only tough part is the swords.  You can lock them down via mez  and then win.  They're summoned, somewhere around level 55/56.  Enchanters can charm.  Magicians can charm.  Bards can charm.  The best is having a raid of like 10 and watching all 5 swords beat the piss out of Tagrin.  We've done this with as few as 8 people, not even close to vt/ele stuff.  Clear the room, leaving the wraith at the front left corner (front being closest to you, as you enter the forge room).  Kill it when everyone is ready to go. Pull Tagrin to just outside his room to get rid of the elite add, get your CC to lock stuff down BEFORE trying to charm anything.  Tank Tagrin in the corner you just killed the wraith in.  If your melee are using max melee range, they'll be out of AE.  If they're getting hit by it, step out and call for a heal.  Errrm, and enchanters can use Glamour of Kintaz to save on mana if they really want to, as opposed to sleep/bliss that they've got up on the way.  Grats on the spoils of victory, wave to the lonely elite guard in Tagrin's room as you click the zone out = )</div></div><hr />
