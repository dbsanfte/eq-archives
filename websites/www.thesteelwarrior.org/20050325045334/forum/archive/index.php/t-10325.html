I'm not sure how they are doing it,(plz, if you know how, do NOT post it here) but it's pretty lame.  Just kinda wanting to get this out in the open so hopefully it'll be fixed.</div></div><hr />

I'm not talking about the Princess respawn. ;p  Or Prince for that matter.. same thing happening with King.  Anyway, yea one-groupable.. from what I'm hearing now, soloable by the right class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope but MPG Trial of Foresight is still being exploited too. I love the new encounters which require a bit more thought vs sheer healing/numbers but they do seem to be more exploit prone :(<br />
<br />
Don't see a reason to play a game (something you do by choice) just to cheat through it</div></div><hr />

Course this could be false as when has a gm been around.</div></div><hr />

I think Chailak of Feratha have been soloed by a necro in a wall :)</div></div><hr />

But I'd find it highly interesting as to how they could unlock the queen, AND avoid the mobs that ae for 5k.  Have you actually seen this done?  Knowing the encounter, I could see a very slim, very small, extremely small possibility of it happening.</div></div><hr />

One group sploiting queen would take a long time i bet.</div></div><hr />

Trust me, it's being done somehow.  That's why it's an exploit... they aren't killing them correctly ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other night we were raiding Queen, and had pull the 3 left side Princesses.(Other 3 were still up). and Queen became active, but all she did was summon people to her throne and kill them.. Never happened before, hasn't happened since. Any clues?</div></div><hr />

As long as the mob is 55+ and you do atleast 1 damage to it the exp and corpse is yours.</div></div><hr />

OH WAY TO JINX ME!  The goat form of Tunat slaughtered me without mercy just last night ;(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all.  Maybe upwards of four guilds (probably more like two) would have a chance to abuse it once before she was perma-killed on all servers until it was fixed, the same way they killed the adventure merchants on bluebie servers that got PvP server gear.  Worst case scenario is she dies through exploit ONCE on each server (or one more time for some servers).<br />
<br />
Or, people can /bug report it and it will sit in the queue until someone reads it and puts it on a schedule of things to investigate while the same people abuse the exploit every repop for a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Let's be realistic, shall we?  They may not have the best CS department in the world, but their response time to highly abusable bugs is VERY fast, once it is widely known.</div></div><hr />
