<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabasher</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have recently aquired 100k (actually 80 but selling all on rogue will equal 100) and I'm wondering what to buy to twink my lvl 1 troll warrior. This is what I have in mind : Fungi tunic ~50k, SBoZ ~30k, no idea for secondary, and a bunch of hp gear. I wanna get one weapon for each skill excluding 2hb. I want to raise them to max so I will be able to be a good warrior instead of just piercing and 1hs like my rogue =/ Any suggestions on what armor to buy and which weapons to buy with that money source will be appreciated. Also, I'm planning on soloing or duoing with a cleric most of the time so keep that inmind...Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol excluding 2hb and maxxing everything else does not make you &quot;a good warrior&quot;... quite the contrary. Buy yourself a 30/40 Sarnak battle hammer or whatever it is, should be 50pp tops, and keep 2hb maxxed. Keep everything maxxed.<br />
<br />
As for what to buy, /shrug other ppl can help you there</div></div><hr />

<br />
DEFINITLY keep your 2hb maxed...All Hail thee, Trunceon of Doom.  You will learn to love it.  That will be the only way to effectively partner at higher levels, the slow proc it has on it is god.<br />
<br />
Hell...100k...anybody else remember the days when that was a lot of plat?  The only droppable upgrades I can get are like 50k+ on my server.<br />
<br />
Personally, you are thinking too big in the items you are buying imo.  That's already 80k yer chunkin' out.  Good items though.  If you are getting those 2 items, you are already down to 20k to spend.  You NEED haste.  And for haste, there is always the trusty RBG (about 20k on my server).  There is 3 items, and that is 100k.  Don't do that.<br />
<br />
Get yourself a set of Crustacean Shell Armor (Crusty for short).  It's definitly not horrible, and has some great HP.  A full set should cost you less than 2k.  98k to go.  Haste...get an RBG.  78k left.  Rings / Earings:  Velium Fire Wedding Rings.  A pair of those should probably be less than 1k.  Get a Pair of Mosquito Leg Earrings.....<br />
<br />
Actually.  I figured it would be easier to just make a Magelo and show what you can get for less than 100k, and still be good.  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=733033.<br />
<br />
With this gear set up, you should have roughly 30k leftover.  Get some more weapons / utility gear.  Sarnak Battle Hammer ... Bloodpoint ... Embalmers Skinning Knife ... Truncheon of Doom ...  Frost Bringer ... Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate ... Goranga Spiked Club (easily find rotting in Maiden's Eye...not sure if people even hunt there anymore).  You should still have about 15k left over now.  SAVE IT.  You should EASILY be set for gear until you start getting Thurg Armor / HoT armor.  I made this warrior as a dwarf, wasn't sure what you wanted or not.  If you plan on making Ogre / Barbarian, make sure your Deity is Rallos, and you can substitute alot of that armor for Fierce Heraldic once you hit lvl 45.<br />
<br />
Thank you for giving me sumpthin' to do for 15 minutes...I'm bored =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bractos</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would personally go with the fungi.  unless you really are going to have that cleric with you a lot, then you wont really need it too badly.   You will indeed need a haste item,  SCHW, and FBSS are cheap,  if you want a little more haste and dont mind blowing some of your cash go for the RBG, or a Silvery belt of contention.    <br />
<br />
To save some cash on weapons look at mainly Damage Delay.  Ignore the proccing weapons because you wont be proccing most of them until you hit the high 40's low 50's (dont most kunark weapons not proc till 51?  trunchean, bloodpoint etc).     Good Damage delay for cheap are weapons like sebillite croaking dirk (10/18 for around 4-5k)  Lamentation/defiance or the velium blades out of DN that have just dam/delay and no stats and sell for very low prices (you can get an 11/21  for like a  K).   <br />
<br />
2hs  Hands fricken down,  Buy a  REAVER.   These damn things are 40/40 with saves  and NO LEVEL RESTRICTION.   They go for about 5k on my  server because they used to be non magical.  well they were made magical and apparently noone has caught on and they still sell for half the price of inferior damage delay 2handers.<br />
For 2hb,  get a velium brawl stick they come in various damage/delays but all of em are more than adequate to twink out with and once again you can equip it at level 1.   <br />
<br />
Armor wise, dead on with the Crusty armor.  Very inexpensive and good stats.   get some  6/65's for rings (later on you will want valorium rings of gallantry),  grab a couple silver chitin bracers  if you have 10k to spend  otherwise just grab some bracers with Good AC.    For your backslot (unless you blow some cash on a seb beserker cloak as your haste)  pickup something with some good ac like a seahorse cloak or a cloak of pernicity (little expensive but has some really nice stats).        There are not that many good droppable neck items out there to buy,  I usually just go with spider fur collars on most twinks,  you might be able to find something slightly better for a lot more platt.<br />
<br />
<br />
More or less a lot of the stuff you will be able to get is dependent on that big fungi purchase.  If you get one, you will need to keep it low on the rest of your stuff.  If you dont get one you will definitely need that cleric partner otherwise your going to go nuts waiting to heal.  An iskar ceremonial BP is a good compromise for only 6k or so if you want something for the times you dont have the cleric on and still be able to recover quicker (just buy lots of bandages or one of those gnome bandage makers, dont get the dumb skinning knife,  youll find yourself taking more damage than its worth trying to get the damn thing to proc).<br />
If you dont buy the fungi you will be able to buy a nice fat haste item with stats and maybe  that swiftblade.  <br />
<br />
Really it is very inexpensive to twink out a melee if you know what to look for.  AC is king, and you dont want anything that is too slow weaponwise so you can keep those stats maxed.  Especially till you hit your 30's and the damage caps on your weapons start going away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">don't get fungi get ikky. for the first 25 with your kinda gear thats all you'll need. next get some good weapons nothing 15k+. the best warrior isn't decked out in two spots but all around good for gear.look into champs/ss mq's. clattering bone neck. 35hp earrings crystal spider eyes. 2 65hp rings or valor your choice.weapons:jarsath trident, savage stone axe, guard captains mallet, truncheon of doom, kunzar kujuch, tae ew longsword. that'll be 18k at max. with ikky and all that other stuff (excluding mq's) 30k<br />

94k cloak: if you got a rbg for 15k then hiero or percenity. if not then get maelstrom. you could go the CoF/CoCW then putrid belt of the rotten hide but you might need more pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabasher</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually - the cleric is out. So now im looking at pure solo till 30 then its OT till 40ish then DL till 46 then planes. I'm going to be MT most all of the time - I'm going to need good HP gear at around 35. Its going to be fungi, hp gear, and all different sorts of weapons till then. Once i get 35-40 im ditching fungi and prolly getting fierce heraldic bp (15k) or cobalt (30k) So - i know what im getting pre-40 what bout post-40...btw he is lvl 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, Jabasher, seems even though we give you advice, you have your mind set on what your going to do, even though people tell you differently.<br />
<br />
do what you want with your cash, what we say isnt gonna sway you anyway.  Learn the hard way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as far as backs and necks go, the Clattering Bone Necklace (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7424) is pretty cheap on my server (like 1-2k) and Cloak of the Maelstrom (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3998) doesn't suck for around 3k.  Other than that I agree, go with the Crusty to start out, with only 10k to spend you wanna get the most bang for your buck and hps&gt;all.  As far as the Fungi goes.....Fungi is a bag item.  You want a BP with AC and HPs, get an embalmers skinning knife or a bandage press and BW up to 50% and pull another damn mob.  The Fungi isnt' worth it's price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just made a ranger twink.  He uses a wavecrasher and an ornate sword of the general.  These would also make good pre-55 warrior weapons.  I soloed very easily from level 1 to 31 using these (about 3 days played).<br />
<br />
Wavecrasher is 9/19, has a 20 percent slow, has a 200 DoT, and procs at level 1.  Costs under 15k on my server.  Main hand only.  The DoT is a death sentence for most mobs under level 10 and the slow helps a lot.  This sword is good to level 55 or so and helps hold agro.<br />
<br />
Ornate sword of the general is a no drop 10/18 sword that drops off a level 55 unslowable mob in Echo.  A solid group of level 60+ can kill him in a few minutes.  Use a warrior as tank and have him/her use defensive and its a relatively easy fight as long as you split him off from adds.  Very good off hand weapon to go with a wavecrasher until you can get better.<br />
<br />
A velium black saphire neclace has 65 hp and is around 750 plat.  It is a lot of hit points for the amount it costs and it is pretty easy to find them in the bazaar since they are player made.  <br />
<br />
You might also want to consider multiquesting some Champion or Myrmidon armor, especially the Myrmidon gauntlets which have 90 hit points on them.  You need ally faction but you can get ally to Coldain and  Claws of Veshan in a few days while high levels kill giants for faction at the fort in GD--just take lots of arrows and practice archery from a safe distance.</div></div><hr />
