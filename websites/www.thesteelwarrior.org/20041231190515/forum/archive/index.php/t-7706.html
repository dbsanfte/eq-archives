<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A long time ago, Sony broke dots.  Remember when they had critical spells bugged for a short amount of time and the caster got crazy aggro from dd's?  Well critical dots have been doing the same for ages and it just doesnt get shit for attention, and I'm tired of it.  I /feedback and /bug it every time I'm online but I'm convinced that does no good.<br />
<br />
How in the hell do you deal with this?  One of my friends I play eq with has a necro, 600 something aa, etc etc, and he just cant use his dots anymore unless he FD's and just stays there.  Real example, happens over and over and over again:<br />
<br />
Mob inc to camp, enchanter mezzes it, tashes, + slow.  I taunt till taunt works, start attacking and hit incite.  Fight for a while till anger3 goes off a couple times, necro buddy doesnt have a pet, casts ONE spell (horror) and things are still working fine.  The very instant that a critical goes off, the mob runs to the necro.  Every time.  No, the necro never sits down.  I'm usually on the phone with him and he announces crit dots hits and we just watch the mob run to him.<br />
<br />
We goof around in the sewers alot and he basically cant cast dots anymore unless he wants to tank, there is jack shit I can do to keep the mob from running to him.  DD's for necros arent exactly very powerful nor efficient, we'd like to do what we've been doing forever, load up as many dots as we can while I still maintain aggro.  It used to be that around the 5th or 6th dot is when we started walking a fine line on me being able to hold aggro without him FD'ing, but now it's one lousy crit dot.<br />
<br />
He cant undo all the aa's he spent on crit dots so what else can we do?  Sony doesnt seem one bit interested in fixing it.  Neither of us are guilded and we cant imagine what chaos this causes when fighting really hard raid encounters.   What do your guild necros do about it, cast one dot and lay there FD?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">06-21-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i played a necro to 65 with 340+ aa and yes there is an issue with crit dots, but its not so broken you cant cast on raids or in xp, thats just crap. yes we use to be able to lay in horror, fp, pyro, splurt, dark plague and saryns before needing to FD to add in blood of thule, and now we cant. waaaaahhhh. if you add up those dots, its a sick amount of damage per tick even without crits. then factor in that each dot can crit on each tick(yes i know crits arent that consistent or often-just saying the chance is there) and you have the potential to do a phenominal amount of damage to mobs, this should pull some extra aggro /shrugs<br />
<br />
its not like he cant fd, and a good fd will completely clear aggro so his past dot damge is irrelevant. im guessing sony got tired of the fact that creative spell stacking orders eliminated the need for a fd til almost an entire load of dots was stacked. ie the necro set up to do large amounts of damage virtually risk free</div></div><hr />

Bro, what you are saying would make sense if it was after a few dots, but he specifically said this was happening with ONE dot, that's not fair and sounds like a bug or another stupid SoE over-compensation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read a post on the Sony boards a while back where they mentioned that in checking DoT spells were causing more aggro then they thought, and crits on DoT's were causing a lot more aggro then they thought, but I dont remember them saying they planned to fix it anytime soon.<br />
<br />
  Shaman have the same problems and cant FD. I know there were some that trained the GoD AA's letting DoT spells do crits and were wishing they could untrain them after because it made it so they cant use their DoT's anymore as a couple of crits get them to much aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Batem Tuhates</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/finger so and so, the necro, necro's I play with most often pull agro from me because it makes them feel good about their selves. Granted, they can tank just as well as me. =P or at least they try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrk</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That explains a few things.  Group with a necro every so often, and could never understand why the mob would beeline for him sometimes like that.  It didn't seem like he did anything in excess of what he had already been doing the whole time on other mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you just need already proccing weapons, LDoN weapons blow for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While you have made great (stat wise) tanking weapons your agro sucks.<br />
