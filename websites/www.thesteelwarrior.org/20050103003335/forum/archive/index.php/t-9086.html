He speaks of THREE pages ON DA GROUND, so IMHO, there cannot be four of them, and it should not drop from a mob. I wandered through  Dranic's Scars for few hours but still no page here...</div></div><hr />

I found page 3 on the ground as well.  If you look out from port in towards the main Dranik area, it's to the left along the wall, you'll come across a small valley like depression in the ground, it was in the center of that little valley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Page 3&quot; was just &quot;Decomposing Page 3&quot;, just like page 1 being &quot;decomposing page 1&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am guessing there's a few spawn points for each page, considering two different &quot;page 1&quot; locations. Still looking for page 2, and will try to turn in... if that doesn't work, then I'll have to find the cover, but the text is a little wierd in that while it refers to 3 pages and a cover, the ogre instructs you only to find the pages.   When i find page 2, I'll let you know.   <br />
<br />
I searched that zone far and wide, inside every building, every crevasse, everything and can't seem to find the bag with page 2 yet (or a cover).  Perhaps only 1 page spawns at a time or something, I dunno.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Korbuk Brimblade says,” Just now I had a flash of a book, or pages of a book. Just as quickly as the book was there it was split into da cover and three pages and then fell to da ground. I wonder if dat’s going to happen often. In any case, may be you should have a look around to see if you can find any pages from a book that are on da ground.

<br />
<br />
<br />
We are actually looking for 3 pages and a book cover. I suspect the Book cover is a container possibly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For non-epic warriors: the Redblade sword is probably a later part of the quest because he speaks of creating a weapon. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Korbuk Brimblade says,” Da sword was going to be made of da finest metal with a hilt dat’s handcrafted by someone I’m very close to. It was going to have my family seal engraved into do base of da blade and was to be my finest sword ever. But da plans were stolen by someone – no doubt someone who oversees everything where I was working – and I have yet to get them back. You look more than capable of recovering day plans for me. Hurry back when you’ve found dem.&quot;<br />

For Epic 1.0 Warriors<br />
- Hail Korbuk Brimblade in Dranic Scar (NW from Priest of Discord)<br />
- Search for 3 groundspawn pages in Dranic Scar<br />
- Possibly search for groundspawn cover<br />
<br />
For Non-Epic Warriors<br />
- Hail Korbuk Brimblade in Dranic Scar (NW from Priest of Discord)<br />
- Kill Overseer in PoTactics for &quot;Korbuk's Weapon Plans&quot;<br />
- Kill Drevlon in East Karana for &quot;Redblade Family Sword&quot;<br />

Didn't find any ground spawns.  Ran around for about a half hour, didn't find any pages/cover.  However, did get the loc for the branch of something-something (659.6235, 381.8977, -9.5779).<br />
<br />
I put all 6 locs into my map.  The board won't let me upload the whole map, so I copied the ground spawn lines from the text file into my &quot;level 2&quot; map file.  It should be attached.  I think you can just drop it into your everquest/maps folder, turn on level 2 map and you should have the known locs show up on your map.<br />

The book he gives you (Recounted History of War) contains teh l33t infoz, and they are as follows:<br />

Dranik's Vengeance<br />
<br />
The time of turmoil is at an end. We must strike back at the infidels who try to thin our numbers. From the west, we find the power of the ancients, and from the north we find refuge in our heritage.<br />
<br />
We have fought long and<br />
<br />
(Page 2)<br />
hard to ensure our way of life. We do not fear death, nor do we fear them. We live for the hunt and will make them pay, even if it means our own deaths. We call him Kratak Drom, the Broken One. He is a myth to our people, but clearly the myth is real.<br />
<br />
The pain he feels will be<br />
<br />
(Page 3)<br />
surreal, though. I find myself carving his name into my table at night, hoping for a chance at his neck, hoping to rinse my blade of his blood. His denial of our people will be his downfall and we will see to it that we bring him and his minions mercilessly to their knees.<br />

If I am interpreting the below quest text correctly, then it sounds to me like the Blackfall Borer will pop in Vxed.  Sounds like either a) he's surrounded with adds, or b) it's some sort of event that pops adds.<br />
<br />
I've been doing XP in Vxed over the past couple of days (mostly just hanging near the zone in area), and no named (besides the normal Vxed named) have been spotted.<br />

One thing i wonder, is if the warrior with the flag needs to be the group leader before starting the instance.  I suppose this will take a little testing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaerdon</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya guys ! ...I've been looking on this page a lot in the last few days and I see you made quite a lot of progress...i just want to add my 2cp.<br />
<br />
I've been looking for pages for approx 9-10 hours yesterday, no luck on them and the other warriors who were looking for them had no luck either, that makes me believe that the respawn time on thoses ground spawns is above 10 hours. Also, all ground spawns respawned after the patch this morning, that might be good to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
There is another spot where the cover can spawn, I dont have the loc (sorry, I set it up on my EQ map and forgot it), but I know it is at the entrance of one of the caverns on the eastern wall of the zone...the cavern that is most to the south...another cover spawns there.<br />
<br />
From the look of it, each page spawns at 3 different locations, the cover was seen at 2 different spots so far. Tonight ill be able to give more infos on exact respawn time of thoses pages.<br />
<br />
About the Blackfall Borer, yesterday i was roaming around on my druid in zone and I saw the Blackfall Borer, he was exactly where the Blackfall Ore drops and was dark blue to my 62 druid. He kicked my butt badly, I dont know if there was or wasnt a Blackfall Ore left after he poped but I already had that ore on my warrior and I hope someone will turn in ore to the ogre directly to see if we can bypass that part (yeah, I suck, I dont wanna do it with mine :P ..maybe if I see the ground spawn is up).<br />
<br />
About Vxed, by the sound of the text, it looks as if the Blackfall Borer was added to the bestiary in Vxed...the ogre says that THAT specific monster is out and roaming on Norrath (speaking about the Blackfall Borer)...and he's to be expected in Vxed. I already exp a lot in Vxed so it will be a pleasure to clean the zone and try to find that guy :).<br />
<br />
I want to confirm the page 3 drop at loc -950, -817, i got mine there.<br />
I Confirm, the cover drop at the end of the riverbed near the castle.<br />
I Confirm, the page 2 drop in the house in SW corner of the zone.<br />
I Confirm, the page 1 drop under the bridge where that elf caster girl is.<br />
I Confirm, the Blackfall ore pop at 1600, 200<br />
I Confirm, the Blackfall Borer kills a 62 druid hellah fast :P<br />
Its about all I have.<br />
<br />
Good luck guys, and keep the infos flowing.<br />

<br />
There are set locations in the zone for spawns.<br />
<br />
Only one of each piece can be up at one time at any of the locations.<br />
<br />
Once you pick up a piece, it either immediately, or on a timer, spawns another piece at one of the random locations.  This means that you could theoretically get all pieces at the same location for the ones that share locs.  It could possibly spawn a junk item placeholder or something at the groundspawn -- I don't know.<br />
<br />
The pieces are PROBABLY also on a timer.  If one is not found within xxx time, it despawns and respawns at a different location.  So you could also, theoretically, run about the zone for hours and find not a damned thing...  :eek: <br />
<br />
While this exact logic might not apply, I guarantee that it's at least partially correct in the way that they spawn, since SoE is so fond of re-using their methods all over the place.<br />

One is at zone, one is on bridge to hail mob, other is on the complete other side of zone, about the same distance from zone. Named spawns in the bend between the misguided belude creque and the hail mobs room. Killed named with war, dru, chanter, rogue. Partial slow.. max hit 1100 that I remember seeing without disc.<br />
<br />
This morning, when the server came back up after the patch, Genalen went to see all the page/cover spawn spots one after the other and they were all up...he picked up cover, page 3, page 2 and page 1 and then left...if only 1 ground spawn can be up at the same time, he was either damn lucky or its not true. Yesterday I roamed the zone for approx 10 hours and got nothing, after patch my friend got 4 out of 4 spawn. I think they just have a long respawn time.<br />

<br />
This morning I logged in and got all 4 pages plus the ore (no duplicates).  I then found yet another baggie in a 6th known location.  So either 6 pieces were up at a time, or else one of them respawned very very quickly.<br />
<br />
Only two of the known locations were empty when I looked, and both were on the route to Bloodfields, so I suspect a passerby picked them up.</div></div><hr />

1546.59, 1322.68 (right outside the castle leading to Bloodfields, underneath the tail of a static noc)<br />
-642.05, 88.40 (between two tree roots)<br />

Both of these were &quot;bags&quot; that gave me the lore message.  I think I only had pages 1, 3 and the cover, but may have had the ore as well.<br />

It's been a long day of running around Dranik's Scar.  Burned about 8 invis potions and as many mana batteries for my invis device.<br />

Oh, and in terms of respawn behavior I had spawn points that I have yet to see a bag at, some that I found that haven't respawned, and some that respawned three times in less than 10 minutes.  Not making any conclusions about mechanics of the spawns yet.</div></div><hr />

I was wondering about the logistics of setting this up. first I know you'd need a group. already together. I am wondering,<br />
<br />
Did you do the turn in and then you personally get  Vxxed Trial?<br />
<br />
Or, did you do the turn in and someone else get the trial from your group?<br />
<br />
The reason being, I wondering if it matters who gets the trial so that the named spawns in Vxxed.<br />
<br />
My second question is, if you kill Blackfall in Dranik's scar do you avoid  doing the Vxxed phase?<br />
<br />
My third question is, How tough is the named in Vxxed?</div></div><hr />

- Blackfall Blade turn in to Korbuk Brimblade in Dranic Scar<br />

- Kill Drevlon in East Karana for &quot;Redblade Family Sword&quot;<br />
- kill Shoqui the Forgotten in Hates Fury for &quot;Elegant Shank&quot; <br />

Not bad so far but the Non-Epic warriors have only a few researched steps at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Epic 1.5 and 2.0 should be the same quest.  1.5 is a halfway reward.<br />
<br />
To get 2.0 you have to get 1.5 first.<br />
<br />
So basically the discussion here is the start of 1.5 and then once its found the rest will get you 2.0.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like it is very possible that the NPC's may be picking them up, like they do/did in old world zones. So it might be wise to lay waste to monsters in the areas that they are confirmed to ground spawn at.</div></div><hr />

Only if the mob roamed over it, I doubt a static spawned overtop an item would auto-pickup.<br />

Others have already found pages on mobs so it seems to make sense, but I won't know until tonight. I might try and shakerpage the whole zone ;)</div></div><hr />

It seems to me he's talking about a destroyed portal on Kauu, &quot;...like it was on Taelosia...&quot; so I think what we're looking for is in Omens at this stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As mentioned there is a portal (with red con broken shards of it around it, non-attackable) in Walls of Slaughter.<br />
<br />
There is a red con named Girplan in the area, but I don't think that is it.<br />
<br />
If you go on top of the wall, in the there is a room just about above the portal that has a named in it.<br />
<br />
Named hit for about 800, but procs a 1500DD that seems to be unresistable. Took a group up and fight was going fine....until we got her to 90%.<br />
<br />
Then she despawned, and 6 shades of herself spawned in the room. They all seemed to be rooted, and only meleed for about 200. However, they still had the 1500DD proc. We managed to &quot;kill&quot; one before wiping, but it simply respawned.<br />
<br />
Have a few ideas, may try them out tonight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, sounds like it could be related to an epic, but seems like too hard of a mob to have to fight so soon in epic quest.   But with a name of Decrepit Hilt, sounds more of like an SK weap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have thought it were for the SK Epic, but from our storyline it really seems fitting for Karbuk's task. Maybe whatever Kimber returns will shed some light. Perhaps Kimber's returned item and the hilt to blacksmith shines it up so to speak, and that with the blade makes the Epic 1.5.<br />
<br />
Speculating at this point, but when you already have a blade and are told to kill an 'impish' mob, and we know an 'impish' mob drops a hilt, it seems like a likely match. I also doubt two epics would be that similar in storyline, being that you need to kill an 'imp-like' mob for a piece.<br />

That Guardian also has an apparent resistant to weaponry, BoW was hitting max 71 or so when we accidentally aggro'd him.  And either he has a huge regen, one of his AE's is lifetapping, or he has a bajillion hp...tanked him for a few minutes before the 2 clerics went OOM to the AE and we didn't get him to 98%.</div></div><hr />

Well the Portal  in Taelosia was exposted to lead to the plane of discord, which is all the zones in OoW. It would lead me to belive that the there would be a portal to it somewhere eles other than OoW<br />
<br />
So what where looking for is a impish creature (Impish means naughtily or annoyingly playful; &quot;teasing and worrying with impish laughter&quot;, and Syn: are implike, mischievous, pixilated, prankish, puckish).<br />
<br />
The ceature is also dark and twisted.... I would check Plane of Mischievous. OR any where else that a dark, twisted, Impish creature would most likely be</div></div><hr />

<br />
the third boreling is down the right side path from zone-in.  he is just right before crossing the bridge as if heading towards the NPC to win vxed.<br />

then when the 3 are dead, you get a zone-wide message stating that the beast is awaiting you up the hill.  so you cross the bridge and head up the hill.  soon youll get the option to break left, take the left road.  after a few mobs youll meet the borer.  nothing special about him at all.  slowed easily from what i can tell, and doesnt put out any serious dps.  he just has a bit more hp than the usual mobs.  kill him and loot the blood and youre done with vxed.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Korbuk Brimblade says,” Just now I had a flash of a book, or pages of a book.<br />
Just as quickly as the book was there it was split into da cover and three<br />
pages and then fell to da ground. I wonder if dat’s going to happen often. In<br />
any case, may be you should have a look around to see if you can find any pages<br />
from a book that are on da ground. Return to me if you find them.&quot;<br />

You now need to find 3 Lore-No Drop pages and a book cover as ground spawns in Dranic’s Scar.<br />
<br />
Warriors on the forum to have found the pages in these locations<br />
<br />
(Others believe the pages spawn at random in preset locations across the zone,<br />

look like small bags) Plus Mobs in zone seem to drop them too.<br />

-Find all 3 pages plus the cover and turn them into Korbuk Brimblade<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Those... those are da pages and da cover I saw. You don't<br />
suppose dat da two are linked, do you? What if they are, what could dat mean? I<br />
don't even know what these say! I think you should take these to a linguist to<br />
decipher them. I knew one in da abysmal sea, aboard da hulking boat, but I<br />
forget his name. I do recall dat it was a funny name, though.'<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
-Head to Abysmal sea and find Rewina Jalmoy at loc -312, 252 hand him the pages + Cover and he gives you a &quot;Recounted History of War&quot;<br />
<br />
The book mentions Kratak Drom and war over life in Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
The Dialogue goes as follows;<br />
<br />
-You say, 'Hail, Rewina Jalmoy'<br />
<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Hello NAME. What's that I see? Are you [smirking] at me?<br />
That's not very nice of you.'<br />
<br />
-You say, 'smirking'<br />
<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Well, I don't think it's very nice to laugh at someone just<br />
because of his name. I didn't pick it, you know. Go laugh at my parents.'<br />
Then upon handing in the 3x Pages + Cover;<br />
<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Oh my, what is this? Someone looking to interact with me who<br />
isn't making fun of my name?! I'm shocked! So what have you brought me, hmm?<br />
Ooo, what a collection of fine specimens! Where on Norrath did you find these?<br />
Did you find them on Norrath? Oh wordy me! I always seem to get sidetracked,<br />
but I did manage to decipher what these pages say for you. Don't be a stranger,<br />
come back and see me any time you like!<br />
<br />
Recounted History of War<br />
<br />
(Page 1)<br />
Dranik's Vengeance<br />
<br />
The time of turmoil is at an end. We must strike back at the infidels who try to<br />
thin our numbers. From the west, we find the power of the ancients, and from<br />
the north we find refuge in our heritage.<br />
<br />
We have fought long and<br />
<br />
(Page 2)<br />
hard to ensure our way of life. We do not fear death, nor do we fear them. We<br />
live for the hunt and will make them pay, even if it means our own deaths. We<br />
call him Kratak Drom, the Broken One. He is a myth to our people, but clearly<br />
the myth is real.<br />
<br />
The pain he feels will be<br />
<br />
(Page 3)<br />
surreal, though. I find myself carving his name into my table at night, hoping<br />
for a chance at his neck, hoping to rinse my blade of his blood. His denial of<br />
our people will be his downfall and we will see to it that we bring him and his<br />
minions mercilessly to their knees.<br />
<br />
(Page 4)<br />
The war will be ours.<br />
Victory over life in Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
The book's item lore identifies as &quot;An interesting story regarding the dragorn&quot;<br />
<br />
-Now Head back to Korbuk Brimblade and hand him the book;<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade grimaces in pain for a moment before opening his eyes. 'Things<br />
are getting stranger by da moment. I just had a vision of a creature dat<br />
wanders about da area below, then it went dark. I'm not sure if this creature<br />
is part of everything else, but it certainly is something we should check out.<br />

<br />
-You say, 'rock'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I was holding da rock when I had dat vision. Whatever<br />
happened to me was passed into da rock as well and I Can sense some power<br />
within da rock now. Maybe holding da rock will lead you to da creature or maybe<br />
it will lead you to something near da creature, I don't really know. You have<br />
to keep a tight grip on it though, else I don't think you'll feel da power<br />
drawing you as I did. If you do find da beast, be careful. There's no telling<br />
what dangers lay in this place.'<br />
<br />
Eventually your energy receptor will point you to a mob.... Blackfall Borer.....<br />

*** Note ***<br />
You don’t need to kill him, just pick up Blackfall ore (Magic, lore, no drop)<br />
that can be found where he spawns.<br />
The Blackfall Borer does not see through “invis spells” is a roving mob and has<br />

behind? I wonder what da story behind dat is... In any case, touching this gave<br />
me a brief glimpse of something sharp. It almost seemed like it was a blade.<br />
You should probably take this to get it looked at by a skill [smith].'<br />
<br />
-You say, 'smith'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Blacksmith, yes. She's dealt with some of da more<br />
interesting things I've needed worked on lately and I know she'll be able to<br />
help with dat ore as well. She's in Nedaria's Landing, so you shouldn't have a<br />
lot of trouble finding her. Give her da ore and these smelting plans, she<br />
should know what to do wit them from there.'<br />

-Now head to Nedaria’s Landing there is two blacksmiths there, you will hail them both until you find Korezna Orecleaver. She will say shes thirsty, give her four unstacked flask of water. She will ask you if she can help, hand her the plans and the ore and you will receive a Blackfall Blade ( No Stats)<br />
 <br />
If Korezna Orecleaver is up that means someone else spawned her with water.<br />
<br />
-Run back to Korbuk and show him the Blackfall blade;<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says ‘Somehow da creature dat left da ore has made its way back to Norrath and is tearing through da mountainsides! You have to head it off in da crumbling<br />
caverns of Vxed before it can get any further! Be careful, though. I had a<br />
vision of some of its spawn with it so you may have to take care of more than<br />
just da one creature when you get there. Now Hurry!<br />
<br />
-Now grab a group of friends, and head to Vxed. When you start Vxed three Blackfall Boreling will spawn, hunt them down, kill them and a zone wide message will appear. The Blackfall Borer will spawn deep inside the zone.  Kill him and he drops a Vial of blood.<br />
<br />
-Details<br />
<br />
The First Blackfall Boreling will spawn almost at the zone (-3250, -725). It's at that first cement patio, so you'll see him before any other mob. Appears to have LOS agro.<br />
<br />
PROCS: Ukun Chains<br />
MAX HIT: 1200<br />
<br />
The Second Blackfall Boreling is located if you take the left path from zone-in. Keep on that path. You will have the option to break left or keep going straight, stay straight. Then take the straight road until it ends and you can go left or right. To the left is a large room with a bunch of mobs, this is where the second boreling is located.<br />
<br />
The third boreling is down the right side path from the zone-in. He is just right before crossing the bridge as if heading towards the NPC to win vxed.<br />
<br />
When all three are dead, you get a zone-wide message stating that the beast is awaiting you up the hill. You then cross the bridge and head up the hill.  Soon you’ll get the option to break left, take the left road. After a few mobs you’ll meet the borer.  Nothing special about him at all. He is slowable and does not do any serious damage and seemed to have more Hps then the usual Mobs. Kill him and loot his blood.<br />
<br />
- Run back to Kurbuk and he returns it to you sealed. He will give you now two task. One is to find his barbarian friend Kimber Whitefoot reported to be seen in Everfrost. The second is to hunt down a yet to be identified mob, possibly a imp.<br />
<br />
Here is the Dialogue; <br />
<br />
-You hand him the Vial of blood;<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Dat was too close! You did a good job though and stopped dat beast before it could get too far on Norrath. We don't know what it might have been capable of otherwise. I've sealed da blood of da beast in a vial for you for da [journey]. I also got another [vision] when I took hold of da vial.'<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
- You say, 'journey?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I noticed dat da blood gave me some kind of feeling. I'm not sure whether it was da same magic dat's been giving me visions or something new, but I'd like you to take it to a shaman I knew briefly growing up. He's a friend of da Redblade family and I'm sure he'd be willing to help. Just tell him I sent you. His name is Kimber Whitefoot and you shouldn't have trouble finding him, he's a very large barbarian.'<br />
<br />
- You say, 'vision'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Da vision I had showed me an impish creature. It was dark and twisted and seemed to devour energy from da chaos surrounding us. I don't know what part it plays in this, but like everything else, I'm sure it's important. Perhaps there is another portal around dat was destroyed, like it was in Taelosia. See if you can find it and<br />
look for da creature there, then return to me whatever it may have in its possession dat we  an use.'<br />
<br />

Can anyone confirm them dropping off mobs, in DS, or in BF? I'ved killed a bunch, havent seen any drops, havent heard of anyone getting a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GrombdaBasher</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding in what i have done so far, finished the vxed part last night and went looking for Kimber Whitefoot. Found him in Everfrost and here's how it goes.<br />
<br />
Kimber Whitefoot spawns in Everfrost at 7am game time at the zoneline to halas and begins his run to permafrost. I tried hailing him and he said he couldn't stop and if i wished to speak with him i'd have to keep running with him. So i took the chance and turned in the sealed vial of blood i got back from Korbuk Brimblade, he then said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kimber Whitefoot says 'Great, wait out here for a while. I've got to make a trip into the frozen mountain of Permafrost, but I'll be out some time this evening. I should have enough time on my trek to examine the vial. I'll be back soon!'<br />
<br />
He kept running out into the tundra at this point and all the way to permafrost where he stood for a second or two and despawned. At 7pm game time he repopped and headed back to Halas. I waited till he got close to the book(portal) and hailed him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kimber Whitefoot says 'Yes, yes, you again. I had a chance to examine the vial you gave me. Quite an interesting substance, I must say. Scary though. Where did you say you found it? Nevermind, it's not important. I made a potion out of the vial, but I can feel an evil presence within. I want to be rid of it, so you can have it back. Please don't come to me with anything like that again. I'm really not into dealing with spirits of such heinous design. Good luck.'<br />
<br />
And now i have this &quot;Potion of Blackfall Spirit&quot;<br />
<br />
I went back to Korbuk Brimblade and handed it to him.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade gags as he takes hold of the potion, then quickly returns it to you. 'I had no idea such a strong presence would be coming from this after Kimber worked with it. I hope he's ok. Now dat we've taken care of dat, we can focus on the last [vision] I had.'<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I just have to figure out the Vision part.  I will add more as i figure things out.<br />
Good luck to all those with the ground spawns.<br />

<br />
Did the whole run thru with Korbuk Brimblade, he sent me on a Mission to Tactics to slay the overseer and retrieve his plans.  Which i handed to him and he gave me a big long speel *sorry didnt have logs on* About how pirates from hates fury have stolen his shank, he also gives the plans back and some xp.<br />
<br />
  The shank drops off Shoqui the Forgotten, he is in the room with Ralo the Black  and 6 adds.   Given to Korbuk Brimblade he explains his friend Kargek redblade requires assistance, and gives the shank back.  <br />
<br />
   Kargek Redblade is in east freeport, *he gives out the red scabbard if u did the first epic* and when u approach him say korbuk sent me.  He then says his precious fathers sword was stolen by a dirty little gnome named Drevlon, who resides in east karanas.  He doesnt always spawn right away so you may have to wait til its dark.<br />
<br />
When given back to Kargek he takes it and gives *Emblazoned Champion's Hilt*, which you give to Korbuk Brimblade.  Korbuk returns it *plus some xp* and says now we must go look for a smith by the name of Dardek to combine the 3 items together to forge the sword, he resides in the frozen tundra hiding with the coldain so he can sait his drunken natures or something.  *really wish i had logs on for this part*<br />
<br />
My problem is i can not find Dardek, i have searched: Iceclad ocean, eastern wastes, crystal caverns, Great divide, Thurgadin, Icewall keep, kael, wakening lands, skyshrine, cobalt scar, sirens grotto, western wastes and am going to check dragon necropolis and tov.  If i dont find him im out of ideas, and will chill in thurgadin for 1day eq time to see if i can find him.<br />
<br />
If anyone is doing this quest unepic'd and has found him, please let me know.<br />
<br />
;t tholuxe.hanobuddi i found him!, or something wonderful ;)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

It may just be really long, or have some trigger we are not aware of.  This is an epic quest after all.<br />
<br />
I've cleaned up my map file.  I don't know why it wouldn't be working for anyone - it's just a text file.  Anyway, my only advice is as follows:<br />
<br />
1.  Download a map for the zone if you haven't.<br />
2.  Overwrite draniksscar_2.txt in your maps directory<br />
3.  If that doesn't work, open your draniksscar_1.txt, copy the lines from my file and append them to the end of your file.  This will have everything on the same layer, but that isn't a huge deal.<br />
<br />
This revision of the map file has all the spawn points reported to date (including the one a few posts above).  Points preceeded with an asterisk (*) I have not verifed myself, so there may be some slop involved.  Points marked &quot;Epic GS (XXX)&quot; (i.e. no asterisk) should be very exact.<br />
<br />
I also added a triangle for the PoD's, labels for the ogre as well as the Runes turn in NPC.  Soulstone Shard and branch spawn points also included.</div></div><hr />

Also haven't gotten a page2 at all. I've spent at least 14 hours looking for this damn page and I know other warriors who've spent time looking as well on my server. It's either broken or &quot;working as intended&quot; (it only spawns right after a server up).<br />

I wouldn't care if they made these rare or ultra rare drops off the trash, but searching for those little bags is complete nonsense IMO.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brede</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... warrior here without Epic 1.0. Someone already posted here about getting to the point that Korbuk asks you to find Dardek the dwarf in velious so I'm not going to start back at the begining. <br />
<br />
I went to velious and found a blue con dwarf with no name lying down in the back bar (the one with the brew barrel after you go down the ramp near icewell). Upon hailing, his name popped up, hello Dardek Bladewright. He refuses to speak to you any further until you get him some Coldain Coffee. <br />
<br />
After some more searching, I found a new vendor behind the counter at the other major bar in Thurg (not sure on it's exact location, just look around and you'll find it). He sells generic coffee beans and talks about a special brew when you hail him. Go through the script and you end up giving him 350pp for &quot;Special Beans.&quot; Buy 3 of the generic ones too and head to the brew barrel. FYI, I am a 252 brewer and I'm not sure on the trivial of this stuff since i didn't take the time to check, this is just a quick walkthrough. Anyway, combine the 3 generic beans to get Generic Coffee Brew. Combine this with the Special Beans to make Coldain Coffee.<br />
<br />
So I ran back to Dardek and handed him the coffee. He got up and walked to the forge on the other side of thurg. Once he got there he asks what you wanted, so I handed him the shank, the hilt from Redblade, and the weapon plans, and he returned Dardek's Forged Blade, no stats, no drop. I ran back to Korbuk and handed him the sword, he thanked me and handed me back Korbuk's Blade of Mastery, warrior only, equippable in primary ala a 2HS, but no stats, looks like an Ornate Greatblade. After this, he says he has more [work] for me to do, and i followed the script until he asked for the pages. Seems this catches all the non-epic warriors up with the epiced.<br />

For those who have the epic 1.0 The next step (after we kill this imp) is likly where we will get our blade, simular to what Brede has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Went to the noc that had a page pop under his tail and killed the surrounding mobs for two cycles. Shortly before 3rd cycle a bag spawned. I picked it up too fast to see if it depoped on its own or not. (damn you lore message)  Killed the mobs again and went to check other locs. Within maybe 15 minutes came back to another bag with another noc. (lore damnit) Killed again, checked other locs, came back another noc, another bag. Left bag this time and went to a group. wandered back that way couple hours later and didnt see a bag. <br />
<br />
Could it be mobs standing on the spawns or close to it are blowing the pop when it tries? Had 3 bags pop within half an hour while killing the surrounding mobs, when I didnt see one for over 15 hours strait on Friday. Sure I'm just smoking crack or something, but this thing is driving me nuts.</div></div><hr />

Are three Blackfall Borelings suppose to spawn instantly when you start vxed? or there are some certain mobs you have to kill in order to spawn them? or is there a timing to spawn them after vxed started? i asked few trackers to track them and hasn't spawn yet<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthiele</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got another theory about the pages..<br />
<br />
What if the reason they aren't respawning very often is because a certain mob has to drop it on the ground as he/it passes by.<br />
<br />
Taking the cue from the noc that usually has a bag under his tail.  Pick up the bag, kill him, and at respawn he will often have another bag under his tail shortly after.  Kill him again, and pop, another bag.  <br />
<br />
If this is correct, a mob that paths over the spots will drop a bag at a certain point, and another bag will not be available until said mob is killed and allowed to respawn. <br />
<br />
Also supporting this theory, earlier today I found two bags, one on top of another at the under the bridge spawn location.  Both were the same I assume, but I already had them so when I ried t pick them up they poofed.<br />
<br />
I plan to try and follow a few select mobs around that tend to go near the locations in question and slaughter them after they wander by the spots to see if they drop at repop perchance.<br />
<br />
I know that the capability is there for mobs to drop things as they wander.  An example from old school would e Tovax Vmar in Qhills who drops a note by the old ruins remember that from the old Pyzjn days)  <br />
<br />
Just another possibility I suppose, and I wanted to present it to you all for some testing and thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Drevlon Knacknabber spawns in East Karanas on the opposite side of the zone , from the druid port in area, along the river, there are some hutts there and some barbarian guards. he spawns there (hes a little black gnoem bastage) and he wanders towards the gnoll obilisk down the trail (south) he then paths in a large circle, and eventually back to the hutts. He was dark blue to 67, and max hits for 658 dmg (tested this with my 51 druid, who died quickly). I could have easily soloed him after proccing slow. This gnoem drops the Redblade Family Sword (not blade, Sword).<br />
<br />
Shoqui The Forgotten does spawn in the Ralo The Black room aboard Hates Fury, off of crypt of nadox zone. His spawn timer is around 20 minutes in the room, and can spawn at any of the spawn sites in the room. Ralo is not his PH. Took me around 7 clearings of the room to get him to spawn, he was also Dark blue con to 67 and was an easy kill. He drops the Elegant Shank youll need.<br />
<br />
As we speak I am running back to the ogre in Dranik's to give him my newly farmed epic looties.. will update more later after I find the Smith ..</div></div><hr />

It is very long but I think it might help sum up this entire thread some.<br />
<br />
Text for Warriors without Epic 1.0<br />
<br />
Go to Dranik’s Scar and Find Korbuk Brimblade.  He is an ogre northwest from the port in area.  <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Korbuk Brimblade'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Well now, aren't you a meager one? Da name is Korbuk Brimblade. Have you felt anything strange lately?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I have felt something strange'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Aha, you have sensed it as well. For a while, I believed it was just me dat noticed it. Now dat you've confirmed my suspicions, I'm sure I can move forward with my [work].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'work?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Hmm, I'm not sure if I should go into any more detail. After all, we've just met and I don't know how trustworthy you really are. Listen, if you really want to know what work I'm involved with, I'll need you to run a couple [errands] for me first, just so I know you're da real deal.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'errands?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'You see, I had some things taken from me. I want to get dem back. I'm very partial to my weapons, and had some great [plans] to make a sword dat would be unmatched by any other. I thought it would be nice to start da plans with my brethren by talking to some of dem about da tactics involved in creating a sword.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'plans?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Da sword was going to be made of da finest metal with a hilt dat's handcrafted by someone I'm very close to. It was going to have my family seal engraved into da base of da blade and was to be my finest sword ever. But da plans were stolen by someone -- no doubt someone who oversees everything where I was working -- and I have yet to get them back. You look more than capable of recovering da plans for me. Hurry back when you've found dem.'<br />
<br />
Now head to the Plane of Tactics and kill The Overseer.  This will take a group, but should not be too difficult.  Loot Korbuk’s Weapon Plans.<br />
<br />
Korbuk’s Weapon Plans<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
WT: 0.1 Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Now head back to Korbuk Brimblade.  Give him Korbuk’s Weapon Plans.<br />
<br />
Now he sends you to Hate’s Fury to kill Shoqui the Forgotten. Shoqui the Forgotten does spawn in the Ralo the Black room aboard Hates Fury, off of Crypt of Nadox zone. His spawn timer is around 20 minutes in the room, and can spawn at any of the spawn sites in the room.  Ralo is not his PH.  Just keep the room clear until he spawns.  Once he spawns, kill him and loot an Elaborate Shank.  Turn in the Elaborate Shank to Korbuk.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'You found it?! Did you slay da beast dat had it locked away too? You must have! Good work, you're really proving yourself nicely. There's some more work to be done though, so don't get too excited yet. Dis next errand is actually a favor I owe to a long time family friend. Perhaps you know of da Redblade family? Specifically, I'm talking about Kargek Redblade. He's in need of some help and you're da perfect person to help him. Just tell him I [sent you to help]'<br />
<br />
Kargek Redblade is found in East Freeport.<br />
<br />
Tell him Korbuk sent me.<br />
<br />
He then says his precious father’s sword was stolen by a dirty little gnome named Drevlon, who resides in East Karanas. He doesn’t always spawn right away so you may have to wait until its dark.  Drevlon Knacknabber spawns in East Karanas on the opposite side of the zone , from the druid port in area, along the river, there are some huts there and some barbarian guards. He spawns there (he is a little black gnome) and he wanders towards the gnoll obelisk down the trail (south) he then paths in a large circle, and eventually back to the huts. He was dark blue to 67, and max hits for 658 damage.  You will probably want to bring a tracker friend to help since Drevlon wanders around the zone, but if you run along this path you will have a chance at finding him.  Kill him and loot Redblade Family Sword.<br />
<br />
Give the blade back to Kargek.  He will give you an Emblazoned Champion’s Hilt.  Take the hilt and give it you Korbuk Brimblade.  He will return it and give you some experience.  He also tells you to go look for a smith by the name of Dardek to combine the 3 items together to forage the sword.  Go to Thurgadin and find a blue con dwarf with no name lying down in the back bar (the one with the brew barrel after you go down the ramp near Icewell, no loc at this time).  Upon hailing him, his name pops up as Dardek Bladewright.  He refuses to speak to you any further until you get him some Coldain Coffee.  After some more searching, there is a new vendor behind the counter at the other major bar in Thurgadin (location not available on this either, but if you just look around you will find it).  This new merchant sells generic coffee beans and talks about a special brew if you hail him.  Go through the script, and then give him 350pp for Special Beans.  Buy 3 of the generic beans as well and head to a brew barrel.  Combine the 3 generic beans to get Generic Coffee Brew, then combine this with the Special Beans to make Coldain Coffee (trivials are not known at this time).  Now take the Coldain Coffee and give it to Dardek.  After you give him the Coffee he starts walking toward the forge on the other side of Thurgadin.  Once he gets there he asks what you wanted from him.  Now hand him the Elaborate Shank, Emblazoned Champion’s Hilt and Korbuk’s Weapon Plans.  He returns Dardek’s Forged Blade, No stats and No drop.  Now go back to Korbuk and hand him the sword.  He will give you Korbuk’s Blade of Mastery, it is warrior only, equipable in primary as a two-hand slash weapon with no stats and it looks like an Ornate Greatblade.  After this he says he has more [work] for you to do.  Follow the script until he asks for the pages.  This now catches all of the warriors without Epic 1.0 up to the warriors with Epic 1.0.<br />

Text for Warriors with Epic 1.0<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Korbuk Brimblade'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Well now, aren't you a meager one? Da name is Korbuk Brimblade. Have you felt anything strange lately?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I have felt something strange'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Aha, you have sensed it as well. For a while, I believed it was just me dat noticed it. Now dat you've confirmed my suspicions, I'm sure I can move forward with my [work].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what work?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Yeah, ok. You look like da respectable type. I wish it was an easy story to tell, but me thinks it's not so easy. I'm uncertain if you know da story of da red scabbard. I was named after my ancestor by da same name. In a great war, Rallos Zek bestowed to my ancestor da fabled red scabbard after Suteng was slain. It had been his charge and dat of my family to hold da scabbard until a [true warrior] would step forward to claim it as theirs once more.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am a true warrior'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Time passed and no warrior came forth. Then da terrible scourge took hold of da ogres and we began to lose ourselves. It was then dat another ancestor of mine, Grivnok Brimblade, asked a human to take charge of da scabbard until da scourge had waned. He would know dat time when a descendant of Korbuk with da same name would come forth. It was then dat da Redblade family, led by Thegrek, took over da charge of da scabbard until I would return to [reclaim da charge] in da name of da Brimblade family.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'reclaim da charge'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'It was I who returned to da Redblades, who spoke with da descendant of Thegrek. But I could not reclaim da charge. I felt a greater power, something more amazing and powerful than even da red scabbard contained. What draw I felt from da scabbard I felt ten fold from this [new source], and I was unable to explain where it was coming from. I just know dat it has drawn me here, to this place, so that I might find da answers I seek here.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'what new source?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I can't express who or what it is dat is drawing me here. I only know dat this is where I must be. I feel as though this is something like da scabbard, but more powerful. Perhaps it is a new weapon? If so, I must be da one to lead da charge to protect its power until da right warrior comes along to claim it. Just as my family led da charge so long ago to protect da red scabbard, so shall I continue it with this new journey. Are you [willing to help] knowing all dat?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am willing to help'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I had hoped so. Let's get started then. It seems the powerful lure is greatest when I am at this point, so I must remain here to ensure dat I can keep a grasp on where it resides. I'm hoping dat after you return with whatever you can find, I'll be able to uncover more information. From time to time, I get flashes of da things dat we need to find, like da picture of a place or a [thing]...''<br />
<br />
You say, 'what thing'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Just now I had a flash of a book, or pages of a book. Just as quickly as the book was there, it split into da cover and three pages and then fell to da ground. I wonder if dat's going to happen often... In any case, maybe you should have a look around to see if you can find any pages from a book that are on da ground. Return to me if you find them.'<br />
<br />
These are the known locations of the ground spawns, but there might be others.<br />

I think you should take these to a linguist to decipher them. I knew one in da abysmal sea, aboard da hulking boat, but I forget his name. I do recall dat it was a funny name, though.'<br />
<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
<br />
The NPC's name in Abysmal Sea is Rewina Jalmoy at loc -312, 252. He gave me &quot;Recounted History of War&quot; when I handed him the decomposing pages and cover from Dranik's Scar. The book mentions Kratak Drom and war over life in Dranik's Scar.<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Rewina Jalmoy'<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Hello Vendak. What's that I see? Are you [smirking] at me? That's not very nice of you.'<br />
You say, 'smirking'<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Well, I don't think it's very nice to laugh at someone just because of his name. I didn't pick it, you know. Go laugh at my parents.'<br />
<br />
Rewina Jalmoy says 'Oh my, what is this? Someone looking to interact with me who isn't making fun of my name?! I'm shocked! So what have you brought me, hmm? Ooo, what a collection of fine specimens! Where on Norrath did you find these? Did you find them on Norrath? Oh wordy me! I always seem to get sidetracked, but I did manage to decipher what these pages say for you. Don't be a stranger, come back and see me any time you like!<br />

Dranik's Vengeance<br />
<br />
The time of turmoil is at an end. We must strike back at the infidels who try to thin our numbers. From the west, we find the power of the ancients, and from the north we find refuge in our heritage.<br />
<br />
We have fought long and<br />
<br />
(Page 2)<br />
hard to ensure our way of life. We do not fear death, nor do we fear them. We live for the hunt and will make them pay, even if it means our own deaths. We call him Kratak Drom, the Broken One. He is a myth to our people, but clearly the myth is real.<br />
<br />
The pain he feels will be<br />
<br />
(Page 3)<br />
surreal, though. I find myself carving his name into my table at night, hoping for a chance at his neck, hoping to rinse my blade of his blood. His denial of our people will be his downfall and we will see to it that we bring him and his minions mercilessly to their knees.<br />

Item Lore: An interesting story regarding the dragorn<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade grimaces in pain for a moment before opening his eyes. 'Things are getting stranger by da moment. I just had a vision of a creature dat wanders about da area below, then it went dark. I'm not sure if this creature is part of everything else, but it certainly is something we should check out. I know it seems silly, but you should have this [rock].'<br />

<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I was holding da rock when I had dat vision. Whatever happened to me was passed into da rock as well and I can sense some power within da rock now. Maybe holding da rock will lead you to da creature or maybe it will lead you to something near da creature, I don't really know. You have to keep a tight grip on it though, else I don't think you'll feel da power drawing you as I did. If you do find da beast, be careful. There's no telling what dangers lay in this place.'<br />
<br />
Put the energy receptor on your cursor.  Eventually your energy receptor will point you to Blackfall Borer, a mob who is immune to all spells, has a ton of hp, light blue to a 67 and hits 150-614.  There is no need to kill him.  You are just after the Blackfall Ore.  Blackfall Borer’s corpse will not have anything on it if you do kill him.  Blackfall Borer spawns fairly often so it should not take too long.  If you have already picked up Blackfall Ore from your page searching time then you can skip this portion of the quest.<br />

It almost seemed like it was a blade. You should probably take this to get it looked at by a skill [smith].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'smith'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Blacksmith, yes. She's dealt with some of da more interesting things I've needed worked on lately and I know she'll be able to help with dat ore as well.

Then she asks if she can help.  Give the plans and ore to her and you get back Blackfall Blade (no stats).<br />
<br />
There is 2 A blacksmith... hail them both and it will be obvious which it is.... if Korezna Orecleaver is up that means someone else spawned her with water.<br />
<br />
Blade to Korbuk gets blade back and this...<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says, ‘Somehow da creature dat left da ore has made its way back to Norrath and is tearing through da mountainsides! You have to head it off in da crumbling caverns of Vxed before it can get any further! Be careful, though. I had a vision of some of its spawn with it so you may have to take care of more than just da one creature when you get there. Now Hurry!’<br />
<br />
This is an invisible flag.  Make a group and head to Vxed.  You will need to kill 3 Blackfall Borelings and the Blackfall Borer.<br />
<br />
The first Blackfall Boreling is spawned almost at the zone-in (-3250, -750).  It is at the first cement patio, and will be the first mob you see.  Appears to have LOS agro.<br />
<br />
The second Blackfall Boreling is located if you take the left path from the zone-in.  Keep on that path.  You will have the option to break left of keep going straight, continue straight.  Then, take the straight path until it ends and you can go left or right.  To the left is a large room with a bunch of mobs, this is where the second Blackfall Boreling is located.<br />
<br />
The third Blackfall Boreling is located down the path to the right side from the zone-in.  He is just before crossing the bridge as if you were heading towards the NPC to win the Vxed trial.<br />
<br />
Killing all three Borelings results in a zone-wide message stating that the beast is awaiting you up the hill.  You then cross the bridge and head up the hill.  Soon you’ll get the option to break left, take the left road.  After a few mobs you will meet the Borer.  There is nothing special about him at all.  He is partially slowable, max hit is around 1100 damage and has slightly more hp than the normal mobs.  Kill him and loot his A Vial of Blood.  Now, go back to Korbuk Brimblade.  Give him the blood and he will seal the blood.  Now he sends you on two errands.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Dat was too close! You did a good job though and stopped dat beast before it could get too far on Norrath. We don't know what it might have been capable of otherwise. I've sealed da blood of da beast in a vial for you for da [journey]. I also got another [vision] when I took hold of da vial.'<br />
<br />
You gain experience!!<br />
<br />
You say, 'journey?'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I noticed dat da blood gave me some kind of feeling. I'm not sure whether it was da same magic dat's been giving me visions or something new, but I'd like you to take it to a shaman I knew briefly growing up. He's a friend of da Redblade family and I'm sure he'd be willing to help. Just tell him I sent you. His name is Kimber Whitefoot and you shouldn't have trouble finding him, he's a very large barbarian.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'vision'<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Da vision I had showed me an impish creature. It was dark and twisted and seemed to devour energy from da chaos surrounding us. I don't know what part it plays in this, but like everything else, I'm sure it's important. Perhaps there is another portal around dat was destroyed, like it was in Taelosia. See if you can find it and look for da creature there, then return to me whatever it may have in its possession dat we can use.'<br />
<br />
Kimber Whitefoot spawns in Everfrost at 7am game time at the zone line to Halas and begins his run to Permafrost. Turn in the Sealed Vial of Blood.<br />
<br />
Kimber Whitefoot says 'Great, wait out here for a while. I've got to make a trip into the frozen mountain of Permafrost, but I'll be out some time this evening. I should have enough time on my trek to examine the vial. I'll be back soon!'<br />
<br />
He kept running out into the tundra at this point and all the way to permafrost where he stood for a second or two and despawned. At 7pm game time he repopped and headed back to Halas. Hail him.<br />
<br />
Kimber Whitefoot says 'Yes, yes, you again. I had a chance to examine the vial you gave me. Quite an interesting substance, I must say. Scary though. Where did you say you found it? Nevermind, it's not important. I made a potion out of the vial, but I can feel an evil presence within. I want to be rid of it, so you can have it back. Please don't come to me with anything like that again. I'm really not into dealing with spirits of such heinous design. Good luck.'<br />
<br />
You now receive a Potion of Blackfall Spirit.  Take this back to Korbuk Brimblade and hand it to him.<br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade gags as he takes hold of the potion, then quickly returns it to you. 'I had no idea such a strong presence would be coming from this after Kimber worked with it. I hope he's ok. Now dat we've taken care of dat, we can focus on the last [vision] I had.'<br />
<br />
<br />
That is as far as the quest has been figured out as of yet.  I will continue to edit my post as the information comes in.  I am also missing some logs of the conversations with the NPCs for the non epic warrior part if anyone could post that here I would really appriciate it and I will edit my post to include it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just aq thought, but  the named imp (forget his name) in WoS that has the ae mana drain.  Could that not be considered devouring engery from around it?  And doesn't  it spawn  not to far from that portal looking thing  in the castle wall?  Bit of a strectch but who knows /shrug<br />

I wanted to add that the trivial for the coffee you have to make for Dardek Bladewright is less than 122. Also, the guy who sells you the 'special beans' asks for 350 gold, not 350 plat- he took 350 plat from me and gave me the beans, but I suspect you can get them for 1/10th the price I paid.</div></div><hr />

Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I've been keeping an eye on the progress you have all been making and I wanted to come and let you know that I found a logic error in the script that spawns the pages. The bug that was occuring was an obscure one which is the reason that it wasn't caught earlier. I won't bore you with specifics, but I did want to pass along that it had been caught and fixed as of about 15 minutes ago.<br />
<br />
We'll be pushing the fix to live as soon as we can, but I wanted to give you guys a heads up since I was able to pinpoint and fix the problem. I apologize for any problems or irritation this may have caused you all in the process. :(<br />
