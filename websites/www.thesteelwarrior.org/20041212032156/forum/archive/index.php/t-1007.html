<br />
I've been the main tank for a lower Tier guild for some time now, and thus concentrated on getting all the defensive AAs I could before I concentrated on doing more damage.  Well, I'm basically done with the defensive AAs, save perhaps Tactical Mastery which I have no solid info, so I'm curious as what opinions are on the best route from here to get AAs to increase my damage output the most.  Keep in mind, this is from the standpoint of basically always taking the hits from a mob, in a raid or exp group, so I won't be a 'rogue warrior' or anything; I am trying to keep the best agro/HP weapons I can.  The only foreseeable weapon upgrade I can see in the near future would be a Cord Hilted Spike Driver and perhaps Primal from ST (which would obviously help my DPS but not really AA related.)<br />
<br />
My magelo is here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=261830) to give you an idea of what I have.  To this point, in terms of offensive AAs I've done Combat Fury 3 and Ambidexterity (As I figured more swings would mean more chances to proc/more agro as a main tank), but I'm unsure what would be the most useful at this point.  I'm debating between Flurry 3 for a greater chance at proccing my primary more often, or Ferocity/Fury of the Ages/Ingenuity.<br />
<br />
Thoughts or comments are much appreciated,<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I see a nice difference in increased number of hits with TM2, so TM3 must be even better.  It'll definately help with your agro.<br />
<br />
After that probably ferocity to increase the number of successful double attack checks (which will slightly boost the number of successful triple attacks, which again will boost the number of successful flurry checks).<br />
<br />
From there it becomes a matter of taste.  But get TM3 first - increased agro and DPS from one ability for MT's :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For aggro based it'd make sense to get the attack increasing skills first, like Ferocity or Punishing Blade of Ambi.  It is not clear whether piercing a mob's special defense makes them any more angry than not piercing it (and certainly very hard to verify) while it can be safely assumed that if you're attacking more often, that should net you more aggro (well, it might turn out to be false, but seems like a good guess as any).<br />
<br />
From a damage point of view, Tactical Mastery and Punishing Blade are probably the best, and both have their limitations (only from front and only 2H weapons).  Ferocity is probably the 3rd best, if only because it always works.  Crit hits, Flurry, and Ambi are all decent skills but the first two are a bit pricy and the latter only works with DW (and isn't exactly cheap either).</div></div><hr />
