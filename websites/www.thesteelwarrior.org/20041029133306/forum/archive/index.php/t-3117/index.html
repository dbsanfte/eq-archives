<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So, is Elemental-Time and VT (VT quality reward)  the approximate difficulty of the raid? AKA a guild that is doing those should be able to run through the raid?</div></div><hr />

Yes, but with DIFFICULTY.  A VT guild will probably wipe the first several times in a VT level raid.  However, after learning it, the raid should be fairly easy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did MMC last night.  Was about elemental difficulty and elemental reward.   All caster stuff though.<br />
<br />
http://www.bck.org/~splaktar/LDoN_First_Raid.jpg<br />
<br />
Everything poofed tho when we got ported out of zone when awarding loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also found some other raid augments.<br />
<br />
I think these are all from MMC.<br />
<br />
+75 hps, plate classes.<br />
+50 hps, all/all.<br />
+35 ac, plate classes.<br />
+25 ac, chain classes.</div></div><hr />

Did it with 18 ...  It wasnt a fail, it was a Gangbang <br />
<br />
I am absolutely sure raids are designed for 36.<br />
And that there is a difficulty selection depending on attendency.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no way 3 groups could had complete the<br />
quest (All Elementals , working on TRC)<br />
3h 18 people we barely did  1/3 of the quest/map.<br />
<br />
Quad1000-1400 trash, almost impossible to split/mez/slow<br />
Quad2000-2700 special &quot;evil mumies&quot; the ones to kill<br />
<br />
However this one was probably perfectly balanced for 30-36 people<br />
with elemental gear looking for some fun/channel.<br />
<br />
While we got our asses kicked, its doable with 6 balanced groups.</div></div><hr />
