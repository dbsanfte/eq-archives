<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garthax</div><div class="date">03-31-2005, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has been farming ubrs a lot over the past few weeks and I wanted some other warrior's opinions on aggro control for The Beast.<br />
<br />
I have no problems with all the other bosses... Rend, Drakk, and the other two losers are stuck on me like glue.  I can keep aggro easily for the entire fight, but The Beast is a disaster.<br />
<br />
He &quot;punts&quot; the first person who attacks him into the air.  Our current strategy is for a Paladin to run in and take the punt then I go in second to tank.  The Beast does an AE fear that I can resist for most of the fight due to some priest buff, but it seems like my aggro is wiped with every fear whether I am affected or not.  Then it is just mass chaos of me chasing the mob around and only able to hold aggro briefly after a taunt before he starts ignoring me again.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have any better luck with this thing?  Am I right that his AE fear also wipes aggro?</div></div><hr />

Even inbetween the knockback, sunder revenge and bash means we have aggro &quot;most&quot; of the time.  You get a temporary period of being ignored during fear, but its very short duration and fixable by fear ward, or a blacksmith trinket.  <br />
<br />
Its interesting to point out that a lot of times, when you &quot;think&quot; you've lost aggro on the beast you actually haven't.  He has some random secondary targeting where he runs off and charges someone else, much like the guards in UBRS and the scarlets in stratholme... even though you still have it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best way to hold aggro is to keep enough rage at all times so that you can taunt after he deaggros and shieldbash immediately. Shieldbash should seal your aggro then throw in some more sunder/revenge love.</div></div><hr />
