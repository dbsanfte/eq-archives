<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I've sorta hit the end of what I can pick up in the Bazaar.  Saving DKP for VT drops and $$ for big ticket items.  Anyway, I decided to pick up some other utility junk to pack around since I have like 30k plat burning a hole in my bank account.  You know, some extra potions, shrink device (for group mates, I'm a gnome myself), etc.<br />
<br />
I saw a Fleeting Quiver up for only 4k (occassionaly look for it along with immaculate shield or earthshaker or other toys).  Previously I had a Tailored Quiver because I always understood that the weight reduction of the Quiver = the item haste your bow had.  <br />
<br />
So before the Tailored Quiver was 22% weight reduction and now the Fleeting Quiver is 60%!  I'm always real good about plinking mobs on inc and I figured I would be able to get off tag bow shots faster and / or get in one more arrow as the mob ran in with more haste.<br />
<br />
Well, it didn't seem very noticeable.  Maybe a little faster, but hard to tell just eyeballing it and going on feel.  I don't have a parser set up or anything so I thought I would just post and see what everyone else felt about it.  <br />
<br />
1) Do Bow's really use the weight reduction of the Quiver for the Item Haste part of that combat forumal?<br />
<br />
2) Does that apply to Warriors, or is only for Rangers?<br />
<br />
3) If it does then is my Stonewood bow just to slow to really see the difference?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any wisdom you can impart on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe to get the haste of a quiver you divide it's weight reduction by 2. So the fleeting quiver would be 30% haste. However, I think normal haste items affect bow delay as well? So if you had a soulscream belt for example, the fleeting quiver would make no difference. <br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quiver haste STACKS with item haste for bows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So, it is like Bard haste (for the bow only of course)?<br />
<br />
Melee = Item Haste + Spell Haste + Bard Overhaste (if you have one)<br />
<br />
Bow = Item Haste + Quiver Wt Reduction/2 + Spell haste + Bard Overhaste (if you have one)<br />
<br />
?<br />
<br />
Anyone know if the Quiver haste addition can take you over the cap?  Probably not, which is why I probably wasn't seeing a difference with my bow, since I was grouped and with CoF + spell haste I was close to the haste cap anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i thought it was wr/3 would have to check with the rangers. it's also hard to tell the difference between 11 delay and 12 delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quiver haste is WR/3 according to the rangers, and I figure they would know. For archery -<br />
<br />
Archery haste = item haste + quiver haste + spell haste up to 100%<br />
<br />
V3 haste is still the only way to overhaste. Basically, the only time quiver haste matters is when you don't have max haste with spell+item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool, thanks guys.  I'll fart around with it without spell haste.  Probably throw the Quiver back on my vendor and go back to a cheapo Tailored Quiver :)<br />
<br />
Afterall, a couple of k pp is closer to that Crystalized Acid Bracer! :)</div></div><hr />
