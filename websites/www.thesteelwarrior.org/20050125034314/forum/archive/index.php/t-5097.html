However, a couple years back, while I was at a Ren Fest, one of my buds asked if I would check out his warrior twink when we got home. Anyway, apparantly some random dude overheard and broke out a minute-long story with EQisms, then left without saying another word. Quite odd =)</div></div><hr />

My wife wanted to go horse back riding and was surprised there were no merchants or drogmors.<br />

When I am hungry I tell my wife I am low on food and drink.<br />
<br />
When I am on a phone call and someone comes to me in the office I tell the person on the phone, brb afk a sec.<br />
<br />
My wife says to her mother &quot;I will send you a tell tomorrow&quot;<br />

We are a goofy bunch, and I am sure there is much more I left out.</div></div><hr />

I also mapped autoattack to caps so I can turn attack on/off while typing something and oftentimes when I alt tab to IM someone it comes out in all caps like im screaming at them.<br />

I'm still waiting for myself to slip up. I know it's bound to happen soon. The weirdest thing for me so far is talking to a friend and his mom (both played EQ) and they said SoW (Spirit of Wolf) like what rhymes with &quot;cow&quot;. I say it like &quot;so&quot;.</div></div><hr />

another thing was my friend was driving from TN to visit me in TX and we were texting each other on our cell phones and when she crossed the stateline into TX she wrote /zone and do /who all Gemuse and I wrote back /ooc 65 Gemuse- cleric - High elf- Texas W00T!<br />

It was 4 of us, 2 of which I didnt know too well.  Well after some chit chat, one of them starts talking about EQ.  I burst out laughing and there begins a huge conversation about EQ at dinner.  The other two guys were staring at us with this puzzled looks on their faces.  I guess we were talking too fast and used a lot of abbreviations like FBSS, SoW, KEI, etc.    :D   They had no clue whatsoever about what in the world we were talking about.  Its an insider EQ thing, lol</div></div><hr />

I say Vel-yus, but he pronounces Velious all wierd.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend and I get a kick out of EQtalk in public. You get the funniest looks sometimes. I can't imagine what I would think if I was an outsider and overheard people saying things like:<br />
&quot;No, I was just sitting there and got hit by the fukn train!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I killed him by myself, but there was nothing on the corpse.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jboots are not as fast as SoW. Do you have run3? How many AAs do you have.&quot;<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
The worst thing though is how EQ invades my dreams. It's fukn unnerviong sometimes. Semi-normal dreams morph in and out of EQness pretty often. Nothing I can think of off-hand, but you know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gimli's windblade.<br />
That chick must have had a nazghul bane weapon.<br />
Aragorn falling off the cliff (or was that the other movie?) Since when does a human warrior get Safe Fall? That was a 20k fall easy.<br />
Gandalf, quit meleeing and nuke. Play your class n00b. That wizard nuked like once in the whole movie.<br />
Kept wondering how much AC and dmg/dly their equip had.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anymore off the top of my head, but that movie was a riot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for in the dwarf city, with the goblins I said &quot;AE!&quot; only to hear my brother (who also plays) say the exact same thing.  And with the demon, my first thought was &quot;wtf is Fennin doing there and who trained him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Those movies are even better imo with eq experience, laughed at myself quite often during it.</div></div><hr />

The other day we were checking out sunday ads and I came across a good deal on a laptop and talked to my wife about it, and she looked at me with a straight face and said that they will probably be heavily camped and we should try and get there early.  I kept quiet about it but was laughing inside.  We went to Best Buy later and as we walked in, I yelled &quot;Camp Check&quot;, a lot of people were looking at me funny and my wife was beat red cuz she realized what she had said earlier, but the kicker of this is that after I yelled &quot;Camp Check&quot; someone actually yelled back &quot;Video Games&quot;.........LOL</div></div><hr />

We would spend half the night discussing weapons and armor while everyone in the area looked at us like we were crazy.  We saw someone pulling a bunch of carts through and we both said TRAIN at the same time.  Another night I saw our boss coming down the hall and yelled &lt;boss's name&gt; INC to everyone in the shop.  After the boss got done yelling at everyone for reading the newspaper and stormed out they asked why the hell I didn't tell them he was coming... :rolleyes: <br />
I've looked for that compass countless times trying to find my around a new part of town.  And I actually said Grats to my lil brother when he called me to tell me his 2nd kid was born :(</div></div><hr />

Of the 5 of us 2 (me and my best bud) play EQ inseprebaly.  He plays a cleric and I played a wizy at the time named Sule.  Well one of the other 3 hits on the others GF and the offended suiter starts it up with the dude.  We are in the process of going to our car in the parking lot at this point.  Well my bud tries to stop the fight (I'm just sittin back laughing as this happens alot when a bunch of marines go out).  The prob is the guy is we were all so piss drunk he can't tell who it is so he pops my bud in the jaw and they start rolling on the ground.  I send the suiter home in a taxi and my buds sitting on the curb bleeding from a cut lip and he's punch drunk and booze drunk.  I tell him to get up so we can go home and he looks up at me all bleery eyed and said &quot;No man .. I need to get a heal off Sule .. I need some mana man /sigh I'm totally out of mana&quot;  it wouldn't have been so funny but he was all puffed up from the boxing match and bleeding and was totally serious .. so naturally I let him fall proceeded to piss my pants laughing with the others, then take him to the hospital to make sure he didn't have a concussion.  I tease him unmericifully about that all the damn time.</div></div><hr />

My girlfriend plays EQ with me ... and lately, I have been catching myself referring to her in emails and conversation as *Hiana* - which is the name of her druid.  I don't think she's calling me Doggabone yet, but it's impossible to be certain :p</div></div><hr />

Once I said &quot;Oh I totally owned that stoplight&quot; to my gf after making a late yellow. She was like, &quot;huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
I use the word faction all the time to describe what I think of people...nobody understands. <br />
<br />
What's even more awkward is talking about EQ on the few occasions I've called up EQ buddies and saying things out loud I've never once said before....like the name of my guild or a zone I've been to a thousand times. Very weird. <br />

Funniest slip was from when I was playing UO. My wife and I were walking through a hobby store and they were selling different colored feathers. I grabed a bunch and turned to my wife and said <br />
&quot;Sweet I was looking for some feathers to work on my fletching skill&quot;. My wife just stared at me. It took me a minute or 2 to figure out what her problem was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The typical rhey, /1 hey, and /g hey are very common on AIM for me. <br />
<br />
I play EQ with 3-5 RL friends and we stay stuff like Newb, Pwn, Woot, etc. all the time at school and now many people say it as well haha.<br />
<br />
In English class, we were discussing MacBeth. The teacher asked  about his thoughts as we was about to fight Macduff or something like that and one on my friends replied &quot;Oh, I am gonna totally pwn Macduff&quot; pronouncing &quot;pwn&quot; as pone. Was the best thing ever.<br />
<br />
My friends and I label people as EQ races and classes a lot too. (hot tan girl = &quot;oh she is def. a wood elf female rawr~&quot;)<br />
<br />
I have many times wished I could just port back home after a vacation or long walk :p<br />
<br />
One time my mom woke me up in the morning and I mumbled something about &quot;Is the spawn up? Is it time to go fight?&quot; she was utterly confused.</div></div><hr />
