<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I see allot of questions about &quot;How is my gear&quot; or &quot;What upgrades you suugest&quot; from people with pre 50ish gear.<br />
<br />
Here is the armor people should shoot for imo once they break 50.<br />
<br />
Info regarding how to get items for quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/veliousarmour.html) <br />
<br />
Breastplate (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4969) <br />
<br />
Greeves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5099) <br />
<br />
Arms (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4515) <br />
<br />
Boots (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5064) <br />
<br />
Bracer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4288) <br />
<br />
Guantlets (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4521) <br />
<br />
Crown (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4516) <br />
<br />
The quest armor drops can be found as rare drops, allong with all other types of armor (silk, chain, leather) in Kael arena area or plate drops are uncommon in &quot;plate house&quot; area. <br />
<br />
It is a cycle started that goes along these lines<br />
<br />
Take about 12 or 18 people 50- 60 and move to plate house. May need about 24 level 50s.<br />
<br />
Had an excellent guild for this but lost it sorry.<br />
<br />
Goes something like say a phrase.<br />
<br />
Dwarf spawns , someone smacks him.<br />
<br />
two low 50 giants spawns.<br />
<br />
Once each one of these dies a 54(?) spawns <br />
<br />
Once a certain one of the 54 dies a 55 spawns.<br />
<br />
Then a 58ish<br />
<br />
Then a 60, tanking him is easy even without slow for you. With chanter and sham should be able to land slow on a couple of tries.<br />
<br />
Then the dwarf spawns again and makes a run for exit. Need to kill him before he runs or no cycle again for like an hour or something.<br />
<br />
Also there are 4 local spawns plus two or three longer timed named spawns in area.<br />
<br />
There is also a spawn up stairs you will prob deal with on level 60 cause his resists are huge and snaring him can be a problem.<br />
<br />
Each cycle should drop 0-2 (usually one) item needed for Thurgy plate armor.<br />
<br />
Get the needed gems (non bp gems are real cheap now a days on my server (20-100pp each) and faction (kindly or warmly to coldain) and you have armor slighty better then cultural.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sory I do not have exact information about cyle like phrase or mob names and who spawns what but my info regarding that was lost. Was on old guild website and they gone now <br />
<br />
A good trick I was shown was charm the mob whose death line eventually triggers the 60 spawn. Kill him when other two mob line is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trigger phrase needed is &quot;The dain must be slain for the peace we shall obtain&quot; this needs to be either said on the throne or directly in front of it to spawn the dwarf, once spawned if you are not doing rings, just smack him and run for the stairs. We usually stage this at the top of the stairs by the table as it allows for a semi possible root park if one isn't down before the other runs in.<br />
<br />
(aside -- although the guide is good this can be done with as few as 5 people (54 to 61) if they know their classes, did it last night with, 54 bard, 56 BL, 55 chanter, 58 Warrior (me) and a 61 shaman, was no worries and we made it through with the adds from the other rooms. shaman has canni V so made it a lot easier)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't think the last giant (the 60 one) can be slowed, at least by normal slows.  He's pretty high MR if not 100% MR.  Never heard of him being slowed before.<br />
<br />
Maybe the disease-based slows of the shaman can, but never tried that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's the sentence i use and it works just ducky.  <br />
i'm always in the mood for trying crazy things, so we took 4 peeps to do the &quot;chanter house&quot; and try the plate cycle.<br />
<br />
65 warrior (me)<br />
62 monk (80aa, staff of flowing water)<br />
62 shaman (malo/torpor)<br />
62 ranger (eq/am3, stonewood bow)<br />
<br />
shaman pet TM'd the giant (make sure you tank mezz the giant named Grondin or something like that).<br />
shaman landed slow on all mobs but the level 60.  heeh. funny story, ranger hit trueshot on last mob, did over 6k damage in less than 6 seconds with 3 shots, 2069, 2069, 1933.  anyways, shaman had to root park the pet TM mob (Grondin) cuz he tried to flee before we were done with the rest of the giants. damn dog too good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just done this recently with my guild and the last giant, the lvl 60, is non slowable, shammy said he got the immune to changes in attack speed message.  Also, the easiest way to do this is have a 55+ chanter come along and simply charm one of the first two giants.  You get the extra dps from the pet and if one of the first two is charmed there is a way to make sure you only fight one at a time throughout the entire cycle, instead of two.  Don't really feel like spelling it out, but i'm sure if you think about it the method is obvious.  <br />

<br />
That is because you aren't the target audience of this thread or this armor. :)<br />
<br />
For someone who is below 60 and in armor inferior to champions/cultural and no/few defensive AA, it's a raid encounter.<br />
<br />
P.S. Spelling error in your sig, Casai. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ohhh ya for the reference all the giants in the thrown room must be dead before you can use the quest phrase and spawn the dorf. It doesnt work if anything is alive. Not sure if it gets borken if you charm on the giants in there just a heads up.</div></div><hr />
