<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johnjacobjingle</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently wield a Wind-worn Handblade and a Short sword of Lightning. Being a warrior I think I should switch to A higher Aggro weapon. When I looked into Sword of the Bloodsworn and Frostbring I noticed the only real Aggro was the stun on the SotB. So of these four weapons should I wield SotB in main and Wind-worn Handblade in second??? Or should I drop down to a Barnacle Covered Axe???<br />
<br />
I don’t have a ton of cash, nor do I have a large guild, just looking for some Hate :D<br />

look me up when your on next we might be able to help each other out by trying to pump though some EF ldon's. I need to get lots of EF points to try and get some A3 aug's.<br />
<br />
Look for Gariyn he's my main if I'm not on my warrior.</div></div><hr />

you'll be losing a bit of DPS by swapping out the shortblade but for proc aggro either the SotB or Frosty will fit quite nicely.</div></div><hr />

So Shikarii, Are you tell me to keep the Wind-worn as my main hand and use the SotB in my off???</div></div><hr />

<br />
P.I.M.P. is good! I can do P.I.M.P.<br />
Thank you for the suggestion</div></div><hr />
