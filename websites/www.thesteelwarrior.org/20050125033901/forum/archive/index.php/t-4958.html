I know my profile is nothing special heh. But I am trying to save cash up , have about 6k right now. So , I just need advice on maybe some upgrades that I could shoot for. Thank you in advance for any help . Here's my magelo... http://magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=888487</div></div><hr />

Become very good friends with a mastersmith barbarian and you can make up some Heraldic armor that will serve you very well.<br />
<br />
Also I noticed you have augmented things so you obviously do LDoN. You can get some nice armor from EC-Ruj missions off named. And as much as people trumpet Tak 1450 cost armor you can get much less expensive armor with Miragul and Deep Guk points that will do quite nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing is get some haste, whatever the best you can get your hands on. Then work on more ac/hp. The smithed cultural armor for Tribunal worshippers is called Helanic Tundra and is some of the best tradeable plate armor in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">poyndexter</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the suggestions , i'll start looking in bazaar for some helanic tundra. Also start trying to do Miragul/Guk ldon's.</div></div><hr />

You have many options.  Your weaponry is the easiest thing to address.  Weild the GSoT.  It will outdamage the main/secondary weapons I believe.  If you don't like it, then I'd swap out your Blizzard-Born Blade for something faster, such as a Lamentation (9/19 + stats) The slow weapon in your on-hand is cheating you out of a lot of damage bonus.  The faster your on-hand weapon, the better off you are.  Your Naraithus looks pretty good. Lamentation, Crescent Blades of Luclin, or Guard Captains Mallet should be inexpensive and effective.  Hit the bazaar and troll. Anything with a delay of 20 or less will make you happy.<br />
<br />
IMO, however, the biggest bang for your buck will come from upgrades on your armor.  There are 3 stats that matter. AC, HP, and STA.  Your Crustacean gear is good.  Anything without HP or STA are candidates for replacement!<br />
<br />
For about 300pp, score a 6AC 65HP ring from the bazaar and sell your Vampire ring.<br />
<br />
Your neck slot could be improved by a spider fur collar.  You can win this in Velks.<br />
<br />
Your face slot can be improved by Crystal Spider Eyes.  Also winnable from Velks.<br />
<br />
You gauntlets can be improved by getting Silver Chitin Hand Wraps.  Has some haste but no HPs or STA.  Also winnable from Velks.<br />
<br />
Your helm can be replaced with a Thurgadin Champion's crown multiquest.  You'll need gems for the turn-in, which drop in... Velks (and other places.)  I still wear mine.<br />
<br />
Consider Earring of the Tempest for your earrings.  I don't know how much they cost anymore.  They'll be in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
My approach is to determine what my worst piece of gear is, and replace, rinse repeat.  Losing all your non-HP/non-STA gear would be a good first start.<br />
<br />
EDIT - changed my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I will offer a few suggestions as well.<br />
<br />
Sell Gaunts, Treeweave, boots, neck, and helm, now maybe you have 7k or so, not sure on boots.  Then buy the following, SCHW (gaunts with 22% haste, 3k?), Crusty boots, Skull shaped Barbute (head), Barbed Ringmail (chest, 2k?), and maybe a Rygorr Chain coif (neck).  If you have money left over you can search bazaar for better items than listed or could search for a usable bow with better overall stats than Gorg Idol such as  a Darkwood bow of Suffering.  Helanic Tundra armor is some of the best you will find but I doubt you will find it in your price range but I would definitely look.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and oh btw, Lamentation or just about any 9/19 weapon is a piece of shiite compared to what you have IMO.  Your damage bonus is still relatively useless at 52 so don't sacrifice ratio yet for speed.  Soon you will need something with a good aggro proc on it, at lvl 55 I would suggest a Great Staff of THunder, dirt cheap and a fine weapon.<br />
<br />
Oh, one final idea.  Take a group of guildees or friends and go the Velks.  Crystal Eyes (named there) drops a nice face item for many classes including you, 8AC, 3WIS/INT, 35HPS/MANA  ALL/ALL.  Would be a good exp camp for you and friends and some named there drop decent stuff.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">poyndexter</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok , I did as much upgrading as i could with the cash i could raise. Just take a look if ya can and see if there is anything else i should get.  Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the back slot, look for a Crinose Cape of the Werewolf.<br />
<br />
 Rings, I'd suggest a pair of Velium Fire Wedding Rings.<br />
<br />
 Ear, I'd save the dough and make a Solsteice Earring.<br />
<br />
 Total cost of those 4 upgrades should be ~6k, depending on server.</div></div><hr />
