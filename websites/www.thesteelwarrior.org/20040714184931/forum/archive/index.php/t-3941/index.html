<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why post this in this forum?<br />
<br />
If it can't be balanced at high end, it can't be done, simple as that.<br />
<br />
I made a post on Monky Business, but either you put it in the raid section no one has access to, or people that shouldn't really be involved decide to chime in their ill thought out two cents and troll a post to death.<br />
<br />
I would like a reasonable discussion based on the rest of this post.<br />
<br />
Can monks be the 4th tank class?<br />
<br />
That is the question.<br />
<br />
I think currently as warriors stand, the answer is no, but I don't think warriors are where they need to be right now, so I will include what i think needs to happen to warriors to make this viable.<br />
<br />
Do not confuse changes I propose as fixes to your class, that is not what I am suggesting, I am suggesting that if these changes were implemented then the monk class could be a tank class without neccessary stepping on warriors toes.<br />
<br />
Firstly, give warriors a 1.4 ratio to HP on worn items. Before AA adjustments.<br />
<br />
Basically if your item says 100hp then a paladin gains 100hp, a shadowknight gains 100hp, a monk gains 100hp and a warrior gains 140hp.<br />
<br />
Most warriors I have seen at the highest end, are wearing 3k from +HP items.<br />
<br />
This would be an improvement of roughly 1500hp on top of what you already have, which would then be adjusted by AA.<br />
<br />
Two, do the same for AC, I am not sure of your base line, so I cannot tell you what the figure should be, I can only say that around 2000ac at the highest level unbuffed is normal, and it should be nearer to 2200ac unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Also need to be sure that there is no AC Softcap that would negate any raise in AC, it must have an impact.<br />
<br />
Ok, lets say these were implemented.<br />
<br />
What tanks do we have?<br />
<br />
1, Warrior.<br />
Highest overall HP, highest Overall AC, No Utility. Taunt from Key and weapons only. (excluding right clickies which are generally saved for raids)<br />
<br />
2, Paladin<br />
Closest to Warrior HP, not quite so close on AC, HP Buffs, Stun, Group heals and Snap aggro.<br />
<br />
3, ShadowKnight<br />
Still quite close to Warrior HP, no quite so close on AC, ATK Buffs, Snare, Mana Infusion and Snap aggro.<br />
<br />
4, Monks<br />
Lowest Overall HP, Lowest Overall AC. In the region of 4k less HP, and 600ac less AC at the very highest end when compared to a similar warrior. No Utility, No taunt other then from weapon proc's/DPS.<br />
<br />
Is the monk a threat to the warrior in their capacity as a tank still?<br />
<br />
Yes Knights are still a major threat, but is the Monk a threat to your role as Main Tank either in adventures/groups or in Raid situations?<br />
<br />
Even with the same levels of mitigation, with 600ac seperating us, that is quite a substanstial difference, and will equate into quite a difference in damage taken ingame.<br />
<br />
With 4k less unbuffed HP, thats a very large drop off. It would make the Warrior a by far more efficient tank for almost all situations.<br />
<br />
What would it mean to me as a monk?<br />
<br />
I could do what i have done for 3 years. Tank. I could be a viable alternative...if the group could handle it.<br />
<br />
I still won't be tanking any raid level mobs.<br />
<br />
What else does this mean.<br />
<br />
Well.<br />
<br />
With an increase in HP and AC as large as this needs to be.<br />
<br />
I think an increase in Mob DPS would also need to be taken into account. I am not talking your average XP trash mob, I am talking about raid level content.<br />
<br />
With a larger AC to mitigate the damage better, a larger HP to survive a larger single round of combat, a raid encounter mob could have his DPS raised accordingly to keep level of difficulty as it is.<br />
<br />
Please be civil, I am not here to bend your class over, or to break you any more then you already are.<br />
<br />
From my point of view, warriors worries about their place in the tanking order is the main reason that monks where changed.<br />
<br />
If I can show the warrior class that a monk being able to mitigate at the same level given the same level of AC...something which would require a MUCH lower level of raiding warrior, will not impact on their abilities, or their chances of being chosen as main tank, then perhaps I can do the same to Sony.<br />
<br />
If however I cannot persuade you, then I cannot persuade Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A monk just tanked Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
I remember back before monks got nerfed, I was like level 26 fighting in Netherbian Lair in a group (on my SK) and along comes this monk who was like level 22 or so.  He procedes to go in and solo inside the caves killing 2 and 3 yellow and red (to him) netherbians at a time for a few hours, taking a lot of our mobs.   I found it quite rediculous.  Then they nerfed monks and I never saw that happen anymore.  I look at the above post and I wonder what is the point really, perhaps I missed something but are you actually trying to convince us that Sony should undo the monk nerf?  No offense, but most warriors are probably not really too concerned with this right now and it probably won't go over too well on this board.  I am not extremely familiar with the subtleties of what a monk can and can not do since I don't play one but I doubt the average monk is going to be a tank on a raid, and I have never heard any of my monk friends complain about this so I doubt it is a huge problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had worn a fungi like that monk OBVIOUSLY wore, then you too could have accomplished the exact same feat.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Monks can already tank normal LDoN stuff better than I can because between Stonestance and Mend they're basically immune to damage for at least 20% of the time (more if they crit mend) and since the monks I group with seem to be out pulling the other 50% of the time, that means a monk pretty much only takes damage about 30% of the time on easy mobs.<br />
<br />
I have never heard of anyone using monks to tank high end stuff so although they fare worse up there I don't think it even matters.  BTW over half of Fennin's DPS comes from his damage bonus alone (1024 versus around 2K max hit) and monks still avoid better than anyone else so it should not be surprising that a monk can tank Fennin Ro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is exactly what the poster was asking for honestly.<br />
I think he was hoping for some sympathy and support from warriors for 2 reasons.<br />
1) Warriors also have it shitty, and so might have sympathy for the only other class in game that likely needs similiar help.<br />
2) Warriors are often perceived as the cause of the nerf.  So perhaps some might have regret on top of it.    especially as the nerf was on the wrong group.<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
The monk nerf is probably the silliest thing that VI did in hindsight.<br />
They nerfed monks for 2 things that added up to one reason.<br />
a) poor itemization.   Prepop monks could get too close in AC<br />
to thier plate counterparts<br />
b) low mob attacks.  Prepop mobs had a low attack.<br />
<br />
a+b = prepop Monks came very close to warrior/plate mitigation yet had an avoidance edge.<br />
<br />
Problem you'll notice is the timinig of the nerf, and words &quot;prepop&quot;<br />
It was what only a couple weeks till POP came out?  POP<br />
fixed A+B itself.  Monks no longer come close to plates in AC.<br />
And AC does matter vs high attack mobs.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Furor:<br />
Do you honestly believe that monks tank better right now than rangers and beastlords?<br />
<br />
((assuming similiar level of gear, and assuming both using same type of weapons 1H, or 2H))<br />
<br />
Heck, do you believe that monks tank better than Shaman right now?  ((Especially considering a shaman tank will take no riposotes.))</div></div><hr />

I really don't want anymore of that idiocy to breed.  Besides what other class besides monks enjoyed their zones being populated by half of them soloing and two-boxing back in the day?<br />
<br />
I also don't feel like competing with even more classes for the exp tank role either thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
What other class besides enchanters enjoyed charm burning names in BoT for phat loots?<br />
<br />

Seems like a petty reason to hate on monks because a lot of shamans botted them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit:- And I do not mind most monks, but generally (along with Paladins and Druids) in the 4 years I have played this game they tend to ask for way too much on their message boards. <br />
<br />
They do not seem to comprehend what its like in other peoples shoes.<br />
<br />
Monks are just as jaded right now as Warriors. They feel they have been gimped in their role and that if any positive change should happen in their specialty department it should be them first.<br />
<br />
How would you feel if any other class made a post on MB saying that their class should be able to pull better or do more dps in relation to monks?<br />
<br />
You would get the exact same reaction there you are getting here now. Basically improve warriors first and then we can talk.<br />
<br />
And thats fine if monks think the nerf was a  huge injustice, or that haivng a million of them everywhere was fine.  Its true NO class likes a nerf. Personally though I feel they just messed up the execution.  With mend most monks I know (VT/SSRA gear) can tank most mobs in pinches if something happens. They always do when the tank drops in my groups. Well them or rangers it depends on gear. Personally I do not see much wrong in that area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just assumed this was a given to be honest.<br />
<br />
Strangely, like someone would 'assume' that Warriors would be the best tanks.<br />
<br />
Odd that isnt it.<br />
<br />
Cause your not.<br />
<br />
You know it, I know it and everyone that plays the game knows it.<br />
<br />
Other then raid encounters, and even then on some of those, Paladins out perform you in every single other situation.<br />
<br />
At no time is the warrior first choice.<br />
<br />
Hell your not even second choice.<br />
<br />
You would assume, what with that being your only real job, that you would be best at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot; in the 4 years I have played this game they tend to ask for way too much on their message boards. &quot;<br />
<br />
It's just a message board. And it goes largely ignored by sony. Even before the supersales &quot;sponsorship&quot; issue, MB never really had any open dialog with Scott or Alan. In fact the only actual dialog of any note was during the epic quest solving days, when monks gave a lot of input on how to improve their epic, and that was actually listened to.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do not seem to comprehend what its like in other peoples shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some do. Some don't. Just like any message board.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks are just as jaded right now as Warriors.&quot;<br />
<br />
In my case, that's an understatement. /snicker<br />
<br />
&quot;They feel they have been gimped in their role and that if any positive change should happen in their specialty department it should be them first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, a lot of positive change has been made in their two specialty departments.<br />
<br />
Pulling. A lot of positive changes have been made to pulling over the past two years. None have been made for monks though. Tweaks to lull, pacify and harmony. Changes to content. Changes to pathing. Fading memories. Stuff like that.<br />
<br />
DPS. That's a whole huge can of worms, but needless to say, improvements to monk DPS have been laughable lately. Like most warriors feel hybrid tanks are encroaching far too much on their tank-ability ... monks have long felt the encroachment on their DPS from other classes. <br />
<br />
Monk DPS is still good. No dispute there. But like warriors love to point out how the percentage gap in HP advantage has been reduced from expansion to expansion to expansion ... monks make the same argument regarding DPS.<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you feel if any other class made a post on MB saying that their class should be able to pull better or do more dps in relation to monks?&quot;<br />
<br />
You don't visit MB much do you?<br />
<br />
Heh. Other classes are constantly posting exactly that on the board.<br />
<br />
It's why everyone thinks monks are whiners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I didn't mean to sound like i was knocking the warrior class, just stating a fact.<br />
<br />
For the exact same reasons you are not first choice, we are not 4th choice.<br />
<br />
It is less to do with damage taken and more to do with aggro held and utility brought.<br />
<br />
Rangers/Bst take 4th just like SKs/Pals take first slot. For exactly the same reasons.<br />
<br />
That isn't how it should be.<br />
<br />
Warriors should be a clear first at taking damage, by a margin that means something, not the piddling little difference that exists today, but by a margin that makes healing them a greatly easier job, then SK/Pal/Mnk should be next in taking damage, SK/Pal still CLEARLY better choices then a monk for the tanking role.<br />
<br />
Basically we would be in the position warriors are in now compared to these two classes and we already know they are always first choice over you, so we know that they will be first choice over us.<br />
<br />
The same way that Warriors should be a better choice because healing should be easier, over SK/Pal, so a Monk should be a better choice over Rng/BST for exactly the same reason.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't step on warriors or Pal/Sks toes, Rng/Bst can't complain the game was like that for 3 years and Tanking isn't really a staple of either of their games.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, I don't think Pal/Sks/Rng/Bst should be changed at all.<br />
<br />
Repeal the monk nerf is enough to put Monks back with Pal/Sks.<br />
<br />
Gve warriors the HP/AC boost and a 20%? increase in mitigation, hey we know they can do it, they took atleast that from monks, if they can take they can give, that should atleast make it so that healing a warrior is a breeze compared to healing a Knight.<br />
<br />
Anyway its late. I rambled.<br />
<br />
Think about it, with an improvment of monk tanking, most come an improvement of warrior tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well I can sympathise with monks in the regard that they are the only class to have their role diminished even worse than warriors right now.<br />
<br />
Honestly its a BAD thing to have a monk pull in LDON, at least a warrior can still tank there, albeit less desirably than knights. I honestly would rather someone just train me with mobs in LDON than let a monk split. But thats pulling, not tanking.  I am willing to bet  if monks do get a tanking improvement they will not stop there. They will complain until everything is upgraded. Its how SOEs gets into these messes. Tons of bones, then finally the proper upgrade which then overpowers the class.  So rather just focus on the actual problem IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Yeah Steelwarrior has its share of overrating knights and complaining, but  generally we do not ask for much IMO.<br />
<br />
Asking to take hits as well as knights is too much imo, considering knights already tank 90% minimum on average as well as warriors now without defensive. And with mend and more dps well I don't see that making warriors  anything but less desirable for groups IMO. <br />
<br />
I am jaded and skeptical of any tanking upgrades because I believe SOE has painted themselves into a very dark corner. You see a warriors main problems are in exp groups where their tanking  can be seen as overkill but their aggro and versatility sucks. Yet other classes are already too close to our tanking ability. So what do you do? Even if you upgrade our tankability and call us fixed what does that even mean for exp groups?<br />
<br />
Most warriors can already tank just fine in exp groups and thanks to stupid mana regen lots of other classes can as well. <br />
<br />
The same argument came up in the Bulwark of Vie thread. A Paladin could not understand why the Vie spell would be more beneficial to a Paladin than a Warrior even though the protection % is the exact same. Its still overkill for warriors, but it does help classes beneath them more as tanking is their weaker point.<br />
<br />
Personally I do not know even what to expect anymore, way too much has been put into the game to ever nerf into where it should be imo, and it would piss too many people off (and rightly so). This should be a lesson to freaking test and use common sense before putting so much into certain classes.  For this reason I play my Rogue a lot more now (what can I say I am a mellee freak) . I just need a break from this craziness. <br />
<br />
I tend to agree a lot with Grimlokk in  that I feel warriors are actually generally fine as far as compared to the game itself, its mostly other classes that are way too powerful. But like I said its way to late to fix that so just hope for some kind of upgrade I guess to compete and have actual class balance.<br />
<br />
Sorry I went off on a long rant rambling on warriors, I do 100% agree that monks are in bad shape right now and need a fix, along with warriors. But I always feel that SOE just needs to fix the proper thing and not start this small upgrades over time routine where they yet again break the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>trmonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Kavak.<br />
<br />
I do agree, you won't find many monks accepting this as a complete fix. I think I am in the minority there.<br />
<br />
Also, you have to understand, from my point of view, this cannot be a monk fix, without the warrior part.<br />
<br />
You can't JUST repeal the nerf.<br />
<br />
Or else you are right, all you do is move warriors from 3rd spot to 4th, you don't move monks into 4th spot.<br />
<br />
Even with the HP/AC gap between our two classes, and this is esp true of LDoN NORMAL, the mob dps isn't enough to make it worth while to take a warrior over a monk.<br />
<br />
The difference in healing isn't offset by the difference in DPS.<br />
<br />
Even though at highest levels, full AA, Blade of War, a monk is barely 30 dps ahead of a warrior.<br />
<br />
It is still 30dps and it still will make the mob die faster.<br />
<br />
If there is little to no difference in the amount of healing required, number of mobs that can be tanked, then that is 30 dps you might as well take with a Monk tank.<br />
<br />
I would hope that the difference between a monk and a warrior tanking would be significant, that anyone who had done both would say...my this was a lot easier with the warrior.<br />
<br />
And this needs to be said when compared to Knights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, this totally ignores taunt button.  And the AE taunt button.  While these don't approach knight agro capability<br />
they are better than monk agro capability and still need to be factored in.<br />
<br />
When 3/4 mobs come in and peel off on a healer, slower.   A monk simply cant get the mobs off the healer or slower anywhere near as fast as a warrior can.<br />
<br />
And your also talking monks/warriors in Plane of Time gear doing normal.  Many of these people are able and do do Hard Adventures.<br />
<br />
Even full nerf removal won't move monks to #3.   due to lack of taunt and lack of hps for content suited to thier level ((IE Time = Hard))<br />
<br />
Take a bazaar warrior and bazaar monk.   you will notice the bazaar level monk will have difficulty even without the nerf tanking ldon normal.</div></div><hr />

Instill Doubt &gt; Taunt, as it *adds* aggro, you have a success/fail message, works more reliably, and a resisted fear adds more aggro than a proc of enraging blow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So let me make sure, I understand you.<br />
You are suggestion that monks use ID for agro in most grouping<br />
situations, say in LDON?<br />
<br />
2/3 mobs come in and monks are supposed to ID/agro them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Using fear on things that cannot be feared (I understand fear caps at 55 and the lowest mobs are 55 in LDoN normal and those are the trap mobs) for aggro is pretty much the same thing as stunning things immune to stun and getting aggro.  If it works (and it probably does), it's a flaw of the game design not because it's supposed to work like that.  The obvious fix, if this is even a problem, is to make fear on mobs that cannot be feared generate no aggro, not whine about how warriors are inadequate again.  The general attitude of warriors seem to be that if other people are broken (in the powerful direction) then we should be broken too (in the powerful direction).  Saying you want aggro like a Paladin can stun is like saying you want a missed kick to generate 3 Enraging Blow of taunt which makes about as much sense as fearing unfearable mobs or stunning unstunnable mobs for aggro but as long as it makes you as broken as the other people that's not a problem.  This is also why SoE hasn't taken any of our suggestions seriously.<br />
<br />
At any rate, this post isn't supposed to be about warriors.  Monks could always tank, especially on something where over half of the DPS comes from damage bonus alone (which means mitigation makes no difference on at least half of the DPS).</div></div><hr />

Warriors should be a clear first at taking damage, by a margin that means something, not the piddling little difference that exists today, but by a margin that makes healing them a greatly easier job, then SK/Pal/Mnk should be next in taking damage, SK/Pal still CLEARLY better choices then a monk for the tanking role.<br />
<br />
Basically we would be in the position warriors are in now compared to these two classes and we already know they are always first choice over you, so we know that they will be first choice over us.<br />
<br />
The same way that Warriors should be a better choice because healing should be easier, over SK/Pal, so a Monk should be a better choice over Rng/BST for exactly the same reason.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't step on warriors or Pal/Sks toes, Rng/Bst can't complain the game was like that for 3 years and Tanking isn't really a staple of either of their games.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind, I don't think Pal/Sks/Rng/Bst should be changed at all.<br />
<br />
Repeal the monk nerf is enough to put Monks back with Pal/Sks.<br />
<br />
Gve warriors the HP/AC boost and a 20%? increase in mitigation, hey we know they can do it, they took atleast that from monks, if they can take they can give, that should atleast make it so that healing a warrior is a breeze compared to healing a Knight.<br />
<br />
Anyway its late. I rambled.<br />
<br />
Think about it, with an improvment of monk tanking, most come an improvement of warrior tanking.  <br />
<br />
Well if it makes you feel any better, I'd take a monk to tank over a Ranger and a Beastlord.</div></div><hr />

2/3 mobs come in and monks are supposed to ID/agro them?  <br />
<br />
Welcome to our world. What do you think Warriors do when 2/3 mobs come in to a camp? Sing some magic song that has them stick to us? Using Instill Doubt is definitely a viable way to aggro a mob past lvl 55. Fear (Resisted/Immune) generates between 1000-1200 hate.<br />
<br />
Take a bazaar warrior and bazaar monk. you will notice the bazaar level monk will have difficulty even without the nerf tanking ldon normal.<br />
<br />
We will be doing exactly this very soon with a level 55 Bazaar Warrior and a level 55 Bazaar Monk. Stay tuned for the results.</div></div><hr />

This is ludicrous. When you want to be a tank, you use EVERY possible advantage you can get your hands on. You can bet your ass if Warriors had instill doubt we'd be mashing that hotkey constantly. You have a very viable way to taunt a mob; you can just start using it before the mob even gets to camp, while you're pulling, whatever. <br />
<br />
And yea, you'd think it would be pretty fucking ridiculous that a mob immune to fear would actually be angered by a level 15 fear spell that costs 40 mana, wouldn't you? Or a level 9 stun? Yea, welcome to Everquest.<br />

THAT would be an interesting parse.  Throw in a beast to make it even more interesting.  And could you include hit distributions?  It seems to me that monks get hit for max 2-4 times as often as a warrior, but the average hit isn't much higher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Furor, I've used ID in an LDoN adventure I was tanking.<br />
<br />
It didn't help.<br />
<br />
That's my &quot;anecdotal&quot; experience with it. I was mashing it every time it was up, because, yes, resisted fears are pretty good aggro everyone says.<br />
<br />
It's just not successful enough to help.<br />
<br />
You have access to some monks. Log one on, and go do a cheesy normal LDoN adventure (the kind monks can tank pretty easily), and use the skill. See it in action.<br />
<br />
It's not effective in my experience.<br />
<br />
Don't trust me on this, though. Test it out yourself.<br />
<br />
I don't want sympathy. Heck I'm not even with LoK on this one. <br />
<br />
I don't LIKE tanking as a monk. Never have. <br />
<br />
I was just disputing the claim that Instill Doubt was useful aggro generation for a monk that ends up tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">When youre trying to generate hate as quickly as possible, you use every possible method you can.

<br />
The only stuff I've had the experience of tanking lately is LDoN normal adventures. <br />
<br />
I don't seek out tanking opportunities. I don't enjoy tanking as a monk. And I don't think I really have the gear to do it.<br />
<br />
Which is why ID hasn't been all that useful for me. As Friss states:<br />
<br />
&quot;ID works well, but it takes time to get it to work. So yes in LDON in normal adv where the mobs go down fast, it will not work to well.&quot;<br />
<br />
The recycle time on ID is pretty long. I get off 1, maybe 2 on an LDoN mob. Most of the time, they don't land so they're not resisted. So it's just me mashing a useless button.<br />
<br />
Even when they do land, the mob's half dead by the time it does land.<br />
<br />
In XP group tanking, which is about the only spots monks get to tank from time to time, the kill rate is usually pretty fast. ID's just too slow to be of much use, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Least that's my take on it.</div></div><hr />

Why would you take a monk over a ranger? <br />
<br />
The difference in tanking ability is tiny, miniscule barely noticable with a healer using HoT spells.<br />
<br />
You said you would thats fair enough, but why?<br />
<br />
Surely YOU don't use FD splitting on Nomral LDoN adventures?<br />
<br />
I don't use FD splitting when I am MTing Normal, I can't really see a reason for you using it.<br />
<br />
Or were you suggesting you would take them for HARD level adventures?<br />

Who would you choose for Tank in Normal (given all classes have gear levels that can actually handle the job). Excluding War/Pal/SK obviously.</div></div><hr />

You know how, like 99 times out of 100 when people make a statement like &quot;Oh we should have ability_x&quot; the class with ability_x comes along and says &quot;No, you shouldn't, that's MY skill&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Well Instill Doubt ... it's one of those rare times that I'll say I'd be happy as a clam to let warriors in on the action.<br />
<br />
Rogues and Bards have the skill as well, so it's not like its an exclusive monk thing.<br />
<br />
Warriors can be &quot;intimidating&quot; as well as any other class.<br />
<br />
I don't think you be all that impressed with its usefulness.<br />
<br />

No. It's not really at all like taunt.<br />
<br />
I have a warrior and a monk. I've used both skills a lot in the past few years. They're nothing like each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be overjoyed to have a skill that had the same success rate as Taunt and double the recycle time,&quot;<br />
<br />
Double the recycle time? LOL. That's being GENEROUS.<br />
<br />
Instill Doubt goes through an animation sequence. It goes through all of your attacks. This takes awhile to do. It then fires off.<br />
<br />
More often than not it does nothing. THEN you have another wait period for the button to un-grey.<br />
<br />
As stated above, when I used it in an adventure I was tanking to help with aggro, most mobs would be around 1/3 to 1/2 way dead before the FIRST one &quot;fired.&quot; It would usually do nothing. So I'd click it again. By the time the second one fired the mob would be close to death, or running.<br />
<br />
A few times the mob would die while I was going through the second round of animations, and I'd get the ever fun &quot;You can't intimidate yourself&quot; spam.<br />
<br />
The button does not ungrey after you get that message, btw. You then have to wait for it to recycle.<br />
<br />
If warriors want ID ... I say give it to them.<br />
<br />
I got no problems allowing warriors in on the &quot;action&quot; of intimidation. As someone stated above, it's not all that out of character to think monsters would be afraid of a blood-raged, frenzied warrior on the rampage. So it's a skill that's in character. The other TWO melee classes (rogues and monks) as well as bards have the skill. So it's not a class exclusive thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that's the tool you all think will help you maintain aggro, write sony, post about it, whatever.<br />
<br />
1- You've got my full support on getting new skills.<br />
<br />
2-You've got my full support on getting THAT skill.<br />
<br />
3-You've got my full support on getting something to help with aggro generation.<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to point out how bad a tool it really is. I welcome all of  you to give it a try. Go to test, /testbuff a monk, and play with the tool.<br />
<br />
It's not that good. I think the warrior class would be better served trying to find an aggro generation fix elsewhere.<br />

&quot;Do monks honestly think they should be tanks? I have always considered monks pullers/dps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most monks considered themselves to be pullers/dps too. And didn't bother much with tanking except in extreme circumstances (like &quot;OH SHI ... INC LOTS, I'll offtank for a sec here till someone camps).<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree that they have been marginalized in these areas lately,&quot;<br />
<br />
Hammer meet nail.<br />
<br />
Monks are pretty marginalized in their two primary roles, and had their third, mini-role, of being a semi-adequate tank, totally gimped.<br />
<br />
Not a whole lot left for the class. Sub-par DPS. They can't pull as well as others in a lot of situations. (Some are going to say that monks still pull raids, but you know, it's the same train of thought with warriors and knight tanking. Monk pulling is marginalized so much, it won't be long until other classes pull raids just as well, or better and then they got nothing left, but sub-par DPS).<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;but I really think they would be smarter to try to get their role back than to try to make an argument for competing for the already overcrowded tank spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I agree with that ... in fact, I never wanted to tank as a monk ... the problem is ... we're not getting any of our roles back from SOE. Nada. There will be no monk fix of any merit.<br />
<br />
Monks aren't the best at anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least DPS stacks...you only need 1 tank per group and there's already 3 classes that do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, but even warriors can bring sub-par DPS to a raid to stack.<br />
<br />
Anyways ... for what it's worth ... the ONLY reason I as a monk want my old mitigation back is this:<br />
<br />
I want to be able to PULL BETTER.<br />
<br />
Less max hits ... less STUNS while pulling ...<br />
<br />
It'd make me do one of, what I THOUGHT, was my primary jobs ... BETTER.<br />
<br />
That's all I want.<br />
<br />
And it's probably not going to happen.<br />

But it don't matter. Pacification ... Lull ... Harmony ... there's just not much use for monk pulling anyways.</div></div><hr />

There are ONLY 3 of you that tank efficiently.<br />
<br />
ONLY.<br />
<br />
There are atleast 7 classes that do DPS, and almost ALL classes right now are doing pretty good DPS.<br />
<br />
Tank spot is hardly over crowded.<br />
<br />
I have ALWAYS considered myself a light tank.<br />
<br />
Did I ever expect to tank bosses, no not really.<br />
<br />
I didn't however expect that i would have to basically complete the game to be able to tank even passably well.<br />
<br />
I am in a tiny tiny minority of monks along with Vabtoo, that have access to the PoTime and are in guilds that are farming that place.<br />
<br />
My GOOD fortune.<br />
<br />
What about everyone else?<br />
<br />
I made my monk cause he could tank, cause he could solo.<br />
<br />
I didn't make him to pull shit. They could take that role away I couldn't care, I enjoy it, its fun, but thats not the reason I made my monk.<br />
<br />
I certainly didn't make my monk to stand behind a mob and mash Flying Kick, or else I would have made a rogue and mashed Backstab and do better damage.<br />
<br />
I made a monk cause they could stand up toe to toe with a mob and not be slapped around like a little girl.</div></div><hr />

Well done for pointing out the completely obvious.<br />
<br />
There are still twice as many DPS classes which have to compete for a limited number of group spots.<br />
<br />
Compared to half that number of Tank spots.<br />
<br />
Put it like this.<br />
<br />
I see &quot;Need a DPS class for X&quot; lasts a LOT shorter and is repeated less often, then &quot;Need a tank for X&quot;<br />
<br />
So what does that tell you? Despite limited spots, there are less tanks then there are DPS classes and DPS class roles are filled a LOT faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Group = Tank Healer Slower/CC DPS DPS DPS<br />

<br />
Thanks for putting words into my mouth, but I am quite capable of making my own mistakes without you deciding on mine for me.<br />
<br />
I never said it was harder.<br />
<br />
That wasn't the point, the point was that whist there are 3 spots for DPS, there are 7 or more classes that can fill that spot, there are also a HELL of a lot more Rogues, Rangers, Monks, Wizards playing them game then there are Paladins/Shadowknights...perhaps there are quite a few warriors, its not really a class I have thought of as 'lacking' in the numbers department.<br />
<br />
You can't deny however that there are more Monks, Rangers, Rogues and wizards then there are Knights. Hell even if you combined PAL&amp;SHD and just called them Knights, they still wouldn't add up to the number of Monks. Rogues etc etc<br />
<br />
You get the idea?<br />
<br />
More Monks playing then Knights.<br />
More Rogues playing then Knights<br />
More Rangers playing then Knights<br />
More Wizards Playing then Knights<br />
<br />
So there are 4 times the number of people, spread across 7 classes competing for 3 spots.<br />
<br />
Whilst you compete with half that number of classes and about a quarter of the number of actual players.<br />
<br />
Yet you talk about crowded?<br />
<br />
Absolute rubbish.<br />
<br />
There is more then enough room for 4 Tank classes, esp if one of them is a light tank that isn't first choice.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean JUST for those with 6500hp unbuffed, that means for the mediocre monk sitting in BoT with 3500hp as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience has shown me two things.<br />
<br />
1- Some days, it's easy to get a group as either a warrior or a monk. Just good timing.<br />
<br />
2- Other days, it's equally bleak and boring.<br />
<br />
I don't think either class has it hardER, per se. I think both classes are suffering from having their roles marginalized.<br />
<br />
Hence the melee balancing &quot;problem&quot; as a whole. By trying to figure out who has it worse off, well, it's kind of fruitless. We both have it bad. And we both need it fixed.<br />
<br />
Monks have a very limited role in an XP group, and in a raid setting.<br />
<br />
Warriors, coincidentally, also have a very limited role in both XP groups and raids.<br />
<br />
I'd say we all need a group hug now, but you all know I'm not that warm or fuzzy.<br />

<br />
Well, time monks are fine defensively.  In fact some warriors would say we take too little damage at that level.  So I am curious what you would do to improve the 3500hp monks that wouldn't make high end monks too good.<br />
<br />
Second, you would have to make monks unbelievably good tanks to make them be the fourth choice for tank over either rangers or beastslords due to their HUGE agro advantages.<br />
<br />
A monk will never be the fourth choice for a group tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A clear advantage, a visible advantage in healing would be enough.<br />
<br />
All the healer has to do is SEE the difference in healing, and we will automatically be 4th choice, the same as the warrior would be first if you could SEE the difference in tanking between them and knights.<br />
<br />
As it stands, if you parse for 18 hours+ you might be able to see a small difference in the damage taken.<br />
<br />
You don't notice it over the course of a single fight.<br />
<br />
If you don't notice it, then its not really relevent.<br />
<br />
The tanking difference between warriors and knights, and monks and Hybrids is so slight as to be meaningless.<br />
<br />
It needs to be profound to make those classes the better choice.<br />
<br />
I do tend to think that when faced with more then 1 mob, is when you really notice the difference.<br />
<br />
You pull normal adventures, much the same way as I do i expect and much the same way as all the warriors I ever seen pull do, you walk in radius aggro and drag back whatever comes.<br />
<br />
Its then, when you have 3 or 4 mobs working you over that you really notice the strings of max hits.<br />
<br />
Of course having 1700ac and 6500hp unbuffed you are going to say, 'we tank fine' cause you can handle the spikes, but the spikes are still there and they are quite horrendous and much more readily visible when you are faced with 3 or more mobs.<br />
<br />
I am not suggesting we should be able to tank 3 mobs, look see what i have to add in the completely obvious, I am using that as an example to show Brodda that I feel that the spikes we encounter are large and are not acceptable if we wish to be the 4th viable tank.<br />
<br />
As to not making us gods....<br />
<br />
Whats wrong with wanting to be balanced with casters and bards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">As it is all melee tank to well in pop once they get the right AA's and gear.  I can not see soe increase the tanking ability of some melee to make monks more attractive. At the same time I can not see soe removing lr5 and Id5 from rangers and beastlord just to make monks more attractive for experience  grps.  <br />

The days of monks being thought as the second best experience tanks in the game are over, and I can not see that changing without some major changes to the monk class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about removing lr5 and Id5 from wizards, necromancers and enchanters?<br />
<br />
Exactly how do those classes hone their defensive abilities so much anyways? I thought casters were supposed to be bookworms, in an RP sense. I can't picture Gandalf, even with all that moving about he did, doing much gymnastics.<br />

<br />
Don't forget, the days of monks being thought of as the best pulling class in the game are pretty much over.<br />
<br />
And the days of monks being thought of as one of the best DPS classes int he game are quickly ending too.<br />
<br />
Monks are the best at whining though. Everyone who tanks better, pulls better and puts out more DPS is very quick to point that out.<br />

<br />
Sure you can remove LR5 and ID5 from casters if they reduce the amount of agro from debuff spells by a huge margin.  As long as tash, slow and cripple means you are placed at the top of the hate list for both experience grps and raids, casters will need help to survive the beating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny you should mention that.<br />
<br />
I would think giving tank classes, even warriors, much more reliable &quot;snap aggro&quot; might go a long way to dealing with that.<br />
<br />
Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Giving melee more snap agro, just makes the game boring in experience groups and trivilize many raid encounters.  It is important to get many raid mobs slowed ASAP, and part of the debuffers fun is getting agro but living through it.</div></div><hr />

Since knights can tank anything a warrior can ...<br />
<br />
that argument pretty much doesn't hold weight anymore.<br />
<br />
But it's always nice to hear the same old tired song again.<br />

So I am curious what you would do to improve the 3500hp monks that wouldn't make high end monks too good.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Avoidance mods on monk-only gear that doesn't have 60 AC.<br />
<br />
Simple, easy to implement, easy to balance, fixes the problem, doesn't fix the non-problem, doesn't cause any new problems.<br />
<br />
Something like +1 avoidance on PoH legs (meaningless, but why not?), +2 on HoT legs, +10 on elemental legs (starts to make a detectable difference with a full set).<br />
<br />

TI feel that monks need ~60 avoidance to be where they should be defensively.  This should be what the monk AC bonus is.  Not some retarded mitigation AC.</div></div><hr />

I'm not gonna argue over AC 60 pants. Sorry for being so touchy about them.</div></div><hr />
