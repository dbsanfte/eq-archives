<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on the merchant's list. Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked. NOTE: This will remove the ability to &quot;recharge&quot; items by selling them to a vendor and buying them back.  <br />
<br />
Since its nerfed now I'm wondering how many people used puppet strings/ bladestoppers/ scepters of forlorn/ forlorn totems/ prayers of life for agro control / management. I assume most people just never talked about it in fear of it being nerfed like the snare pods and I'm curious to what degree you think it will affect the game. <br />
<br />
I know while tanking TZ I would burn all 10 charges of puppet strings as soon as I engaged before the hate debuff just incase 2 aa curers in group couldnt cure it so I would get the full hate value, and then I would use all 10 charges of a bladestopper as soon as the 1st hate debuff was cured / wore off and I would still lose agro sometimes (TZ turns or summons a caster) this is while using a SEWS with symbol of the planesmaster and Ykesha aug. I'm not worried we wont be able to kill him now or anything silly but I am wondering to what degree it will affect the encounter and many others where mana is an issue due to Mana affecting AE's coupled with slows or agro debuffs or an insanely fast rot mainly (or all 4 in the case of TZ).<br />
<br />
You could pop a charge off of puppet strings or scepter of forlorn or forlorn totem on any normal (non hate reducing non slowing) mob on incoming to secure your clerics lives etc..<br />
<br />
Bladestoppers and prayers of life were also great ae taunt in LDoN dungeons, its like a healing wave of marr and help tremendously when things are going sour.<br />
<br />
I dont really want to debate whether they were useful or not because anyone that used them knew the value of using them, really just trying to find out how many people used them as another crutch to our broken class and what effect you think it will have on current encounters / gameplay because I'm pretty pissed off they nerf the only things that made us comparable to knights MT'ing pretty much anything before they fixed our fucking class myself. While the whole use of rechargable items was gay it sure the hell helped a ton and was a temporary fix to our class until Sony actually does something.</div></div><hr />

With everyone being new to an encounter, I like to take out as many variables as I can, and tank aggro was nice to be able to nail down.<br />
I don't use any of them anymore on pop mobs but i have some banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We havent used charged items since they nerfed the snare gland recharge price. WS Ranger+AE Taunt 15 sec later pretty much covers all our initial agro needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, I think last mob we used a WS ranger on was our first few kills of emp unless I'm forgetting something, rechargables were nice while they lasted I guess, just time to go back to relying on another class to gain initial agro for us until the elusive fixes come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is some shit really.  Most pure melees rely on golem wands in outdoor zones ect to pvp.  Now they nerfed pure melees even more in pvp.  Grats you dumb fucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually do the sacrifice a WS Ranger thing too... well sometimes they live. It works pretty well. Oh and we use Paladins and SKs for all our TZ tanking needs during the RZtWL cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, we use WS Rangers and haven't messed with any clickables since SoL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe they won't be afraid to put good charge items in the game now that you can't recharge them instantly on vendors?<br />

<br />
-golem metal wands  (doesn't drop anymore)<br />
-prayers of life (pally-like healing)<br />
-bladestopper (big aggro runes)<br />
-wooly spider net (instant cast root for snap aggro)<br />
-puppet strings (charm, for some quests and snap aggro)<br />
<br />
Wonder if they dropped the npc buy price on these (and all the other charged items) back to normal levels at least?  Was always soooo frusterating to see a full gland on a vendor, for &quot;only&quot; 35k or so. :/<br />
