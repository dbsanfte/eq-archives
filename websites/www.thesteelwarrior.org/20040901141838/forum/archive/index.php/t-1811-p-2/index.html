<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qualtar Shylok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, let me see if I understood you correctly... <br />
<br />
total hps/zone of the mob.<br />
<br />
This particular mob is the only in one zone... less its all dwarven bandits, or all bandits in all zones.... let me just assume that you mean the hps of this one bandit since she is uniquely named.  You can clarify as needed<br />
<br />
So her hps determine how much spell agro is generated?  lets say she has 100hps... which is probably close..  That means one cast of a spell generates 100 hate points? (100/1)<br />
<br />
That means on a unique mob.. like the EMP, you would have 250,000 hate points built up on one cast?  I dont see the logic there, I must be misunderstanding your post.<br />
<br />
I am sure different lines of spells have different levels of hate generated on the same mobs.<br />
<br />
Irregardless, if taunt only generates hate +1 on melee agro and taunt agro, then its still falls in line with what I proposed with spell agro being mitigated at 4 casts regardless of how much agro was built up.  After say 8 casts of an agro spell, i would theortically gain 800 hate points.... and if taunt is capped per success (say at 50) vs spell generated hate, it would take me 16 successful taunts to gain up those 800 hate points (numbers are ficticious).  I suggested that what Sony has done, realizing that 16 taunts would be amazing too long has made a maximum cap of 4 successful taunts to gain back up that ground, rather than hate +1. since it would elminate any real risk to casters.<br />
<br />
The previous perception was that hate +1 would get you on top of anyones hate list... but we didnt consider that spell agro vs taunt agro is handled differently.  The fact that spells can quickly generate enormous amounts of hate (probably to make game play more exciting) and the taunt button can only be pressed so fast (6 seconds), and it stacks with other taunters has caused sony to code it this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Originally posted by Qualtar Shylok <br />

<br />
In short, yes.<br />
<br />
What I had meant in my previous post, was that the maximum amount of aggro generated by a spell is capped by the mobs total hp and quite possibly the zone said mob is in.<br />
<br />
I had originally heard of &quot;aggro capping&quot; while reviewing older patch messages on casters realm of all places ( go figure, they have some useful data ). It is rather easy to prove as well, just grab a_large_rat in your local newbie garden with a disarm to pull and see how many casting of stun or snare it takes to pull it off of you, then go to any higher level zone and repeat using whatever mob is handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qualtar Shylok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK, I think I understand you now... so basically your saying that is possible to gain 100 hate on a rogue in Butcher by casting tash, and gain 250,000 hate (or what ever Ssra spell cap is) by casting the same spell on the Emp.<br />
<br />
If spell casting has agro caps, is it unreasonable to think that taunt vs spell casting also has caps?  I think we all believed before that it was hate +1 vs spell casting... but I think this thread has shown otherwise.   The reality is that since spell casters can generate hate much faster, it seems Sony has placed a &quot;maximum successful taunt&quot; attempts to 4 to ensure that melees can always eventually reach the top of the hate list without trivializing the risk to casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've noticed this with heals as well, but it could just be attributed to two different 'types' of aggro.  However, I've noticed that lower hp mobs tend to aggro more per 'heal' than higher hp mobs.  I've always had a theory that the amount of aggro generated was some ratio of the amount healed / hps of mob, but never have been able to get any hard proof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, ran some tests on the piddly little raiders in NK tonight. Warrior is level 51 with maxed taunt for his level. Raiders are very low level mobs, level 7-9ish maybe, and are speaking mobs. I equipped a low damage weapon (Luggald Dagger) so I wouldn't single round them.<br />
<br />
Tried a few scenarios:<br />
1. Pulled with cleric with a single stun. Warrior taunted until he gained aggro. Took 4 successful taunts to gain aggro.<br />
2. Pulled with the cleric with a single round of melee. Warrior taunted until he gained aggro. Took 4 successful taunts to gain aggro.<br />
3. Pulled with cleric with a single stun. Warrior taunted until he got one success message, then hit autoattack. Gained aggro with one attack round.<br />
4. Pulled with the cleric with a single round of melee. Warrior taunted until he got one success message, then hit autoattack. Gained aggro with one attack round.<br />
5. Pulled with warrior with a single attack round. Stunned with cleric until the cleric got aggro (took 3 stuns). Warrior taunted until he regained aggro. Took 1 successful taunt.<br />
Then the slightly weird one:<br />
6. Pulled with cleric with a single stun. Warrior then meleed for a single round, then taunted until he gained aggro. Tried this about 6 times, 4 times it took 3 taunts, 1 time it took 4 taunts, and 1 time it took 2 taunts.<br />
<br />
It does seem to indicate that there is not a significant difference between spell hate and melee hate. It also seems to point toward (as the other tests have) that if you are actively meleeing, a single successful taunt is sufficient to gain aggro. The differing number of taunts that it took in scenario 6 has me mystified though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">6. Pulled with cleric with a single stun.

<br />
That's wierd on the surface it sounds like the 'bonus' aggro from the cleric pulling that's applied as a modifier to the basic hate list BUT that particular test seems to go against the idea of hate being added as strictly linear comparison i.e. the first taunt should bring you to the top of the basic hate list but some form of 'weight' is given to the amount of damage/aggro done recently by the taunter ? <br />
<br />
Got the numbers on the damage the warrior did in each single round? does the damage done scale inversely with the number of taunts required? i.e. more damage less taunts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i suppose given the marginal amounts of hate involved that could simply be down to proximity aggro being applied towards a 'hate list active' taunter...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>hawnz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i read through about page 8, so forgive me if i missed it.<br />
<br />
I think my last test shows pretty clearly that aggro doesn't decay....To finally get aggro I had to cast stun on the mob something like 6 times in addition to the CH and the melee<br />
<br />
an easy way to tell for sure is to have the cleric just cast say 7 stuns, you taunt off, he zones.  he zones back and if he pulls aggro with less than 7 stuns, your aggro has decreased.  if it takes him 7+ stuns, then there is no aggro decay.<br />
<br />
the only thing i can come up with with the 4 taunt issue is that there's a max cap on actual mob hate.<br />
<br />
do the soulbinders give aggro message?  most human mobs seem to so they might be a good test tool since they don't run around.  you could have 2 SKs come and let them pour on about 5 minutes of hate spells (and /log it) and see if it still takes you 4 taunts.  if it's still 4 taunts, i think it would have to be one of two things...<br />
<br />
1, there's a hate cap mobs have as well as a maximum ammount of hate you can get per taunt.  so if a mob's hate list caps at 100k, and a max successful taunt is 30k, it would take 4 successful taunts to get on top again.<br />
<br />
2, there's a formula after a certain ammount of aggro that just requires the 4 successful taunts.  it could be a % per taunt if the aggro difference is &gt; x.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
<br />
SKs have built 100,000 aggro<br />
war has 0 aggro<br />
formula is - if (aggro difference) &gt; 20k, then successful taunt = 25% of total taunt value.<br />
<br />
<br />
the numbers could be anything of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
one thing i notice a lot is mezzed mobs and taunt.  i always /assist mezzed mobs after taunting them to see if i have aggro yet, even on ones that give the voice message.  and even though i get the message, sometimes they are still aggro on the mezzer.  and if i break the mez, it will run right over to the chanter.  but it only takes a little melee for me to pull it off...which suggest to me that even though i got a successful taunt, i only received like a 90% taunt value off the chanter.<br />
<br />
put into numbers:<br />
<br />
chanter mezzes mob about 5 times: 10000 aggro<br />
warrior aggro: 0 <br />
successfull taunt<br />
mez breaks and mob runs after chanter<br />
after about 10 secs of melee, mob turns on me (without using taunt or without message)<br />
<br />
this seems to suggest that even tho i got a successful taunt, it only put me at like 9500 aggro instead of 10001.  because there's no way a few rounds of melee &gt; aggro than chanter chain mezzing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
personally, i just wish they'd scrap the old taunt code and just redo the whole damned thing and make it into a set value so i can throw away my EB weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tamurlane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">problem with chain mezzing is this...  every chanter mezz has a percent chance of clearing the hate list..... not reducing aggro mind you, but erasing the whole thing.<br />

<br />
My Old Thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=275&amp;highlight=Struan) <br />
<br />
My testing leads me to believe that taunt hate is capped on warrior level and mob level.<br />
<br />
For instance I can taunt from a 65monk with REBB on a low blue mob, but find it tough to do the same on a white con mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Need to bring in a more knowledgeable person from the cleric boards tho to clarify this.<br />
<br />
There are more knowledgeable clerics than me, but I can certainly answer the question in hand.<br />
<br />
Healing is aggro per spell type.  It is not aggro per hp healed.<br />
<br />
Any cleric will tell you that Complete Healing is less hate than Supernal Light, and that Supernal Elixir is negligible aggro.  A group heal for 3,000 total hp is also more aggro than a single-target heal for 6,000 hp.<br />
<br />
Also, Complete Healing gets newbie level 40 clerics turned on and killed in the Dreadlands when they CH for 1,500hp - even with supertwinked tanks.  That's why 45-55 clerics often seem addicted to Celestial Healing, to the intense frustration of their tanks: they have learned that CH gets you killed, a lesson which sometimes takes time to un-learn.  However, I can CH for 8,000hp+ in HoH without real risk of reprisal.<br />
<br />
Therefore, heal-type x is always n hate, whether it actually heals 1hp or 17,850.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually, Complete Heal is totally wacky for aggro anyway.  When I was levelling on Katta guards, but wanted to keep faction up for my cleric (don't ask), I'd con the guards when I healed to see if I got on the hate list or not (they'd be threatening if I did, indifferent if not) and I found the following:<br />
<br />
- Complete heal was about 50/50 to put you on the hate list.<br />
- Celestial and superior ALWAYS put you on the hate list.<br />
<br />
Had the same experience factioning/farming/exping at the Kael bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I forget if it counts how much potential healing or just what you healed as part of the hate...<br />
<br />
<br />
It's just what you healed.  If a supernal light crits for 6k but only heals for 3k, it doesn't gain any more agro than if it landed for 3k.<br />
<br />
A group heal for 3,000 total hp is also more aggro than a single-target heal for 6,000 hp.<br />
<br />
A crit group heal will get you killed in a heartbeat though, even if it lands for 2500.   (2500 group heal + cure.  level 64 cleric spell).  Not sure why it's different.  I've watched my wife's cleric die on a crit group heal when there was no reason at all she should have gone down.  Eg. It was about 3/4 of the way through the fight on a routine run at Xanamech.  She landed 4 crits on one spell and Xanamech made a b-line for her and wasted her, then switched back to the main tank(me). (Unfortunately I had popped ae taunt at the beginning of the fight to save an overzealous mage)  I checked the logs and I had 18 GSoT procs during the 4 minute fight, so it wasn't an agro control issue.  Not sure why it's different though.</div></div><hr />

That's probably due to the fact that taunt success depends significantly on the relative level of the mob being taunted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I mentioned this a while back the taunt hate is capped. <br />
<br />
Taunt hate still is not capped.  The results of these tests point more in the direction of modifiers based on what you've done to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've always thought that there was a cap on taunt. Now i'm not so sure.<br />
<br />
It can't be infinite agro for pressing taunt successfully, otherwise we wouldnt need agro weapons in raid circumstances.<br />
<br />
I've seen similiar things happen when mobs have said they want to kill me and my children etc, but not turn and attack me. Wield a bloodfrenzy and hategiver, so my agro isnt a problem normally.<br />
<br />
As for the masher vs single press method:<br />
<br />
I think I'll keep mashing on raids when MT, as the agro list seems to change so frequently, but in single groups, where there are less variables, stick to single press when I lose agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
(by the way, hi brutul)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Lesiter, I'm fairly certain that similar to nukes, a critical heal is the same aggro as a non-critical heal.<br />
<br />
(Yes, this is based on a &quot;feeling&quot;.  Slippery, I know.)<br />
<br />
You're referring to Word of Replenishment, which causes an awful lot of Hate (perhaps because it heals 6x2500 hp and has a cure component as well, all in a very short cast time).  If I ever actually wanted to pull aggro by healing, that's the spell I'd use.</div></div><hr />

Something occured to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Verant (and SOE) assigns numbers to EVERYTHING.  The meditate skill for casters seems odd, because it's not a chance for success...if you're sitting, and you have a skill in meditate, you're medding.  Simple as that.  The thing is a certain skill in Meditate adds a certain amount of mana per tick.  (The general idea I've found is that every 10 points of meditate adds 1 more mana per tick)<br />
<br />
Okay, now that it's on here, the next part of my speech.<br />
<br />
Remember I mentioned the Meditate skill?  It's a skill that &quot;succeeds&quot; every tick as long as you're sitting for the entire tick.  For all I know (very hard to test since the interval is 6 seconds, and we don't have a number to go by) Meditate might be checked against if you weren't sitting the entire time.  But anyways, the point was that the ratio is 1 mana for every 10 skill in Meditate (this might be arbitrary too).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ACtually, meditate doesn't work like this.  Each &quot;tick&quot; a check is made against your meditate skill, which determines if you gain the bonus mana or not.  Also, you do not have to be sitting for the entire tick, you only have to be sitting when the tick occurs.  It is possible to &quot;ride&quot; the ticks, as it were, you can stand up and move or cast, then sit down just before the tick, and get your mana bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Originally posted by Kosari <br />
OK .. Im adding something because a few people have tried to point out that something has been proved when it hasnt.<br />
<br />
I made a statement, There is no such thing as a failed taunt - and that taunt creates a lot of aggro.<br />
<br />
Look at Brutal's second test.<br />
<br />
I will tell you if you damage mob, then lose aggro, let that other person take their hate to the limit- a fixed number of taunts will always regain aggro.<br />
<br />
This is because taunt never fails, and always produces a fixed amount of hate.  <br />
<br />
The message &quot;I'll teach you ..&quot; that you see is random, but will always occur when you hit the top of the hate list and gain aggro.<br />
<br />
I have known that taunt never fails for a long time, because there is always a fixed way to lock aggro from tash and slow.  Damage, minor stun then taunt will always gain aggro from tash and slow combined.  It never fails, the taunt never fails .. without it aggro is not gained.  Taunt does not fail.<br />
<br />
Kosari  <br />
<br />
Kosari, you need to go back and read the log where Brutal taunted the guard 7 times in a row, without the guard giving the &quot;interfere&quot; message.  It wasn't until he got 4 interfere messages that the guard switched to him.  Obviously those 7 taunts totally failed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Originally posted by Flair <br />
My apologies slight thread de-rail<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
From a sheer technical standpoint this is extremely unlikely.  There would be a performance impact of managing 100+ person hate lists...I'm fairly certain there is a list cap of some kind (again no proof...just experience in writing high performace systems).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Interesting you have access to their data dictionary?  I'd be very interested in asking you several questions if you do (this is not sarcasm i am being sincere).  Also DWORD is an MS SDK defined term yes?  That would mean access to their architecture structure or is is a guess they use SDK framework?  <br />
<br />
Well, I believe (my opinion) that the hate list determines who gets faction hits from the mob when it dies.  I have noticed with my cleric in Kael when I am healing on boss mobs that sometimes I get faction hits, and sometimes I don't (pissed me off when I didn't get a hit from KT).  When this happened to me, I petitioned it as a bug, and talked to a GM about it.  He told me that there was a limit on how many people were on the list, and that I probably wasn't high enough up to stay on it.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if he was correct about this, because I have found that if I don't heal, but simply drop a 6 point nuke on the mob, I always get a faction hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Originally posted by Hussar <br />
I believe that is true.  In fact, I have a bit of evidence to support it.  The final mob for the Loyalist shield of honor quest requires vampyre bane weapons to hit.  Weapons without vamp bane get the immune message.  I have zero proc aggro weapons, so my choice when I was going to tank him was either duel wield bane piercers, or stick with my usual aggro weapon, Greatstaff of the Four Winds.  GSot4W is a pure dps aggro weapon.  It does have a proc, but it's a minor 75pt dd, that doesn't even really matter.  I decided to test a theory I had, which was about the same as what I quoted at the beginning of the post.  So I used my staff, and I kept aggro perfectly well.  I didn't even proc for the first half of the fight either.  My dps was around 1 maybe with procs towards the end, yet I didn't lose aggro once.<br />
<br />
Heh, I'm good at posting about random things that people mention, even if they aren't directly related =p  <br />
<br />
This is really interesting, but I think there is another explaination. <br />
<br />
If it is true that it is your POTENTIAL damage that generates your hate, then bigger is always better, regardless of whether or not you actually hit.  I think however that it is actual damage that matters.  When I am assisting, and using a big weapon, I generally don't get aggro with it, unless I generate some really big hits.<br />
<br />
How then can we explain your holding aggro without doing damage?  Well, I think the system generates damage from your attacks, adds it to your hate, and then mitigates it due to the invulnerabilty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Originally posted by Gimmel <br />
Not really, since 1 successful taunt and a swing is enough to get aggro. The last 3 taunts added an almost insignficant amount of aggro.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, this implies one of two things, either a swing and a miss = at least 3 hate, or there is a hate bonus if you are actually attacking the mob.  To be attacking you must have autoattack on, I think elsewhere someone bashed and it didn't have the desired effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Originally posted by Haass <br />
As requested, Boggle Tests.  My chanter doesn't have that great a mana pool tho and no MP4 item, so I didn't get in as many boggles as I could have.<br />
<br />
<br />
14 Boggles, again, 4 successful taunts to pull it off the chanter.  Sure looks like the hate list wraps to me.  <br />
<br />
I don't think your data supports your conclusion.  Boggle reduces aggro,   correct?  I doubt it will reduce it to a negative number however.  That still leaves your enchanter with 0 hate, but an aggro bonus for being first on the hate list.  It takes you 4 taunts to overcome this bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Originally posted by Gimmel <br />
<br />
Then the slightly weird one:<br />
6. Pulled with cleric with a single stun. Warrior then meleed for a single round, then taunted until he gained aggro. Tried this about 6 times, 4 times it took 3 taunts, 1 time it took 4 taunts, and 1 time it took 2 taunts.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
My guess is, the time it took you 3 taunts, you had done 1 more point of damage than the cleric, so you were on top of the hate list, but didn't have aggro yet due to the first hate bonus.  The time it took you 2 taunts you had done 2 more points than the cleric.</div></div><hr />

For instance I can taunt from a 65monk with REBB on a low blue mob, but find it tough to do the same on a white con mob.  <br />
<br />
I think this is a different issue.  Taunt either succeeds, or it doesn't.  A successful taunt will put you on top of the hate list, but it doesn't necessarily give you aggro, because there are other bonuses at work as well.<br />
<br />
Determining taunt SUCCESS is a whole other can of worms.  It is my experience that a taunt is adjudicated as an attack against the mob.  I have found in BoT towers that my attack rating has a big effect on my success rate with taunt.  When I'm under 1500 my taunt rate seems to run around 60%, over 1500 there is a noticable improvement, to about 80%.  I also find that weaker mobs are far easier to taunt, just as they are generally easier to hit.  This has nothing to do with a cap, it's just a matter of success/failure on the attempt.</div></div><hr />

i saw where someone asked &quot;how much taunt do SK's spells generate&quot;.  well, there's no way to tell direclty. besides the two SK lines generating tuant direclty.<br />
<br />
there's the voice line.<br />
<br />
Voice of Thule  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3410&amp;source=Live) 12% buff<br />
Voice of Terris  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1228&amp;source=Live) 10% buff<br />
Voice of Death  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1227&amp;source=Live) 8% buff<br />
etc<br />
<br />
and the Direct Aggro spells:<br />
Terror of Thule  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3405&amp;source=Live) 600 Hate<br />
Terror of Terris  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1224&amp;source=Live) 510 Hate<br />
Terror of Death  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1223&amp;source=Live) 450 Hate.<br />
<br />
SK with Voice of Thule casting Terror of Thule = 672 hate.<br />
<br />
as a SK, Aggro is mine anytime i want it. usually with a single cast of dooming darkness. doesn't matter if the mob is Red con (i'm only 56). and i usually don't have to hit taunt button either, leaving my friend the 60 warrior spamming taunt all he wants.<br />
<br />
btw, don't hate me because i got tired of the bullshit Sony/Verant did to warriors. but since i retired my war, and went SK, haven't looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Lost track of this thread and missed the &quot;boggle&quot; stuff.  I think Haas' tests can be explained by what we have already learned in the thread.  The enchanter pulls and gets the &quot;aggro bonus&quot; for being the first on the hate list.   The warrior has done nothing to the mob, and is at zero hate.  The enchanter boggles themselves down to zero, but hate cannot go negative (making an assumption here).  Now the enchanter has zero hate plus the pull aggro bonus.  We have shown the pull aggro bonus is four times the value added by taunt, so it *should* take 4 successful taunts to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Of course that's assuming that hate cannot go negative.  If hate *can* go negative, then an enchanter should be able to pull a mob, get some aggro on it, and then boggle it until it would leave them and attack another kos person who has done nothing to the mob but is standing at the same distance from the mob as the enchanter.  To me, the concept of negative aggro doesn't make a lot of sense, and I tend to think aggro stops at zero.  I have no proof of this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Then the slightly weird one:<br />
6. Pulled with cleric with a single stun. Warrior then meleed for a single round, then taunted until he gained aggro. Tried this about 6 times, 4 times it took 3 taunts, 1 time it took 4 taunts, and 1 time it took 2 taunts.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guess is, the time it took you 3 taunts, you had done 1 more point of damage than the cleric, so you were on top of the hate list, but didn't have aggro yet due to the first hate bonus. The time it took you 2 taunts you had done 2 more points than the cleric.<br />
<br />
There's a problem with this, stun aggro is good enough to beat out slows and such, it is not physically possible for me with my 15/20 16/20 Dual wield set up to out aggro a knight spell pull in one round (or 5). The 51 warrior should not have managed to - with one round from a luggald dagger ! -  overset the aggro from all but the pull bonus. <br />
<br />
If that's the case then we have a problem with our initial idea about where the aggro is applied.<br />
<br />
Cleric pulls with stun = 200 hate say + pull bonus (call it twenty) = 220<br />
Warrior does minor damage = 5-15 hate (for the sake of arguement)<br />
<br />
At this point he taunts, according to our theory the taunt brings him up to the top of the hate list not including bonuses i.e. he goes FROM 15 up to 200 This means the minor damage done previously should no longer have bearing upon the hate equation and it should still take 4 taunts to overcome the bonus. <br />
<br />
What the example seems to suggest is that previous damage done somehow add's 'weight' to the taunt thus overcoming the bonus sooner. <br />
<br />
That or stun hate is not applied in the same manner as damage hate to the basic hate list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Heyas-<br />
<br />
The &quot;hate&quot; value would *probably* be an unsigned integer variable... those, by definition, can't go negative.  No negative sign.<br />
<br />
But, depending on how they are operated on, they CAN wrap- that means, instead of going negative, they go to their maximum possible value when they go &quot;below&quot; zero (to avoid nasty exception errors at a guess).  Can also happen with signed variables actually, but those are only used when you WANT to allow negative numbers (which, as pointed out, doesn't make much sense for a hate list).  This is basically what happened  with faction at one point (rollover from max kos to max ally), a few stat rollover bugs, etc. and is due to faulty or non-existant limit checking.<br />
<br />
How this would interact with taunt is nebulous and purely hypothetical, but if they were using some type of bit shift or offset to apply taunt values, and they used one that wasn't appropriate for the at-some-point-greatly-expanded hate list, it might take several taunts to do what one was supposed to.  That's my completely uninformed guess anyway.  Doesn't take any magic, just some sloppy and inconsistent coding.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way:<br />
-eq starts, no negative mods or adjustments to hate, taunt and hate list variables consistent and synced.<br />
-hate list gets revamp, greatly expanded for new 32k++ hp mobs in velious; taunt and hate list now &quot;out of sync&quot;, but extremely rare and hard to catch; might take 2 successful taunts in certain extremely rare cases (tank fresh on hate list at the end of a very long fight, for example), easy to miss or pass off as a fluke.<br />
-AA modifiers and hate reduction spells/effects get added; now hate list can be wrapped by going negative.<br />
<br />
And, until the june/july patch, I'd not seen the 4-taunts-to-succeed effect quite so blatantly, so at a guess something else might have changed then as well.  Hard to say for sure tho.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just a hypothesis, seems consistent but might be totally wrong and is definitely totally speculative.<br />

<br />
If the hate list wrapped in any meaningful way, every Emp, Seru and Aten Ha Ra fight would be a ping pong disaster once the hate list wrapped, since the MA would move to the bottom of the hate list and #2 on the hate list (wizard or whoever) would run to the top and get splattered, meaning end of encounter as the mob ran loose and wiped the raid.<br />
<br />
If hate list doesn't wrap on a marathon Luclin fight, it's not going to wrap anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Since this does not happen (that is, Seru is killed with minimal pingponging), I'm forced to conclude that this hate list wrapping is a bunch of wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
The only real useful thing I see out of this testing is that there are modifers applied to the hate list which are separate from the actual hate list.  These include: Autoattack on. First aggro.  Proximity. (modified) Level - that is, sitting or not. <br />
<br />
Taunt checks against the unmodified hate list, leading to weird results when the hate modifiers are taken into account.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Herrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Interested in this boggle theory after an enchie friend of mine complained about continuing to boggle a mob she had mezzlocked for some time and the warrior took ages to get agro...  <br />
<br />
Basically the thread has dredged up two possible explanations.<br />
<br />
1) Hate list wrap <br />
<br />
Some warriors think there is a chance that the hate list wraps around to some silly big number when you go negative, so if you boggle when you already have pretty low hate, you will wrap around to a huge amount of hate, thus making it extremely hard to taunt off. <br />
<br />
2) 'Agro' Bonus <br />
<br />
Some warriors have surmised that there is a 'pull agro' bonus. If you are the first person on hate list for that mob. Even if you didn't pull the mob, you can gain the pull agro because of mez's inherent chance to memblur. e.g. Your first mez blurs the mob, next one regains you agro as if you were the puller. <br />
<br />
Anyway this pull agro bonus means that 1 taunt isn't enough, and several are needed, even if the enchanter has zero 'hate' on hatelist from boggling, they still have this pull agro bonus and therefore multiple successful taunts needed.<br />
<br />
Testing the theory<br />
<br />
Couldn't we resolve this instantly.<br />
<br />
e.g. Setup the same boggle test Haass did again.  e.g. have chanter pull mob, dazzle it, boggle repeatedly.  Then...  have warrior beat on the mob repeatedly without taunting.<br />
<br />
If boggle has wrapped the hate list and given the chanter 9,999,999,600 agro or whatever... then meleeing won't get the agro back.<br />
<br />
If it has merely set it to zero and the issue is the 'pull agro' modifier, meleeing should get agro back in short order.<br />
<br />
If my thinking is dodgy sorry.<br />

Actually, that's totally dependent on the size of the variable they use for the hate list.  A quad word (double long) is a BIG number; think (to use a super cliche example) like the sleeper's HP, was something in the billions.  No way to wrap that in the positive direction under any reasonable scenario.  Wrapping it in the negative direction is a totally different story, obviously.<br />

Well and good, but is there anything besides Boggle that lowers hate by a fixed amount?  If not, then all these theories being thrown around about wrapping don't apply - unless an enchanter is boggling down - but haas' tests of boggling don't show a wrap effect.  With auto attack off, aggro is gained on the 4th successful taunt just like every other taunting scenario with auto attack off. I'd even be willing to bet that an arbitrarily boggled mob will respond to a single successful taunt and auto attack on.<br />
<br />
I hate to invok Occam's razor here, but a fixed bonus for first aggro and a bonus to the hate list for auto attack on (and a few other well known factors) explain all the results we've seen here - aside from apocryphal results, without resorting to bizarre theories about over and underflow, AND fundamental changes in how we think taunt works (and how Sony has told us taunt works). <br />
<br />
The problem is that somehow, the taunt is a quarter of top aggro theory has taken root and is being publicized on other boards. Aren't the REAL problems with taunt bad enough without promulgating incorrect theories on how it works? Brutal's tests are very interesting, but they being wildly misinterpreted by a community grasping at straws to blame someone, anyone, for their problems.</div></div><hr />

Jolt and Concussion. Evade lowers hate as well but is variable. Some monks also think FD acts the same way when it otherwise fails to remove one from the aggro list.<br />
<br />

<br />
However if the hate list has wrapped, there is no way you will be able to do so by meleeing... as the maximum hate list size would have to be phenomenally enormous to cope with luclin length fights where people can build crazy amounts of hate.  It would be technically impossible to melee that amount of hate down.<br />

<br />
See, that's the problem.  You need 4 hits to taunt off, if and only if, you don't hit auto attack.  The original test had auto attack off to supress the hate introduced by meleeing to just test taunt.  Good methodology, but turning on auto attack actually effects your hate - which I've tested.<br />
<br />
If you have auto attack turned on, 1 taunt suffices - even if you miss.  So is a swing and a miss more than 3/8s the aggro of a stun - if so HOW can anyone hold aggro with stun? If you accept that taunt is a quarter if the max hate, it is.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there's a really easy way to test if the hate list wraps under.  Pull with an arrow, then have an enchanter boggle, wizard concuss or a ranger jolt.  If the list wraps, you will never be able to pull off them with melee. If the mob doesn't look at them, it doesn't wrap. <br />
<br />
Hell, have a ranger chain jolt while you melee something down and see if it ever turns to the ranger. If the list wraps, it will. If it peacefully sits on the warrior, it doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Heyas-<br />

I've done the boggle test w/ sol ro guards a few times, in the following manner:<br />
-prox aggro (no damage) mob, bring to camp<br />
-chanter mezzes<br />
-chanter boggles<br />
-I break mez, with taunt, slam, melee<br />
Reliably takes a minimum of 4 taunts to get aggro back (no emote on fails).<br />
<br />
-prox aggro (no damage) mob, bring to camp<br />
-chanter mezzes<br />
-chanter does NOT boggle<br />
-I break mez, with taunt, slam, melee<br />
Takes a minimum of zero taunts, depending mostly on distance and whether slam connects.<br />
<br />
There isn't any initial aggro, pull aggro, or other hate list modifiers involved with respect to the chanter, and I personally can't think of a non-wrap explanation for the effect without making some really bizarre assumptions.<br />
<br />
I'd also note that there's a bunch of aggro reducer effects (AAs) that could be mucking things up, as well as the straight hate reducer spells/effects.<br />
<br />
I'd also guess that they are using some type of bit-level overlays/xors/whatever, for efficiency.  Division and percentages and such (floating point calculations) are just too &quot;expensive&quot; computationally for such common use on a mmorpg (or even well written MUDs).  Something like a 2 bit offset could explain the 4-taunts-to-succeed observation (i.e. 2 bits = 4 discrete states, 00 01 10 11).  Or not...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Ok, that's plain weird.<br />
<br />
The simplest explanation is that boggle is broken, but I'm still not sure I buy the whole wrapping thing.  Because if it did wrap, then it would unwrap once you established aggro again.<br />
<br />
Consider:<br />
- enchanter has X (where X&lt; 400) hate from mez<br />
- enchanter boggles, wrapping to *large number* of hate<br />
- you taunt 4 times getting *large number* +1 hate (which is at the edge of the taunt 'limit' - or max value of the variable)<br />
- you then get melee aggro - once you get no more than 400 aggro (which is less than 600 damage), you will go over the top of the limit<br />
- mob makes beeline for enchanter<br />
<br />
So, if the mob makes a beeline for the enchanter shortly after being taunted off and requires 4+ MORE taunts to get off, you'd be wrapping. If this happens, ok.  If not, this means that boggle - or possibly other negative aggro spells - are broken, and suffer from edge effects if you go below zero aggro.  It doesn't display true wrapping, but it does have some weirdness.<br />
<br />
Then again these sorts of edge effects, while worth investigating, don't effect the day to day performance of taunt.<br />
<br />
Because we choose to test taunt under situations it wouldn't normally be used at, it can give us deceptive results that while interesting, don't help us predict how it will work in real situations.<br />
<br />
Shrug. I still think the conclusions being drawn from this thread - such as taunt giving 1/4 of the total top of the hate list at most - are ill-advised. The experiments are useful, but I don't see anything that's really new about how taunt works in general, just some weirdness relating to auto attack being on and edge effects with jolt type spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Maniacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I'm still not seeing much to dispute the maxhate+x on hatelist, with aggro modifiers affecting actual aggro.<br />
<br />
What this makes clear is that &quot;initial pull&quot; bonus modifier is 3 times whatever the +x is on taunt.<br />
<br />
My guess is that x=1 and &quot;initial pull&quot; bonus modifier is 3.<br />
<br />
The real question at this point is, how, exactly, does the new information that being at the top of the hatelist doesn't necessarily generate aggro, due to modifiers, make you want to see taunt changed.  Should it change to maxhate+4?  Should it change to maxhate+maxcurrent modifier? how about maxhate+taunt/n, where n is a number/determined by verant, between 5 and 50?<br />
<br />
If you want taunt changed intelligently, this would be the place to argue.  The taunt mashers would love it, as each use of taunt would add more than just 1 taunt when personally aggroed.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, good tests would be to see how many disarms it takes to steal aggro from an sk who casts a specific hate buff, and how many failed begs it takes to take it from the sk.  If disarm and beg give &gt;1 agro, it would be nice to know.<br />
<br />
Other things to consider...proximity aggro is definitely countered by level difference....anyone who can suddenly pull singles where they could only pull doubles the level before can attest to this.  (level 55 to 56 at the entrance in chardok, for instance).  Faction must also play into proximity aggro, as threatening lets you get closer without aggroing mobs than kos.<br />
<br />
By the way, a good way to lower proximity aggro is to levitate....those levitating are now both x AND z distance away.  Other aggro modifiers....front/back of the mob....No aggro change checks occur while a mob is casting a spell or is stunned.  (want to, as a rogue, pass a mob you can't get behind that sees invis but not sneak? wait till it casts, then run in front of it to it's behind and sneak before it stops casting, and then yer golden)<br />
<br />
Low hp frenzy is a definite modifier....it would be nice for taunt to go above this.</div></div><hr />

Done that, the amount of hate gained from disarm is minuscule at best. 40 disarms will not even overcome a mere 5 points of melee damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Personal experience to throw into the mix, for what it's worth.  I've been hanging out in Veksar a lot recently.  There is a mob called a Phantom, a place holder for a named mob.  It's possible to come up from behind this mob and have a wall breaking the line of site to it, which means it doesn't aggro due to proximity.  Rather than poking my head out into the room to pull this guy, I'll get close enoug to him with the wall still obstructing LoS and use taunt to aggro pull him.  I've done this about 30-40 times.  Typically he'll aggro on the first or second taunt.  Sometimes on the third (maybe about 25% of the time).  Last night on one pull it took 5 taunts to aggro him, all of which were clearly within the proper range.  This tells me that taunt can be very streaky and the more mobs you kill within a set amount of time, the greater your chances of running into one of these bad streaks.<br />
<br />
Having 4 taunts in a row fail on a mob without anyone else even on the hate list is just lame, imo.</div></div><hr />

The skill isn't doing what I thought it would do, or what other people have said it would do. This means its doing something that we don't know is going on with taunt. This could be in a few particular cases, this could occur on a smaller scale everywhere and in every case, we really don't know. I would love to know what is going on here, if for nothing more than it would allow me to be a better player.<br />

If it is working as intended or not is irrelevant until we know how it does work currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Arantius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">WELL!  I read about 11 or 12 pages of this and realized what everyone realized and then started posting by the next page.  I made a huge write up.  It's not quite as useful now that the rest of the thread says the same thing, and I didn't 100% finish it once I was working through the thread and found out I was beaten, but I'm going to post it rather than throwing it away:<br />
<br />
First let me say that though this was a concept I understood and accepted before, that Brodda explained very well how taunt works (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=23158#post23158) .  It is important to understand that taunt is just one of the things involved in how aggro works, so to understand taunt, you must understand aggro.<br />
<br />
First let's define aggro.  Aggro is a trait of an NPC which concerns which PC that NPC currently wants to turn into a pile of goo.  Since it is part of a computer program, it clearly is determined by a mathematical formula.<br />
Aggro = Hate + HateBonus<br />
This is a simple version of what the formula probably looks like.  Hate in this case is primarily what people are concerning themselves with when they discuss aggro.  The HateBonus is the things that people observe but do not understand which confuses their conclusions about their tests.<br />
<br />
We all know that sitting will add a large bonus to your aggro.  Also mentioned somewhere in that thread is someone's opinion that being the first to aggro the mob (the puller) gives an aggro bonus.  Additionally the theory that the rampage list was always in the game, and that it is a factor in aggro, which should coincide with the earlier-on-the-list means aggro bonus idea.  Proximity is the (likely) biggest and definetly most obvious bonus.  An NPC has a high affinity to hit a PC that is close to it rather than one that is far away.<br />
<br />
The skill Taunt gives hate.  It does not give any hate bonus.  The amount of hate it gives is enough to match whoever has the highest hate value of the Taunted NPC, plus a marginal amount.  This is currently accepted opinion as well as aligned with the developer information we have about taunt.  Developers information is seemingly always accurate, but not always complete.  Being a developer on a project as large as EverQuest does not instantly grant complete knowledge of all facets of the project.  The developer quote we have (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22358#post22358) says:<br />
Source: Everquest Gameplay Forum.<br />
I am posing a question here for all the classes to respond to. Should the cap for taunt be raised for all the taunt capable classes? (War, SK, Pal, Rang). I think it should be raised. With the new more powerful spells, increased skill caps (offense/weapon skill), new weapons with high taunt factors, and the new disciplines, the taunting classes are going to have a hellacious time keeping anything on them.<br />
<br />
The skill level associated with taunt interacts with your level to determine how likely the taunt is to be successful. It does not control the level of success. A successful taunt will always make the creature shift to you, assuming that it can be taunted (Yes, some creatures are untauntable).<br />
Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list. In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra.<br />
<br />
I hope that clears up how Taunt works.<br />
<br />
- Gordon<br />
<br />
This is the source (I believe) for the common opinion of how Taunt works.  In brief, Taunt:<br />
1) Is a triggered skill that can fail/fizzle<br />
2) Assigns the PC an amount of hate to the targeted NPC dependent on the status of the NPC's overall hate<br />
The important points are that Taunt gives no hate bonus, and does not effect hate bonus in any way.  The amount of hate given relates to both points.  Point one says it gives either zero hate, or an amount determined by point two.  Point two says that you receive enough hate to match the highest hate that the NPC has plus &quot;just a little bit more.&quot;<br />
This is in line with the developer's comments.  This is also in line with the testing I have seen, though not the flawed observations made from said testing.  The observations failed to consider the hate bonus.<br />
<br />
Each time an NPC attacks, and only then, it will decide who to unleash that attack on.  This is what we call aggro.  Aggro will not change between attack rounds, which spell casting also counts as.  At the begginning of each attack round, the NPC analyzes each PC that is on it's hate list.  It adds the hate, and the hate bonus for each PC, and whichever PC has the highest total is the PC that &quot;has aggro&quot; and receives this round of punishment.<br />
<br />
We have now sufficiently described how aggro works.  There are almost certainly other examples of hate bonus.  I am welcome to suggestion as to what they might be.  Now, I will pick out what detailed test descriptions I can find in the inspiration thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1811) and evaluate them under these mechanisms.<br />
<br />
Test 1 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=21897#post21897):<br />
Went down to FG with a cleric tonight (tried it with the bot but he got owned by the shroom stuns ). Had the cleric pull a mushroom and spend 5 minutes pissing it off...stunned 8 or 10 times, healed herself multiple times, meleed, etc until it was at around 20% health and then I had her turn off attack and stop casting and I tried to taunt it off of her. I didn't attack at all and hadn't done anything to the mob until this point.<br />
(Emphasis mine.)<br />
The cleric pulled an NPC, and proceeded to generate hate.  On top of this hate generated, the cleric had the hate bonus for initial aggro on this NPC.  Let us call the unknown value for this bonus Bi (Bonus for Initial aggro).  The warrior then proceeded to Taunt the NPC while the cleric took no action.  The warrior took no action besides Taunt.  Based on the theory that the phrase 'I'll teach you to interfere with me Brutul.' indicates that the NPC who spoke it was just successfully taunted by Brutul, the warrior successfully taunted the NPC four times, at which point the warrior gained aggro.<br />
We can say that the Taunt interval (Ti) is at least Bi/3 and no more than Bi/4.  After the cleric completed their hate generation routine, they had at a minimum their generated hate (Through melee and offensive spells) which I will call X plus Bi.  I do not believe any other bonus applies here.  After the third successful taunt, the warrior had X + 3*Bi hate, and no hate bonus.  If Bi is exactly three times Ti, then we can assume that the aggro values for both players are identical.  The NPC should continue to attack the same PC.  Perhaps there is a minor hate bonus for being the subject of the last attack round.  Upon the fourth taunt, 4*Ti was enough to overcome Bi.  The warrior's aggro now = X + 4*Ti + 0 (bonus).  This compared to the cleric's aggro = X + Bi then transferring aggro to the warrior means that X + 4*Ti &gt; X + Bi, furthermore the lack of three successful taunts to transfer aggro means X+ 3*Ti &lt;= X + Bi.  Therefore 3*Ti &lt;= Bi &lt; 4*Ti.<br />
The difference between aggro generated lies in the bonus.  The warrior taunt interval needed to be applied four times to overcome the pulling Bi.<br />
The test is repeated again under what I assume are similar conditions, with the same result.<br />
If my conclusion is correct, the warrior pulling the NPC should cause a single successful taunt to transfer aggro to the warrior after the cleric's hate generation routine.  Based on comments in that thread, I would like to define pulling as causing damage to an NPC in order to engage it in combat.<br />
<br />
Test 2 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22038#post22038):<br />
Aethor describes a scenario setting up a tank order for Arch Lich.  I assume based on the description that this NPC is permarooted, to allow the described behavior.  Forgive me for not being a raiding type =)<br />
The scenario is to generate enough pure hate, via a shadowknight with the spells to do so directly, to totally outweigh any bonus.  The taunt skill is then used to transfer that pure hate to the intended (secondary) tank.  The process repeats, with the shadowknight generating further aggro, and transferring the total to the intended main tank.  (In truth this was continued a third time.)<br />
A repeated clicking of Taunt until aggro was obtained was described.  I cannot be sure based on information given but I trust that the warrior who was in range had a proximity hate bonus while the shadowknight was out of range for that bonus.  In a later post (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22061#post22061) the shadowknight describes that he needed to take advantage of the aggro-shrugging abilities of feign death in order to not grab aggro.  Why?  Because the shadowknight had virtually the same hate generated as the intented tank, but one further bonus of Bi.  Not until some of his aggro was mitigated could the intended tank hold aggro.<br />
Again, I would like to see the warrior, in this case the intended primary tank, start by shooting an arrow that lands.  Then don't have the shadowknight feign.  The warrior should have less trouble holding aggro.  Another unknown to me hate bonus would need to apply in order to invalidate that.  (Or, simply starting from a similar point, the shadowknight would need to generate pure hate at a rate that overcomes the warrior's Bi).<br />
Again (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22070#post22070) the same shadowknight wonders how aggro can ping pong.  Situation: shadowknight pulls, obtains aggro, warrior fights normally including Taunt, and obtains aggro.  At this moment, the warrior's overall hate is only marginally higher than the shadowknights.  His pure hate is just high enough to overcome the total aggro the shadowknight has.  The next round of combat from each will determine the next aggro (successful dual wields, etc).<br />
<br />
Test 3 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22281#post22281):<br />
In this test, Brutul again is testing aggro between his warrior and a cleric again.  The warrior approaches an NPC with which he is aligned.  His aggro for that NPC is now zero.  He proceeds to taunt successfully 63 times.  His aggro is now 63*Ti + Bi.  Starting from no aggro at all, taunt generates only the taunt interval of hate 63 times, plus the hate bonus for initial aggro.  A complete heal from the cleric causes the cleric to grab aggro.  Therefore the hate generated by a single complete heal is greater than 63*Ti + Bi.  This test primarly shows that Ti is rather small, as it was described by the developer.<br />
<br />
Test 4 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22316#post22316):<br />
Nearly identical to test one.  Detail not given, I assume the cleric pulled.  Giving the same 4*Ti to overcome Bi.<br />
Then the anamoly.  A single melee swing from the cleric, for 9 points of damage, transfers aggro back to the cleric.  An additional four taunts are required for the warrior to regain aggro.  A weakness in my theory, I can only assume there is a separate Bd, bonus for first damage to the mob.  Until that melee swing the NPC was only rooted and stunned for no damage.  This may be first melee damage.<br />
<br />
Test 5 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22398#post22398):<br />
Included to make it not seem that I am being selective about which tests to evaluate to support my point.  Lack of information though.  If the warrior in this case pulled the NPC, especially if he did damage when doing so, then it goes something like this:  Warrior pulls NPC, aggro is now X + Bi, X being the amount of hate the action he pulled it with causes.  Ranger causes Y aggro through snares.  Note Y &gt;&gt; X.  The first successful taunt sets the warrior's aggro to Y+Ti + Bi which is greater than Y, therefore he has aggro.<br />
I am not certain this is what happeend.  If not, I suspect it is the result of a proximity hate bonus in the warrior's favor.<br />
Part two of this test is just like three above.  A single snare is more pure aggro than 14*Ti.<br />
Ahhh, in a later post (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22418#post22418) this tester admits that he was further away during these tests, lending support to the proximity bonus Bp being larger than Bi.  Which can be a good thing.  It is theorized that a caster far away from the NPC can cause pure aggro above the tank's pure aggro, given the tank's bonuses including proximity which we have just reasoned to be somewhat large.  If so, the taunt skill while already tanking can cause a significant raise in pure hate, as much as the total hate bonus the tank currently has, assuming that someone's aggro value is above the warrior's pure hate but below his total aggro.<br />
<br />
Test 6 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=23046#post23046):<br />
Notice how the poster says &quot;I aggroed a guard and pulled him&quot; and then, twice, a single successful taunt caused him to gain aggro.  He had all bonus plus the pure hate his paladin partner generated.  Then:<br />
As we started killing the guard, my friend taunted it and the guard shouted at him, but did not turn.<br />
As soon as that happened we both turned off attack and tried again, same result, the mob shouted but didnt turn off me.<br />
I suspect another two taunts (4*Ti) would have been enough to out-aggro the bonus that the warrior had incurred, once the meleeing had stopped.<br />
<br />
Test 7 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=23121#post23121):<br />
The same thing.  Cleric pull, four taunts.  Warrior pull, one taunt.  Twice more, when the cleric pulls under other circumstances, 4 taunts.  Then this one taunter which stands out to me:<br />
 Next I pulled the mob with taunt...did no damage though. Stunned him up with the cleric but still got aggro with just one taunt.<br />
I'd be interested to see what would happen in the same situation... Warrior pulls with no damage, cleric generates hate including melee damage, then how many taunts it would take.<br />
<br />
Test 7 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=23646#post23646):<br />
In this test, twice with roles reversed, puller who pulled with damage lost aggro after 4 taunts, and gained back with one.<br />
The bottom line is that there DOES seem to be a taunt advantage to the puller when it comes to maintaining aggro. The puller can control the aggro by using Feign Death or other tool, if the goal is to allow the warrior to 'tank' the mob.<br />
An activity I often would find myself doing when pulling as my monk, but only when the tank was capable enough to tag before the mob aggroed the group.  If I feign and then he tags, aggro is better.<br />
<br />
Edit: Screwed up a tag</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that's not completely true.  Actions are taken based on the hate list between swings.  These include summoning and running after people.  It's quite possible to land a slow, get summoned, and never get hit if the tank wacks taunt as soon as they see the summon message (and taunt successfully).  It's also possible to land a slow, sit, have the mob run toward you, stand, have it move back, all without ever swinging once.</div></div><hr />

I don't see this as an anamoly or a weakness in the theory personally.  All it shows to me is that a 9 damage hit is more hate than 4*Ti and put the cleric back above the warrior on the hate list.  The cleric still has the bonus for being the first to pull, so it takes an additional 4 successful taunts (the first successful taunt puts the warrior back on top of the hate list) to overcome the pulling bonus again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen the 4-taunt-to-succeed &quot;bug&quot; happen when *I* had pulled the mob with prox aggro (/con pulling werks gud!).  Seemed quite repeatable with sol ro tower trash, I pull mob, have chanter mez, then boggle before breaking mez.  Mob takes absolutely no damage till I break mez with slam/taunt/autoattack, but requires 4+ taunts to get it off the chanter.  <br />
<br />
Without the boggle, taunt seems to work normally... i.e. decent chance of getting aggro immediately with 1, or even none if slam hits and I proc.  Anyway, to me that seems to suggest that the 4-taunt &quot;bug&quot; isn't related to pulling bonus, auto attack, etc.<br />

Sample size isn't big, but so far has been consistent; without boggle it's never taken more than 3 (maybe just lucky?), with boggle never taken less than 4.  I'll test more next chance I get/when I can find a sacrificial chanter + cleric for a sol ro armor pharm.<br />

<br />
I tend to agree w/ Tugurok- I'm a &quot;constant taunter&quot; (hey, tanking can get boring, and it's an extra button to wait for ungreying, so I can click it again! :) ) but I typically get unshakeable aggro even in relatively high dps groups despite taunting constantly.  I will start watching for indications of this tho...<br />
<br />
Pseudocode from link:<br />
if(YOUR_AGRO_SLOT==1 &amp;&amp; AGRO_SLOT(1) != LOWHP_AGRO)<br />
{Set YOUR_AGRO_TOTAL to AGRO_SLOT(2)+1;<br />
}<br />
else (Set YOUR_AGRO_TOTAL to AGRO_SLOT(1)+1) ;<br />
<br />
I don't see any real reason they'd code it this way; it'd probably be much more efficient to use the aggro list as an index instead of some &quot;aggro slot&quot; construct, for example.  Anything done that frequently in-game is gonna be highly optimized, and that first &quot;set&quot; is entirely redundant (would be a no-op if anything...).<br />

Only reason I'd suspect wrapping would be to explain the 4-taunts-required to get aggro (mismatch with taunt code), and the unbreakable aggro lock you get afterwards.  Poor limit checking also seems to be a really common programming mistake in muds/MMORPGs, has happened numerous times in EQ (and UO and AO and...).  <br />
<br />
Regular taunt- unchanged since game went live with the exception of the level restrictions on it (no change to functionality).<br />
Hate list- greatly expanded at some point in kunark/luclin, lots of tweaking since then (sit aggro, camp aggro, caster aggro, spell aggro, pet aggro, etc etc etc.)<br />
New(er) modifiers- hate reduction AAs/spells/effects.<br />

Didn't seem unreasonable to suspect all those don't quite work together correctly, tho obviously it's only one of the possible causes.  IANAPP. ;)<br />

Why would they even choose to use a signed variable for a value that can never logically become negative? If they aren't using a signed variable (which I think is about as likely as me growing gills), how could you get negative hate?</div></div><hr />

This might have been done to reduce the ability of a warrior to power-level someone by just taunting mobs and letting someone else kill it (yeah yeah, not something that really should be that much of an issue).</div></div><hr />

Depending on how &quot;taunt&quot; is applied, something as simple as a 2 bit offset could cause the 4-taunts-to-succeed problem... i.e. if the taunt code and the hate list code weren't consistent.  So the 4-taunt-to-succeed observation be a combination of 2 bugs: lack of limit checking and a variable size mismatch.  Or it could be something entirely different... interesting problem tho.<br />
<br />
Oh, also- doing damage didn't seem to change anything when I was testing, it still took 4+ taunts BUT the mobs I was checking did not have successful taunt emotes, so it's also still theoretically possible that the results from the string of tests I did was just a result of an amazingly cooperative &quot;random&quot; number generator.  I don't think so tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Well, I skipped alot of this as I am basically on limited time(lunch hour), but I read teh first 6 pages then the last 2...so I might have missd something that shoots down my opinions on this.<br />
<br />
I feel that taunt ALWAYS generates SOME aggro ... regardless...it ALWAYS does.  You can test this by going up to a mob or NPC that cons indifferent to you and targeting it and hitting taunt 1 time......it will attack you.  However I beleive there is only a CHANCE it will bump you to &quot;Max hate&quot; +1....this chance being dependant on a number of factors including Taunt skill, Toon's lvl, and the lvl of the mob/npc that is being taunted.  This is why sometimes when a chanter mezzes an add, I can taunt one time, mez wears off, and I get aggro, and sometimes I can taunt 2 or 3 times (my norm) and then attack the mob and it runs over to the Chanter and starts the beat down and I have to scramble to regain it back.  <br />
<br />
The problem, I beleive is this.....I think the Default ammount of aggro that Taunt ALWAYS builds is far less than that caused by spells, but is a constant dependant on skill lvl.  THis creates a situation where SK&quot;s and Pally's can build Big ammounts of aggro with each cast, however, Warriors, don't build nearly as much with each taunt.  Only when we DO have a taunt that bumps us to Max Hate+1 do we get a massive bump in hate...and are only precariously at the top even then and need a good combat round (and possibly another pressing of taunt or two) to gain solid aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyway...those are my thoughts on this.  Regardless, Taunt needs some real work....warriros are NOT a utility class, a DPS class, or anything like SK's and Paly's are.....we only have the tank Roll in teh xp group...and when they start taking that away from us, that leves little room in the XP group for warriors.</div></div><hr />

Try it.  I have.  It will cause non KoS mobs to attack you.  ANd I am missing your point about using it to pull mobs in Sol B.  Please Explain.  If you use taunt to pull mobs in sol B, tehn ofcoarse taunt is getting you aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">A successful taunt puts you on top of the hate list plus a small number.  An unsuccessful taunt does nothing. Taunt does NOT always add hate. It only adds hate if it is successful.<br />
<br />
If there is no hate list (that is, mob not aggroed on anyone and no one KoS in aggro range), you will have a small number of hate, on a successful taunt only.  On an unsuccessful taunt, nothing will happen. If you use taunt to pull bats, every time you hit taunt you should get a bat if taunt always gives some aggro.  This is not the case. You only get a bat to come SOME of the time (when taunt is successful, but they don't give a message).<br />
<br />
If you do up to a mob that is at 25 percent health and taunt successfully, you will get a boatload of hate plus a small number of a successful taunt only (where a boatload of hate is whatever hate the person getting beat on currently has).  On an unsuccessful taunt, taunt will generate no hate (I've done with with Sebelite Juggernauts actually, they will turn at 25 health if you taunt once, about the same percent of the time as you get a successful taunt, even if you didn't do a thing to them until you hit taunt).<br />
<br />
By pulling bats I mean, if you go to lower bats (near the KPC complex in Sol B), there is a tunnel above the main passage with some bats in it.  Because of the angle and height of the passage, you can't melee the bats, can't cast on them.  The only way to pull them is to sidle up next to the wall under the tunnel and wack taunt until you get a successful one and the bat comes flying at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Ok... so taking that into consideration, taunt is even MORE broken than I originally thought.  THere is a Chance it will not build aggro at all....where as  SK and Pally spells ALWAYS build aggro....and the more they cast....the more aggro it builds.<br />
<br />
Oh well.  Maybe they'll balance us out someday....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Rhick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">About a year ago we did extensive testing of taunt. This is what we discovered.<br />
<br />
Taunt matches your hate to the highest person on the list plus x amount.<br />
<br />
The mob will only switch targets if your hate exceeds the highest person on the list + y amount.<br />
<br />
X &lt; Y<br />
<br />
This means that taunting alone is never enough for a mob to switch targets everything else being equal. <br />
<br />
I assume that there is another factor that is causing the mob to switch targets on the magic 4 taunt number. Most likely this is proximity. <br />
<br />
Effective hate = personal hate / 1+(distance/z)<br />
<br />
Effective hate changes with proximity, but personal hate stays constant no matter where you are. <br />
<br />
This means that the further away you are the less likely you are to pull aggro.<br />
This also means that if you build alot of hate, and move close to a mob... you can pull aggro. <br />
<br />
However, the mob doesn't bounce around constantly with every hit because you have to exceed the current targets hate by a certain amount to pull aggro.<br />
<br />
I wish I could find my post from a year ago where I went into every specific situation that we tested to prove all this. <br />
<br />
Our tests involved a cleric, ranger, wizard, shaman and warrior. <br />
<br />
A quick test you can do for yourself is get a snaring class. <br />
<br />
Have them snare a mob once, then have the warrior taunt once. The mob will keep attacking the person who snared, until they move out of melee range, where the warrior will get attacked. <br />
<br />
Now do the same thing, and have the warrior attack with fists. Usually the mob will switch targets after one or two whacks of the fist.  Now have a wizard start blasting and see how much damage they can do before they pull aggro.<br />
<br />
Now have the snarer snare 20 times. Have the warrior taunt once.... If taunt is successful everything works the same with one taunt.  Again, have the wizard start blasting and see how much damage they can do before they pull aggro.<br />
<br />
Now try the same situation and have the warrior taunt 20 times. See how much damage the wizard takes to pull aggro.... multiple taunts don't do anything to add aggro.  This is why if you have aggro you should never taunt it does nothing. <br />
<br />
Save taunt for when you need it. Those 6 seconds can be life or death for your shaman/cleric/enchanter if you have wasted taunt at a bad time.<br />
<br />
If you understand how taunt works you can use it to your advantage in many ways. For instance, I am a ranger. When I pull I will chain tangling weeds and snare on my pulls and build a huge amount of aggro.<br />
<br />
The warrior in my group can taunt off me, and then I will jolt. Now the wizards/druids/necros/mages in the group can UNLOAD chain casting spells and the warrior never has to worry about losing aggro.  <br />
<br />
There was an excellent thread here on mashing vs. saving taunt. If you really understand taunt you should never mash. It does nothing unless you are still training your skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Feysboil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Originally posted by Brutul <br />
<br />
Here's the test I said I would post to prove that taunt isn't a fixed amount of aggro.  Went to freeport to visit our good friend Guard Effel.  Neither my warrior or Cleric are kos there which makes this easier.  I aggroed Senor Effel with taunt (notice he doesn't aggro on the first taunt with no message.  I pulled him to the zone and sat there ducking and mashing taunt until I got low on health. I did no damage to him whatsoever with either character.<br />
<br />
96 taunts<br />
<br />
63 'I'll teach you to interfere with me Brutul.' messages<br />
<br />
Then I cast CH with Brutor (who wasn't aggro at this point).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
As you can see, after 63 successful taunts, 1 CH pulled the mob right off of me.  This shows pretty clearly that taunt is not a fixed aggro value and if it adds any amount of aggro it is insignifigant.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
OK, I realize I'm new here, and this message I've quoted is pretty old, and I haven't gotten past this point in the thread, but I had to offer up this observation....<br />
<br />
If Brutul did nothing to build aggro but taunt, and if taunt works to put you at max hate+1 (up to some capped value), then the implication here is that Brutul's hate built up was 63 (63 successful taunts = 0+1, 1+1=2, 2+1=3... and so on).  It might be safe to assume that the hate associated with a CH is considerably greater than &quot;63.&quot;<br />
<br />
So it would seem to me that this test is invalid.  Basically it proves only that the amount of hate generated by taunt if you are already at the top of the hate list is marginal.<br />
<br />
Forgive me for butting in at this late date with this observation if it's something that's already been discussed or debunked or proven correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly the conclusion we came to in the thread.  What is &quot;invalid&quot; about the test?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Feysboil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Well, my only conclusion from that test was that the amount of additional hate generated by repeated taunts when you're already on top of the hate list is either minimal or non-existent.  This is borne out by the fact that a CH pulls aggro (being some fixed amount of hate, presumably).  Why I consider the test to be &quot;invalid&quot; is that it does not make any real objective measurements of taunt hate as compared to CH or any other scale.  All you managed to prove with that test is that hate generated only by taunt is negligible in a very carefully controlled test situation.<br />
<br />
I think this is the root of the problem, as some people are leaning toward: that the issue is far more complex than can be &quot;tested&quot; under artificial conditions.  Certainly, I think we all agree that maintaining aggro during active combat is a different equation than contrived tests.<br />
<br />
I would hazard a guess that if there was something special about the &quot;4 taunt&quot; rule, we could prove one of two things:<br />
<br />
1) That it ALWAYS requires 4 successful taunts to overcome &quot;max hate&quot; - assuming that hate is capped at some value.<br />
<br />
2) That the number of successful taunts required is proportional to the amount of unbounded hate, assuming that the maximum added hate from taunt is capped at some value.<br />
<br />
The test that would be required would have to involve the same cleric/warrior test, but do specific sets of stuns, starting at some large number, and decreasing gradually to one.  We should see either that at some number of stuns it takes only one taunt to get aggro, and any more than that take four taunts (implying hate is a capped value)... or we should see that as the number of stuns increases/decreases, a proportional number of taunts is required.<br />
<br />
That is to say, if you stun 32 times, and it takes 4 taunts, and taunt hate is capped, it implies that one taunt should overcome 8 stuns, or two taunts should overcome 16 stuns.  But if total hate is capped, we might expect to see one taunt work up to a certain number of stuns, after which (for some strange reason) it then takes four taunts to get aggro back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the purpose of the test was to prove exactly what you said, that if any pure hate amount is added by a successful taunt, it is a negliglible amount.  Nothing more.  I still fail to see what is &quot;invalid&quot; about it.<br />
<br />
Also, please read the thread before posting any more, or at least the summary post linked in the first post on the thread.  There's no reason to go back over things that were discussed 10 pages ago.</div></div><hr />

Having said that, RdT's issue probably warrants it's own thread since it is (possibly) an exception to the current aggro model discussed in this thread and further experimentation might prove useful in identifying what is going on.</div></div><hr />

Well, I since HAVE gone through and read the rest of the thread (all 20-some pages of it), and I still got the impression that the test I talked about seemed to have some other motivation or some other result was inferred.  I posted very explicit and valid reasoning for my beliefs, and I don't recall at any time after that one test where a significant follow-up test was made to determine anything else about the mysterious 4-taunt rule that explained the phenomenon. <br />

I will grant you that your test was a successful test of the idea that repeated taunts while at the top of the hate list generates no significant additional hate, it just seemed as if that test implied that you were looking for some other set of conclusions.

And I'm tired of would-be science guys coming in and attacking Brutul's method. There was never anything the slightest bit &quot;invalid&quot; about what Brutul doing. This is like the 5th time some guy has jumped in without reading the thread wondering what Brutul was trying to test, as if there were some methodological insight to be gained. Brutul's tests were exploratory in nature, uncovered some serious issues, and then delved into those. His tests were perfectly fine. After all, here you now are agreeing with everything Brutul found, in total contradiction to your initial post. Final resolution is difficult to obtain, but at least we know we don't know what we thought we knew about taunt, and along the way we've figured a few other things out, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I would only suggest that if that particular test had had a clearly stated objective (I was of the impression that it was related to earlier tests regarding the 4-taunt issue), then 5 people wouldn't be &quot;jumping in wondering what Brutul was trying to test.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't feel that I've contradicted anything in my original post.  I've had the intent of the test in question clarified, and in light of that, I've stated that I do in fact agree with those findings.  I also suggested additional tests which I've seen a couple people mention in passing, but don't recall anyone actually having done.<br />
<br />
Now... rather than play the &quot;whose dick is bigger because he has more posts&quot; game, shouldn't we be more worried about understanding the game mechanics in question?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only conclusion I drew from that test was at the bottom of the post you quoted.  This is what I said:<br />
<br />
As you can see, after 63 successful taunts, 1 CH pulled the mob right off of me. This shows pretty clearly that taunt is not a fixed aggro value and if it adds any amount of aggro it is insignifigant. <br />
<br />
If you see any post by me inferring more than that with regard to this test, please post it and I will explain how you are mistaken.<br />
<br />
Since you are an experienced forum member you should know that starting a post with &quot;I haven't read the thread but here's why you are wrong&quot; is not going to lead to you being taken seriously.<br />
<br />
If you wish to be taken seriously in future posts, then drop the &quot;dismissing me because my post-count penis is too small&quot; BS.  I don't care what your post count is at all.  All I did was ask you to clarify what you felt was &quot;invalid&quot; about my test and your only response was to say that some phantom conclusions (I still don't know what conclusions you are talking about) were not justified.  If Shikarii (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/member.php?s=&amp;action=getinfo&amp;userid=6) or Varaho (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/member.php?s=&amp;action=getinfo&amp;userid=8)  had posted the same thing I would have responded in exactly the same way, so no more crying about how me and my big post count are picking on you.<br />
<br />
BTW:  This testing was done in response to questions in this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1673) so perhaps reading that will give you a little perspective on the early posts in the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Feysboil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Well, to be honest, with a thread 23 pages long, and finding something 10 pages in that I wanted to comment on, I hope you can understand why I stopped in the middle of my reading to post my comment.  My comment about not having read the entire thread wasn't meant to say that I was just stopping there and posting some random bullshit, but with a couple hundred more posts to read, you can see it might be easy to lose one's train of thought if I went on to read everything first, whether my questions were answered or not.  In fact, that was the point of me saying &quot;Forgive me for butting in at this late date with this observation if it's something that's already been discussed or debunked or proven correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, all the posturing is getting boring.  I misread something, or perhaps something wasn't stated clearly, at this point it hardly matters.  I now understand the nature of the test as it was intended, agree with the conclusions and have tried to contribute in a constructive way by suggesting additional testing.  It appears to me that rather than try to clear up the misunderstanding, people are more interested in a lot of chest-thumping.  Can't we all just get along?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Dareis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Idea <br />
<br />
The theory of &quot;AGRO Bonuses&quot; seems to makes sense to me.  Let's say that anything negative you do to a MOB generates or adds to a number called HATE.  AGRO determines who a MOB attacks and is just your HATE plus your &quot;Bonuses&quot; represented by the following equation...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 AGRO(x)=HATE(x)+BONUS(x) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
From what I've seen on this thread I'm suggesting that having the most HATE and the most AGRO are what determine these BONUSes.  The following pts are added to BONUS(X) per these conditions and I have designated variables following each condition for ease of reference...<br />
<br />
<br />
 A. Top Postition on MOB's AGRO list (+8pt)<br />
 -TOPAGRO(x)=YES<br />
 B. Top Position on MOB's HATE list (+4pt)<br />
 -TOPHATE(x)=YES<br />
<br />
<br />
Now from what we've been told, successfully TAUNTing moves you to the top of the HATE list plus just a little more.  For this example I'm only considering SUCCESSFUL TAUNTS.  I've used the following equation where HATE(WAR) is the TAUNTing WAR's HATE and HATE(HIGHEST) is the highest numerical value on the MOBs HATE list.  I then added plus 1 to represent that &quot;plus a little more&quot; and got the following equation that show's how a successful TAUNT affects a WAR's position on the HATE list<br />
<br />
<br />
 HATE(WAR)=HATE(HIGHEST)+1 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I chose the value of 1 to simplifying the math, but the value is directly related to the amount of BONUS you get for being at  the top of a MOBs AGRO list (8 times more) and HATE list (4 times more).<br />
<br />
<br />
TAUNTing also indirectly affects the WAR's position on the AGRO list by increaseing HATE(WAR) by 1 and moving the warrior to the top of the HATE list, if he's not already on top, thereby increasing the BONUS(WAR) in the AGRO equation...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 AGRO(WAR)=HATE(WAR)+BONUS(WAR) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">soooo. in answer to that.. what if taunt is an if then test.. if it succeeds = top of list +1, or at the least 25.1% of current max hate. 4 taunts 100.4% of hate list hate, putting you on top...<br />
<br />
tamurlane<br />
<br />
Interesting.  What if taunt was all percentage based with the only fixed numerical values being thresholds at which taunt changes from adding (maxhate + % ) to adding 26% to the warrior's hate value?  Something along the lines of each successful taunt checking the hate value of the PC highest on the hate list and reassign the taunter's hate value to, say, 101% of that value.  there would also have to be some way of tracking the number of taunts that have been successful since max aggro exceeded the threshold.<br />
<br />
For example, let's say the threshold was 1000 points of hate.  Mob comes in, taunter taunts.<br />
<br />
Puller aggro = 200<br />
Successful taunt would reassign taunter's hate to 202.<br />
<br />
Slow lands, aggro off the warrior and on to the shaman.<br />
<br />
Slower aggro = 1200<br />
Successful taunt, warrior's hate is reassigned to 312.<br />
Successful taunt 2, warrior hate reassigned to 52% of hate list, 624<br />
Successful taunt 3, warrior hate reassigned to 78% of hate list, 936<br />
Successful taunt 4, warrior hate reassigned to 104%, 1248, aggro on warrior.<br />
<br />
The actual amount of hate the taunter has after each successful taunt would vary with the absolute max of the hate list, of course.  I dunno, just an idea...viable?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I'm curious about the test that showed that a successful taunt + a bash for 12 damage did not take aggro while a successful taunt + a missed swing did take aggro.  I wonder how many bashes it would take to pull aggro after one successful taunt.  That might give us an idea of how damage relates to any bonus from pulling the mob and to the aggro from a missed attack.<br />
<br />
Based on reading the entire thread, I will restate some basics:<br />
<br />
A failed taunt has no effect on the mob<br />
A successful taunt puts you at the top of the hate list, +x (a very small amount)<br />
There is a bonus to aggro for whoever first aggros the mob.  This bonus is at least than 3 times x but less than 4x.<br />
<br />
The taunt plus bash not pulling aggro implies that:<br />
<br />
12pt bash + x &lt;= pullbonus &lt; 4x <br />
<br />
and that pullbonus &lt; x + missedattack<br />
<br />
Since we also know that 3x &lt;= pullbonus<br />
we can say:<br />
<br />
12pt bash &lt;= 2x<br />
<br />
we can also say that<br />
<br />
missedattack &gt; 2x<br />
<br />
And from an earlier test where Brutul made 63 successful taunts, we can say:<br />
<br />
Pullaggro + 63x &lt; CH   (where CH is complete heal aggro)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Rather than focus on pull bonus in particular, maybe it's a broader pattern, in which the order of aggro offers a fixed series of modifiers to pc activities. That is, something like a rampage list is built for all mobs, who consult that list for modifiers to add to the hate those people generate. <br />
<br />
Do people who do things earlier to a mob tend to be the people who are more consistently among the candidates for aggro?</div></div><hr />

I think that just turning on attack gives a hate bonus. The test in question is in post 239 and both 1 and 2 misses are enough to pull aggro after a successful taunt.<br />

You could test that out by turning away from the mob and then turning on attack.</div></div><hr />

I think that warriors REALLY need a bump to the argo getting skills. I think that the taunt is extremly broken. It just doesnt get the job done. When your 65 with 200+ aa and they get a pally instead of you because of argo issues that is just plain silly<br />

Theres 3 parts to your total hate:<br />
<br />
Part1 - Everything you can do to a mob, melee damage/spells/procs/taunt/whatever<br />
<br />
Part2 aka &quot;Hate Bonus&quot; - EITHER Frenzy aggro OR Sit aggro ( if you're below 25% health you'll get ~5000 aggro at lvl 65, it varies depending on level or level of mob, never ran tests but i can tell you for sure it does. Sit aggro is about 500 aggro, again depending on level)<br />
<br />
Part3 - Proximity aggro (aggro number varies on mob and level, most boss mobs usually have a high bonus to thoes that are in proximity aggro, some exp mobs do as well ex: your so called &quot;Undead aggro&quot;.. But for the most part i believe it to be around 3-400 on normal exp mobs.. This bonus is added to anyone inside melee range.. Which is why as a raid leader I shouted every raid for the HEALERS TO STAY OUT OF MELEE RANGE!)<br />
<br />
Part1 + 2 + 3 = your total hate. <br />
<br />
Theres one more part to it, which varies on the mob. a second and harder to figure out &quot;hate bonus&quot;. Im pretty sure the formula is based on how weak you are(ac,hp, level, etc) - it was mentioned in a patch a couple years ago that they added some code to &quot;Make npc's smarter&quot;.. <br />
<br />
and the answer to your question if you didnt get it from that:<br />
&quot;Hate Bonus&quot; isnt actually a &quot;Bonus&quot; as the way you're looking at it.  No weapon, no proc, no spell, no taunt, NOTHING but frenzy aggro or sitting will affect it. HOWEVER your proc will be added to part1 as it's a spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">something i dont see discussed much when talk of how aggro works comes up that i'm wondering about.  if its been covered, lemme know.  what impact does the amount of time you have spent being the focus of the mobs aggression have on someone else pulling aggro from you?<br />
<br />
im thinking of a tank off tanking while the group mutches another mob.  I go to attack the mob the off tank has been off tanking and it takes 4 taunts while attacking to turn the mob to me every time when using only taunt, kick, and weapon dmg.  no stun/hate proc.<br />
<br />
it appears as if you are given some additional bonus (similar to the pull bonus) for being the focus of mob aggression over time a period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">The most simple way I can sum up the melee class balance issue, and taunt for warriors in<br />
particular.<br />
<br />
 When Planes of power came out, we all went to 65.<br />
 Also, when PoP came out, new spells were introduced.<br />
 That gave the hybrids 5 levels more of agro obtaining spells. Warriors were not given any<br />
new skills or abilities to catch up. So, now warriors are gaining agro at level 60 still, when<br />
the hybrids now have agro up to 65.<br />
 And also, they gave all the casters 5 more levels of agro. With debuffs, slows, nukes, etc<br />
etc. These all added 5 more levels of agro also. So, now the warrior is trying to level 60<br />
taunt off level 65 power.<br />
 <br />
 Can argue &quot;well, PoP gave warriors better weapons to gain agro&quot;, well, so did the<br />
hybrids. Everyone gears up per expantion. Can argue &quot;warriors got real nice PoP AAs&quot;,<br />
true,, but so did everyone else. And none that realy can make up for 5 levels of agro<br />
spells.<br />
 I personaly don`t think there is any problem with not having the best taunt of the 3 tanks.<br />
Thats the price we pay for no spells but more HP/Ac. All warriors know they don`t taunt<br />
as well.And don`t mind the hybrids gaining in the Hp/Ac gap a little, was a little far off.<br />
After all, they were always designed to tank about as well as a warrior,, just not quite.<br />
But, giving them 5 levels more of agro ability has gave them an unfair advantage. <br />
<br />
 Basicaly imho.<br />
 PoPs ability to go to 65 with no adition to warrior taunt or weapon skill, or AA abilities<br />
or whatever to add agro, gave the hybrids well more agro then is balanced. How can a<br />
warrior compete. <br />
 We agro at level 60, and everyone else in EQ agros at level 65. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Sorry if my post was a rehash of this topic,,, but hard to read that many posts to be sure not been all said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">We agro at level 60, and everyone else in EQ agros at level 65. <br />
<br />
Almost true, Monks and Rogues are still lagging behind in this manner as well =/<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone has thought about trying some tests on rooted mobs. IE root a mob with caster-A, have warrrior-A move up and taunt the mob 10 times, with no weapons equipped to avoid reposte, after 10 taunts the warrior backs off and if the mob is facing him, have the SK cast his lowest pure aggro spell until the mob faces him.  You can use a corner to control the distance between the mob and warrior/SK. You can increase the number of taunts to increase accuracy of the test.<br />
<br />
This would allows us to get at minimum a close aproximate for what Ti is. And once you have Ti you can do simple math to discover what Bi is and if there are Different forms of Bi, such as Bi(First Aggro), Bi(Last Rounds Target), Bi(Low Health), and Bi(First Damage), etc.....<br />
<br />
This test will not however take into account any time factors, IE aggro decreasing over time.</div></div><hr />
