<br />
I guess what im asking is would it be better to go the more hp route or take a step up in dps?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

More hits = more ripostes<br />
<br />
Get planar durability 3, and then CA/CS, LR5/ID5, also might want to put in planar power there somewhere.<br />
<br />
If you want a DPS upgrade find a nice 2hs and buy punishing blade 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kriegartorv</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wouldnt worry about ripostes that much... its a nice skill to have if you dw... although i didnt really notice a dps increase by feel people have parsed it to be a nice boost... <br />
<br />
seems like there are two schools of thought about aa's that increase the number of attacks...<br />
<br />
1. ripostes get u owned so dont get any aa's that will boost the chance of getting riposted<br />
<br />
2. more swings = more chances to proc, more dps, more agro... clerics worry about my health not me...<br />
<br />
i personally have all my offensive aa's so i guess that puts me in the second group... imo at least theres no reason not to get flurry / pb / ferocity / ambidex... these aa's will help u gain more aa's by producing more dps while not tanking, as well as help you hold more agro allowing for more spam heals/dps while you are tanking... if i was ever really concerned about getting riposted to death, i'd ask for a lower level haste but i really doubt that day will come... <br />

Take that 9aa and get Ae taunt and start on planar durability or combat agility/stability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Worried about riposte and not get ambidexterity is like not using a haste item because mobs will riposte you more often when hasted.<br />
<br />
Ripostes are something to worry about but it doesn't make sense to do less damage just so you don't get riposted.  The best overall DPS skill is probably either Tactical Mastery or Punishing Blade, but if you're not using a 2H the latter is of no use to you.  The former is only useful in XP groups unless you happen to MT a lot too (sure you're not there to do more damage, but more damage is still more damage).  Also Tactical Mastery is actually less effective against easier enemies (because they don't use special defenses very much to begin with) so you want to fight fairly high level (low 60s) mobs to get the most out of TM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious to know if having Ambidexterity boosts the proc rate of a weapon in your offhand (which would have all sorts of benefits.... faster avatar when you're swapping, more aggro if you dual wield taunt procs, easier use of utility weapons with low dps - snare whip and whatnot). From a sort of common sense perspective, it seems like proc rates should be raised... the more rounds you have a successful DW check, the more chances you have to proc, right?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm still a ways from training any offensive AAs, working the CS / ID path now. Afterwards I'm planning to get Tactical Mastery and Ferocity as &quot;generic&quot; dps increasing AAs (not specific to 1h or 2h), and don't have a clue where I'll go from there!</div></div><hr />

Especially in PoP avoided stunning blows (and you actually get a message for it) is well worth it IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone have a link to PoP AA descriptions '?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the present time it seems that 2h weapons own DW for warriors.  It's a sad state in my opinion, but it's the state we seem to be in.  As such in the short to medium term raising a DW only skill doesn't make sense.  If you are currently dual wielding and want to increase DPS/proc rates think about ferocity instead.  If you have the 2h weapons available go straight to punishing blade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought ferocity was the highest overall boost in DPS for an AA skill?<br />

Then again, I get Master Wu's kung fu, heh. Least I get to perform funny animations when I get my DPS &quot;boost&quot; AA!<br />
<br />
Woot wooot!</div></div><hr />
