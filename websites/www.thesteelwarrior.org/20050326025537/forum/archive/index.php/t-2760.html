I have BoT flag ready to go as soon as i finish em but i can't get through the damned trial of execution!!!! Can you all do me a favor and tell me what classes you used and the strategy you used to win? I'm pulling my hair out lol. Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dephrog</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">alrighty, First.. Is your gear up to speed on your Magelo? Cuz if so I think you need a lil bit of upgrading for 65..  I've seen a group composed of a 60 War, 64 Ench, 61 Shm, 63 Rog, 63 Wiz and a 60 Clr clean up in it.. Basically all you need is crowd control, and slows.. That group had some killer DPS in my opinion.. but then again i'm still a newb ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best way i've seen it done, and the way i got thru, was to AE them<br />
<br />
63+ paly to kite the prime exe<br />
2 big wizzy's to AE-nuke the mob<br />
1 enc(forgot level) to ae-stune the mobs<br />
1 cleric(or druid/shaman) for heals<br />
1 person to get flagged<br />
<br />
put the paly(sitttin) in the far corner away from the platform...have the rest of the PC's in the oppsite corner, waiting for pop..paly will draw aggo from all 4, enc starts stunning and the wizzy(and other's) goes nuts)<br />
<br />
and ya get about 60secs between waves to med...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the warrior is the most important piece. It took me a while but here is my strategy for warrior:<br />
<br />
1) put all in back left except warrior who is at benches<br />
2) before mobs pop swivel your toon left, right 90 degrees watching for pops<br />
3) when rock pops, grab the unmezzable and atk<br />
4) never call assist. As soon as you target, the others should attack. If you wait for assist it takes too long. The others just have to deal with their aggro and not cause ping pong. This is the most important point.<br />
<br />
Thats about it. If you make to exe, you should win easy as warrior with defensive. Easiest group to win: warr/cler/ench/2 65 mages/ fill in the last slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aoe,banish, melee dps - all of these are good options.<br />
<br />
as people have said above - there are a few thigns though you should ensure -<br />
<br />
1. get good buffs. i mean the good stuff , especially if its not like a uber 65 dps crew. - full raid buffs for you, a hate increasing buff from ench or sk. make sure that your casters are also loaded up - C5, POT9, kitty crack. If possible a divine intervention too for you, the cleric and the crowd controller.<br />
<br />
2. DPS DPS is the key. So make sure all dps people are maxed out with atk buffs and casters have focus items if possible.<br />
<br />
3. heres how i passed mine. grab everyone head to the left wall somewhere alnog the middle. wait for mobs to pop. as soon as they pop, i moved forward a bit and targeted the nearest rock. start whaling the shit out of it and make sure everyone knows ur not giong to call assist. if you have crap for aggro weapons, borrow some. your going to lose aggro but the key to that is to make sure everyone sticks to you like glue, that way you avoid runing ping pong.<br />
<br />
4. everytime i have failed, it is due to running ping pong aggro  - the overaggroer (either ench or cleric or caster) was too far away from me, mob runs to them, i have to locate, then me and the rest of meleees run and reengage. this loses precious seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
heh my taxi is here, will continue this when i get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We actually usually do exe without crowd control - casters go near a corner, warrior facing the group near the close corner of the benches, then warrior just tanks all 4, with cleric keeping their heal over time up on the warrior through the wave, and the rest of the group assisting the warrior and taking out the mobs one by one.  With a reasonably buff tank and some decent damage, you can pretty much clear the first 3 mobs of a wave before the warrior needs a direct heal.  Divine arbitration helps a lot with this approach as well, since you can put off the direct heals even longer with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaman with tirgirs is the win too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, i just just just got 65 so i only got 4 AA and my gear isn't that great because ii haven't been looking for upgrades recently. I want to get through these trials so that i can continue the flagging process.<br />
<br />
what we usually have in a group is a beastlord,a chanter, a cleric, a mage, a tank, and another dps.<br />
<br />
what i do is sit in the middle facing the group and have everyone standing in the corner. seeing as my view is limited i have a guy target the mobs he wants me to attack, i assist him and then the goiup assuists me. it all goes well until 3rd qwave when chenter dies or pets are on a wrong mob. this is so ANNOYING! anyways i want to try an AE group. My friend said something about banishing the rocks, any info on that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah crowd control slows things down in the trials IMO.  I would go in with all dps and just have the warrior tank all the mobs at once.  I dont even think we bothered to slow them.  Nukers are great for the trials since they can turn on the firepower if it looks like you are kiling a mob too slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no big secret.  Have decent DPS, don't ping-pong, don't waste any time between mobs, and you'll be ok.<br />
<br />
The last trial I did was a 65 SK tanking, a 65 monk  and a 61 ragebringer rogue for DPS, an enchanter doing CC, a 55 cleric (my bot) healing, and a 54 cleric nuking.  Hardly a super-group.  The monk was the only one in the group with uber (had the 2-hander from Aerin Darr so it's not like he's using time stuff) gear.  Right before that we did it with my warrior tanking, the same enchanter and monk, a ranger with epics, the 54 cleric healing, and a 57 druid doing DS/healing.  Both groups won on the first try.<br />
<br />
It's all about killing as fast as you can, but don't think you can't win without three 65 wizards or something.  Switching targets quickly is really important if you are the tank.  I usually target and start hitting the next mob when the other mob is at 5% so the DPS can assist the second the other mob dies.  Make sure your cleric/enchanter stay close to the group when they cast, but get back so they don't get mobbed when the waves spawn.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">need 1 nuker class and one enchanter with CoD is normally enough to breeze through with a cleric + another 2 melee and tank. more nukers the better.<br />
<br />
take your time on the first mob of each wave, you have twice as long to kill him so ppl dont burn mana.<br />
<br />
if its an exceptional cleric with mana, they can load nukes and melee too hehe. ive 2boxed clerics through while playing a wiz, nuked with both.<br />
<br />
never had a problem CCing the mobs, just attack the rock mobs first and mezz the rest, if you got a decent enchanter, will CoD one.<br />
<br />
i agree tho, slowing is total waiste of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
thing to help squeak by<br />
<br />
1. buy a shaman ds potion for extra 32 ds<br />
2. make sure cleric is reverse dsing mobs<br />
3. 1 mage is really useful. rod sticks for everyone and can keep 33 ds up on ya and they add essentially another melee with their pet on top of nukes.<br />
4. you can go all out on wave 4 and just run around the room mana regenning when executioner spawns. cleric should have at least 1 nuke loaded. there is no time limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladin kiting the Exe? wtf???<br />
<br />
I have done both AE and conventional groups in Executioner and won. I also failed a lot of times when we first started out.<br />
<br />
At 65 these are all light blue (or were before exp revamp a while back) and while the thread starter doesn't have the greatest gear available, he should be able to walk through 4 rounds of low blues/light blues IF he has something more than the level 55 brigade helping him out.<br />
<br />
The easiest wins I experienced were myself (starting at 62 on to 65), an ENC, a healer , 2 Int casters to AE and anyone else.  Mages were actually better than wizzies, as the pets could dish out nice damage. <br />
<br />
Conventionally, I was 65 and so were most of the people I was with. Usually something like a 65 ranger, 65rogue, 65 cleric/druid and whoever else.<br />
<br />
Levels matter. High DPS classes matter. And you can still lose if you have the mixed luck to get 2 named mobs in a wave (as I have seen happen the odd time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way I have had most success is with AE groups, but have successfuly done it both ways.  The group you list should have no problem at all getting thru DPS wise.  A few things to help, some already mentioned.<br />
<br />
1:  Don't have chanter mez, have him chain stun.  Have everyone in middle so mobs are all nicely compact, and stun, stun, stun.<br />
<br />
2:  DS potion, plus any other DS you can get.  Make sure the chanter uses DS potion as well, as mobs resist the stuns alot and he is going to get hit more than you.    You mention a mage, so getting DS should be NP.<br />
<br />
3:  Fast targeting.  I rebound the f8(target closest NPC) key to the delete key on my keyboard, found it handier there for me.  Getting next target quickly is important, so everyone can assist and start doing damage fast(When doing trials with my mage, I am pushing /assist as mob drops, soon as a target is up, pressing /pet attack...my pet does from 70 to 90 DPS, so getting it on target fast helps).  Unless you are going to be really close on finishing a mob, go ahead and change targets a little early and let pet(s) and other melee finish mob.<br />
<br />
4:  With the group you listed, I would have mage start out each wave with a rain spell(hits all 4 targets, very efficient, tho resist rate sucks).  If there are rocks, you can have mage banish one after casting rain, just make sure not to banish mob you are fighting, that is a waste.  If not banishing, have him single target nuke as needed to finish off mobs(done trials alot  with my mage, am very good at them).  Mage/wizzy combo's rule for trials btw, both casting a rain to start, wizzy does another AE while mage switches to single target, will be scarey how fast mobs drop.<br />
<br />
5:  When Prime Executioner spawns, engage and /disc Defensive.  With chanter AE stunning, your cleric should have plenty of mana left to get you thru.<br />
<br />
6:  Almost forgot, since you have a mage, make sure everyone has a rod with at least 2 charges at start of trial, casters use first charge at end of first wave, and again when Prime Executioer spawns.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of different ways to win trials, the above ideas are  not the only way, but I have had good luck with them.  I think if you are tanking trials, the biggest thing you need is practice.  I went 0 for 30some when I was trying to get flagged(back when you needed flag to get to PoV/PoS) in pickup groups.  I noticed as I got faster at targetting and more comfortable with trials, groups where doing much better.  I eventually did pass in a pickup group, and if it can be done with a pickup group, a group used to working together should be able to get thru it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure your MR is good so you don't get slowed by the Enchanter types in the trial of execution.  Slow screws up your DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kbam</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the Trial of Torture.  Doesn't get a lot of press because people are so focused on Execution, but in my mind it is the easiest of the lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I've only did the trials once and passed my first time my group was so awesome.  It was me 60 at the time 65 Bard 65 Rogue 62 Chanter 60 Druid and 62 Chanter.  It was SO easy this way the exe only got close to killing prisoner on the first mob and never even got close the time after that.  Way we did it was have to Bard play an AE song the whole time and Chanter AE stun.  The Rogues dps helps by the time we killed a mob the next one was already at 75% or so from bard song.  Worked like a charm didn't lose anyone except chanter on Exe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyallag</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A caster that can cast pure blood helps a lot. It remove a crapload of poison and disease counters. (cures the turgers the mobs proc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason the other trials don't get much press is because exe is *so* much easier, unless you've got a really stacked group.  Mobs in exe don't hit as hard as in any of the other trials, and there's no additional 'trick' to deal with, unlike the other trials.  I can go through each wave of exe tanking all 4 mobs unslowed with only heal-over-times.  There is no other trial I can do that in.<br />
With good damage and cc, lashing and stoning aren't too bad (though tougher than exe still).  Torture is a fair bit tougher than either of those, IMO, hanging has a fair chunk of luck (or a very good root-cc-er) involved due to the razorfiends, and flame is just brutal without a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So many different ways, let me tell ya one more :)  We dont use a chanter or shaman inside, outside for buffs yes but leave em there.  The KEY is the best damn DS you can get.   I dont goto the center of the benchs, its better to place everyone on one corner dont matter which one and then I stand between them and the mobs spawn points, they alwasy attack me first.  Now without the mobs slowed or stuned they beat the crap out of themselves on my ds I can get about 50-70 dps out of the DS while fighting the first mob.  By the time we get to the forth mob hes at 60-70% health.   Mages are gods in trials, get a mage,druid and rogue and ya got it made.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You've gotten plenty of advice on how to get through the trials, so I am going to skip that. I saw something else that is a little disturbing that I think is going to come back to haunt you.<br />
I want to get through these trials so that i can continue the flagging process. <br />
I think this is a mistake. All the flags in the world are not going to help you because you are going to get annihilated in tier 2+ with your current gear. With max buffs you are going to be sitting around 5700hp plus what ever you get from STA, so maybe 6khp. Of course, the chances of getting max buffs are not all that great in most groups so chance are you will be considerably lower. You can probably get by in PoV if you have a good slower, but you can forget tanking in HoH, BoT, or even PoS giants without being a serious mana sponge.<br />
<br />
There are tons of paths you can choose to upgrade your gear. You could go for Champ's armor or other velious quest armor - none are very hard to get. You could go for cultural, or if you have a lot of money or a lot of friends you could try to get yourself some ornate molds.<br />
<br />
At level 65, you should be able to easily get over 4khp unbuffed with 1200ac. With some good gear choices and 20ish AA you should be able to get pretty near 5khp. That kind of an upgrade would go a long way to making you a better tank and one that will get invited to more higher tier groups. I think you will be a lot better off in the long run if you spends a month working on upgrades and worry about getting flags later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to get the trials done so that later in the game i don't have to retrace my steps to catch up with the guilds raids. Like if one day we are gonna do RZ i wanna have PoJ trials done so i get the flag. Its also not just about the flag i want this charm thingy to upgrade too, pluss free AA is always good<br />
<br />
I've tanked in BoT b4 and its not that hard. You were right i hbave roughly 6k group buffed highest i've seen is 6150. I've tanked Laef in BoT with my base hp/ac because he dispelled everything. I've been in groups where i was good enough that we could killnonstop and med after everytrhing is dead. The only mobs tha whooped my ass were jord krigers. Sorry if i don't look like the best warrior in the world but then again i'm only human(literally) made bad choices at the beginning when i first got eq and only found out what was the more important stat when i was like 40 and i didn't feel like rerolling. If you look in my magelo modifiers i have almost 80 points of stamina going through to me via equipment yet my stamina is only 162. Anyways thanks for all the info guys. should be enough to get me through</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just so you know, you don't have to get flags in any particular order. Every flag you get counts, you just might not be able to use it until you finish up some earlier flags. You could get the RZ flag tonight and never have to go back for RZ. you would still have to finish everything up to RZ, but when you do, the Seer in PoK will unlock all the flags you got out of order.<br />
<br />
Also, I am not trying to knock your choices, I am sure most everyone made some bad choices when rolling their warrior or when selecting gear. My only point is that you could do a lot of constructive upgrades that will help you out a lot more than 1aa and the PoJ trials flag. With the right group, the trials flag is trivial so it is really not anything to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dephrog</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alrighty well.. I got my flag last night, and we had no problem.. (Well we ran into one trying to use 2 clerics.. but then our Mage friend logged on and we subbed her in for a cleric)<br />
<br />
Anyways.. our group was Me - 57 War, 63 Ranger, 61 Ench, 59 Clr, 65 BL and 65 Mage.. We did it straight forward, mezz all mezzable adds, kill rocks first, kill fast. I think we came CLOSE to the executioner killing the dude once.. and our ench and cleric threw in 2 nukes.. (It's cuz we got split up due to a named pop) we didn't use banish or AoE or nothing.. it was all straight forward. Got to the exe.. the ranger ran him around while casters medded to full, then ran to group and used his invicbility disc.. I took agro and hit defensive and we slaughtered him..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I done it we had a 65 bst( actually tanked lol) 2 65 enchanters, nuking/mezzing, cleric, and druid, and me, 57 warrior(DPS). We had a 65 warrior in place of me first, using GSoT and they lost on the first wave. When I replaced the 65 warrior, i was dual wielding CHoS and the SotB. I assisted the bst, and the rest nuked(even cleric) We blew through the mobs, until executioner, then Bst went to 10% fast as hell, i /shielded, and heal landed at 1%, after that was cake. we won, and went home happy. Wierd group but 2 chanters=rule in that place.</div></div><hr />
