<br />
i zoned into GD one night to see over 200 people in the zone and lag was so bad i couldnt move.  turns out a dragon named snowflake was there looking for giant heads.<br />
<br />
while people were tryign to get organized 2 groups from the &quot;uber&quot; guild on our server popped in and smoked him. turns out the only thing he dropped  was a combine dagger. 4/24 with no stats.<br />
<br />
then i heard about another event that just started in DL right after the snowflake one was ruined. so i ran down to see whats up.  and there by the entrance to KC was a huge dragon named fuzzynutkins. and he wanted hugs.  he was indiff to all unless you hugged him, in which case he hugged you back for massive damage. the same 2 groups that killed snowflake in GD were already there trying to attack him and swearign and bitchign in /ooc that fuzzy wasnt taking damage.  eventually fuzzy walked over to the cave to FM and started spurting out and MASSIVE army of spiders! as soon as he did however, he became vulnerable and the ubers smoked him.. Grats to them on their new fine steal halberd!!<br />
<br />
PS, the spiders only hit about 30 hitpoints or so, but when you see the entire screen fill up with a massive wall of spiders all hitting you at once, you dont last long...</div></div><hr />

A group of GM run characters invaded Rathe Mountains disguised as Specters.  There were some rumblings in OOC about GMs killing some PCs and the next thing I'm rooted, doted, and would have died if I hadn't gated.<br />
<br />
My first thought was, wtf?  If I wanted to be jumped unexpectedly by characters more powerful than myself, I'd have joined a PVP server.  I've hated GM events and avoided them ever since.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only one that sounded even remotely interesting was the plague in the karanas that ended up being the Qeynos Badge quest series, and I think it's much better as a static quest series.<br />
<br />
That they give out crap loot and NOT artifacts, like the Prime Healer's Bulwark, is disappointing.<br />
<br />
That they can't come up with fresh ideas, is a joke.<br />
<br />
They're GMs. GM EVENTS were supposed to be like old schoold dungeons and dragons &quot;campaigns&quot; where you could interact more directly with the environment.<br />
<br />
But because the EQ environment is as static and unwieldy as it is ... it's just a limited, relatively useless tool.<br />
<br />
Still even with all its shortcomings, there's a lot of untapped potential there.<br />
<br />
And the servers should have more ARTIFACTS. They don't even have to be all that great, just ... ONE OF kind of stuff, to give people that extra special feeling for participating in an event.<br />
<br />
Instead, you get what, the occasional Gold Threaded Tunic, when they could be giving out a Butcherblock Hammer or a Prime Healer's Bulwark to add some ooh and ahhh factor to the game again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One, CS in this game has been trending downward at least since I started playing three years ago.<br />
<br />
Two, anyone who has been around long enough to remember the old large scale GM events remembers that the basic plot was this:  <br />
Low level zone gets invaded either by one tremendously nasty creature that kills everyone (remember Faydedar in LOIO?) or by a horde of less nasty creatures that accomplish the same goal (the classic overrunning of WC by werewolves, which I think they used to do every couple of months just for giggles).  After the resident PCs are all slaughtered a few times, high level players show up in force and kill the beasties, and get the loot.<br />
<br />
They trained us to act like this.  They also instilled even more distrust of their CS reps by doing this shit.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, someone seems to have finally gotten the idea that slaughtering the players indiscriminately does not make them grateful.  So they try &quot;roleplaying&quot; events.  And run smack into a basic problem of GMing a live event - if you have more than a handful of players involved, you lose any ability to direct events coherently.  <br />
<br />
What I think would be really, really cool, given that LDoN is bringing us instanced Dungeons, is to have them stage one group events.  You zone into your instanced dungeon and find that one of the npcs is being run by a GM.  Maybe he's there to help you, or to ask your help.  Maybe hes playing the boss mob, and presenting you with an intelligent challenge rather than the lame EQ AI.  I think this would have a lot of potential, and would be much less prone to being fubared by the usual horde of idiots.</div></div><hr />
