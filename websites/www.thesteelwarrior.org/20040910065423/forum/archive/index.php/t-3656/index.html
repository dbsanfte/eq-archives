<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Upem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use this UI personally.  Great for Melee and casters alike.  Has all the features you want such as ability to see your inventory and armor and such from the main screen.  All stats listed, Grp listing out of the way for better fight viewing.  Also has great spell icons for buffs and such.  Here is the link to try it.<br />

BTW tried SARS also for a week, went back to delta after fighting with the XML to get it in a different format than 1280 X 1024.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Much &lt;3 for Sars.  Just a note though, if you don't play in a higher resolution, it can cover a lot of your screen, making it difficult to see past.  1280 x 1024 is the suggested resolution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sars 4.0 without a doubt. It's GREAT for melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Niadnab Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sars is great.. I have been using them and updating the UIs and he did.. have used them since he started'em.. There is also one called Ataris that you can get on EQstratics.com that one is pretty decent (my bro uses that one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sars needs a freakin medal... not only is it the perfect UI, but he made a walkthrough to customizing it that even the computer illiterate (like myself) can work through just fine... much kudos.  Everyone should send this guy like $10 each in collective thanks from the warriors of Everquest for what he has done for us.  Jus my personal opinion :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use Infiniti, which I find to be perfect for melee (I play a monk).  The hotbutton window has your weapon slots (primary, secondary, range, and ammo), as well as all your inventory slots, so you don't have to open your inventory to switch weapons.  It looked to me like Sars does not have this feature, which I find to be invaluable.<br />
<br />
Infiniti also has all of your stats/XP displayed on the front screen as well.<br />
<br />
Here is a link:<br />

The Bags. Love the Sars bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use Vert, but I think I need to check into a new version of it.  Something with the pet buff box and I could really use some timers for various things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use Vert also, for all 3 of my chars.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">sars 420 kb dl vs. close to 3mb for some that do the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Goska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">www.eqinterface.com<br />
<br />
You can get vert there, in all its different color forms.<br />
<br />
Or more specificaly, you can get vert HERE (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/index.php?s=&amp;op=showfiles&amp;catid=31&amp;sortby=date&amp;sortorder=DESC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Alacor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have found that with the new LDoN expansion, my SARS and my VERT UIs both have a problem with the compass and the little blue line that appears to point you to the dungeon.<br />
<br />
When LDoN was brand new, I got tired of not being able to find the mission since the compass was FUBAR (Well, not the actual compass, but the blue line on it pointing you in the right direction.)  I got rid of those mods and went with one called Infinity.  It's real similar but doesn't mess with the compass at all.<br />
<br />
Now that I know where most of the missions for LDoN actually are, I might go back to SARs or VERT.<br />
<br />
(Has anyone else noticed the LDoN problems with the compass, and has anyone fixed it?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sars's new compass is working fine for me - it has been since LDoN released, anyway.  I like it better than Vert, personally..</div></div><hr />
