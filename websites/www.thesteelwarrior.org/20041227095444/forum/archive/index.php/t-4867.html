<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenneys Bounces</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite works great. No arguments. <br />
The chanters and shamans in my group can tash/malo on incomings. Great.<br />
<br />
When they slow right after it still chases them.<br />
<br />
A chanter needs to cast boggle after tash in order not to pull mobs from me...UNLESS i get in a lucky proc within the few seconds of the pull.<br />
<br />
This is fine for mobs with lots of hps. (fight lasts long enough for boggle + slow to be effective)<br />
<br />
This isn't fine for ldons where fights are about 40 seconds long.<br />
<br />
Please, change the intial hate value for incite, and decrease the duration of it to 5 ticks. (30 seconds)<br />
<br />
Suggested changes :<br />
<br />
Provoke - Level 20, 300 Hate, 40Hate/Tick, 500 Total Hate<br />
Bellow - Level 45, 450 Hate, 50Hate/Tick, 700 Total Hate <br />
Berate - Level 56, 600 Hate, 60Hate/Tick, 900 Total Hate<br />
Belittle - Level 63, 750 Hate, 70 Hate/Tick, 1100 Total Hate<br />
<br />
*above are just suggestions, the important thing is that it's enough hate to cover instant tash+slow*<br />
<br />
Add : <br />
I repeat, i am NOT asking for aggro lock. I do NOT want to dumb the game down.<br />
Warriors maintaining aggro for the initial slow has always been what we asked for.<br />
<br />
Let me stress this again.<br />
Maintaining aggro on incoming when slowed is what this feedback is about.<br />
<br />
If it chases the chanter/shaman half the time, it's still not a good thing. <br />
<br />
And yes, let me say it right here, THANK YOU SOE for giving us Incite.<br />
This is my feedback to you, please do consider it.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the point is instant aggro lock, so if someone malos/slows on incoming, they probably deserve to get beat on.  ;)  I was able to slow at about 97% when duoing post-patch, where before I had to wait until 92% or so.  That's a pretty good improvement imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only thing they might want to look into are the reports of incite not working at max range. I seem to recall someone saying that even a normal bow shot will grab agro over incite at max range. I havent had a chance to test this yet, but if true thats probably a bug. SKs have been reporting the exact same problem with their Terror line of spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only (albeit very small) problem I have, is that  my understanding of the goal was to allow us to use Incite 1 time per mob.  My average groups kill at 45-80 seconds or so on LDoN, and if I use incite on each mob, I am quickly OOEnd. I believe it was a stated goal to allow us to use this 1 time per mob, which is the only reason I would not mind seeing them lower the endurance cost a small amount, increase regen slightly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, on the flip side, so long as I pay attention and only use Incite when I actually need the agro, it's not such a problem, just an annoyance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with my biased (towards warriors) opinion, I can't really think of a way it could be improved without overdoing it and throwing the scales out of balance the opposite way.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Btw, from what I recall it wasn't necessarily a &quot;stated goal&quot; to be able to use the skill once per mob. I believe it was worded more like an approximation. Besides, with the difference in time that it takes a group to kill an xp mob of appropriate difficulty compared to the moment it takes to slay an LDoN:Normal mob, there's no way they could guarantee a balanced one per mob skill.</div></div><hr />

We basically took turns tanking, letting me stonewall on the odd accidental multiple mob pull to conserve mana, so I got a pretty good chance to compare; <br />
<br />
Aggro was pretty consistent with incite. The only problem came when taunt failed before mez breaking, Incite would not scrape aggro off the enc after. <br />
<br />
Then again, even if the Paladin stunned before breaking mez and his taunt failed, he would have the same problem, his advantage being he can recast. <br />
<br />
I agree with most here, it is exactly what it says on the tin and basically is what we asked for.</div></div><hr />

I was being too lazy to look it up, but if it was an approximation, then I can't say there is anything wrong. I just need better gear to increase my pool :D <br />

As for breaking mez, like what Gharghael said: Now you know when it fails, don't break it until after it succeeds if your enchie can't take a hit or 2 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it becomes possible to double our END pool, sure it wont help regen any, but in them fast paced LDoN's, you can go a long time (surely long enough to win) without OOE'ing I'd think.<br />

Would also allow you an emergency pool for furious or what-not for when the cleric &quot;lags&quot;    /wink<br />

It's not meant to be agro-lock agro-lock=bad. Only issues I had were on re-casts of resisted slows, and even then taunt seemed to bring it back more often then not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sineral</div><div class="date">12-21-2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">people complaining about aggro on mez breaks slightly annoys me, so..<br />
aggro on mez breaks shouldnt be a problem, even without using incite. in lodn especially pulls of 2-3 mobs is optimal. this not only reduces the running-back-and-forth time of the puller thus letting him do more dps or singing or whatever else he does, but it also lets you cascade good aggro control from the first mob onto the rest. <br />
<br />
in options, on the keyboard tab's 'target' list, bind &quot;toggle last two targets&quot; to something convenient, lets say the G key. on the multi mob pulls, put your back to the mob you're going to kill next, this tells the group which mob is next and lets you switch to it to taunt it w/o having to turn attack off. after you've established aggro on the mob you are currently killing use the mousewheel to scroll out to third person perspective, click the mob behind you and hit taunt then G to put you back on the one you're killing. when taunt recycless press: G taunt G. rinse repeat until you've gotten in a successful taunt after the casters are finished debuffing the mob. thus on mez break you have aggro and the group didnt have to sit there and wait for you put multiple taunts on the mob.<br />
<br />
say it takes you 45 seconds to kill each mob, that is enough time for the add(s) to get mezzed and debuffed and you to put 4-6 taunts into it thus garunteeing aggro on mez break almost every time. with the mezzer doing slows this also puts you at least 1 mez + 1 slow + 1 tash's worth of hate ahead of the melee and nukers. and using the G key to switch targets makes it extremely easy and quick, you lose at most 1 melee round of attacks, and if you time it well when using 2hs you lose no attacks. <br />
<br />
this was my standard mode of operation even before the taunt failure message on multiple mob pulls in hard lodn missions, and the group definitely notices. other warrior's have told me it's too much work for them, i see that the same as if they had said /shielding casters was too much work.</div></div><hr />

Probably the best thing that's happened to us in the last 3 years.  To be able to hold aggro as a CLASS skill, not as a damn weapon proc, is how we always should have been.  Is it aggro lock?  No.  And it shouldn't be.  Dunno about losing endurance while using it.  Unless I'm using a disc back to back, I can incite multiple times on a mob, with back to back pulls,  and never run below 70-80% endurance.  That being said casters and slowers can pull aggro from me just as before, but if I use my taunt and incite at the right times and correctly, I get it back ALOT easier, even on slow resists.  Kudos to Sony, don't change a darn thing.  Please.</div></div><hr />

Ive seen a number of Posts that have been saying the same thing about the end cost of incite, and have to admit that Im a bit confused. People are saying that if they incite once per mob they are very quickly OOE. Im a DECIDEDLY un-uber Warrior, with a 210 base endurance, and Ive been inciting on pull in normal exp groups opn EVER mob, and barely see my endurance bar move.  Heck in some of the longer fights, im actually inciting twice ( I group with some nuke happy wizzies Im afriad ) and yet I STILL never see the end bar move.... <br />
<br />
What gives ?<br />
<br />
for referrence purposes Ive included my magelo here. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=700985</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the issue about failure of taunt, I don't think you realize how powerful Taunt is when it succeeds.  If it succeeds 40% more often than it currently is, you have AE Taunt that refreshes 100 times faster than the current one even with maxed out Hastened Instigation.  If you have a nuke that say takes 1/10th of the mob's HP away and it only works 50% of the time, it is still way more powerful than anything else any class can do for damage.<br />
<br />
For running out of endurance, it only happens with certain types of groups, assuming the warrior himself is doing a reasonable job at budgeting Endurance.  <br />
<br />
There's no way you can use up your Endurance bar on a great group.  It just doesn't happen.  Part of the definition of 'great' is that the group knows what they're doing.  A great group works fine with warrior before Incite and it still works fine now.  <br />
<br />
If you've a group that sucks, such a group will quickly either replace you (so you couldn't possibly run out of endurance because you're not there anymore), die (and you don't use endurance if you're dead or waiting for someone to med), or most likely just have some horribly low efficency that you'd never run out of endurance.  I certainly can't imagine a group that thinks a warrior sucks at aggro actually go out and fetch 3 mobs at once unless they have a death wish.<br />
<br />
You run out of Endurance on groups that think they can handle 3 or so mobs at once but they really should not be.  This happens a lot on LDoN more so than PoP.  It's actually pretty hard to run out of endurance for PoP groups because you just won't have that many mobs for you to use your endurance on.  Of course, you can also budget your endurance poorly in any group.<br />
<br />
I'm of the opinion that any group I run out of endurance on from just using Incite is worse than even a group that cannot control aggro because the latter I can save them with Incite (ignoring the ones that have death wishes), but the former I eventually won't be able to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bleh, Incite is fine leave it be. In xp groups I can use it once per mob and hover around 100%. I use defensive/stonewall (or any offensive disc) then hold off on Incite a little bit till I regen my endurance back to full. <br />
<br />
Look, I'm using an un-augmented CHoS and SoBS or GSoT as MT depending on where I am, and I don't necessarily &quot;need&quot; Incite on every pull if it's a half-smart group. Just using it when I lose agro or using it every other mob lets me regen to 100% pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Only time I ever need to really watch my endurance-conservation is in LDoN where everything is dying at a faster rate. I'm just hoping for +endurance on items or a fancy AA that lets us turn worn mana into worn endruance. /shrug<br />
<br />
EDIT: I lie, I have the 20 point DD aug on the hammer, but as far as generating agro I think the effects of that are nil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite Seems to work really well.  My gripe has more to do with Existing Gear (Vellious armor's, Ornate...whatever) getting an Endurance modifier to help offset mudflation some.  As it stands now, I can stay Full on Endurance with using Incite.  It seems to use 8% of my Endurance which regens before the next mob.... this is raid buffed with 300 STR, 300 STA, 298 AGL and 300 DEX.<br />
<br />
However, when we get the rest of the melee change, alot of the most usefull skills cost ALOT more and/or have a MUCH higher upkeep.  When this happens we are all gonna be dealing with an Endurance pool that is 3 or 4 clicks away from OOE....and since we are now dependant on INCITE, Defensive/Stonewall, that leaves little Endurnace to hit the openings as they come during a big fight without going OOE.<br />
<br />
Hopefulyl SOE will add +Endurance to many existing items as they have hinted to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it does.  I run out of endurance frequently using nothing but Incite.  It does NOT happen quickly but it does happen.  If I use ANY disciplines along with Incite then I DO run out of endurance quickly and it stays pretty much at zero as long as I continue fighting.<br />
<br />
If the intent was to use Incite once on every mob then it costs a little too much relative to endurance regen.  If the intent was to ration it then it's fine.  IMO it was intended to be used once per mob and that's what I find to be the most effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh if you use incite once per mob you are either a: producing WAY more agro than you need to, or b: you just suck.<br />
<br />
I find myself using incite only when I lose agro by a sufficient margin, when I know cleric is chealing on inc, or any other time I feel the chance of losing agro for a significant amount of time.<br />
<br />
I find taunt succeeds more when the agro gap isn't so great.  So if a shaman is slowing, I time my taunt for when his slow lands.  99% of the time that is enough, since slow without tash doesn't produce that much agro.  If chanter is tashing and slowing I may use incite more simply because of the increased agro generated by the tash.  However, 90% of the time either my procs or a well timed taunt is more than enough to do the trick.  If I hit taunt and the mob keeps running, it is a simple matter to hit incite and it'll come right back.<br />
<br />
When I'm breaking a mez I NEVER use incite unless someone else breaks it before I'm ready to.  There is no reason to use incite when you have all the time in the world to taunt it.<br />
<br />
All in all, I use incite a grand total of 10-15 times per adventure, which breaks down to 1 time every 3 or 4 mobs.  Granted, in some groups I may use it much more, and even run out of endurance.  However in the average group, and especially in a great group, the endurance bar seems quite sufficient to me.</div></div><hr />

They stated that there would be gear-related modifiers.  Although they didn't mention it, I think it is reasonable to assume that there will also be endurance related AAs added (similar to the mental clarity line for casters).<br />
<br />

Till you get the enchanter re-mez a bit before the mob you're on dies and reaggros needing another successful taunt...  <br />
<br />
that is not a problem either. i tell the encs i group with not to remez the mob at my back if the one we're killing is about dead. any warrior that can tank a grind/lodn mob unslowed can tank two slowed at once for a couple seconds. and if mez does fade early you'll have a tash+slow+mez worth of hate above the healer, so he wont pull aggro on the next heal, and you could always toss in an incite for good measure if you felt it was needed. and the very small bit of extra mana needed to heal the extra dmg from another slowed mob for a few seconds is way less than the extra mana needed to toss the other group members a heal everytime you dont have aggro on mez break from taunting just once.</div></div><hr />

If you fight mobs one at a time, you don't run out of endurance, ever.  If it takes more than a minute to kill a mob (and most groups need that much time in PoP) then it'd regen that much already.  If you can somehow kill it faster than a minute, your group is uber enough to cover for the few times you can't use Incite.  <br />
<br />
If your lack of endurance comes from 'fast pulling' then that means your group isn't really pulling that well.  A lot of people, especially in LDoN, confuse with pulling a train and then coming back and crying to your tank with efficiency.  Obviously if your puller brings back a train that's mezzed/rooted/slowed/etc you have no choice but to Incite as often as you can because you've 3 mobs that are ready to pounce on your slowers/CC person at all times.  That is a problem with your group not the ability.</div></div><hr />

i can easily see warriors without eb weapons needing to incite every mob. even if you do have eb weapons, there is no such as too much hate if you are grouped with nukers with good mana regen.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Hmmm...I don't know about you, but I cannot control when I get a proc, so using incite on incoming means I for sure have agro to get thru slow.  I don't think there is such a thing as too much agro when you are tanking.  Incite is the one controllable thing I have to use to make sure I maintain agro.  Using Incite once per mob, the only time I have endurence issues is during high DPS LDoN groups.  Even then, go a few mobs tanking without, and back to ready to go again.  I cannot imagine why you would not use incite every mob when possible.</div></div><hr />

Slowing a MOB, even if it is 300-400 DPS when its &quot;up-time&quot; is shy of the half minute mark is just kind of silly, and if you are killing mobs with 500+ DPS in under 30 seconds, then stand back and let the charmed pets do it anyhow.<br />

<br />
I totally agree, of course you don’t have all the time in the world, most of the bards I kill with attack the mob themselves if I take more than one taunt to break it.<br />
<br />
While taunting the mob as described above can work it is a lot of trouble and I have noticed when flipping to other mobs to hit them with incite others sometimes assist me and break mez and the wrong mobs are getting cast on. If your group is killing fast then you need to be keeping lots of agro on the mob being killed with flipping over I have seen many mobs bounce mid fight because I was not able to keep my regular agro, and that is switching to other mobs once after incite pops not every 6 seconds. It may work for you but the risk / reward is not worth it to me.<br />
<br />
I think that the only thing I would change with the line is that I would remove the timer so that you could slap a few incites one after the other on different mobs. The skill was though of to allow you to tank more than one mob but the timer on it makes it very hard to do that.<br />
<br />
And perhaps balance out the END cost so there is a more linear curve rather than 250/200/175/85 maybe 250/200/145/85, together with making the lower level ones slightly longer range so a higher level warrior has some options to them maybe range 150 for the lowest one 125 for the second lowest one and the other 2 stay the same. With an endurance pool to think about it becomes more of a question of what to use, a lower one then the top one or other combo. Choice is good, push incite or not is very little choice.<br />
<br />
If you want to give the damage dealers some latitude to do there job then you need to use incite unless you want to do even more work than you are. While incite does not change your END pool greatly it eats up most of your ENDr (endurance regen) so that when you do use abilities you do not regen fast enough to be able to do more in a short time frame. If we do not have good enough ENDr to regen all the END from the last dis before the next can be used then were our dis’s really improved by putting on separate timers? I think not.</div></div><hr />

Dont get me wrong I like incite but its no different than a stun taking 7-8% mana, imagine the backlash on that, and we cant even get buffs or sit to regain endurance faster.<br />

What should be done is add an AA with the next patch to increase endurance regen if they dont want to increase it across the board, or make sitting regen 20 more endurance a tic just like mana, or raise regen rates at certain levels. <br />

The problem REMAINS knight spell aggro. A warrior firing off Incite, taunting, and whipping around dual EB weapons with anger augs shouldn't lose aggro to an SK chaining a low-level darkness spell. <br />
<br />
Hell I shouldn't even need special weaponry and magic stones to hold aggro over goddamn Clinging Darkness. The dps I put out with my 2-hander + offensive AAs should be enough. <br />
<br />
Think of it this way- if you're up against 2 mobs- 1 is beating the crap out of you and the other is snaring  you, $10 says you're on the badass.<br />

Until knight spell aggro is fixed, we'll still use knights on our raids that require instant and continuous aggro lock.</div></div><hr />

In the crescendo leading up to this patch it was hard for me to envision the Warrior community happy with anything short of aggro lock and deleting Knight classes completely.  Well… maybe just deleting Shadowknights, then burning, folding, spindling and mutilating Paladins before deleting them slowly.<br />

The Paladin board (PoN) is split between those who think the sky has fallen, and those who think the changes are fine.  I think the changes are good, and can see Warriors I group with handle aggro much better.  Hopefully things will be relatively balanced between the plate tanks when this settles out.<br />

I've had a couple of druids try to see how far they can push my new aggro and basically take a mob and keep it (snare+chain nuking), but aside from that it seems pretty solid.  I usually stay somewhere near full END if all I do is incite once per mob, HOWEVER, the END cost for some of the discs seems excessive given the current state of END regen.  If for some reason I have to use a disc, then my END pool is practically gone after.  Also, I think it would be nice if I could activate and deactivate a disc, say for example defensive, and then reactivate it immediately provided that the duration timer for it had not been completely used up.  I.E., go devensive for 30 seconds, turn it off, a few minutes later go defensive for the remainder of the duration timer of the disc.  Of course, that may be more complicated than it sounds from a coding perspective, and also, once the rest of the combat ability stuff goes live, it may compensate for the minor problems I'm seeing now.  All things considered, this stuff rocks.</div></div><hr />

I saw a thread there a month or two ago whining about how they needed their heals improved.  Some disagreed because they didn't want to be main healers, but a disturbing number agreed, too.  With some people it seems like the moment they get one upgrade, they're whining for the next one.  <br />
<br />
There are certainly still some problems.  A bard friend of mine mentioned recently that after the melee improvements he was in a group that included a warrior and SK from his guild in Plane of Fire.  Their gear level is fairly similar.  Still the SK was blowing away the warrior when it came to tanking the exp mobs, even with the new abilities.  The warrior had to work at holding aggro and sometimes it would still get messed up.  The SK was just... &quot;MINE!&quot; and that mob was locked on him as long as he wanted.  He didn't seem to be giving up noticeable tanking ability either as numerous threads from the knights have tried to have us believe (you warriors tank SO much better than we do! blah blah).  So I would say the aggro locking abilities are a bit excessive.  We'll see what happens in the next few months though.</div></div><hr />

Well, we know they took the opening moves down cuz they weren't satisfied with how they were working.  But I have this vague memory (or fantasy?) of reading a concurrence from the SOE side that random opening + reuse timer + endurance costs were to high for the openings motif; that perhaps the RNG was enough of a burden for the moves, esp. as they were on the light side of effective anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">12-27-2003, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inicite is a nice tool.  Specially when you take in  consideration we did not have anything like it before. <br />
<br />
Incite is not aggro lock, nor a guaranteed agro every 30 seconds. Knight spells still remain a more effective aggro tool hands down when they are grouped with sloppy players. <br />
<br />
Tonight for instance, I used incite to tag the mob OFF the puller(63 bard).  It always made the mob run towards me after firing it off.  Nice taggin tool with decent range. <br />
<br />
BUT, I ALWAYS lost aggro whenever the slower(lvl 62 shaman) casted slow within 6 seconds after Incite had landed. I am talking about non resisted slow here. <br />
<br />
The only times I kept aggro on me(with incite) was when I got a proc off before slow was casted. I was using Hategiver+BoC combo(both augmented with anger 2).  In some ocassions I got the procs off before the slow. But the times I did not get the procs on time, outnumbered the timely ones.<br />
<br />
Needles to say that having 4 failed taunts in a row seemed more common than getting 3 succesful taunts in a row. Is there a reason why taunt must fail this much? <br />
<br />
A knight has no problems with this type of slower, no matter if he is using a windblade. As long as current knight aggro-vs-cost continues to exist, the current incite while being a nice tool, will not be enough to bring the balance.  <br />
<br />
Yes easy knight aggro is bad for the game. It continues to breed very bad players that have no idea what aggro control is about.  <br />
But aknowledging this problem is not enough.<br />
<br />
Either the trivializing aggro of knights needs to be toned down more(ala provoke line), or the Incite line needs to be upped so that it can at least allow the warriors to keep aggro during one unresisted slow. <br />
<br />
Currently Incite will not allow you to get aggro from a mezzed mob on its own(400 hate will not do it).  Your taunt must be succesful. Incite is just filler hate after the success taunt.  <br />
<br />
If you break mezz after using Incite alone, the mob will turn on the mezzer or the person who slowed it while it was mezzed. <br />
<br />
If your taunt is succesful, then you use Incite and immediately after a slow is casted(unresisted), the mob will jump on the slower(unless you get some procs or some decent damage in)<br />
<br />
We are still dependant of procs to go off and taunt to be succesful. Incite is not a magic button that will allow us to tank with a Windblade like a knight would. Far from it. <br />
<br />
I have no idea why some people think Incite works that way and continue to be careless with their aggro.</div></div><hr />

I get my info from my Shield of Strife.  Furious Bash is a focus effect.  And as such, you get a message when it is kicking in.  When I bash, I get &quot;Your Shield of Strife glows red.&quot;  When I cast a spell, I get all kinds of fun messages... &quot;Your Grimror's Guard of the Plague glows,&quot; &quot;Your Cloak of Wishes feeds you with power,&quot; etc.  I get nothing from the shield when I cast a spell or proc.  Ever.  Nor do the warriors in my guild who have one.<br />
<br />
I'm not a random noob off the street talking out of my ass.  It's first-hand info from me sitting around and casting all variety of spells at/near mobs to see how it would work.

After a couple deaths, or at least pet deaths, they might get a clue.  <br />

I use the bow when I can, then when the mob is on me, I incite and auto-attack.  Most of the time if the tasher and slower are different peeps then I am golden.  If they are the same one, then it depends on if they enjoy screwing the group with ping-ponging mobs.  The only advantage a pally and sk have is that they can build up some big aggro while the mob is out of the slowers casting range.<br />
<br />
The slowers that tash on inc, then count off 3 seconds to slow the mob after I have engaged it never, ever, ever get aggro.  The ones that tash and slow back to back or on incoming get pounded on a regular basis.<br />
