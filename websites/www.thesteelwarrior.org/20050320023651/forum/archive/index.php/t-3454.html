<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absor - a little over a month ago you came to these boards to promote LDoN.  At that time, you had little to say in response to our questions about class balance.  However, you did promise to return here later to address those issues.<br />
<br />
It’s later now.  You are clearly reading the various class boards, as you have posted on the Druid forums and the SK forums, and probably others that I haven't seen.  Yet here there is no Absor love.<br />
<br />
Why do you shun us?  There is no commercial link to a EULA violating website here.  We are paying customers, just like the ones that you actually respond to on the other boards.  Yes, we have our share of hot-heads who will do nothing but bark at you if you post here, but many of us simply want some indication that SoE actually is doing something about our concerns.  The cut and paste statement about melee balancing that has now gone 6 months without alteration or visible progress does not constitute communication with your customers.  <br />
<br />
When you were last here, you made a comment about the classes not being that out of balance.  Most of us are amazed and appalled by this statement, seeing it as evidence that you, and by extension, SoE, are truly indifferent to our concerns.  Prove us wrong, please.  If you truly believe this, make the case.  Tell us something about the underlying logic being applied to class balancing.  Reconcile your statement with those coming out of the fan faire where the panelists seem to have generally acknowledged the plight of pure melees in a game that has shifted dramatically in favor of anyone with a mana bar.<br />
<br />
We know you read these forums, we see your name pop up at the bottom of them from time to time.  Continued silence does nothing but solidify the general perception here that when it comes to pure melee concerns, nothing has been done, is being done, nor will ever be done.   With respect, sir, I am asking you, please, to respond in a meaningful, informative and substantive way to our concerns about this class and its place in this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta admit I'm kinda stunned to see a post.<br />
<br />
Its good to get some acknowledgement that people at SoE do read boards and that all the great and not so great ideas being generated here are being read.<br />
<br />
Having been actively involved on and off in the class balance discussions in the last 12 months aswell as having been both a guildless LFG warrior in PoV when PoP came out and now in an elemental guild I think I have a good overview as to what our issues are and to be honest while I have read alot of great ideas and views on this board I still haven't seen anything that has made me think &quot;Yes! Thats it! Thats how we fix class balance!&quot; so with that in mind while its disappointing to not have this addressed month after month I'm not suprised a solution hasn't been found and it is encouraging to know our ideas are being read and we're not just pounding each others heads against the wall for nothing.<br />
<br />
Grammar &gt; me, Im sure that should have been more than one sentence.</div></div><hr />

Because I don't have any information for you.<br />
When I do, I'll certainly let you know -AbsorEQ-<br />
<br />
Nice almost-answer there Absor, but I really would like to see you do better.<br />
<br />
Why DON'T you have any information ?  This is a question that has been asked, loudly, for months.  Literally, months.  It hasn't just popped up in the last week or 2.  Now, I'll freely admit, I've never seen your job contract; your job description.  I never read read any announcements on any Sony sites saying &quot;today we welcome Absor to the post of...&quot;.  Not there there weren't any such announcements, just that I never saw them.   However, I think it's a fairly safe bet to say that you're in the public relations department at SOE.  Either as their spokesperson, and/or as a liason between Sony and the various EQ communities.  The job of a PR person IS to know what their company is doing, and to have, or get, answers for customers who have valid questions.  Having said that, that leaves us with 1 of 2 conclusions.  Either you truly don't have any information/answers, or you are outright BS'ing us.<br />
<br />
If you truly don't have any information, again, why not ?  This is not some trivial concern of a few people.  This is a core issue for a large number of gamers, one of the more popular classes in fact.  Surely, Sony Online Entertainment is not such a huge company that you would have to go through 38 levels of red-tape to get answers?  How hard can it be to either sit in on a developers meeting *which I'm quite sure you do anyways*, or to ask around to a few people who would have the answers ?   Sony, and I'm going to say by extension SOE, is a very structured company.  In other words, everyone works as a cohesive unit.  Developers aren't running around free to work on whatever they please .. &quot;oh, I think I'm gonna work on the tree-bark texture in Kelethin this week; yeah, that's it, tree-bark !!!&quot;..  They'll be working towards an organized goal.  How difficult can it be to determine what this goal is ?   And to see what the status is on working towards this goal ?   <br />
<br />
So if it is the first option, that you truly don't know, when can we expect a status report from you ?   Something along the lines of  &quot;well Zito, I scheduled a meeting with head developer/President/melee dude/class balance dudette/whoever for tuesday, and I'll let you know on wednesday what happened&quot;  Can we expect something like that from you ?  Can we believe that you're going to back up what you say ?<br />
<br />
As for the 2nd option, which is just that you are BS'ing us.  Sadly, I'm more inclined to think this is the case.  When a thread arose on the SK boards, and the subject of nerfing knight aggro was brought up, you quickly had this to say ...<br />
We haven't come to any conclusions, nor made any <br />
announcements about any conclusions we have not yet made.<br />
<br />
This was in relation to the question of knight agro vs. warrior agro, which is of course a huge part of the class balance discussion.  While that's a very ambiguous quote, it shows that something was being pondered/decided/thought about, in relation to the agro discussion.  Or, that you knew it was NOT being pondered/decided/thought about.   In either case, to me it shows that you know what is happening inside SOE at this point, regarding the issue at hand.   <br />
<br />
As well, I find that given the nature of the gaming business *very hands on, not a huge corporate structure*, and given the nature of your job, I find it difficult to believe that you truly have no idea of what is in store for the melee classes.<br />
<br />
If indeed the 2nd option is true; then please respect us enough as your paying customers to at least be up front with us.  If Sony feels that there is not a burning need to address the class balance issue, then tell us.  If it is indeed being considered as an area that needs to be addressed, but won't be for some time, then tell us.  The &quot;I'm just a mushroom&quot; excuse doesn't cut it.  I truly enjoy playing EQ, even with the issues I have with it.  However, when I get the feeling that my concerns, the concerns of the warrior class, are just being blown off,  the search for another game becomes more appealing.<br />
<br />
And lastly...Nayl asked you to explain or justify your now famous, or infamous, quote; &quot;Classes are not that out of balance&quot;.  I am again asking you to do the same.  If you truly believe that statement,  I would ask you to explain to me what I am missing.  It seems strange to me to find threads on many different game and class message boards about how the warrior, and pure melee, are broken.  Shaman boards, necro boards, pally boards, cleric boards; these are just the ones that I have seen myself.  I find it difficult to understand how so many players from the entire spectrum of EQ have come to the same conclusion, which you don't agree with.  Again, if you could clear this up for me, I would be extremely grateful.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply.</div></div><hr />

This fuckin assclown comes here, basically tells you that he's NOT doing his fuckin job, which is to communicate with the playerbase and the Devs, and you all roll over and play dead.<br />
<br />
Start doing your goddamned job.  There's a fuckin problem.  You surf the fuckin net, find the facts and figures that THE GODDAMNED PLAYERS ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE FOR YOU and you present them to your fucking dev team.  They look at it on one of their 1000 coffee breaks, AND THEY GIVE YOU A GODDAMNED ANSWER, which you tell us.  It's not even like we're asking you to research the fuckin problem, you can find the research and cut and paste fuckin hyperlinks for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
Does SoE think we're broken?  What do they plan on doing about it, and when do they plan on doing it?  After they revamp a few more fuckin engines?  After a few more fuckin expansions?  After WoW kills your fucking company as you know it because they actually give a shit about their game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It appears that Absor is the ONLY person from Sony who frequents these boards. As such, he'd be the one transmitting our ideas to the developers. This is obvious from the lack of ANY other Sony posters here, unlike certain other boards I could mention. *cough* PoN *cough*<br />
<br />
 In any case, there's a complete lack of communication on Melee issues. Hell, we don't even know the name/names of the people working on Melee issues! We've been given nothing for months and, unlike some OTHER issues, there's been a complete lack of transparancy on Melee issues. As someone else pointed out, there's no reason to dodge coming here and being frank with Warriors like the excuses they have with PA-business.<br />

 It's NOT too much to ask for basic information. It seems to be too much to ask to recieve it.</div></div><hr />

I came back from a hiatus and was told I was no longer wanted as the main tank in our GUILD exp groups anymore. Our level 60 Paladin was the only tank our Ench wanted.<br />
<br />
This hurt my feelings more than just about anything in the game. I had spent 100's of hours getting all of these people their epics, working with them as they levelled, taking them out and showing them how to kill Vindi, HoT, etc...<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't care as much anymore.<br />
<br />
LDoN allows me to play with people that will let me tank.<br />
<br />
LDoN gives me exp whenever I want it if I can get 5 people together and I get some adventure points too.<br />
<br />
LDoN gives me Proc Augs that make my Agro insane when using 1hs.<br />
<br />
No, it's not snap agro.<br />
<br />
No, it's not agro lock.<br />
<br />
No, it's not changing the way people look at paladins.<br />
<br />
Who ever decided Agro Lock was a good idea in the first place? If you liked the game before Paladins could do that, and we now have 2x the amount of agro we had before, then why can't you enjoy the game now?<br />
<br />
Yes, LDON gives me a stress-free way to play my game and be the main tank and get exp and advance my character while they try and fix the melee issues.<br />
<br />
The fix will come. The problem is obviously bigger than they had thought at first.<br />
<br />
The fact that they fixed 90% of my issues as a casual player by releasing LDoN and MAKING IT WORK RIGHT THE FIRST TIME...was a lot more important to me than lazy chanters or shamans who would take a paladin before me.<br />
<br />
I can now play with my friends when I want, be guaranteed some fun and exp, and play the main tank whenever I want to...<br />
<br />
Thanks to LDoN, if you don't want to play in a group that values Paladins more, then you don't have to :p<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Let the man try and get the fix done. You know .001% of the overall picture that goes on there, so why assume the worst?<br />
<br />
You act like you have never had a job before. I don't tell our shareholders every thing that goes into making our Company work, and my guidance for our Wall Street Analysts is about 100x more vague than the info Absor provides to you all<br />
<br />
In the meantime, our stock is up about 1700% in two years. We have things going on that create value that no one will EVER know about.<br />

Taking shots in the dark with incomplete information is ridiculous.<br />

This looks like the long version of A-EQ's comment above:<br />
<br />
 Quote:I miss the good ol' days when SOE comunicated as a company, instead of making everything into a marketing department meeting before saying anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it's sort of the opposite. If marketing was doing the communicating, you'd have heard all sorts of promises about what we plan to do by now. The problem is, we haven't worked out what we want to do. So telling you what we have in mind isn't really possible. At least not for me. Maybe some marketing guy could come up with something...<br />
<br />
Once we have plans, we'll let you know and you can send your comments about them and we can discuss it. We're not happy that it's taken so long to come up with those plans, and there is no excuse, but that's also not a good reason for me to pop onto message boards and make up stuff about what we might do either.<br />

Absor isn't the one that will come floating down from the skies in a ray of bright light and wave away all your troubles. A patch message will surely cover that.<br />

Just a quick post from a lurker...<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever wondered if class balance is the way it is intentionally?  I've only been playing since kunark release so I don't know how it was before then but from what I've seen the classes always have gone up and down in terms of relative power.  In a way, if you knew that true balance was impossible wouldn't the best plan be to keep things dynamic and always changing...instead of keeping one class on the bottom forever?<br />
<br />
Think about it, hasn't the 'cycle' of power shifting been pretty consistent over the course of the game.  It seems like *almost* every class has had their time at the bottom and the top.<br />
Sorry boys but I think its our time to be on the bottom of the dogpile...never fear though, eventually it'll be someone else's turn (enchanter, cleric, druid anyone?)<br />
<br />
Just a thought, please feel free to disagree</div></div><hr />

Might be time we start giving them the benefit of the doubt for a while. I know you're going to say we've been waiting for years but the difference is now they say they are trying to fix it.<br />

Little better than the blokes who complain that Absor doesn't post here enough and then fall to their knees when he posts to tell us, uh, that he isn't going to tell us anything. <br />
<br />
Absor's post was not meaningful or helpful.  It was pure fluff.  Yeah, maybe he has nothing better to post than pure fluff because SoE hasn't DONE ANYTHING about a known problem in a year and after promising to fix it over 6 months ago.  But addressing a complaint about lack of information with lack of information ISN'T RESPONSIVE.  <br />
<br />
When he posts something meaningful that provides us some actual consideration, then I'll consider it a real &quot;post.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">couple of things to consider regarding Alan's non-post here ...<br />
<br />
1- As I stated waaaay above in the thread, he's just got nothing to say about the issue. Why? Because as the PR guy, they've given him nothing to say about the issue. Plus, he doesn't have much familiarity with the details of the class. There's no point in him getting into a debate/discussion/whatever regarding the intimate details of the warrior class when he's got nothing he can relay about it and he doesn't play a warrior so doesn't really have much firsthand experience.<br />
<br />
2- Most of the time when he posts on message boards, he gets flamed way too much by angry monks (like me). So he limits his participation in them, and severely limits his responsiveness.<br />
<br />
3- He has an e-mail address at SOE. If your burning &quot;issues&quot; are that important, why not just e-mail him directly? As the PR guy, I'm sure he's much more responsive to direct communication.<br />
<br />
4- When you do e-mail him, don't be surprised to hear the exact same things you heard at the fan faire. People are aware of the complaints that melee classes have. And it's being &quot;looked into.&quot; Don't expect specifics. There are none yet.<br />
<br />
5- Besides Alan, there are others that work on Everquest who can be reached directly. Open up a dialog with them. Talk to them. Send them e-mails. <br />
<br />
6- Don't expect to change the world overnight. And don't expect much detailed response from the people you do contact.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't defend Alan for his response. Heh. He's been taking so much heat from melee issues for so long, imo, it's long past the time he took an afternoon to /testbuff a monk, rogue or warrior and spend an hour or two in our shoes, and then maybe opened up a dialog to his customer base.<br />
<br />
But, I do understand why he has no response. There's none that can be given.</div></div><hr />

As for backing off the guy it makes no difference to him unless he is some kinda simp. Absor is PR for a huge company who is never going to satisfy all it's customers no mater how hard they try, in his job he knows that he is gonna take heat from the unhappy ones..in fact it's expect.

There has been bitching for months that no one from SoE ever reads these boards.  If he doesn't have info, or can't share what info he might have, swearing at him won't help.  We know people see what we post, hopefully the devs are using that information.  Considering that whatever they do is probably going to require a huge amount of work and will probably have ripple effects across the whole game, I can see why they want to stay tight-lipped.<br />
<br />
It would have been nice if he had said, we recognize that there are problems and we are working on that.  Even so, take this as a sign that what we post hear does actually get seen by SoE.  For now we won't get much better than that out of them.</div></div><hr />

Although I don't play a warrior and therefor this issue isn't bothering me most of the time I play, I do end up playing with warriors as a common character for me to play is my cleric, so it does come up.  Normally I don't think I'd like someone telling me they don't have any information about the problem.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you're now actually being told that he doesn't have anything to give you.  Before, he just didn't post (which, from another point of view, could possibly be seen as ignoring it) because he didn't have any information.  I, given the choice, would rather be told straight that they didn't know what to tell us yet, and it's gonna be a short while before they do, rather than just be given the silent treatment.  I'm sure many of you would prefer that too.<br />

<br />
SoE has been COMPLETLEY 100% unaccountable for their actions FOR YEARS NOW.  We as the consumer have the right and the responsibility to bitch about products that are unsatisfactory.  It's how capitalism works.  When we bitch, we are supposed to get a fuckin reply, it's a goddamned good business plan.  I'll tell you right now that if this policy doesn't change and they don't start owning up to their actions, or lack thereof, there WILL be a company that comes in, takes their playerbase and leaves all of these fuckwads out of a job.  It's time to be scared Absor, why don't you bring that back to your round table meetings?  You can sit here and you can ignore us and play dumb or whatever the fuck your goddamned plan is, or you can start acting like a real company, and more importantly, HARD WORKING MEN and start taking responsibility for what you do in your product.<br />
<br />
It's not a matter of if SoE is going to fail at this point, it's a matter of when.  You take an honest look at EQ, SWG and whatever the pre-alpha shit they're going to put on the shelf for EQ 2 and ask yourself if this is a company that inspires faith in you.  YOU PAY THESE PEOPLE 13 DOLLARS A MONTH TO FUCK YOU IN THE ASS, and apparantly the majority of you like that.  I, for one, am going to bitch about it because it's my goddamned right.  Fix your product, it's broken.  You don't and I'll take my business elsewhere, along with a lot of other people who feel the same way.<br />
<br />
THE MELEE IN THIS GAME ARE BROKEN.  ITEMIZATION AND OUTDATED SKILLS ARE CAUSING THE PROBLEM.  FIX IT.  NOW.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for posting Absor, but throw us some information. I want to at least know if the melee issue is a high priority at the moment. I'm not sure about playing a lot longer if SOE is going to jerk my class through the mud.  I'm a 65 warrior and even my best friend that got me into playing EQ considers a pally over me for grouping reasons... That's just disgusting.</div></div><hr />

We've developed friendships with people online that can sometimes nearly equal the value of friendships with those we see face to face. We've invested a part of our lives into this game, just as those who take golf seriously, radio controlled airplanes, or any other hobby. So much so that rather than just saying, &quot;F-it, I'll just quit if the part of the game I like is fubar,&quot; we bitch and moan on message boards venting our frustrations. We just aren't often willing to quit when we are dissatisfied with the game, since we want so much for the game to get better, for our characters to get better, and our friendships to continue. Even when I'm using all my willpower to not break my driver into 8 different pieces, I still love playing golf, and EQ is no different.<br />
<br />
Our level of commitment and passion for this product is unquestioned, whether it is because it's a pretty good game that we've sunk our lives into, or a really good game that drew us in.<br />
<br />
Yes, we deserve more than a 6-month old message telling us that they're working on it. Yes, we have a right to expect them to devote as much resources as it takes to make sure their existing product is functioning at a reasonable level. If we aren't seeing what we should, we can and should stay on their cases until we see real progress.<br />
<br />
But, Haass, and others, do little to no good with that kind of venom. After 4+ years, if SOE has learned anything, it is that there will always be players that are pissed off about something. Rather than being a demonstration of anger or motivation to get moving on valid issues, it just floats into the void. Or worse, it can bring the tone of a whole message board down to a point where no one feels that it has any value. The FoH guild message boards are like that. Every thread there that starts off with any kind of rational argument degenerates into flame-fests so fast that it only serves as entertainment, not a place to really talk about the game.<br />
<br />
To Absor:<br />
<br />
There are things you should and need to talk about now, even if the team is still working on any fixes.<br />
<br />
First and foremost: Just what does SOE see as wrong with melee in general, pure melee more specifically, and warriors especially? Where are we supposed to be? What about our classes are where they are supposed to be, and what isn't?<br />
<br />
These are things that 6+ months of 'future plans' should have answered, at the very least. If fixes take more time, so be it. But I think a real discussion of what the problems with melee are or aren't is what is the most overdue. Being able to discuss with players what each class is supposed to be capable of is not something that should take this kind of time to figure out.  I, for one, would be inclined to pull back and relax for a short while with even just that much discussion.</div></div><hr />

They're words, deal with it.  If I want to be abusive, you'll know it.  You should have seen that post before I went back and reread it.  Telling someone that I think he's not doing his job is well within my rights.  I work my ass off 60 hours a week, when people I PAY to do their job aren't, then I get to bitch, that's the way it works.  And the beauty of it is that I don't have to be nice if I get pushed too far.  You want my money and want to fuck me over on your product?  Then you're gonna have to take it, else I'll take my money to somewhere else that appreciates it.<br />
<br />
There is NO avenue for complaints with SoE.  They shut down their forums, they don't respond to e-mails in any volume at all, other than with the carbon copy form letter bullshit.  You can't /petition in game with any effect, and it's debatable if /feedback does anything either.  You give me an avenue where I can speak with a real person and tell them the problems i have with their game and get some feedback from those complaints, and I'll be happy to be civil, but since SoE has continuously shut down all of those avenues and is obviously only concerned with cranking out more pieces of shit that they call expansions rather than tuning their game, I'm gonna bitch, and they're gonna have to deal with it.</div></div><hr />

You just don't get it do you?  I don't WANT to have to go the extreme of quitting EQ.  I want them to be more productive with their time.  Revamping a fuckin graphics engine WILL NOT salvage the SOE name.  There are always going to be some retards that are gonna buy any piece of shit that this company turns out, but there are more than enough people who will never buy another product this company makes again.

Any breathing human being can see that there's a problem when the ONLY advantage that warriors have, being higher AC and HP is being squandered away by fuckin craptastic lazy ass itemization that doesn't include warrior only items that are 10% above and beyond what every other item in that difficulty bracket is.  Anyone can see that there is a problem with aggro management at all levels of the game for warriors, and they think that the fuckin Copper Hammer is gonna remedy that fact.  It's not.  Just like the BoC didn't 3 years ago.  MAKE A WARRIOR ABILITY THAT GENERATES AGGRO.  It's simple really, I don't know why it's so fuckin complicated.  The ONLY excuse for this going on this long is laziness.  You guys call it &quot;Flaming.&quot; I call it calling a spade a spade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically Haass is correct here.  That is all they have to do.  Something like a 1 point AA that is availiable at level 51.  If we could somehow project an item independent EB effect on an incoming mob, something with say a 2 min refresh, all of this problem would mostly go away.  One guaranteed EB proc every 2 minutes wouldn't break the game and it would allow warriors to avoid the agro loss on initial slows and tashes.  Once we have agro firmly established, we usually do fine unless someone does something really stupid.  I bet SOE could do this in 1 day of programming (or less) using the already in place AA ability definitions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What we want, Deadalus, and it's pretty simple and basic; is for Absor to actually come out and SAY something.  Something like... &quot;well, I talked to the developers, and they're looking at it, but other items are on the agenda first&quot;  or anything along those lines.   People here aren't all up in arms just because there is no solution yet *some are I'm sure, but a small minority*, but rather are upset because we are given NOTHING.  Not even an acknowledgement that Sony is WORKING on the problem yet.   Hell, I know for damn sure that if I was given some kind of information, I'd be a lot more relaxed about letting Sony work on the problem.  But the same old &quot;we're looking at it&quot;, and no more, for over 6 months now is utter bullshit.<br />
<br />
 I mean let's get serious.  Sony has said for six months, that yes, there may be a problem, or is a problem, with melee, and they are looking at it.  Absor's job would be to communicate what the status is of that effort is at this point.  Is a &quot;fix&quot; actively being sought ??  Has it been determined for sure to Sony's satisfaction that there IS a problem ?   Does Sony think there is a problem, but doesn't yet have the resources to tackle it ?   Does Sony think there is a problem, and plans to begin working on it soon, but as yet are not sure what approach to take ?  Does Sony not think there is a huge problem ?  This is what we're looking for.  It's not at ALL unreasonable to expect this information.  Hell, this kind of information is EXACTLY what a PR person is for.  So to say that &quot;I have no information&quot; is a reasonable answer, is not being at all realistic.</div></div><hr />

Just because it's the norm doesn't mean it's cool.  If everyone at your work is taking 2 hour long breaks when they're not supposed to be, that doesn't make it okay for you to do so.  You're still a piece of crap.<br />

Has it moved down the list thanks to other cosmetic changes that no one gives a fuck about?  I'll tell you 3 acceptable replies that I won't bitch about.<br />

1 : &quot;We haven't had a chance to take a look at melee balancing yet.

Tell me the fuckin truth, i'll respect you more for it than blowing sunshine up my ass.<br />
<br />
2. &quot;We don't see a problem currently.  We've reviewed the situation and determined that the game isn't far enough out of balance right now to warrant a change.&quot;  ---- Okay, you're a dumbshit, but it's your product.  If that's the way you feel, then that's fine, now I at least know the situation and can base my gaming decisions on that information.<br />

3. &quot;We are aware of itemization and aggression issues in the game between the melee classes, but we haven't come up with any solutions to fix the problems yet&quot;   ---- This is fine as long as you ACCEPT FEEDBACK to help you with your decision making.  There are some absolute geniuses playing this game right now.  Frodlin and Furor have their head screwed on straight and if you sit down and talk to them or set up a chance for one or both of them to sit down and talk with a Dev, we can probably find an acceptable solution for the issues.  It doesn't even have to be made public.  If you're half the PR man you should be, you should already know who the main contributors of balance discussions are and can get in touch with them privately so that they can help provide a completely free consultation on what you can do to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it's not hard to please me, and contrary to popular belief, I don't &quot;flame&quot; people for no reason.  Just be straight with us, we ain't fuckin kids.  You can tell us what's going on so that we're not sitting around getting aggravated becasue we think we're being ignored.</div></div><hr />

Safe to say that anyone with a smattering of psychology is reaching some conclusions when they see this type of vitriol in what is essentially an anonymous forum.  They are not conclusions you would care for. <br />

<br />
I won;t dispute that we have issues now or that the itemization is absolutly stupid as it is right now, however people are jumping to several wrong conclusions.  What Absor posted on PoN was that Paly's are not being nerfed as it stands now.  So what is going on is SoE has spent all their time worrying about putting out another expansion, and is just now working on class balance. (just a guess there, but the warrior issue was flat out ignored till now) They have ignored the issue too long, and now they are trying to come up with solutions.  Absor just posted no definite solution has been reached, not that it would not happen.  (humm maybe absor will respond to this telling us how the developers have a secret lad of developers just working on class balance and we have not been ignored . . . . . .yeah right).<br />
<br />
I don;t think this is going to be an &quot;easy&quot; fix either.  Of course we have all the board trolls with the sure fire way to make things work better, but I don;t think SoE is buying it.  More likely than not the developers are forming a plan and it will probably have a few different ideas in it, and they are refusing to play the &quot;information minister&quot; and talk to us about what they are thinking (like that is something new).  We have hints that they are going to work on itemization, disciplines, skills,  Oh and our broken taunt button.  Not sure what they are going to do but pissing and moaning about it sure is not making the changes come any faster.  <br />
<br />
I think the paly's of PoN are woefully mis-informed if they think they will definetly not be nerfed at all.  All Absor said was that was not in the plans now.  Since they basically have no plan, then that would be correct.  I highly doubt that a change in balance would mean that there would be no nerfs.  I also doubt very seriously that developers are not aware that paly's are pretty powerful as it stands and the other tank classes are not quite as good (yes including sk's).  Paly's have too much aggro control (more so than sk's imho) and they mitigate all too well, have too many hitpoints compared to warriors etc.  When mob's are hitting for 600+ and that's all the difference we have at the higher end then that is a problem.  All hybrids make a tradeoff of some sort.  Rangers can seriously spank a mob, but tank like they are naked.  Currently Paly's don;t have to make a significant trade-off and that needs to change.  Additionally our taunt button is not working as intended (and even SoE has admitted so).  What the changes will be who knows.  <br />
<br />
I wish the developers did communicate with the classes a little more on ideas for fixing, but then again why would they want to.  Every classes see's themselves as the most important element of the game and in &quot;dire&quot; need of fixing, and if that class could make changes for itself they would be WAY overpowered.  Look at the moron casters asking about changes to spells at the last fanfare.  Even the developers had to laugh at them.  Yeah we need to work on more spells so you can earn 10 aa's in an hour instead of 4.  To that caster though it probably seemed really important, and likewise with us with the exception that we really do have issues even in the eyes of the developers.  <br />
<br />
Just relax and wait, nothing we do will change the fact we will be waiting on it.  Go ahead and flood the feedback boxes, but SoE will fix what they want when they want.  We can protest, or do whatever but i really don;t think it will matter.  Besides if they continue to screw up melee it will just make WoW that much more attractive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to say this one last time:  Keep your threads civil or you're not going to like what happens.<br />

<br />
You know what, normally, i'm a very civil guy, but I've been level 60+ longer than some of you guys have been playing EQ.  I've been there, i've done that.  I've been nice, I've packaged things up all neatly, and I've expressed my opinions in a very concise and clear manner.  Guess what that's gotten us all so far?<br />
<br />
I'll give you a hint.  It's everything to the right of this period.<br />
<br />
Yup...absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Some of you whippersnappers might still have some glimmer of hope in your eye that the tooth fairy is gonna come down and make this game all better for everyone just because you asked.  I got news for you, it's not gonna happen.  How I choose to express myself these days is based upon over 4 years of complete and total frustration with the lack of communication we have with the people who make this product.  What they want to talk about, they talk about, and they dodge everything else that they don't want to talk about.  You guys can go ahead thinking that's cool, but I don't have to.  I told absor point blank in his LDoN thread that I was willing to lay off him in that topic and let him discuss his new mealticket IF he promised to come back here and talk balance.  He hasn't talked a goddamned word since.  Am I pissed off?  You're damned right I'm pissed off, and I'm justified in being so.  Lie to me, and I get angry.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'm sick of sugar coating my posts for the moral minority.  Don't like what I have to say?  There's an ignore function.  They're WORDS.  I don't know how else to explain it to you.  If you get offended by words, you've got bigger problems than me.  On my 3 main characters I've got close to 450 days played.  You bet your candy ass I'm passionate about this game.  I care about the time I've invested in my characters and in my friendships in the game, and I'd rather not see all of that tossed down the crapper because some PR guy isn't doing his job and relating to the public.  When that happens, I stop buying SoE products.  Everyone I talk to stops buying SoE products.  Everyone who feels remotely the same as me that reads my posts says &quot;Hey, that guy's got a point.  He's a dick about it, but he's got a point&quot; and they don't buy SoE products.  You see where I'm heading with this Absor?  You don't think this is gonna happen?  Money is tight, the economy sucks.  The people who are paying your paycheck are getting fed up with your service.  You think they're gonna keep paying you forever?<br />
<br />
Time to think long term SoE.  Start building a good reputation with your customers again, so that the next time you come out with a half decent game, people aren't afraid to buy it because it says Sony Online on the back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass - you gave a reasoned response; I'll try to do the same. <br />
<br />
First of all, I would never have bothered saying anything if I didn't think you were worth speaking to.  You write in complete words, spell correctly, form grammatical sentences and present coherent thoughts.  That all by itself makes you a worthwhile voice. <br />
<br />
And, although there were no level 60's when I started playing, I would still, comparatively, qualify as a whippersnapper.  I have very limited playing time and my 54 warrior is my highest level character ever. Your knowledge of the game and the class in particular far outweighs mine - that's not even arguable. <br />
<br />
I have been steaming mad at Sony/Verant on more than one occasion.  I have actually cancelled my account twice, though I always ended up returning.  As far as I'm concerned, it's been all downhill since they made cat pelts stackable, but that's another story. <br />
<br />
I believe that once upon a time there were actually a group of people (Developers, etc.) who really cared about the internal integrity of the game - content, balance and so forth.  Whether they always handled everything correctly is open to debate, but I think they seriously tried. <br />
<br />
I fear that, whether or not those same people are there, the people making the decisions nowadays are the money people - the bottom line people.  That, I think, is the crux of the problem and I quite frankly have no idea how to get around it. <br />
<br />
As to threats to cancel your account and get others to do the same, I really think they pay no attention to that as they have heard it so many times before.  I don't think they will do anything about it until they actually see a significant loss in revenue, and then I think they will probably do the wrong thing - e.g. give EVERYONE EVERYTHING they are asking for - which would be the culmination of the trend I have witnessed since I started. <br />
<br />
I do, perhaps naively, believe that they will do something about the Warrior class.  They may not do enough, or they might make us the most over-powered class in the game.  I don't know which, but I think they will do something.  I hope that it's soon, but I have no speculation about that. <br />
<br />
We do appear to have an opportunity here to give some input and be heard.   How much our input will mean is yet to be seen, but it is at least an opportunity.  While what Absor posted may be infuriatingly uninformative in some ways, the fact that he posted it is at least a clear signal that he, at least, is continuing to read these boards;  that is a hopeful sign. <br />
<br />
I believe that if we continue to flame him, however, he is much less likely to come here and listen and/or to actually particpate in a discussion.  I would hate to see that opportunity missed. <br />
<br />
Lastly - yes, I suppose I am part of that moral minority.  I have no problem with the language (as my youngest son once said, &quot;we've got HBO&quot;), though I often find it gratuitous and tiresome.  It is the personal attacks and insults that I object to.  Perhaps it is my age, but for whatever reason, those will always rub me the wrong way.  I suspect we will always disagree on that, and I will make this my last attempt to address that particular subject.   I just don't like it - I don't know what else to say about it. <br />
<br />
That's all for now.</div></div><hr />

I'm talking more long term.  The difference between a 1 hit wonder and a REAL gaming company is the people behind it.  Those people need to sit down and ask themselves if they want to keep on top of the heap or whether they're just going to think short term.  People aren't going to be playing EQ forever.  Eventually, it's going to get old, new games will come out, people will move on.  It's inevitable.  The real question is &quot;Will they move on to other SoE products?&quot;  I say no, and this is why.  I may not be able to quit EQ at the moment, but you can bet I won't put myself in this situation with SoE again.  That means no SWG, no EQ2, no EQ3, no EQXXVI, nothing.  Seriously, if anyone buys another SoE product after playing EQ, they deserve what they get, and they should be given zero sympathy.  I pity everyone who bought SWG, and I pity everyone who's looking forward to EQ 2.  May god have mercy on your souls.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
This thread needs to stay here, in the Tavern, which is the &quot;general&quot; part of this forum.  Absor shouldn't have the option of simply avoiding the Outhouse to avoid seeing it.<br />
<br />
I asked for a response.  Absor replied in the most minimal and least satisfying manner I could imagine.  But he has provided us with information, if you care to read between the lines a bit.<br />
<br />
Here's the scenario I imagine is going on in SoE land -<br />
<br />
Six months ago, a new regime is instituted for the CS department.  Communication with the players is to be improved - upcoming updates, future plans, developers corner, all neatly organized and regularly scheduled.  Someone makes up a list of all the stuff that they want to address in the near future, and it gets put up as their future plans.  Over time, almost everything on the list is addressed and completed.  But months go by, and the melee issues remain untouched.  <br />
<br />
Most probably, there is no one person assigned to the melee issues.  No one whose job it is to show up for progress meetings and say &quot;heres what I think we should do&quot;.  Its on everyone's back burner because its not easy, and the consequences of doing it wrong could be a huge mess.  Its easier, much easier, to deal with the endless spell tuning and upgrades, along with fixing all the little content detail bugs that have been running around for years.  There's a rising tide of unrest on the melee boards, but since Absor doesn't interact with us, other than to show up to sell the new expansion, none of this is making much of an impression on the Devs.<br />
<br />
Then the Fan Faire rolls around, and they suddenly find themselves in palpable contact with the anger and disaffection they've created.  They hastily cancel the &quot;class balance&quot; panel, realizing that someone might actually show up with tar and feathers.  Even so, throughout the Faire, they get the message, loud and clear - a significant portion of the players are really, most sincerely pissed as hell.  They make placating noises, and retreat to the Bat Cave.<br />
<br />
Now.  If you notice, there has been no update to any of the Future Plans, Upcoming Updates, etc., on the EQlive site, despite it being at least a week past due.  In all probability, today's patch is going to contain a series of LDoN updates, and nothing of substance for us.  They are basically stuck in the position that they have promised us something for 6 months, and haven't even gotten far enough to give us a progress report.  Likely it will take them a month or two to work out and test the details of any fix once they have decided on one.  In short, there is nothing in the pipeline, so they are now stalling.  Absor came here and posted his limp non-response because if he didn't, it would be an open admission that he simply isn't doing his job at an even minimal level.  <br />
<br />
So, end of the day, its going to be a few months, if we are lucky, before we see boo out of these guys about melees.  Meantime, we need to keep the issue alive, even if Absor has nothing to contribute to the discussion, so that they don't forget that the next Fan Faire will be really uncomfortable for them if they don't get this done soon, and done right.</div></div><hr />

Just because you have the best piece of crap on the market doesn't make you a god.  It makes you a peddler of a piece of crap.<br />
<br />
If your only choices for beverages were coke and pepsi, and coke was straight sulfuric acid, while Pepsi was just piss in a bottle, would you be praising the shit that didn't dissolve flesh on contact?<br />
<br />
EQ is by far the best game on the market right now.  I don't dispute that.  The problem is that it could be 10 times better EASILY.  SoE doesn't seem to care about that.  They know they're at the top of the heap and then they stopped working because they have no competition.  That's wrong.  Believe me, I understand your point, but there's much more to it than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;They know they're at the top of the heap and then they stopped working because they have no competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's not true at all.<br />
<br />
They've continued working on this game the entire time.<br />
<br />
New expansions. New content. New spells. New quests. New features (tons and TONS of new features).<br />
<br />
In fact, because competition exists NOW that didn't exist before, SOE has been working hard to keep EQ competitive. It's why there's things like augments, and things like PoK books, and things like mounts. So many of the changes that have been implemented into EQ over the past few years have been done for the exact purpose of keeping up with and staying ahead of the competition.<br />
<br />
Just because they let melee balance slide, doesn't mean they're not responding to the REST of their customers.<br />
<br />
Think about the things that have been fixed/improved over the years.<br />
<br />
Bard twisting is much easier on the wrists now. <br />
<br />
Tradeskilling is vastly improved.<br />
<br />
Cleric epic quest is no longer the hate filled KS fest it used to be. <br />
<br />
Planes have been opened up to people so they can be with their friends.<br />
<br />
Bank space has been expanded.<br />
<br />
You can get from point A to point B in the game without taking 4 hours and two deaths to do it.<br />
<br />
Pre-Enraging Blow aggro generating weapons (Copper Hammer of Striking) now not only exist, but are rather common drops, giving the non-uber warrior an option he or she didn't have before.<br />
<br />
Necromancers can now stack DoTs on the same mob, giving them a USEFULNESS at raids.<br />
<br />
Instill Doubt has been unlilnked from kicks, letting monks actually train and use the skill.<br />
<br />
Summoned items got a nice tweak and overhaul.<br />
<br />
Focus effects breathed new life into old items and gave casters something to cheer about lootwise.<br />
<br />
XP changes made grouping viable again, and the new expansion made grouping ENJOYABLE again.<br />
<br />
Broken zones like Inner Acrylia have been fixed and made semi-useful.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying roll  over and take it Haas. You've got a point. Melee issues are being ignored.<br />
<br />
BUT ... don't lose sight of the bigger picture.<br />
<br />
Sony is very much aware of the competition, and has for years been keeping ahead of the curve by making changes and fixing thigns in the game.<br />
<br />
And they've responded on the issue of melee balance. They're &quot;looking into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Expect changes around the same time a new game, like Worlds of Warcraft, ships.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can say the game has been &quot;Improved for the casual gamer&quot; but really it's just been watered down so that there is no real penalty for anything anymore.  Die in the planes?  No problem, your corpse will magically appear in front of you in 20 minutes.  Die in a zone too far from your bind point?  No problem, take a PoK book.  It'd sure be a hassle to actually have to run around.  Most of the rest of the crap you listed is stuff that should have been implemented correctly from day one, but you people think that SoE is so great for doing these improvements.  Instill doubt got unlinked from flying kick?  That's fuckin great..why wasn't it done 4 and a half years ago?  It's the same with EVERYTHING else on that list.  You don't have to be grateful for people who finally correct the half assed job they did in the first place.</div></div><hr />

There is a legitimate gripe that SoE is blatently ignoring. Why doesn't Absor say that nothing has been done yet, instead of giving us a slippery answer. How long are the melee communities going to put up with this crap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;It's the same with EVERYTHING else on that list. You don't have to be grateful for people who finally correct the half assed job they did in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not true.<br />
<br />
Bank space should not have been that big from day one. That was an improvement. And it was made after people brought it to the attention of the game designers.<br />
<br />
The cleric epic quest was improved. The quest was certainly DOABLE in its previous format. But they improved it.<br />
<br />
Augments should have been done since day one? Hardly. That's a new FEATURE they added to keep people interested in the game.<br />
<br />
Look, I certainly have no like/love/whatever for Alan. I don't think he does his job all that well.<br />
<br />
But I'm not going to flame him for doing exactly what I thought he would do. He simply has no answer he can offer on the melee issues. Because no one has given him anything to say.<br />
<br />
In the world of journalism and press secrataries, the canned response is &quot;no comment.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can't force him to comment. He has responded to the direct question ... no comment.<br />
<br />
It's like trying to get a straight answer out of a football coach on Monday morning. It's just not going to happen.<br />
<br />
And also Haas ... game balance is one thing, but to expect them to put warriors at the top of their to-do list is just wishful thinking.<br />
<br />
They've ignored monks forever. They've ignored warriors for far longer.<br />
<br />
I don't expect it to change. Why do you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, whatever you wanna think.  I personally think that the dev team knows they can get away with designing shit just so they can fix it later so you all feel the need to kiss their ass for it, and I have yet to see any evidence contradicting that theory.<br />
<br />
If you think bank space should have been part of an expansion, you're on crack.  If you don't have LOY, you definitely have no use for 8 more bank slots right?  <br />
<br />
If you think that Sev shouldn't be triggerable exactly like the cleric epic is now, you're on crack.<br />
<br />
THESE ARE NOT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE GAME.  THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED LIKE THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE.  FIXING BROKEN CONTENT IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR NOT IMPLEMENTING IT CORRECTLY IN THE FIRST PLACE.<br />
<br />
Man, some people around here are just astonishing.  They implement quest XYZ, it's broken, it sits like that for a year, they fix it and you all line up to say &quot;Thank you Mistress, may I have another?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haas, I agree w/you 100%. I work my ass off too and when I come home I like to fire up EQ, log on my warrior and kill some shit.<br />
<br />
But that hasn't been the case for me in almost a year. Now I just log on, talk to my friends, and if theres a raid going on I'll go help out.  After that I simply log.<br />
<br />
I've been playing this game for 4 years, I don't want to quit either but if SOE cannot get shit fixed then I'll take my money elsewhere, perhaps WoW because I won't waste my time on EQ2.</div></div><hr />

I am 100% sure SOE knows how upset the melee community is(hell if they cancel the class balance conference at fan faire you know they do). So screaming and swearing at a rep coming to just respond, albiet not what we want to hear is not a good plan. If you want to get attention and dialouge with someone it works better to actually have a resonable conversation, bring up the problems in a calm intelligent way and get dialouge going.<br />
Yeah I have been playing 4 years as a warrior to, I have seen my role change big time, I am not gonna rip off a person who has 0 impact on my day to day playing, Absor is the PR department if I have understood correctly, meaning he just reports and talks up what is being done.<br />
If this game is causing that much anger you need to step back, take a breath and maybe take a week break and figure out what makes it enjoyable for you to log in again. Now if you want to attack me for this knock yourself out I dont really care it would just show more so that there is a issue with anger you really need to deal with over a  GAME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta say that i am simply amazed that any of you can defend SOE in any way shape or form.<br />
<br />
Yes EQ is a dam fine game, but it could be a great deal better, it SHOULD be a great deal better.<br />
<br />
In the last 6 months or year or so SOE has basically ignored warriors and monks amongst other things. How can you possibly tell me that in that year or so they could not have come up with some workable solution? How, in that year, could they have not seen how much the melee balance has gone from the odd forum discussion to basically THE issue for a large part of the EQ communty? <br />
<br />
It is impossible to miss the emotion that many people have for this issue. The simple fact that people are reacting so fiercly and have been for months should indicate that it has gone too far, and the warrior community will not give up. In fact things will get worse, because the longer it goes on the more people will begin to be frustrated at this.<br />
<br />
The thing is tho is that there are TWO seperate issues being blurred into 1. <br />
<br />
Firstly melee balancing and itemization need to be addressed. Countless numbers of threads have offered opinions on how to alleviate the problem, usually these threads are calm rational with everyone hoping that an idea will get picked up by sony cause generally we all have thought of something that could help.<br />
<br />
Secondly, and this is what i think gets alot of people so mad and links the 2 issues into 1 is that SOE seems intent on doing absolutly nothing. Its impossible that they have'nt noticed. We beg, we plead we offer to discuss, offer to help, we rant and scream and yell which only makes it worse when SOE do ABSOLUTLY NOTHING! <br />
<br />
<br />
 And also Haas ... game balance is one thing, but to expect them to put warriors at the top of their to-do list is just wishful thinking <br />
<br />
Dam right it should be at the top of the list, if not the top at least somewhere close. Maybe that quote  was true when the issue was first brought up, maybe that was true 7 months ago before we were told it would be looked at but now its has to be a priority.<br />
<br />
To the people saying that the more volitile posts will just be ignored, how is that different from any other post? Calm or otherwise? How has the well thought out, well written posts helped us? Not one bit<br />
 <br />
If you think your way of the clear, procise threads are the way to go, by all means go for ya lives but to say that those that go off on a more agrressive tact are wrong, you should  keep a more open mind. More than 1 way to skin a cat they say.<br />
<br />
Is Absor doing a good job? Hell no. <br />
<br />
As a middle man between us and the devs, its impossible to not get the feeling of the warrior community, and its impossible to not get some sort of information from the devs. A minimun of 6 months that Absor has had to get ANY peice of information, yet he has not given us anything that could give us hope of a future resolution and to me seems unsympathetic to warriors in general.<br />
<br />
To those who feel that people like Haas (i totally agree with Haas) are too aggressive and should tone it down get off your high horse and think about this.<br />
<br />
Your all fighting for the same fucking cause.<br />
<br />
Instead of turning your attention to attacking his post and picking it apart, how about you keep your eye on the ball and focus on keeping SOE, Absor and the Dev team your target. You dont have to agree with how or what he says but we should all respect that in the end we want the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;How can you possibly tell me that in that year or so they could not have come up with some workable solution?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's an easy question to answer. How can I say this? Because their actions prove this.<br />
<br />
Did they work on a solution? No.<br />
<br />
How could they not have come up with a solution? Easy. By NOT coming up with a solution.<br />
<br />
It sounds flip, and if it does, I apoligize.<br />
<br />
But, really, you expect far too much from Alan and from the EQ Live Team.<br />
<br />
&quot;How, in that year, could they have not seen how much the melee balance has gone from the odd forum discussion to basically THE issue for a large part of the EQ communty? &quot;<br />
<br />
They've seen it become a hot topic.<br />
<br />
Which is why they won't address it publically until they have something. Right now it'd be stupid for Alan to talk to us about it. He has no way of adequately addressing the questions he'll be hit with. He has no data or information from the live team about what it is they want or even plan to do about it. Or if he does, he's lying. Either way ... the official response at fan faire ... on this message board ... and on their board is ... as always ... They're Looking Into It.<br />
<br />
That's all you'll get out of them. But, good luck going for more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dam right it should be at the top of the list, if not the top at least somewhere close. &quot;<br />
<br />
Nope. Over the past year, the list has looked something like this:<br />
<br />
1- Fix the content of Planes of Power, because it was rushed, and still had a lot of bugs that needed working out. (Think things like &quot;Unlock Memories&quot; and &quot;Guided Meditation&quot; as well as, well getting the Rathe Council to work ... making Sol Ro not exploitable ... Making Reparm much harder ... etc., etc. etc.)<br />
<br />
2- Re-tweak the content of Planes of Power because even though it may work, it's not doing so well with the larger portion of the playerbase (Think of things like opening up the planes ... rewarding those who had the flags already ... allowing unflagged people into the raid function ... as well as things like making swarm kiting in Halls of Honor not so exploitable, etc., etc., etc.)<br />
<br />
And 3- Get the NEW expansion ready for release.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying class balance isn't important. I'm not defending SoE.<br />
<br />
I'm just relaying HISTORY.<br />
<br />
Those above three things were rated much higher on their to-do list than melee issues. As evidenced by melee issues still being around and all of the above three things being worked on and dealt with.<br />
<br />
SoE's actions speak for themselves.<br />
<br />
I also think it's far too optimistic, or nearsighted, or both, to expect Alan or the live team to put a new expansion or working out actual content bugs with the current expansion behind class issues that they OBVIOUSLY feel aren't much of an issue (the whole &quot;Not that out of balance&quot; quote).<br />
<br />
&quot;As a middle man between us and the devs,&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually, that's only part of Alan's job. And obviously a part he doesn't spend a zillion man hours working on. Again his actions speak far louder than his posts (what few there are).<br />
<br />
&quot; how about you keep your eye on the ball and focus on keeping SOE, Absor and the Dev team your target.&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;target&quot; isn't SOE or Alan or the devs or the live team or scott hartsman.<br />
<br />
The &quot;target&quot; is the warrior class. The monk class. The rogue class.<br />
<br />
The &quot;target&quot; is fixing the problems.<br />
<br />
Yelling and screaming (of which I am VERY guilty of) isn't going to fix the problem. And certainly isn't on &quot;target.&quot;</div></div><hr />

 Horseshit.<br />
<br />
 Since warriors aren't the ones coding the game, since monks aren't the ones coding the game, since rogues aren't the ones coding the game -<br />
<br />
  Put the focus where it belongs. ON the Dev team.<br />
<br />
 And yes, a year is much too long to have not even ONE person testing ideas.<br />
<br />
 Who's working on melee issues? What's their name(s)?<br />
<br />
 Are there any changes coming to Test for trials yet?<br />
<br />
 Is anyone listening?<br />
<br />
 The answer so far is a big fat NO. Not only NO, but (OBCENITY) NO.<br />
<br />
 If there are 10 people on the Dev team working 40 for 50 weeks, that's 20,000 man hours in a calendar year. Saying they couldn't spare any of them so Reparm could get tuned is an insult both to their coding skills and our intelligence.</div></div><hr />

Did Absor not say 6 months ago that balancing would be looked into? He has already addressed it publicly. It would even be better if they just came and just told us what is going on. The not knowing is part of the problem. I'd rather hear, &quot;Sorry guys at this point in time there are no plans to look at melee balancing, we will keep you updated when we do&quot;<br />
<br />
From what i have heard absor  isnt that knowledgable about warriors, they should get someone who actually knows the warrior. I doubt absor will ever have any way of adequately answering us, get someone who at least might have a chance to answer with some credibilty.<br />
<br />

Your are very wrong on that,  the target is NOT the fixing of warriors, the END RESULT is the fixing of wariors.<br />
<br />
Warriors only have very limited paths to get this done and that IS to keep posting and posting and posting. Who are these threads and posts targeted at? SOE, Devs and Absor. Off the top of my head i cant think of anyone else to aim our thoughts to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the &quot;target&quot; comments, well, yeah, Wubao, ya kinda lost me there too :p  Although, what I THINK he's saying, is let's keep the ideas going for improvement, throw out new ideas, whatever.  While I can't say this is a bad thought, I don't see it accomplishing any more than it has previously.  Warriors, monks, rogues, heck all the classes/players have come up with an awful lot of possibly good, workable ideas and fixes.  It's now up to Sony to make something work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You misunderstand.<br />
<br />
I didn't say it should not be a priority. I said it wasn't, and all signs point to, it isn't.<br />
<br />
There's a difference.<br />
<br />
You're wrong in your assessment of my position on class balance.<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to not get all upset, worked up, or pissy about it. It didn't fix the monk class at all over the past year. It's not going to help the monk class if I continue to rant and froth for another year. It's wasted energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Absor not say 6 months ago that balancing would be looked into?&quot;<br />
<br />
About four months ago, the UPCOMING CHANGES portion of the Everquest Live website was launched. And listed on it was a statement that balancing would be looked into. These statements have been cut and pasted onto subsequent Upcoming Changes commentary ever since.<br />
<br />
&quot; It would even be better if they just came and just told us what is going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
But ... and this is what Absor has said ... they can't. Because no one knows what's going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your are very wrong on that, the target is NOT the fixing of warriors, the END RESULT is the fixing of wariors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Attacking Alan won't fix warriors.<br />

Is that such a hard concept to grasp?<br />

Put the focus where it belongs. ON the Dev team.&quot;<br />
<br />
How does cursing, and flaming, and attacking and slandering and calling Alan's lineage into question FIX the warrior class?<br />
<br />
It's really simple. It doesn't.<br />
<br />
I understand the frustration. I have it too.<br />
<br />
But it won't fix the class.<br />
<br />
That's all I'm saying. It won't fix my class. All it did was make Alan not even POST on my class' message board. At all. Sure he hides behind a convenient excuse ... but whatever. The point is, Alan doesn't like to talk to monks. Monks are mean to Alan.<br />
<br />
Attacking him won't fix the problem. And sometimes it only creates more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Wubao, you have hit new dizzying heights of cynicism  You are the new Obi-wan.&quot;<br />
<br />
FINALLY! Someone understands me!<br />
<br />
Look. I spent a year getting worked up into a frenzy over &quot;monk&quot; issues.<br />
<br />
It got me nowhere.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of energy. A lot of drive. A lot of passion for the warrior class here.<br />
<br />
But the frustration is warping it. Warping it badly. <br />
<br />
  <br />
&quot;what I THINK he's saying, is let's keep the ideas going for improvement, throw out new ideas, whatever.

<br />
That's exactly what I'm saying.<br />
<br />
And yeah, tossing out even more ideas probably isn't gonna get much done.<br />
<br />
But surely it's a much more positive, constructive way to go about this than flaming Absor constantly?<br />
<br />
I mean, what's going to be more helpful to fixing warriors ...<br />
<br />
A statement like, &quot;Well I think warriors need their taunt skill fixed, because right now it's far too chaotic, far too inconsistent, and I see Paladins and Shadowknights are tanking in XP groups, raids, and even in my SLEEP!&quot;<br />
<br />
Or a statement like, &quot;Absor you %$!@, get your head out of your @!%% and stop sucking your own @!!!%^ long enough to realize that Warriors are @##$! and need to get fixed like really @#@% quickly or your head will explode and I will hunt down and kill innocent kittens until everyone at SOE fixes warriors and publically apoligizes for ruining my class, and giving me a headache!&quot;<br />
<br />
While holding innocent kittens hostage may sound fun, I doubt it'd fix the class.<br />

I have not &quot;attacked&quot; allan and for the most part most people havent either. <br />
Criticism =/= attacking.<br />
<br />
We arent attcking him personally, but we are criticising him.<br />
<br />
Constructive criticism would be a much better way to do it but nothing weve seen would make me think that it would be considered.<br />
<br />
SOE would have to have a roster/schedual/program of some sort. a list of to do things. <br />
<br />
If the balancing is actually on the list then how hard is it to actually say, &quot;Yep its part of our schedual but we will get to it after we do so and so&quot;<br />
<br />
If its not on the list, why not say &quot;Its not on the list we will let you know when&quot;<br />
<br />
is that so hard?<br />
<br />
<br />
But ... and this is what Absor has said ... they can't. Because no one knows what's going on. <br />
<br />
Utter bullshit.<br />
<br />
Very naive of you to think that not 1 person at SOE knows whats going on with melee balancing. Someone would definately know. Even if they have put it on the backburner or are looking into it or have just decided to do nothing, someone had to make the decision which way they would handle this.<br />
<br />
And btw just because someone doesnt agree with your particular view doesnt mean its a rant.</div></div><hr />

I'm a journalist by trade. I've dealt with people like Alan for over a decade now. He's basically saying NO COMMENT.<br />

If you want to try and get a comment from Alan ... go ... right ... ahead.<br />

He can be contacted through the everquest live website.<br />

Most of what I was posting was in response to people defending Haas, or Haas himself.<br />
<br />
Haas was indeed ranting.<br />
<br />
In case you missed Haas' first post:<br />
<br />
&quot;What a fuckin joke.<br />
<br />
This fuckin assclown comes here, basically tells you that he's NOT doing his fuckin job, which is to communicate with the playerbase and the Devs, and you all roll over and play dead.<br />
<br />
Start doing your goddamned job. There's a fuckin problem. You surf the fuckin net, find the facts and figures that THE GODDAMNED PLAYERS ARE HAPPY TO PROVIDE FOR YOU and you present them to your fucking dev team. They look at it on one of their 1000 coffee breaks, AND THEY GIVE YOU A GODDAMNED ANSWER, which you tell us. It's not even like we're asking you to research the fuckin problem, you can find the research and cut and paste fuckin hyperlinks for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
Does SoE think we're broken? What do they plan on doing about it, and when do they plan on doing it? After they revamp a few more fuckin engines? After a few more fuckin expansions? After WoW kills your fucking company as you know it because they actually give a shit about their game?&quot;<br />
<br />
He asks some great questions. At the END of the post.<br />
<br />
After the &quot;what a fucking joke&quot; and &quot;you're an assclown&quot; comments. You know ... the RANT.</div></div><hr />

Actually you were replying to me and even if you would like to use that for people that defend Haas and Haas himself how does him doing that hurt you, monks warriors or the issue? <br />
<br />
At worst it will just get passed over. No one from SOE will read a rant and decide to hold off balancing because of it. No one from SOE staff are gunna be upset by his comments, no one at SOE is gunna instantly decide that they will be petty and fuck with us over a rant. If you dont want to read a rant dont read it.<br />

If you want to try and get something more from them, go right ahead <br />

<br />
In your quest to help the warrior class have you done any of these recently:<br />
<br />
1- Sent feedback in game?<br />
<br />
2- Sent feedback via the eq-live website feedback and user comments area?<br />
<br />
3- E-mailed anyone at Sony/EQ-live about the issue?<br />
<br />
4- Asked anyone on the team, in person, at a fan faire?<br />
<br />
Or ... have you just posted here, and continued to be ignored? <br />
<br />
Flame me. Flame Alan. Flame Haas. Flame Shikari. Whatever. It doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
If you want to get the problems heard, there's channels. Use them. AbsorEq's post count on Steel Warrior should be a HUGE indication to you and anyone else that Steel Warrior is NOT that channel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me too. Believe it or not, me too.<br />
<br />
I AGREE with a lot of what Haas said. I agree with a LOT of what you all are saying.<br />
<br />
I just can't get pissed about it anymore. It's too tiring.<br />
<br />
This thread started out seeking an answer from Alan.<br />
<br />
Alan came and gave his answer.<br />
<br />
The answer sucked.<br />
<br />
What else is new?</div></div><hr />

Lo and the faithful went forth to seek the word.<br />
<br />
For 10 long months the faithful wandered in the wilderness, seeking the keeper of the word.  After many trials and tribulations the faithful did come upon the keeper of the word in a remote and desolate place where rarely was the keeper seen.<br />
<br />
With much beseeching and wailing the true followers of the word did beg the keeper of the word to speak!  To reveal to them the plans of the mighty builders of the great design!<br />
<br />
In the fullness of time the keeper of the word did speaketh the word and the word did sucketh.</div></div><hr />

No one reads feedback.  No one reads e-mails.  SoE won't allow balance discussions at fan faires.  You claim there are other avenues to communicate the problem, but lets be serious for one second...there's not.  I've feedbacked Talisman of the Tribunal being HALF the duration of it's lower level spell every damned day since PoP came out.  There is zero reason that it shouldn't be fixed.  What has it gotten me?  Jack and shit.  If they actually cared about /feedback and actually gave a shit about 1/4 of the e-mails they get, you'd have a point, but they don't.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I dunno where this internet speak &quot;Flame&quot; thing came up, but I don't &quot;Flame&quot; people.  I either insult them, or I criticize them.  I for one think Alan is doing a horseshit job.  That's not a flame, that's my assessment of what he appears to be doing.  I'm very willing to hear what he does all day if he so chooses to defend himself, but I have a feeling it goes something like &quot;Lets surf the bard boards.  Lets surf the Beastlord boards. Lets surf the cleric boards.  Lets surf the druid boards  Lets surf the enchanter boards... Oh damn, 5 o clock already, no time to hit the warrior boards today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The dev team has a limited amount of resources. They have a task list. They work on the tasks given the highest priority.<br />
<br />
Absor is a corporate spokesman. He is going to repeat the company line no matter how asanine it sounds. It is what he is paid to do. Don't expect honesty, wisdom, or profound words from him... expect the company line. Whatever that may be.<br />
<br />
Sony's VP of Entertainment said in a message a few months back that the melee classes were balanced, or something like that... anyway, the message from that was they weren't going to do anything.<br />
<br />
So, where does that leave us?<br />
<br />
1) Stop Debating.<br />
2) Unite.<br />
3) Get Organized.<br />
4) Make a Plan.<br />
5) Take Action.<br />
<br />
Until we do that, why in the world would anyone at Sony give two rat-tail-shakes about what we think???</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apply the same logic you just applied to the everquest live website to THIS message board. No one reads the balance threads. No one reads the posts. SoE won't participate in balance discussions on message boards. You've attacked Alan and SoE &quot;every damned day since BEFORE PoP came out.&quot; There is zero reason that they shouldn't have listened and fixed the warrior class. What has it gotten you? The same result. Jack and shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and I dunno where this internet speak &quot;Flame&quot; thing came up, but I don't &quot;Flame&quot; people. I either insult them, or I criticize them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flaming ... insulting. It's the same thing. If you don't think calling him an assclown and other obscenities if flaming him, fine.<br />
<br />
BUT ... what boggles my mind about you (and a few others) is why you bother to respond to him at all?<br />
<br />
By starting a post off with &quot;What a fucking joke.&quot; and then following it up with calling him an assclown, it doesn't matter that each question you ask has MERIT ... it doesn't matter that you raise good points. All you did was get skipped. Ignored.<br />
<br />
Or as you put it ... all you got was jack and shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Most Paladins don't want Warriors to have Aggro Lock.<br />
<br />
 Most people of all classes don't want to get rid of Aggro Lock.<br />
<br />
 Some Warriors don't want /defensive.<br />
<br />
 Some Warriors DO want /defensive.<br />
<br />
 Monks and Rogues don't want Warriors to do more damage.<br />

 Some folks want to keep the fix through itemization.<br />

 Most folks want the fix to NOT be dependent on gear.<br />

 You CANNOT build a consensus on something as big as this. You should know it, I know it, Romidar knows it, Absor's pet cat knows it. (Whether or not Absor knows it is debatable, given his past statements.)<br />
<br />
 Whatever they decide to do to fix it is going to piss a very vocal minority off. Let's at least make sure that we push them to FIX the damn thing, rather than sit on their asses and play their Mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Superchum.  I don't listen to someone who starts off by yelling/cursing at me either.  Maybe you haven't got what you want yet, maybe you never will.  However, being rude or offensive is never going to get you anywhere.  It's not like you can intimidate SoE into making the changes you want.  <br />
<br />
Step back a little and think how you would react to someone treating you that way, then try working with SoE in the manner you would like to be treated.  Again, maybe it will work and maybe it won't, but ranting and being abusive is not going to work.<br />
<br />
Also, you need to realize 2 things.  First, SoE is a business and they want to make money.  They make money from paying customers, and therefore they actually want happy customers (believe it or not.)  This means not just happy warriors, but happy druids, shaman, monks, rogues, etc.  Therefore they have to be very careful about class balance.  <br />
<br />
Second, don't assume you have all of the information.  It may be that the toolset the game sits on is very tempermental when it comes to melee changes.  I'm betting SoE doesn't clearly understand how all of the code fits together, so making changes in certain areas can be very risky.  I work for a software company and I know what's it's like using an aged toolset...seemingly minor changes can cause huge unforeseen affects and therefore we often refuse to change certain aspects of our software.  Maybe SoE has a similar situation, who knows?  (by the way, if SoE has this problem and you wonder why they don't mention it...go back to my first point about SoE being a business...that would definitely be fuel for the competition)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gazarion</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you're all missing is that SoE is interested at increasing revenue and profit margin. With WoW in sight and other competitors, EQ1 is only a cash cow until their next high end game EQ2. <br />
<br />
Which mean we will not get amazing expansive new development within EQ1, it's only going to be a bunch of new expansion to increase the cash flow that will be used to release EQ2. <br />
<br />
It also mean that their best mind are dedicated in EQ2 development and it's release. Most likely EQ1 team is under-staffed and slowly redirected to EQ2.<br />
<br />
What i understand from the 6 months overdue class balancing is that it's just too expansive and risky to fix. It's better to just dedicate most of their time coding 2 more expansion in the next 5 months at $20 to finance EQ2 release. EQ1 is planned to just fade away, and nothing will change that unless there is a large diminution of revenue before EQ2 is released.</div></div><hr />

Well until someone proves to me that being nice and kissing his ass will get the results we're after, that's not gonna change.  Look at all the whiny bitches on the druid's grove.  For some reason they get a rather large number of requests added to the game.</div></div><hr />

They're druids. That's all the reason they need!<br />

Anyways, don't change Haas. <br />
<br />
Don't expect Alan to actually reply to you, but really, don't change. <br />
<br />
Like I said waaaaaaay up there a few posts, I agree with what you're saying, and would LOVE for a lot of your questions to be answered.<br />
<br />
As someone else said, I'm just too cynical these days.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because I don't have any information for you.- AbsorEQ <br />
This does not necessarily mean there is no information. There may just be no information for us (the player community).<br />
<br />
If SoE came right out and said &quot;We are making no changes to melee other than the ones we've made public for at least 6 months.&quot; what would happen? Some players would realize they were unhappy with the state of the game and quit. It's much better to say nothing and let players continue to hope and pay - a lot of us have been doing this for awhile.<br />
<br />
If SoE came right out and said &quot;We've decided A, B, and C needs to be fixed and we are doing X, Y, and Z about it in the near future.&quot; what would happen? Endless debate, flaring tempers, etc.<br />
<br />
SoE has put itself in a box. Having let this situation fester for so long there is nothing they can do that will make everyone happy. So we get non-commital answers - it shouldn't surprise us.<br />
<br />
There is an unspoken ultimatum - if the degree of unhappiness of a significant portion of the playerbase continues the number of paying customers may decrease.This loss of revenue if significant enough will come to the attention of the parent corporation at some point. It may take a quarterly report or even an annual report. But let Sony find out revenue was lost because long known player issues were not addressed and I gurantee the new managers will make addressing those issues their top priority. Assuming they believe there is a chance to re-capture departed customers.<br />
<br />
The only way to speed up this process may be to write to Sony of America and Sony of Japan, get your point of view in reviews read by potential customers and general RPG game boards.<br />
<br />
Only at the point where professional reputations are at stake and heads are ready to roll because of lost revenue will we get more information. SoE has made this perfectly clear.<br />
<br />
I will say that at some point were I a company spokesman asked to say &quot;Sorry, no news.&quot; or &quot;The classes are perfectly balanced.&quot; I would say, &quot;I've done this for almost a year. Why don't you write a nice long message telling the customers whats going on? There's a limit how foolish anyone is willing to look.&quot; Of course I would be counting on my reputation being good enough to get employment elsewhere in the industry - an interesting conumdrum for anyone who's job it is to be a liason between the company and it's customers.<br />
