<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlea</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently wielding a Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled, augmented with Anger III and I have little problems holding aggro with it. <br />
<br />
Yesterday my guild celebrated its first Vallon Zek kill and so I started to wonder if the Obsidian Scimiter of War might be an upgrade to my old BBoE. Stat wise the Scimitar would be surperior but of course it's the aggro that interests me. <br />
<br />
Would an OSoW with Anger III hold aggro about as well as the BBoE and thus make the upgrade (and the 50 HP coming with it) worthwhile?</div></div><hr />

The good thing on the BBotE is that it has the procrate of the BF means about 40 % more procs than normal.<br />
<br />
The OSoW is a weapon we gave to our rangers for not having aggro. The proc is nice but not half the aggro of the BBotE proc.<br />
<br />
When I am not using my BoW I have the combo BBotE/HG with the HG in offhand. Both are not augmented, but I do not have and also never had any problems with them holding aggro against my elemental equipped guildmembers. <br />
<br />
Before I had the BoW I used this combo when fighting in Sol Ro Temple with the two best equipped monks in guild and they loved me for grabbing aggro so fast and well.<br />
<br />
Something I have seen all the time when watching other warrior is, that they stand much farer away from the mob than I do ( mostly I see the knees of the mob or the toes cause I am gnome ) so that may be one of the reasons for your lack in aggro... .<br />
<br />
But definitely the BBotE isn't the reason. And a BBotE with Anger III should rock. Your offhander is a nice one but nothing to use for a bit of aggro. Maybe you should have a look for something more aggro for your offhand.</div></div><hr />

OSoW our rangers have now basically due to it's light aggro generation.<br />
<br />
( and my GBoS will get the anger3 augment too one day :D )</div></div><hr />

<br />
@Kilaara: I have no problems holding aggro with my current weapons at all and both being augmented with Anger III helps even more.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if I can get another 50 HP (OSoW: 100 HP, BBotE: 50 HP) for the same aggro. According to you the increased proc rate makes the BBotE a better aggro weapon though. That's all I wanted to know. :)<br />
<br />
Do you think my offhand weapon is really that bad though? I know the lifetap proc is as good as zero aggro but that's why I also gave it Anger III to make up for that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also a fan of the BBotE and used it mainhand with a BoC offhand for a long time before I upgraded to a SEWS with anger 3. The proc rate is indeed better than most weapons, and as others have said the Scimitar from one of the Zek brother's isn't very good for agro unless you simply don't have anything better.</div></div><hr />
