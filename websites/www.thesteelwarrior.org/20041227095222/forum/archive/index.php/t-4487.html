<br />
Thanks for all the info so far on questions I've had here - invaluable :) and much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Wanted to see what the consensus is on mounts.<br />
<br />
I bought a horse for my warrior primarily because I was tired of being dependent on casters for SOW... and also cuz I think it looks kewl... (can't resist, I grew up riding horses in RL)<br />
<br />
The horse I got isn't all that fast, so I'm saving up for a faster one.<br />
<br />
Seems to me mounts are mostly a benefit to casters, who can med while mounted.<br />
<br />
Now, if their mana regenerates quicker while mounted, wouldn't it make sense that warrior's HP should be able to regen quicker while mounted?<br />
<br />
Else, what real benefit does the mount have for melee class?<br />
<br />
Your thoughts?<br />
<br />

I'm not sure.  I got a fast horse because I was tired of running around slow from PoK to LDoN camps.  :P  It used to be that being on a horse helped with blindness in certain zones, but I don't think this is the case anywhere anymore still.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, slamming someone with a horse should give a damage modifier for sure!! :D<br />
Maybe a horse-slam is already active in-game! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL WAR ELEPHANTS!  That is an awesome idea!! Should have camels too, that spit poison at your enemies :P<br />
<br />
No, HP does not regen on a horse, only mana does.  Which I think is unfair.  I think melee classes should be able to have as much benefit from a horse as do casters... if their mana regens quicker, then so should our HP.  I included that with my ideas in the Brainstorm Session, in the warroom.<br />
<br />
The only benefits I get from my horsie are:<br />
<br />
-run a little faster than normal, but not quite as fast as sow.  Still, its saved my life on a number of occasions when I ran screaming to zone.<br />
-fall a little farther without getting hurt.  I can go down steep mountainous ravines without getting injured when I'm mounted.  But don't try jumping your horsie off the top of the Aviak city in NK. I did that once. OUCH.<br />
-Kewl factor.  Hey I just plain like how I look riding my horsie :)<br />
<br />
Some disadvantages from horsies:<br />
<br />
-Can be difficult to target at times because horsie's head gets in the way.  This isn't an issue with lizards, BTW.<br />
-Difficult to loot at times for above reason.<br />
-expect to go through water and rations a LOT faster.  Horsie needs to eat and drink too.<br />
-expensive as hell.  My horsie cost about 12,000pp and he's a nag.  He can't run very fast, he's slow to charge.  I am saving up to buy a chain rope bridle.  Costs about 100,000pp, but runs FAST.<br />
<br />
Myths about horsies:<br />
<br />
-Horsies are better/faster depending on color.  FALSE.  Its the type of bridle that makes the difference, not the color.<br />
-Horsies increase HP, AC or anything else.  FALSE.  Doesn't help you at all in these areas (But I think it SHOULD, dammit)<br />

<br />
1- Each time you cast one, it's a different mount. Which means, if you sit there and cast and re-cast your horse, you will eventually get one that starts up from walk to gallop faster than the others.<br />
<br />
Necromancers have discussed this in detail on their boards.<br />
<br />
2- Melees get no real benefit from the horses other than the look cool factor, and the improved speed.<br />
<br />
3- Your 12k horse is slower than run 3.<br />
<br />
4- Lancelot rode a horse. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats an excellent idea.  And it would be a lot more realistic.  Horses should be able to help the rider do damage, thats what horses did in actual cavalry.<br />
<br />
Other improvements I'd like to see with horsies:<br />
<br />
-horsies should be able to jump over stuff.<br />
-horses should be able to rear and pivot like a trained cavalry horse does (these abilities could also improve with the value of the horse) Pivot would allow you to turn quickly during close combat.  Rear would allow your horse to come down on top of enemy and do damage with hooves.<br />
-melee class should get a sitting regen to HP while mounted<br />
-horsie emoticons (LOL)<br />
-horsie should increase stamina since you're not having to run on  your own legs<br />
-improve horsie so rider can target without horsie head getting in the way<br />
<br />
and this is just my own silly idea that would improve kewl factor:<br />
<br />
-should be able to buy tack for horsie, such as saddles and bridles that have AC and HP bonuses and effects.  Would also like to see battle armor for horsie such as chamfrons (face plate), neck plate, plate for chest and rump.  Blankets (like the kind in jousting tourneys) would also be great, though I'm sure this would be hell for CG techies :P<br />

I personally have not noticed this.  Horsie always looks, runs, starts up the same no matter how often I cast it.<br />
<br />
However - you can equip everyone in your group with horsies, if you want to trust giving your bridle to someone else to use.  Simply give them the bridle, cast horsie, then pass the bridle to the next player, cast, and so on.  Players do not have to have the bridle in their inventory to remain mounted.  They can also zone and horsie won't disapeer.  Everyone will be riding a clone of your horsie though, only differences will be the size of the horsie which will adjust depending on players (Halflings ride little mini-horsies, for example and Barbarians get big Shire/Clydesdale sized horsies)<br />

The major reason that SoE had expected people to buy horses was the status symbol effect: I have a fast as hell horse, therefore I am richer and thus better than you. The meditative bonus was something kicked around alot at the beginning.</div></div><hr />

Hmmmmmm.  Well, on Firiona Vie they aren't.  One more reason I prefer my server, aside from the fact there are fewer prepubescent boys running around shouting and whining continuously :p<br />

<br />
The necromancers are pretty sure of this one. So take it up with them if you disagree. Heh. I'm sure they'll love to &quot;debate&quot; it.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The necros are wrong I'm fairly sure.<br />
<br />
 The way you get a super fast accelerating/stopping horse is to summon your horse with bad lag/framerate. not positive exactly why/how it works. It's the server compensating for your computer speed I guess. But get yourself WAAAAY lagged out and summon horse. Then it will be superhorse until you lose it. Best I've found is to turn spell effects all the way up. Zoom in close to my char in 3rd person, and spam my 10th ring 10 times or so. Then make horse. Tada, wonderhorse!<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: This stopped working for me like 2 months ago. But guildmates say they can still make superhorse no problem. If anyone else tries it let me know if it still works for you.</div></div><hr />

You obviously have all the answers you would ever need in everquest.<br />

Well guess what, Zen.<br />
<br />
I HAVE a chain bridle.<br />
<br />
I've used one.<br />
<br />
I was offering some advice and some insight, drawn from experience.<br />
<br />
Super-horse, as Grimlokk stated, DOES exist.<br />
<br />
The necros have their theory. <br />
<br />
Grimm has his.<br />
<br />
I don't which to believe.<br />
<br />
But I do know, it does exist.<br />

The rules of this particular form, the ARENA, as I understand them, are that personal attacks are unwelcome here.  I have made it clear that I don't wish to debate with him.  He continues to pursue me, onto this thread.  He has made derogatory, rude and personally insulting comments about me here.  I view that as an attack.  I have asked for him to take it to the outhouse.  That is in accordance with the rules of this forum as it is set up.<br />

If you were truly an &quot;outsider&quot;, you wouldn't take sides on the issue.  Or is this just a little &quot;old boys club&quot; where you pile on someone who happens to disagree with one of your buddies?  Please advise.  I would like to know.<br />

Read that again please, 'aren't totally blameless' doesn't mean 'you are entirely to blame'. If suggesting you share some responsibility with Wu is 'taking his side' then he needs better friends :p <br />

Now I ain't flaming you, but the way you've become so immediately defensive against me points at why this thread is in danger of devolving. As for assumed favoritism, all i can tell you is that sitting here i do not believe I am being unjust /shrug. <br />

Yes, I am defensive at this point because Wu has been flaming me non stop for two days now on a subject I have repeatedly ad nauseum said I am not interested in pursuing.  I came here to get away from him, and he followed me, and hurled more insults my way.<br />
<br />
Iksandar, I don't take offense at every &quot;slight&quot; that comes my way.  I put up with his slights for a long time, I tried to be humorous, I tried everything to get him to leave me alone. When he followed me here I finally made issue of it.  I didn't consider his posts appropriate here, as per the rules of this forum.  I am feeling harassed, not slighted, and I have asked for it to stop. If I'm acting like a kindergartener for taking this stand, then I guess that is what I am.  My understanding is that &quot;personal attacks&quot; are not to be tolerated on this forum.  I consider this kind of language to be inflammitory, insulting and a personal attack:<br />
<br />
&quot;Get some levels under your belt, young warrior.&quot;<br />
&quot;You obviously have all the answers you would ever need in everquest.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why do you even bother to come to a message board.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know it all, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe you don't guys don't consider that to be inflammitory at all.  Or maybe the moderators don't enforce their rules.  I don't know, haven't been here very long.  And from the looks of things, I won't be hanging here much longer.<br />
<br />
Folks, I came here to have fun, rub elbows with some fellow warriors, ask some questions, and share some of the things I have learned.  I would like to enjoy a vent every now and then in the outhouse, and I like to get creative in my venting and have fun with it, make it an excersize in creative writing which is something I enjoy, but if people are going to get bent out of shape because I make a joke about a ficticious character, and then follow me around the bboards insulting me... then this isn't the kind of place I am going to like.  <br />
<br />
No offense, I don't know you, and you don't know me.  I'd prefer not to leave, especially since I just signed up at Magelo for the sole purpose of taking part in this bboard.  But I am not going to tolerate this kind of *explitive* not anywhere, not any place.<br />

I hardly ever lock a thread. When I edit someones post it's when:<br />
1. Someone has a lot of profanity directed at someone..ie: &quot;#$*$( you and @(*@) your ideas because you're @)(#)(@ stupid&quot;. This is a personal attack,<br />

I don't think so, Marglok. They all died.<br />
<br />
My chain bridle horse, Ryfelgri (Welsh for &quot;War Cry&quot;), loves to pass druids with SoE. :p  <br />
<br />
Sure they all died, but the important thing here is htey tried their best. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No matter what I did, said, meant, etc, it was wrong, or an attack towards her, or an insult, etc.<br />
<br />
I could say &quot;You are a cool chick&quot; and she would be &quot;Whats that mean?? You saying I am 'cool, for a womyn?' &quot; or some other such crap.  This was best case scenario, and it was often times worse.  I tried putting up with this for maybe 4 or 5 dates, and had to call it quits before I resorted to self castration and spendin the rest of my life as a tao monk or something.<br />
<br />
Wu is a good guy, and talks and acts like ANY other guy that posts here, and doesnt examine, re-examine, and do it all over again to make sure every last little thing he says is perfectly stated, and not able to be taken as an attack.  Most, if not all the guys that post here on a regular basis are beer and brat kinda guys, that dont give a rats ass about drama, or whether something they say or type can be construed as an insult.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Wu didnt post here until the end of the first page of threads...so much for him &quot;following you&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you came here, posted, and asked questions...then when Wu answered them, you responded with &quot;I'll have my own chain bridle soon enough and make up my own mind then.&quot;... so why bother?? Why waste our time, the bandwidth used to serve this forum, and your own energy if you have you mind made up, disregard the comments of other people here, since, as you stated, you are going to do as you please anyways, since you know all...<br />
<br />
Oh, and if what Wu said gets your panties in such a bind, perhaps you are better off rolling a druid instead, or canceling your EQ account, and spending your free time watching lifetime and oxygen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before you pile on me in defense of your BUDDY, you should check out the thread in the outhouse I was referring to.  That was where this started.  Do your HOMEWORK before you stick your nose into a debate that was supposedly ended by the moderators on this bboard.<br />
<br />
I am running into a number of guys like you on this bboard who have issues with women.  Take your angst toward your ex-girlfriend elsewhere.  I'm not her, not all women are the same contrary to your narrow minded little-boy attitude.  This is starting to look more and more like an &quot;old BOYS club&quot;.<br />

<br />
Do you tolerate this kind of sexist garbage here?  Is this an old BOYS club where the guys pile on like this one just did?  Where they can make nasty little gender slams without fear of reprisal?<br />
<br />
Do you enforce your rules here for EVERYONE? Or do you just enforce the rules in favor of your liitle guy buddies? <br />
<br />
I checked out your profiles.  Most of you are boys, 10 years younger than me.  Seems what we have here, is a club for boys.  Any men?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 Things, to keep this thread on track ...<br />
<br />
1- With the upcoming melee changes, there's always a possiblity that mounts might actually be given some USE for melees.<br />
<br />
That would be interesting. And fun. Anyone else have thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
2- Zhenobia, you play on the FV server correct? Since originally you asked for advice on mounts, I will give the nicest possible advice I can give: When you save up the 100 to 120k the chain bridle costs, I'd suggest possibly, maybe, holding onto it for a second and considering buying a Primal Velium Warsword. In the long run, in my opinion, it would serve your warrior better than your horse. And your server is the only one where a person can buy that weapon.<br />
<br />
Horses are fun. And look neat. But overall, they really don't do much for melee characters.<br />
<br />
Edit: Bah, I can't spell</div></div><hr />
