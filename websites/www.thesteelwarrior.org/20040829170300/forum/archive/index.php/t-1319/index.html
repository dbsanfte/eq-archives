<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all!  <br />
<br />
After a three month hiatus (damn my job!) I'm back in Norrath and of course my first stop was to the bar to buy a round of drinks.  Funny thing though... there was nobody at the bar (old messageboards).  Reminds me of that time as a kid when I went off to summer camp and when I got home my parents had moved... but that's a different story.<br />
<br />
Poking around the boards a bit it looks like I've missed a few things (rumors of free AA points and a charm thingy have my interest).  I won't be back in game for another week, but I'm going to be trying to catch up here in the meantime.  They didn't go and do anything silly like fix aggro while I was away did they?<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough talk!  It's great to be back.  A round for the bar on me... and where's that cute barb lady I always flirt with?<br />
