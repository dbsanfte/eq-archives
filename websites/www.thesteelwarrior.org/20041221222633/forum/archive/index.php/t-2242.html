C. on a stroll of bad luck for skillups, how long has it been since you gotten a skill up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are way over twinked/always have damage shield on.<br />
<br />
That said, my rogue (who does a fair amount of tanking) took until 50th (from being able to max defense at 39th) to get 200 defense. <br />
<br />
And your cap is 180. I too would be interested in knowing when the last time you got a skill up was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you cant put points into defense or offense at the trainer</div></div><hr />

I'd go with petitioning. I had problems where my skills would get stuckon a couple of times on my characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That might be good advice, if agility actually helped, and if he hadn't been tanking a large number of mobs that were hitting him.  Petition and see if gms can help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agility actually does help for defensive skill ups.  And your defense will raise faster versus red cons then vs your avg xp grop blue cons, /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim AB</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason I always seem to get skillups when fighting two mobs at the same time, and there is no need for red cons here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, multiple mobs hitting you seems to increase the chance for skill-ups. And agi definatly helps. What race are you and what is your agi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dvus Nme</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can see my AGI in my Magelo Wolveren, the link is right under my name... I have been getting PLed by a Shaman in ToFS tanking 2-4 mobs at once non stop. Theres definitely something wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im pretty sure there is some kind of anti twinking/pling code in effect either by design or accident.<br />
<br />
If I twink a character so taht they have tons of ac/hps I very rarely get defensive skillups until I fight mobs more in line with my stats. Either there is some anti twink code (which I doubt) or I think skill ups for defensive work on some kind of ac vs attk relationship.<br />
<br />
However I do seem to get skillups when getting beat on multiple enemies. Best thing to do is let 2 or 3 low blue mobs beat on you while the shm heals ya.<br />
<br />
Also if your getting PLed by a shm, two things:<br />
<br />
1) The mob will prolly be always slowed therefore less hits = less skill up chances<br />
<br />
2) You'll level so fast that skillups will be few and far between.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to let 2-3 mobs beat on you for 20mins or so.</div></div><hr />
