<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomercy</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been a year now since I've palyed EQ( just got back from Iraq) and  then i could post here as an overlord but now im very much a noob again.<br />
<br />
When i left we had just broken into time and now that I'm back they still farm time some but have moved onto GoD and OoW.  I left on top as the highest DKP holder in the guild and on my return im still 10th and no other warriors close to me.<br />
<br />
So my question.....Should I get the darkblade assuming i see it or are there even better weapons in these new expansions i have yet to even see.<br />
 I need to make wise decisions because i know im gonna have to burn though anlot of DKP getting geared to the lvl i should have been at had I not left.  Feel free for any other items i should be on the look out for as well.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for any responses and see ya again once I become worthy of the board again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also is your guild in Qvic? If so you can save some points on a raex bp, the effect is also on the Vadds gloves which are FAR more common in Qvic.  Post a magelo if you have one, it would make it a lot easier to suggest things worth getting, also, what sorta stuff has your guild been killing lately? That would also help.<br />
<br />
Welcome back!</div></div><hr />

ALso doing some Proving ground trials But still not real sure on what OoW has to offer. Ill snag the Darkblade on your advice because im just sick of BoW.It served its purpose but now i see to many and well...I dont like that  lol.   Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your just looking to upgrade your bow asap, theres some options.<br />
<br />
if they going to flag you for qvic, you can hope for a fleshbiter from uqua. from qvic when u get there there is chaotic black scimitar.  <br />
<br />
another option would be the fang of feratha, 2hander from feratha in riftseekers.  stun proc, 53/30, 75ac &amp; 275 hps..  not difficult to kill, just a fair amount of hps.<br />
<br />
one last option, if you have lots of friends from your server, do 1.5 and slap a couple of anger/ykesha augs on it.  <br />
<br />
not sure what DW weapons you have atm, but if you going to go the DW route, theres also a fairly easy to get EoE clone from wall of slaughter, velitorkin's femur.   19/19 stun proc, although the stats are not so hot.<br />
<br />
theres some discussion on whether the new 2handers like matchless claymore are equivalent of better to a DW setup with DBoW, but personally i dont see me giving up DBoW for a while yet. it was like night and day when i finally got it.</div></div><hr />

It is a great weapon... Else, you can get a DBotW and Epic 1.5 in secondary it is a great combo.<br />

But if i were you i wouldn't count on it, because more and more guild are stopping to do Tacvi because OoW is much better RvR.</div></div><hr />

We got 4 DBoWs in 35+ or so RZ kills where the last 2 dropped after 30+.<br />
2 Fleshbiters so far and thats a not much better rate than DBoW's.<br />
We arent in Tacvi yet and i am not sure we will ever do it (Txevu atm).</div></div><hr />

Take the darkblade if your going to be back at hardcore raiding, The darkblade will last you threw OOW end game (if something better then DB drops)..MSC is not better agro,nor is BBB, The proc mod on DB helps it be the best agro weapon in game (IMO) and basing this on other warriors in my guild and there agro along  going up against them Daily...As far as off hand you could go with the Black Scimi,Jos,or painsipper. GL have some fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what you should do. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
A small advice from someone that waited 10 months with ZERO Darkblade drop :<br />
Get the 1st one that drops (DBlade or Fleshbiter).<br />
BBB could be a possibility, but a rare one.</div></div><hr />
