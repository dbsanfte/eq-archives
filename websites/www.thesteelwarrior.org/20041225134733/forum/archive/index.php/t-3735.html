<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kassel</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've recently come back to EQ, quit for a while due to guild issues and burnout about 2 months before PoP. Playing as #4-5 in the tank setup on raids and crap in groups got rather old.<br />
<br />
I came back and PL'd up a wizard when LoY came out, up to 57 on him so far -- but to pull that off most of my warrior's tradeable gear went byebye.<br />
<br />
I've been pondering dusting the warrior off for some random dungeon runs and whatnot, but there's some issues:<br />
<br />
He's 60, no AA.<br />
His gear is craptastic -- 3141 hp, 1066 ac, 1229 atk, with 2 blue epics.<br />
I have no cash to spare for further upgrades, owe some friends unbelievable amounts of plat at the moment.<br />
<br />
magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=223728)<br />
<br />
I wasn't the greatest tank before I quit, and I'm now down a number of pieces of cobalt and a CoF.<br />
<br />
I know the usual argument is to just burn to 65 and then do AA's, but I have serious doubts as to my ability to tank things a 65 would want to toy with.<br />
<br />
Current plan: kick the bar over to 90-100% AA, and slum it out in LDON to get some upgrades while I can still adventure with low-mid 50's types.<br />
<br />
So, is this a decent plan or have I completely lost it?</div></div><hr />

You'll get 65, plat and aps enough to be a average level 65 tank.</div></div><hr />

Then Get 65...cant stress it anymore than that.<br />
THEN worry about AAs<br />
Equipment wise, you will find plenty of decent gear is now available for decent prices..Cultural Armor is much better than cobalt(other than BP and Legs),and much cheaper.<br />
If you have no deity(like me) there is Fine Heraldic for the agnostic,not quite as good as fierce but its suffices.<br />
Other than that,get in a guild and raid.Even ToV armor is still acceptable for every day tanking.<br />
Also, if you exp enough in Bastion of Thunder after hitting 62, you will have some chances at Ornate Molds for way better armor<br />
LDoN armor isd quite nice too,but I would reccomend getting to 65 quickly in PoP,then &quot;slumming&quot; thru AAs in Takish adventures in LDoN,save up for the Royal armor</div></div><hr />

<br />
get a 6ac 65hp ring<br />
<br />
Cultural Armor is much better<br />
He's in debt, I doubt he can afford a single piece of gear atm ~</div></div><hr />

Im the type that likes to help out others, and for a while (still do some) I use to put together BoT Tower mini raids and PoI Xanamech raids.  <br />
<br />
Whats special about Xanamech is that he ALWAYS dropped his 41% haste item (dropped him  at least a dozen times, always had it), all you need to do is spend ~30 minutes on farming his quest items, which you can even obtain on your way to the gnome, Nitram Anizok .  The gnome has to be up in order for you to trigger him, you basically have to escort the gnome up to Xanamech, he respawns every 3 hours... 41% haste item every 3hrs...<br />
<br />
... made a lot of melees happy with their new haste items they thought theyd never see, and a lot of warriors were overjoyed as they never thought theyd see an Taunting Blow weapon... <br />

farm a lot of items along the road as well.  You can do the raid with less than 3 groups (done it with 16 people, all pickup gruops, no ubers, from level 60-65), just need a couple of tanks and at least 1 enchanter, 1 shaman, and 2 or more CHers.  Xanamech is even knight tankable so not too hard - get another CHer.  If you make it to him, you will win, 95% of the event is getting to him.  Event is less than 1 hr from zoning in/buffing, to AE TL out.  Xanamech is slowable too.  Only problem with pick up raids is you have to hand out very clear instructions, and also giving out instructions on what NOT to do... gets to be a headache, but in time you'll get some regulars who always ask what raids you putting together today and they can support you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw, wizards are pretty weak at farming cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kassel</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I have PoP. Wizard was on another account, moved the warrior over since a $50 move was less than PoP + LoY + LDON for the first account. I just happened to miss most of it =P<br />
<br />
Most drops will be rather difficult to come by, I have no intention of making this guy my main again (short of some acts of god on SoE's part) Anything a wizard can solo though is all good =)<br />
<br />
The problem I can see with pop is that I've got the AC of a paper sack. Things were difficult enough before when I couldn't always hold aggro, right now I wouldn't doubt that a pally could out-tank me on AC/HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Untrue.<br />
<br />
 I can't update my Magelo, but you're not far behind me either in AC or HP, and with 2 epics, you've got better aggro generation than me. And I do fine as long as you don't let people try johnson-measuring with aggro. (My personal suggestion is bring a like minded cleric who won't mind rezzing after.)</div></div><hr />

This is surely not good advice.  My guild saw the shim drop 3 times in about a dozen kills (24 loot items).<br />
<br />
If you want guaranteed haste items, take the Xanamech force and go kill Yelinak instead.  Guaranteed two 41% haste items every kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osyris</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK none of this is to be mean =P<br />
<br />
I know people will disagree but I'd say you have around the same HP and less AC as an Unbuffed level 55-57 Paly/SK. Most people that are 60 with really bad gear hunted in the outdoor zones that don't drop any money/loot. If you don't believe me, level a character in sol A from 20-40, Picking up and selling everything to the gnome in zone. You'll be surprised.<br />
<br />
Epics are just fine for a &quot;good&quot; exp group though. You're epics and attack are just fine for a level 65.<br />
<br />
Now as far a LDoN goes, I want you to sit down and calculate how much you play a day, how many points you get on a &quot;SUCCESSFUL&quot; adventure, how long each adventure takes and how much the items you want will cost you. . .  now think if you're not even going to make the warrior your main will you want to invest that much time? It's like joining the military, it doesn't seem like that much time when people talk about it casually. Until you've been sitting in the Persian gulf for 9 months.<br />
<br />
Don't mess with AA till 65, you get AA so fast killing at 65 that getting AA at 60 is almost a complete waste of time. Level the warrior up to 63 and go to HoH. You should be able to handle those mobs and it's very good exp.  They hit for around 500-800. <br />
<br />
As for my view, I'd just keep the warrior on the shelf for now, Get PoP for the other account and level the wizard up. The warrior is going to just be a big headache until you can get him up to par<br />
<br />
But if you can't wait grab a few friends and do the armor cycle in Kael and get plenty of armor to fill the warrior out for free.<br />
<br />
I forget if the stuff in Plane of Growth summons. I think most of it doesn't though. You can go up there and solo with your wizard for some pretty good cash, and the warrior armor drops up there are about equal to the thurg quest stuff.<br />
<br />
Sorry for crushing you all with reality. =P<br />

with 2 blue epics.  <br />
<br />
Put away the blue and break out the red...that's 30 more stamina which with your low HP number I think I can safely assume your stamina isn't near max. In addition to the extra 30 stam it's also two 500hate procs.<br />
<br />
Blue=nice attack bonus, good for raids that you aren't tanking on. The suck if you are in an exp group or raid and you ARE tanking.<br />
<br />
Red=The win all the way around, more HP, more aggro...did I mention more HP?<br />
<br />
Oh, Osyris Protectors of Growth have been re-instated to patrol the entire zone again. No more soloing in PoG I'm afraid. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kassel</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds about more with what I sussed the playerbase to be, Osyris. Warrior's taking a back seat until the wiz hits 65 anyways.<br />
<br />
The char/account setup right now looks like this:<br />
Account 1: Kunark, Velious, Luclin<br />
(used to have warrior)<br />
bunch of alts under 20<br />
<br />
Account 2: All<br />
Wizard<br />
Warrior (moved)<br />
<br />
Moving him was cheaper than catching up on the expansions, and my setup couldn't really dual box anymore.<br />
<br />
So, revised plan (for when I play him):<br />
<br />
Grab run3, level to 65, scrounge up gear where I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">off topic here but can the poi dragon really be done with 3 groups? just the last time i did him i think i was level 60 with 6k max hps and we had a zerg army of 72.<br />
<br />
not sure how much of a tougher fight it will be with 3 groups. anyone else care to comment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lamini</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gulug <br />
<br />
Ive personally made my own pick-up raids against him at least a dozen times.  Lowest number ive done it with was 16.  Ive even had ubers before say that doing it with 3 groups was way overkill.  Remember, hes SLOWABLE, just have to land debuffs like mad on him ASAP (who cares if debuffers die, raid will live).  One time we did him we had no tanks at all other than myself a 59 warrior, and a bard, and I was MA and at 7200hp RAID buffed.  Our guild use to pop him as soon as gnome spawned just for the nice upgrade from an RBG/CoF to Xanamechs 41% haste choker, sometimes as much as 3 times in 1 day since respawn is only 3hrs and the fact that hes so easy to do in small numbers.  BTW you get PoI factory flag for this, another bonus to those thinking if they should join you.<br />
<br />
people tend to confuse this guy for Behemoth who gets you tactics flagged :(... HUGE difference hehe.  Hope this helps Gulug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by gulug <br />
not sure how much of a tougher fight it will be with 3 groups. anyone else care to comment?  This guy can easily be done by 3 groups of competent people even with Velious/Luclin type gear. I have a group of friends that farms smaller raid targets and we've done him with 12 before, most of my friends are Ssra/VT level gear including the tank (6300hp unbuffed).<br />
<br />
Also, saying that the haste neck and hate hammer drop often is pretty misleading. The neck is more common than the hammer, and that drops 1/3 or 1/4 kills in my experience. Of course with such a fast repop, it's only a matter of time before you get enough for everyone and their twinks.<br />
<br />
As for outfitting the warrior, try to get in on some BoT tower kills, get a few nice items. I would also recommend setting up residence in either Veksar or BoT. If you can get a group to hunt Veksar regularly, you can pick up some nice gear pretty easily. If you can tank BoT effectively, then park there until you are level 65+50aa, by that time you should have gotten luck on some ornate armor drops. You might also consider doing LdoN for exp and APs. The cash drops are not bad so you can spend your time saving to buy upgrades with your split of the plats, and you can buy some LDoN gear with your APs. In any case, don't do any AAs other than run3 until you get to 65.</div></div><hr />
