<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No, I'm not overly serious about this, but I did have a stray thought which might produce some interesting changes to the paladin agro things (no comment on shadowknights, however, as I don't play one).<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, its one that wouldn't affect warriors at all, although a lot of other classes would have screaming fits.<br />
<br />
The big complaint about paladin stuns is that Cease can be used to generate a good chunk of agro and with KEI up, the mana can be regenerated in just one tick.  Very nice if you have KEI.  If you don't have KEI, its another matter entirely, and the mana useage pretty much requires the constant use of Cease to keep from putting too heavy of a drain on mana.  I have a 57 paladin main, and while I'll be the first to admit my gear isn't the most optimal (its actually somewhat subpar right now, imo), but I suspect even better equipped paladins would need to keep an eye on their mana pool.<br />
<br />
(and for the record, I love Cease, not only because its easy on the mana pool, but also because when I pull, I want to generate a nice bit of agro without leaving the mob standing out in the open any longer than necessary - which is a problem with Stun)<br />
<br />
The thing that seperates KEI from all of the previous group mana spells isn't the amount of mana regeneration (although that is pretty high).  Clarity II has over 75% of the mana regeneration.  What makes KEI different from the other spells is the duration.  The other clarity spells only last for a half hour.  KEI lasts for over two (iirc).<br />
<br />
One possible solution?<br />
<br />
Kill the duration on KEI.  Maybe not bring it down to a half an hour, but a lot less than the current number.<br />
<br />
Of course, the problem with that is that over half the player population would scream bloody murder, but I think it is an interesting solution to the problem (although knights with lots of FT won't be hit nearly as hard) - even if it does have only the proverbial snowball's chance of coming about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have an easier solution -- make it so KEI doesn't work on any hybrids that have warrior as a part of what makes up the hybrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eumerin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suspect if that were possible, then the devs could tweak KEI so that it boosted agro generation by 500%, but only on warriors.<br />
<br />
Hey, it would give warriors a reason to join the crowds clamoring for KEI, right?<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is crazy talk Hulanta, that would mean there would be a price to pay for using a hybrid tank again, ie med time for aggro lock OR group aggro management like with warriors tanking.  It isn't like there is a precedent for your suggestion or anything *cough* Bards *cough*.<br />
<br />
It truely is difficult to balance the 3 plate tank classes without giving anyone an advantage.  But this idea is interesting, I would have to stop and think of the ramifications gamewide though before deciding for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kill the duration on KEI. Maybe not bring it down to a half an hour, but a lot less than the current number. <br />
<br />
And then you are going to have the shammies screaming bloody murder because it will make enchanters the preferred slowers in groups! And the clerics ..... they are going to be insisting on an ench (or bard) as well as any other casters!<br />
<br />
As a side note I rarely have kei, or any mana regen buff on my pally (he is on the same acc as my ench :( ), and he never has any mana issues, but there again I multi-box him with a nec who either twitches when needed or group mana taps if we are fighting casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It has always been a very bad disparity that KEI lasts hours, but regen and avatar last what? a few minutes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">warrior kei adds aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wasn't suggesting what I said, actually.  Just simplifying the original posters ideas into a simpler solution.</div></div><hr />
