<br />
1- I now dual weild a Bladecatcher of the marshall and a Blade of insanity. they are delay 25 and 21. would haste affect both delays when dual weilding?<br />
<br />
2- I've seen a thread about haste here when a seach in lucy returned a few items called &quot;pure haste&quot; but has recommended lvl. is there anything I can afford being a lvl35?<br />
<br />
3- anything I could try to get to drop at my lvl? or should I just look for something to buy cause i'm low lvl?<br />
<br />
thks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">go buy some silver chitin hand wraps; decent enough AC for a 21% haste item and not as stat-killing as a FBSS and once you hit the 26% haste items on up base cost is 10K+ plat.<br />
and it will work for single or dual wielding.<br />
<br />
drops at your level? at 35 you're maybe able to get into a lower guk group to loot one; that is if the level 70 necromancer that's soloing the zone will let you :D<br />
overall; from 30-45 you're kinda sh*t out of luck for droppable while hunting upgrades. save them coins man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Short answer = yes it affects both.<br />
<br />
Pretend for a moment that you get 100 mainhand swings in one minute (really fast weapon).  With 20% haste you now get 120 (multiply by 1.2).  With 50% haste you get 150.  With max haste (no bardsong) you get 200 swings a minute.  With 100% haste + bard overhaste you'll get 215-220 swings in one minute.<br />
<br />
Granted you will have more mainhand swings than offhand, but yeah haste affects both of them.<br />
<br />
You could probably afford an FBSS (21% haste) pretty easily at your level.  There are others but they get more and more expensive.  Best buyable haste is 36%.  Most people will settle for 31-32% buyable belts.  Oldschool nodrop haste caps at 41% (gotta kill bosses for em).  Some of the newer haste items in cutting edge content has 45% or more worn haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wrathhob</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok....so for now I must concentrate on saving (estimate) 3kpp for a SCHW right? btw, what a FBSS?:P<br />
<br />
ohhh, and thaks for the explanations:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">handwraps are a good bet too.<br />
When you hit 48-52 there's something to be said for tanking Naggy or Vox, as both drop very good haste.<br />
If you miss haste from those dragons, and have access to a group that can handle Veksar, the rotted shopkeeper drops the Soulscream belt, which is pretty standard issue 31% haste. You'll need some help with him, but not huge help.<br />
There's a list of haste items in the library too.<br />
Decent haste is kind of a problem for warrior mains 40-55, as you'll have to go into trader mode to get enough plat to get haste, and it's hard to loot it yourself.<br />
I'd urge you to discuss with your guild, too, since they might be willing to help you with some of the targets.</div></div><hr />

1) Haste effects both.<br />
2) Here's a link to the OoW Augmentation Generator (http://plurpage.com/everquest/aug.php).  However, the drops needed for these are quite rare/expensive to buy in the bazaar, and you need GM tradeskillers-preferably with Mastery AA's-to do the combines if you want even a decent shot of success.  Therefore the final product will most likely sell for 100k or more.<br />
3) I would personally recommend buying a pair of Silver Chitin Hand Wraps.  Better haste than a Flowing Black Silk Sash and better stats too iirc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pure Haste&quot; are augments that are made by greedy enchanters and sell for 100K plat each.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the skill needed to make these-only the first combine is done with JC.(and that's a 351 trivial btw...my Chanter with JCM3 still fails on those about 50 percent of the time)  The rest is done with Poison Making, Alchemy, and Blacksmithing.  Combine that with the fact that things like discordant scoriae generally have been selling in bazaar for 30k+, and you not only get 40% haste but +45hps, +12 to a stat, or +3ds/regen/shielding, etc. and I think it would be a pretty good deal to pick one up for 100k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah-just looked it up on Drinal-there's only one for sale, and it's at 180k :eek: atm.  Was trying to be conservative/wishful...guess I overdid it and underestimated a tad ;)<br />
<br />
Point I was going for is Radiant Anything of Pure Haste would be quite a good deal at 100k total price.....at least for the moment and probably for at least a few months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are pleanty of good entry level cheap haste items thesedays. on tribunal fbss goes for maybe 1k? 1.5 maybe? seems like a lot at lower levels but its not really. SCHW are around 2-2.4k so i'd go with those for the AC/stats. frenzied camp in guk is quite easy for a group of 55's, so you might be able to just loot a fbss. once your in your 52+'s you could also xp in velks and try to loot the schw. <br />
<br />
you could try to farm one of these from rujark if you have ldon:<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23522<br />
no clue on the drop rates though.<br />
<br />
Shadowy Assassin Sash (sp?) from luclin is also an option, sometimes as low as 1.5k, maybe less now, 5sta/dex and 26% haste, marginally better than the fbss.<br />
<br />
other than that i'd just search your bazaar for items with haste, since haste percentages are reported in item description now, what you see is what you get. you never know what you might find for cheap. <br />
<br />
btw, I didnt use haste until i was level 50 and i got a belt of contention from a plane of sky raid :) I did just fine with agro using a wurmslayer and a sarnak skullsplitter, but thesedays way, way better weapons are available for cheap, so i'd focus more on a good set of proccing weapons (read: yaks etc are cheap and effective) and just use a cheap haste item until you're able to farm/loot/raid for better.</div></div><hr />
