I know the rule of three if the level of enchantment is level 15 you are allowed to equip it at level 12.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I went to Cookes Electronics in Skyway city to get my very  first DO for my Technology/Blaster.  I was lucky enough to read the description of the DO before i bought it.  IT was a level 15 damage DO and it stated that I need to be  at security level 13 to use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did they raise the level limit for DO's or did I go to the wrong place to purchase them</div></div><hr />

If they have, it was completely unannounced.  Might want to double check on that, I'd be surprised if they've done this.</div></div><hr />

Were you replacing a current DO or trying to combine it with one? Remember you can equip them at 3 levels lower but you cannot combine them till two levels lower.</div></div><hr />

They don't combine with training enhancements anyways, so it's kinda moot at 12.</div></div><hr />

I bought  4 DOs today and was able to use them.  Sorry</div></div><hr />
