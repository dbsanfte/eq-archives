<br />
Guild was in there last night, farming drops like we do every Tuesday night, and the pit mobs were doing a congo line to the south door.  Then they would warp back to their spawn spot and go again.   Every mob in HoT was on some sorta weird pathing bug.  We normally roam the halls and single pull everything, but things were pathing incorrectly, and some wurms were spinning in place.  All night, we only singled 1 mob in there.  The pathing and weird effects were making our pulls get aggro from thru the walls.  We've been in HoT for about 4 months now, and this is the first time things like this have happened. I know it wasn't a bug on my end because our whole raid force seen it too.  <br />

Weird stuff.</div></div><hr />

We didn't have your problem of not being able to single pull because of it though, were able to single em like normal.  Rofl if was fun though, no chanty showed up so we had one mob gate out like 7 times in a row, we finally got so pissed off we started chasing mobs back to their gate point.  Actually made HoT some what interesting, plus we got a plate BP, greaves, and 3 gauntlets so was a good night in all (first BP I ever seen drop there).</div></div><hr />

<br />
man, that was fun. It was about as much fun as our first ToVN run with Wandor's old guild. :D</div></div><hr />

The usual roamer adds, that was all.  It seemed like the AoEs were aggroing some pets through the walls, but I am not sure if that is normal or not since we would normally not have as many pets around as we had last night.</div></div><hr />

They stand at maxish melee range and your melee need to push them up there from almost the edge of the pit for 45 seconds.<br />

Whatevah. <br />
<br />
People have speculated that this is related to the mob geometry bugs that are no longer allowing certain shrunk races to Corner mobs.<br />
