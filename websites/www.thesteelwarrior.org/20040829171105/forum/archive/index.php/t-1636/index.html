<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanna know what parsing is....sorry if i sound like a newb but i realy don't know but i would like to. Also how fo record logs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Parsing refers to going into a log file and analyzing the data.  It means that you critically analyze a sample of real data, rather than just going by casual observations.<br />
<br />
You can save your logfile by typing /log in your chat window.  It works as a toggle, and will turn logging on or off (you get a message).<br />
<br />
The saved log file will be in the main everquest directory with the name: eqlog_charactername_##.txt.  The number is specific to the server you play on.<br />
<br />
To analyze the log file, you can use a parsing program.  I use EQ Companion which you can get by clicking here to visit the website (http://home.inreach.com/kai/EQCompanion/).  I am sure there are several others that also work just fine.<br />
<br />
Just install the program and then tell it what file you want to analyze.<br />
<br />
You'll want to archive your logs every once in a while (they get pretty big over time if you leave logging on.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  And happy parsing.</div></div><hr />
