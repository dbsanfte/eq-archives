<br />
People might be offended by your usage of the word &quot;Fuck&quot; in that post, but you obviously don't care about their feelings since you're not censoring yourself.  Not that I'm saying you should, I'm just saying you pretty much lose the right to bitch if you want to use words a little more contriversial than &quot;Rape&quot; in your rant about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I could post all the reasons why you're wrong, such as every definition from Merriam-Webster, but I'm not going to bother.<br />
<br />
  As for my usage of swear words in this post, I would agree excepting the place I put this thread. This isn't meant to be a sweet thread about how people should pretty please stop using &quot;rape&quot;. This is a rant about how fucktards use rape in a casual manner in general forums. I don't say &quot;fuck&quot; outside the outhouse. I do my best not to call people &quot;pricks&quot; and I even try not to say &quot;god damn&quot;. Believe it or not, I'm actually practicing what I preach. If we get everyone to refrain from using the term &quot;rape&quot; in the general forums, I'll be happy as a clam. People can call each other &quot;5 year old molesters&quot; and &quot;Uncle rapers&quot; all they want in the Outhouse, as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
  I'm just saying you pretty much lose the right to bitch if you want to use words a little more contriversial than &quot;Rape&quot; in your rant about it. <br />
<br />
  You seriously think you'd offend and shock more people by saying &quot;Fuck&quot; than you would by saying &quot;Rape&quot; casually? I think that no, no you wouldn't. How many victims are there of &quot;fucking&quot; as opposed to &quot;raping&quot; to offend, for example? <br />
<br />
Words aren't offensive, only your perception of them. <br />
<br />
  Of course. I perceive the word &quot;rape&quot; used casually to be extremely offensive. This is because rape is a terrible thing, and a crime in every culture. &quot;Fuck&quot; actually has positive connotations, if offensive to many people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think what the ohters here were trying to say is that not everyone here has the reaction to hearing the word rape as you. In other words, the connotation does not hold the same meaning as it does to you.<br />
<br />
I'll hold my comments on the exagerated reactions people have to many words I consider benign. Mostly because many people do not take the extremist additute I have towards words such as &quot;god damn&quot; and &quot;shit&quot;. Suffice it to say, I think many people hold too many words or phrases taboo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think what the ohters here were trying to say is that not everyone here has the reaction to hearing the word rape as you. In other words, the connotation does not hold the same meaning as it does to you. <br />
<br />
  Yep, I know that's exactly what people are trying to say. That's why I responded to those who disagree with me, other than the brainless twit that was trying to point out that I should go look up rape because it has other meanings. I think it's quite reasonable to understand that I'm offended by it and to not use it, even if you're not. I'm not offended by the word &quot;fuck&quot;, but I understand that others are and react accordingly. I don't feel this is a particularly extremist attitude to take.<br />
<br />
 Because you have posted on this thread, I do have to ask: Do you think the word &quot;rape&quot; is inappropriately taboo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some RL women play this game, some of them find the use of the word &quot;rape&quot; in this way offensive. The word &quot;niggardly&quot; is is the dictionary too, but not to be used in anything like polite conversation regardless of what it means. The current use of the word &quot;gay&quot; is simularly offensive.<br />
<br />
I've found some people persist in saying such words even when informed that they are offending - IMO they are beneath contempt. Others habitually use such words but try not to when told they are offending - people often have trouble transcending their low class roots, at least they are trying. Still others (like me) are nearly perfect and offend mostly only when we intend to and don't rely on shock words to achieve that aim.<br />

Actually, you're the first person I've ever met who would even suggest such a thing.  They don't bleep out rape on the TV.  Hell, the ONLY Iron Maiden song I've ever heard get airplay on a Clear Channel Radio Station is &quot;Run to the Hills,&quot; which if you learned anything in school has the line &quot;Raping the women and wasting the men, the only good injun's are tame.&quot;<br />

I would wager a guess that you've got some sort of traumatic association with the word from your level of reaction to it.  This isn't normal dude.  Maybe you should seek counseling.</div></div><hr />

  Actually, not at all. Never been raped, though, like almost everyone in the US, I know people who have. Haass, you of all people should know that a rant isn't necessarily indicitive of some personal rage.<br />

  That is because it IS a legitimate word. I wouldn't suggest bleeping it out either. As you might have noticed, everything I've posted in this thread has been about the casual use of &quot;rape&quot;. Have you ever heard anyone on TV say something like &quot;Man, I got raped at the used car dealership&quot; or &quot;Wow! The Pistons raped the Lakers&quot;? I feel that is an extremely poor use of the word.<br />
<br />
  Some female guildies saw a recruit post, and in it the recruit had used &quot;rape&quot; casually. They were extremely offended, and I believe this was a major reason this person was rejected. Not the only reason, but a major one. I have female friends who HAVE been raped that would blow up at someone using it so casually. <br />

  Money for Nothing by Dire Straits (the I want my MTV song) says &quot;faggot&quot; three times uncensored. If it were a new song, they'd censor it. It's not; it's an old song. Heh, try listening to new pop songs... they censor everything that might offend anyone.</div></div><hr />

I once had my leg humped by a dog, but you won't find me on the Chihuahua lover’s forum posting my outrage of the use of the word dog simply because they offend me.  Everyone puts their own meaning and connotations on words.  Like the word fuck, highly offensive to some, just another word to others, likes an exclamation point.  If you are in a group with someone using the word rape, tell them you don't like it.  If you see someone using the word rape on a message board, don't fuckin read it.  <br />
<br />
You are only exposed to what you allow yourself to be exposed to and are only offended by words that you allow to offend you.  Just because something doesn't sit right by you doesn't mean it should be immediately banned.  If you don't want to see or hear profane language, stick to your knitting circle and I'm sure you'll be fine.  Or you can just except the fact that not everyone is going to have the same views as you, and aren't going to be offended by the same things as you.  Just as I find your attempt at censorship offense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, we have a problem, allow me to explain it a different way for you.<br />
<br />
Rape is a crime.  A particularly vile crime, and i definitely don't condone it.  Murder is a crime as well, also one that definitely effects a large number of people.  However, we have the word &quot;Kill&quot; which could be considered interchangable with the way people use the word &quot;rape&quot; in EQ, which is --<br />
<br />
Man, Rallos Zek just fucking killed us last nite.<br />
<br />
Or.<br />
<br />
Dude, Quarm sure raped us good there.<br />
<br />
Now, despite those sentances being esssentially the same, one of those, you find offensive.  The other, you, and the vast majority of the public do not.  Why?  I'll tell you why.<br />
<br />
THEY'RE WORDS.  The act is one thing, a piece of language is a completely different thing.  Being offended at an act is fine.  It's okay to hate rapists and murderers.  Being offended at language is just assinine.  What are you gonna do, kick the word's ass because you don't like it?  Exactly.<br />
<br />
Actually, not at all. Never been raped, though, like almost everyone in the US, I know people who have. Haass, you of all people should know that a rant isn't necessarily indicitive of some personal rage. <br />
<br />
Indeed I do.  However, your level of visceral rage stemming from a word, and not an action, is highly unusual, to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you see someone using the word rape on a message board, don't fuckin read it.  <br />

<br />

<br />
  You, sir, are an even bigger fucktard. Attempt as censorship? By what? Ranting about someone using &quot;rape&quot;? Oh yeah, I'm censoring away! Fuck free speech! You know what, I'm going to hack the boards and add a *BLEEEP* every time someone posts &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;raping&quot; or &quot;raped&quot;! Mr. Censorship here doesn't like it. I'm going to oppress you! Idiot.<br />
<br />
  This isn't like I'm pissed off people are saying &quot;banana&quot; or something. No, I'm pissed off because people are using a word to describe one of the most traumatising events possible to describe a mob beating them up. Not the same ballpark, oh ye of small intellect. Would people be offended if I went around substituting &quot;baby fucker&quot; for mob? Yeah, I imagine people would... and rightfully so. Does that mean the courteous thing to do would be NOT doing that? Uh, yeah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, I do, but thanks for assuming you know something about me over an internet message board.  But we are not talking about the act of rape here, we are talking about a word.  If I asked someone if they objected to being raped, I'd probably get a yes.  But if I asked someone if they objected to Vikings raping a pillaging because the sentence contained the word rapeing, I don't think it would evoke the same response.</div></div><hr />

I don't care to have any boards/posts edited.  I do that on my own by generically lumping people who use words like this in-game as &quot;ignorant&quot;.  Thats my own filter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Seriously, I'm not foaming at the mouth here. I've seen at least a dozen people make the same claims about you that you're now making at me. I'm not making a petition, I haven't even PM'd the mods or anything. I didn't even write my congressman. I'm ranting on a message board. It's a form of release and expression.<br />

Man, Rallos Zek just fucking killed us last nite.<br />
<br />
Or.<br />
<br />
Dude, Quarm sure raped us good there.  <br />
<br />
  Yeah, I do find the second one more offensive. It's true. It IS stemming from the choice of words. The word &quot;fucking&quot; doesn't particularly bother me; it actually has no negative connotations in my mind. Frankly, I can't think of many less offensive words than &quot;kill&quot; for describing what we do to mobs in EQ. We attack them with swords and staves and spells until they fall to the ground and we take their stuff. It's exactly right on, rather than a word indicitive of something horrible that didn't happen.<br />
<br />
 I'm NOT suggesting that everyone should feel the same way as I do. I do suggest that there are certainly other people who do. I also feel that people should respect the wishes of the offended when it is just as easy to use different terminology. I feel it should also be obvious that it IS offensive to people.</div></div><hr />

  So what you did is read my first post, then posted. That's one reason you're a fucktard. I explained this earlier, go back and read it. I'll restate it in case you really were just too stupid to understand. <br />
<br />
I DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN THE OUTHOUSE. IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME; THIS FORUM, IN MY OPINION, IS FOR RANTING, SWEARING AND OFFENDING. If you want to start a post in the Outhouse about how Reparm bent you over and raped you like your daddy did to that pox ridden whore who spawned you from her diseased loins, I'd say that's fine. I don't expect inoffensive material here. If you say &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;fuck&quot; or &quot;shit&quot; or something else offensive in the other forums, I think you're in the wrong. That includes Haass, who frequently uses cursewords in what I, and the mods, consider inappropriate places.<br />
<br />
  Lastly, no, I don't really think that anyone is really going to learn a lesson from this. It'd be nice, but not something I'd expect. If I wanted a polite conversation about how people really shouldn't say &quot;rape&quot; where I expected people to listen, I'd make a nice, calm post in the Tavern without any swear words. I just may do that later, when I'm less ranty.</div></div><hr />

  Actually, Haass, what I'm choosing to do is remove myself from the target audience of someone who does use that phrase. That's quite definitely within my rights and options, and is a very reasonable thing to do. I'm not saying that I'm going to report every thread where someone uses &quot;rape&quot;, I'm not going to slander them. I'm simply going to remove the problem, which would be the fact that their usage offends ME. I'd expect other people who are offended by something I say to do the same, and reap the same consequences.</div></div><hr />

I had an uncle who tickled children. He was incapable of understanding that tickling someone a bit past the point where they were ok with it is borderline. Tickling them when they are shouting for him to stop is not borderline, it's  abusive. The issue was not wether he thought they were having fun, but wether they did.<br />

  That's because he was attempting to point out something that was obviously worthless. Rape was used in the example I gave as exactly the usage everyone knows and expects. It wasn't used to mean something obscure like &quot;picked up rocks&quot;. It was a point completely devoid of any value. Therefore, he was just being a brainless twit and was labeled accordingly.</div></div><hr />

  Free speech always has its limitations. You can't yell &quot;FIRE&quot; in a crowded theater. Beyond that, this isn't a public message board. It's actually a private one. If I asked Raaj, and he agreed, your &quot;rights&quot; to free speech on this board would be gone. There is no free speech on private property. To quote the moderator for my server board:<br />
<br />
I think you are a bit confused, no offense, but the ADMINS set the rules on the board. We can make them as free or constricted as we see fit. If for some odd reason, we choose to ban anyone with over 500 posts from the site, we can do that. If for some reason, we choose to filter the word &quot;the&quot; from the site, we can do that too. That's just the way things work on messageboards. <br />

<br />
Yes, I understand you're offended by it.  However, if I was horribly offended by the term crackhead, would you stop using it?  If I was horribly offended by the term brainless twit, would you stop using it?  It's unfortunate that you find the word rape so offensive.  And while I wouldn't go out of my way to use the word solely to offend you, I'm not going to censor myself just because one person, or even several people, are offended by a particular word or usage of a word.  If, on the other hand, it was widely preceived as being offensive by the majority of society, then I would probably make the effort to conform and censor my usage of the word.<br />
<br />
But seriously, if we censored ourselves every time someone was offended by a word we used, eventually we'd all fall silent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Probably, at least other than to describe someone who actually smokes crack all the time, which I would imagine would be the actual definition of a crackhead if our dictionaries kept up. Yes, I would stop using it, other than in this forum until I'm told that this forum is not as much of a free for all as I thought.<br />
<br />
  There are levels of offensiveness. I imagine that if I put up a poll in the tavern, I would have considerably more support from people who are also offended by this usage of &quot;rape&quot;. I'm guessing most of them don't visit the outhouse, and even those that do aren't likely to post into a flame fest. My reasoning and experience tell me that many people would be offended by the casual use of &quot;rape&quot;. Therefore, I wouldn't find it unreasonable to request that people stop using it. If someone said they were offended by the word &quot;banana&quot;, I would find it quite unreasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well my reasoning and experience differ from yours.  I don't think most people would be deeply traumatically offended by the sentence, &quot;Warriors get raped by high DPS mobs in GoD just as much as Knights&quot;.  While many would probably be offended by the sentence, &quot;the mobs in GoD bend Warriors over and rape them without lube just like they do Knights&quot;.  Much of it does have to do with the intended meaning.  In the first sentence rape is being used as &quot;an act or instance of robbing or despoiling or carrying away a person by force.&quot; while the second clearly refers to a forced sexual act.<br />
<br />
Now, if you'd like to be offended by the use of the word rape in the first sentence, that's your choice.  But don't expect me to conform to your desires to refrain from using a perfectly valid word that the majority of people have NOT indicated they're offended by.  This appears to be primarily a personal peeve of yours.  I respect that you feel the way that you do, but don't expect me to drop the word from my vocabulary because it offends you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Are you serious? People also say that &quot;mob XXXX bent them over&quot; or that next time they'll need lube. They don't mean because their skin is dry. They intended meaning is obvious, even if you're desensitized to it. The accepted meaning of the verb &quot;rape&quot; is to forcibly have sex with someone. That's how these people are intending it. You're going to have an awfully tough time convincing anyone that they were using the word &quot;rape&quot; to mean that Reparm carried them away by force, or robbed them. If you asked them to be more explicit, they'd undoubtedly continue on in sexual overtones. <br />

  Why not? Does Haass swearing all the time entitle him to be called any dirty name in the book? Does it mean his opinions aren't to be respected? Not in my opinion at least. I've said it before and I'll say it again. What I said was offensive, even to myself. My point was that in the correct place, I couldn't care less. If someone said that phrase here, I'd shrug it off. If someone said that in any of the general forums, I'd report their post and probably say something. You take that risk when you read, for example, any knight rant here in the Outhouse.</div></div><hr />

*shrug* I disagree, respectfully.  While we may not always apperciate what other people have to say, we have to respect their right, for the most part, to say it.  Because if we begin to impose restrictions on what they can say, other people will take that as license to restrict what WE can say.  It's one thing to self censor out of politeness or an interest in getting along with others.  It's another to expect everyone to conform to our desires of what &quot;appropriate&quot; language is.  Must we all call trash collectors, sanitation engineers because it would hurt their feelings if we didn't?  Should we no longer refer to the color blue, because someone is offended by the word?</div></div><hr />

    thats another place where you are wrong, when somebody says (ingame i mean) that they just got raped by a mob, they dont mean that they were picking daisies and a cragbeast convinced them to get into his car because he had candy, and proceeded to forcibly have sex with him. what they do mean is that they were fighting a hard mob and it owned them to a very high extent. wich brings something else to the table, the word owned. now im not saying it does, but the word owned could be misconstrued as owning the person or mobs, aka slavery, wich i probobly shouldnt even get into. if i say &quot;hey guys guess what? we just owned AoW and i finally got my BoW!&quot;, it doesnt mean i bought the AoW, it means that i beat the shit outta his pansy ass. the same goes for the word rape when used inside the game, it doesnt mean that the person or mob ACTUALLY raped you, but that it got the best of your skills and you werent ready for the fight, thats all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The word offends me.  I haven't been raped but I know a lot of people who have.  In the area I'm from, 1/4 females and 1/7 males have been or will be molested or raped.  <br />
<br />
Every single time I hear it in game, I cringe.  To some people it might just mean a mob was a lot harder then expected and hurt them bad.  And although it has denotations that might mean it is technically being used correctly, the connotations definately say otherwise.<br />
<br />
I've only ever asked one person to stop using it.  It was someone I grouped with every day and out of respect for my feelings he did.  The rest of the people who use it, I cringe but I respect thier right to say whatever they want to say however they want to say it.  <br />
<br />
Since someone else brought it up though, I would ask people who use it to keep in mind that although to you it means one thing, to others it means something else.  Some people might be upset.  If thats ok with you then by all means use it.  But if you are concerned with other's feelings chosing another word that still says what you mean might be a nicer method of communication.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but those bolded lines mean jack shit to sexually abusing someone. Also I don't see what grounds you can be objecting one offensive word, but not another.

<br />
Also, unless you are routinely roleplaying in your descriptions of your activities in EQ, stop arguing that in any substantial way the contemporary semantic field of the word &quot;rape&quot; involves non-sexual destruction. In the 1700s, yes. In the 21st Century, no. The only semantic weight the word &quot;rape&quot; has in contemporary English outside of sexual assault is as a specific grain: rape seed.<br />
<br />
Also, stop arguing that only people who have been sexually assaulted might find this term used this way offensive. Such arguments are untrue.<br />
<br />
There are only two arguments for using this word as a description of your character meeting an unexpectedly swift demise at the hands of a mob: 1) the other common term (&quot;killed&quot;) is scarcely more accurate, does not communicate the suddenness of your character's demise, and is not judged offensive; 2) you have the right to say what you like, and you are not compelled to worry about whether your description offends others.<br />
<br />
Strictly speaking, number two is true. History has a way of making people who attempt to control the speech of others look very bad indeed, and, I think, rightly so. Such people either end up attempting to prevent others from expressing certain ideas, or (somewhat more rarely, but also more accurately in this case) prevent them from using certain words to describe otherwise acceptable ideas. Niether attempt is admirable, and both open themselves up to appropriately scathing satire (cf. Swift's &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; or George Carlin's routine about words you can't say on the radio).<br />
<br />
Nor can anyone be expected to avoid affending *everyone* else, if for no other reason than someone somewhere will always be offended by something.<br />
<br />
For these reasons, I don't bother with asking anyone to stop using the term.<br />
<br />
I would point out, however, that having the right to say a thing does not necessitate you saying it. By using the term &quot;rape&quot; in this context you are enjoying the benefits of a rhetorically direct and easy means of communicating the suddenness/violence/unexpectness/unpleasantness of your character being decisively crushed by a mob. Against this advantage, you weigh the possibility that, by using this particular rhetorical strategy rather than some of the many others available to you (and there are many many others), you may offend some number of other people. <br />
<br />
So, you choose.</div></div><hr />

Why is it such a big deal that we do not offend?I dont see anywhere in the Bill of Rights that says &quot;All men are endowed with the right not to be offended.&quot;<br />

Eating a hamburger is offensive to people in some parts of the world.Go figure.<br />

Why should I?  Why exactly should I have to take into accont the pontential that anyone might possibly being offended by my expressing myself using words in a way commonly understood to have one meaning, but can have another meaning as well?  Why must I constrain myself because another person's sensibilities might be wounded?  Should I guard how I speak all the time simply because someone might misconstrue what I mean?<br />

I don't like how Goths dress, it offends me.  Are they going to stop dressing that way to satisfy me?  I think you see the point.  Self expression is allowable as long as it doesn't harm another in their person or their property.  Their feelings are their own concern.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I had completely misread your meaning.  That's what you get when you're reading these things in the middle of the night, some times the reading comprehension falls into the toliet.</div></div><hr />
