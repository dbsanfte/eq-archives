<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently using primal bow so I'm looking for a solid upgrade that will last me well into the Elemental planes. Guild killed emp 3 times in the last week thanks to patches, so we'll be in VT in the next couple weeks. Also killed everything up to Bertox and MM in PoP to give you an idea of what I have available to pick from.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=27649 or http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=30565 were my top 2 choices. Going for the most AC / hp / resists I can find in one item. We killed Cursed last night and I got passed over on the Eye because an officer was trying to tell me I could get better in VT, but from what I've seen that's not true.<br />
<br />
Is there any better range slots in VT or pre EP that I could get? Or should I have argued for the Cursed range slot last night?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get the bow, probably the best range before PoTime.<br />
<br />
110hp 25ac , and utility :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't want anything in my range slot that doesn't shoot arrows.  <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28989 might be a good choice if you're goin to VT or http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=29597 if you're rich or have friends in the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />

but he says<br />
<br />
Going for the most AC / hp / resists<br />
<br />
out of those 2 choices it would be the eye due to resists. but do you really want to switch out bow and eye every time you pull. it won't be anything huge if you choose the bow. just a couple of resists. and since you guild is doing emp and soon to do VT i bet you have some good resists already and will soon be getting better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">realize once u do get to elemental planes, a poe bow is relatively easy to farm, with just an xp group and everyone xps in poe anyways. i dont really know how far off you are from that though, with an MM kill i would guess not too far off. MM drops a nice range slot too btw. <br />
<br />
i got fang summons from ssra, cuts range down but normally ok if u dont mind swapping out, i got the eye from cursed too. 25ac/110hp in the range slot is hard to beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Although it's not in your 2 top choices, I wouldn't over look the orb of evasion from 3rd floor blobs in VT. Same AC as your two choices given. While you lose 10 hps and some stats, I personally feel the 8% to dodge more than makes up as our dodge is capped at 190.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the Longbow of the Stormcaller myself (from Agnarr), and I'm very happy with it. It's probably one of the top 5 bows for warriors in the game. That's what I'd recommend you get. I'm glad I passed on the Serpent Eye and quite a few other items. Besides the Longbow of the Stormcaller there's also the Bow of Contortion from Mith Marr which is very nice as well as the Bow of Storms off of Lord Seru. If you can't get ANY of those go for the Stonewood Compound Bow. Prices are dropping fast on those on my server. They're down to 90k I do believe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks guys, that's exactly what I wanted to hear. The Agnarr bow was my top choice of range slots. We need to kill him a couple more times anyway for flags so hopefully he'll drop another one. I missed our first kill and the bow went to a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When rangers bitch about you getting a bow off one of these mobs all you have to do is point out the fact that Elemental fletched bows (like the stonewood bow) are much better in terms of DPS than any other available bows because of their archery skill mods. If they can't afford them now (Featherwood is down to 50k and Stonewood is down to 90k on my server), then they'll be very easy to get once you're in the elementals. Even if they don't bite on that there are a million other bows, like the bow off TZ or VZ in PoTactics (can't remember which one drops it), which drops nearly every time.</div></div><hr />
