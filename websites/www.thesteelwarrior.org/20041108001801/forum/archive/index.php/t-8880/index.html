Howdy folks,<br />
<br />
Feel free to discuss EverQuest: Omens of War.  The beta Non-Disclosure agreement has been lifted in relation to content and screenshots, however it does continue to apply to the testing experience and interaction with members of the development team on Omens issues.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of your help testing Omens of War.  <br />

So for everyone who was in beta I would love to hear your thoughts about the expansion, specifically about how the exp camps and mobs are, what the new epic quests will be like, the new AA's for us, and about raid content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what the new epic quests will be like,<br />
They didn't have epics on beta btw ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They didn't have epics on beta btw ;)<br />
 They let some testers play with them but yeah, i dont think they had the quest in there yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ZajeerSOE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They let some testers play with them but yeah, i dont think they had the quest in there yet.<br />
<br />
Which testers got to play with them? I have a very strong suspicion that this isn't true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haha, I never saw one</div></div><hr />

Wow way to post without knowing any facts.  Very impressive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ZajeerSOE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They were very much tested. They were thoroughly internally tested by our QA department, by the devs themselves, by volunteer GMs (they helped test on their free time), and even players got to test them as well. However, we moved NPCs around in the world to keep players guessing. If you ever saw any of the testing that occurred in the Arena, as an example, it may very well have been an epic event of some sort. I can name two very prominent warriors on these boards who have either helped me test, or have helped other devs test epic content.<br />
<br />
The weapons however, were never given out to players. In fact, they were intentionally left off the beta server until the last week of beta. Even devs weren't wielding them, so I very much doubt the claim that anyone has seen them in game.</div></div><hr />

What about the rumor that you may stop at a 1.5 point with your epic, much like the original paladin epic had various stopping points so everyone could walk away with something.<br />
<br />
Such as a casual player... might... own a 1.5 epic... but an epic raider has the epic 2.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I thought that was already confirmed there's epic 1.5/2.0, 2.0 is for the end game raider, 1.5 is lesser but who knows at what level of play I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i have read and heard the same thing bul and also with epic 1.0 it will allow you to get around some of the items to get to 1.5 and 2.0, 1.0 is not needed but it will help ya skip part of the questing for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hopefully, think that was a intentional thing because of all the newer players and some of the olders that reaslied Oooo lightsabers.... and here's a copper hammer of striking, and sword of bloodsworn! look maw, more aggro!</div></div><hr />

I sure hope I don't read anything anywhere about someone's broken epic quest :)</div></div><hr />

there was a drawing of what the 2.0 war epic will look like on one of these other threads but i am too lazy to find it  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">best thing about this beta was that i got to meet aakla in person :D<br />

it looks nice, it feels nice, the xp areas are comparable to KT i'd say (for those that are grinding out to 70)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I think that the &quot;OMG Untested content&quot; crowd who loves to show up every time something new happens in EQ is gonna be eating a little crow this time, the amount of testing that happenned during this beta was STAGGERING compared to what I have ever seen before in any previous beta.</div></div><hr />

Tell us exactly what you tested where and post logs please,  I'd like to see some information.</div></div><hr />

How are we supposed to test post-GoD content when GoD was designed for Time+ and the gear we are given is early-PoP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tanked fine with the betabuff warrior before my main was copied over, although the way they spent the AA's was mind boggling ( maxxed out STR aa's but no LR5 or ID5). OoW doesn't require Time/GoD+ gear for the most part. I don't know about the end game content but overall it's doable by a broad spectrum people from casual to hard core.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well..SoE earned this reputation with some extremely shoddy work in GoD, some of us in this crowd have a healthy skeptism that is grounded in past performance.  <br />
<br />
I for one will be esctatic if they spent that much time testing this...a solid-fun-immersive release will mean many hours of enjoyment...something not necessarily true of most recent releases (other than LDoN)  Guess we will all find out in 1 days time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are we supposed to test post-GoD content when GoD was designed for Time+ and the gear we are given is early-PoP?I'm probably the only one with this opinion, but reading that makes me much happier about the OoW expansion, if Warriors like me were the base for the testing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They have the post god guilds testing the post god stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you notice how many of the top guilds were copied over? You think they were testing level 45 content, or kizraks armor content?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I agree... It sounds like I wont be total shit in this expantion like I was in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya know, now that you mention it ... I think I remember reading somewhere that the *real* order of the expansions should have been OoW and then GoD ... so maybe that does make sense about the level of gear required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They used the warrior race as the default for the warrior class. I fail to see the problem!</div></div><hr />
