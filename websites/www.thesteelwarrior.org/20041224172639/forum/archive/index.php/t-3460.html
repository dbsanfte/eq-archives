<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rather than unlinking them, how about this<br />
<br />
For every mob you kill you get 1 min and 30 seconds discounted off the reuse timer?<br />
<br />
Or because there are mod rods, why not self mutalation akin to canabalize, loose 225 health for 20 min taken off the reuse timer? <br />
<br />
the excuse for this in a RPing invironment could be that pain, and battle causes adrenaline to build up, allowing people to pull off feats, such as that guy lifting up a helecopter off of his friend when it weighted closs to a ton.<br />
<br />
all im saying is this could be great, and focus items for pure melee's could be spawned off of this, such as battle experance 1 2 3 4 and 5 that makes the discount on discplines(also known as feats to D&amp;D players) multiply.<br />
<br />
as for possible abuse, it could be limited to only getting a boost from a mobs death if its with in xp range, that prevents using it to exploint raids(like having a tank run out to kill goblins right outside vox's place and then have a CoTH mage that isnt in raid bring him back to keep unloading mightystrike)<br />
<br />
and the hp--discount could be tuned so that is if is being pumped to chain discpline that it severly depleats a caster's mana or something... there could even be a limit to how often Via a manaburn like timer, tell me whatcha think im gona start feed backing this once a week in the hopes one of the CS people will read it and mention it</div></div><hr />

This is one of the main systems that needs to be revamped.<br />

Relax Gerick...go have a beer. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoedog</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish that the disc's where each on their own timer, meaning if you did /disc mightstrike you could /disc defensive right after.<br />
<br />
This very simple 'fix' would alow warriors have a little more fun, deal a little more damage without having to keep your disc pidgeoned holed for defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disciplines need to be entirely unlinked, that's for sure.<br />
<br />
But time still has to play a big role in disciplines.<br />
<br />
Being able to control the amount of time between discs is bad.<br />
Take it on raids... people would find a way to bring charmed pets or god knows what, to kill and allow the warrior to chain defensive.<br />
At the same time, having to kill mobs to reduce the timer will be a huge handicap, because when theres few mobs around.. we'll suck. <br />
Yes, we suck now... but I want to be upgraded to be as good as any other class... and not just suck less then usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jziad MT</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Discs each have their own timer and re-use.<br />
<br />
In that way they are not unlike spells, as such they should be unlinked as here they differ from spell casting, and just as there is a default re-cast time between spells regardless of their seperate recast attribute, for spells its along the lines or 2.5 seconds. So could melle discs have a standard re-use time.<br />
<br />
therefor you may have to wait a few mins before using any disc, you would still have to wait 10 mins between going defensive each time, however you could use furious say a few mins after felstrike.<br />
<br />
Not even sure there has to be a gap at all, but if they think its unbalancing add a standard re-use time.. that comes in as default if you try and chain two different disciplines. Shield has its own timer yet wont stack with other discs, so we know they can do this.<br />
<br />
*shrug* most of the discs are toys at best, but i admit i rarely even play with them as the shortest ones seem to have the longest re-use and its sods law i'd want to pop defensive/evasive then. If i risk using any other even in an exp group, its aggresive, or in a few situations furious... but its not often.<br />
<br />
would be nice to see discs 61+ too if they are going to stick with a disc system maybe even add more 40+, but not holding out there lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bunny, you cant get the mob killing discount unless it in within your xp range, so the warrior couldnt shave off time by killing ice goblins on a vox raid or something, but ya player abuse EVERYTHING, its kinda sad lol.<br />
<br />
this would be nice on top of unlinking, mainly because of the focus effects that could be spawned off it, if they get a reward per kill code working outside of getting xp then they could make focus items that give us small attack boosts or give up small amounts of hp, and a mydrid of other things based of the orignal code</div></div><hr />
