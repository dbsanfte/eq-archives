<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalos Nathsar</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My war is just about done his Loyalist Shield quest, and I have been trying to find the ashes in the bazaar. I have the HG ashes on my character so that the Lore tag will stop me from buying the wrong ones again, and I will be sure when I buy the correct VZ ones.<br />
<br />
Today, however, through the unfourtunate act of actually purchasing them, I noticed that the &quot;lore&quot; tag has been removed from my HG ashes. <br />
<br />
I haven't seen any of the correct ashes, so I am not sure if they are still lore... or if this change was deliberate...<br />
<br />
So I'll give this warning now... The Heratius Grolden ashes are no longer lore (as of Aug. 11), so be careful when attempting to buy them in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh, that sucks.  I bet you can still use Vikken's Trick (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=122594&amp;postcount=93) to tell if ashes are the right ones...<br />
<br />
Just ;t &lt;Item Link&gt; and you should get a code (like 0002671-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001F647CE29NAME) that is different than if you do the same thing using your current ashes for the item link.  Also, according to Lucy, the Fake Ashes (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31751) are not lore anymore, but the Real Ashes (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7397) still are lore, so if Lucy is accurate then you only have to find the LORE ones now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalos Nathsar</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, yeah I've read Vikken's trick, but with the lore / non-lore aspect, it'll be even easier now. Didn't check lucy's first, thanks for clearing that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Microxx</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the same thing. Looked up the ash like I do daily, see a new one up..go to buy knowing I have the wrong one in invertory...GO BALISTIC when it actually did not give me lore message and let me buy it.<br />
<br />
then I realize I have TWO of the same one..bye bye 5,000pp. (and I can't jack someone else for that ammount, and passing it off to a friend is now worthless since its not lore)<br />
<br />
How many years has this item been this way? and now change it? i just don't get it.<br />
<br />
oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just kill Zefer?  He isnt that hard at all.  Was camping Spirit of Flame with me (61 at the time Beast) 61 druid, 65 wiz, 64 chanter.  Zefer was up, so went at him....<br />
<br />
He is immune to melee non-bane weapons, yet we got him to gate (which caused our loss) with only nukes/procs to do damage.  Had I picked up a few of the vendor-bought vampire bane weapons they sell in katta and used them on me and my warder, it would have been an easy win.  Would think that 60+ war, cleric and nuker would have little problems killing him.<br />
<br />
Camping the vamp tower is decent plat too, especially if you get a fist of iron or a copy of flame, as they both sell for 10k+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dbol</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A simple solution is to rename them to Zevfeers ashes and Hroldens ashes, of course that's much to simple a solution now isn't it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I take it you have never camped him for the ashes?  I know peeps that have spend over 30 hrs and no show.<br />

Although I know my guildies would help me, in no way am I going to ask them, dragging guildies to TM for a rare item camp is not something I wish upon my friends.<br />
<br />
That is why people like to buy the ashes.<br />
<br />
I common link the fake ashes in the bazaar with names of people selling the wrong ones in the bazaar after I send them a /tell. It's sad, but I see people selling these fake ashes all the time for real ashes prices. Considering that the fake ashes are completely worthless, I don't see why SOE doesn't remove the fake ones from the game, with the real ones dropping only from Zeevfer. As it is, it only serves to provide those inclined with another way to scam people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thargorr</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those bazaar shopping, I don't see any way right now of differentiating the fake ashes from the real ashes by just viewing the items. Both appear stackable (i.e. there will be a 1 counter in the corner) and if you have both in trader mode, they will inherit the identical price (although the prices can be changed separately after trader mode has been started).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just kill Zefer?<br />
<br />
Sorry, Amigo, but I laughed bitterly when I read this. I personally have invested over 30 hours of camping time into this and have NEVER seen Heratius spawn. If you're morbidly curious, you can read more about my travails on this quest in The Keep forum (I'll be in pretty much every thread with the subject of Loyalist Shield).<br />
<br />
Anyway -- I narrowly avoided buying some fake ashes for 20kpp. Vikken's trick saved me from being fleeced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game is full of long, tedious quest camps that involve waiting for a mob you can't solo. It's one thing to fiddle away your own time, but asking a bunch of other people to fiddle theirs away in the hopes that some mob might appear...well.<br />
/petition EverQuest's name is spelled wrong on the latest expansion I bought. Should be spelled EverVendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I killed the PH over 50 times, and after a while just ended up camping a druid alt near the castle to track him occasionally. I saw him twice; once a pally was running him in circles waiting for guildies to arrive; he let me have him. I engage with war/sham, get him to gate, and then have both the PH and the named beating on me, along with (somehow) 10+ other vampyres. I zoned, he depopped before I could get back to him. The second time I saw him, I killed him... and got NO ASHES. No response to petitions for days, so I eventually found someone who gave me both ashes for 10k.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not just kill Zefer&quot; Hah. hahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">osserkon</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just keep trying... I spent a couple of weeks camping him with friends for 2-3 hours at a time every other night. The other night i get a tell from a friend saying he got the ashes. The next night we went back and scored 2 in like an hour. I think you gotta just get lucky and catch the cycle just right. <br />
<br />
Ps never have seen the real ashes in the bazaar just fakes for 10k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also just park any low level Alt on the hill behind the castle to watch for Heratius. He seems to be a totally random spawn but what makes him seem so rare is that he Depops after a time if not engaged.<br />
<br />
  Or you could get as lucky as we did. Last Saturday morning a guildy logs in his character he has parked there watching and actually finds Zevfeer up. Someone must have killed Heratius and then left zevfeer. So a few of us run over and I lev to balcont and engage him, and the other wandering named and locals. Get everything under control and am slowly beating down Zev as others arrive when my shambot starts getting hit again. So I look and its Heratius beating on him, he spawned again while we were killing so we just killed the first one then killed Heratius and spawned and killed him again.</div></div><hr />
