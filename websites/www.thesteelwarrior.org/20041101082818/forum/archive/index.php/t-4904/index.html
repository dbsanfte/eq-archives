<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bruttoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I rolled a warior yesterday to see this new melee system I keep earing about, twinked him a bit and headed to the newbie grounds. My wife started playing last week and has a Cleric so I thought a Warrior would be a nice partner too.<br />
What I would like to ear from u more experienced warriors is what weapon setup should I use in the earlier levels and what skills to keep up.<br />
I managed to buy a Great Sword of the Bloodsworn for 3k and some other cheap weapons, but the better ones have a req level which means that I should wait a bit to get the best out of them.<br />
As to skills I'm doing 1hs and throwing some piercing and 1hb every now and then. ok, questions finally...<br />
1) could I have some weapon advices both for single and dual  setups? dont have much plat left so it would help if I can camp it with my main (64 SK).<br />
2) I know I should keep all my weapon skills up but should I worry now about 2hs and 2hb or start after the damage cap is lifted (level 20?) and I start to outdamage the 1hs?<br />
<br />
Thx for reading.<br />
<br />
Ps weapons I have r on the traders satchel in magelo.<br />
<br />
[edit] I forget if the sword I bought is the Great Sword of the Bloodsworn or Sword of the Bloodsworn...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Work on all of your weapon skills.  Yeah, use the 2h before 20.  Don't worry about the damage cap, everything is pretty easy at low levels anyway so your dps doesn't matter all that much.  Concentrate on getting fast weapons rather than high damage weapons like the Wurmy.  Just rotate your weapons around and keep your skills at about the same level.<br />
<br />
When I was levelling up, I used 2h as my main weapons but at the beginning of each level I dual-wielded to get my 1h skills up as well as stuff like double attack.  That worked fine.  I was kinda behind in 2hb but I brought that up in the 40s.<br />
<br />
For weapons -<br />
2hb - Sarnak Battle Hammer (30/40 war only, less than 100pp)<br />
2hs - there's a bunch, go for one with a 40 or below delay<br />
1hb - Jade Mace would likely be ok (9/18) drops in KC, probably fairly cheap these days.<br />
1hp - I dunno, you can always get a walrus tooth or something and off hand it for the skillups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since you have a 64 SK, you might ask some friends if they have a Horn of Hsagra(13/20) sitting in the bank that you could borrow for a piercing weapon.  They drop like candy off of Tormax in Kael.  Its one of the best weapons for a new warrior that I have seen (75 hp/ 35 ac/ 10 sta /25 resist cold), if you can find one.<br />

<br />
Ketchata Koro Mis (7/30) is a good practice weapon for 2h blunt but don't use it unless you are just assisting since it has low damage.<br />

Don't forget to practice archery, it helps to be able to hit the right target when you pull, especially at higher levels.  Best way to do this is get a lot of arrows and go ask another group if you can shoot their mobs for practice while they fight.  Just don't stand opposite any guards like I did at first...</div></div><hr />
