<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mahhj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm curious as to the direct reasoning as to why one handed weapons are considered better then two handed weapons for aggro when damage is similar.<br />
<br />
Is it because there's a static amount of hate added per swing regardless of damage, or is it because after a taunt you begin moving past that &quot;1 hate above the last guy&quot; state sooner?<br />
<br />
There's been some debate recently in guildchat about which would hold better aggro, one of our warriors Swiftblade of Zek/Windworn Handblade combo or her Greatstaff of Thunder.<br />
<br />
As a rogue, I'm not entirely sure if the aggro from the one handers is substantial enough to out perform the stun proc of a 2hander. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts on how this works, as well as the equipment choice, would be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">More constant, even aggro comes with 1h weapons. 2h can be streakier although that's not much of a concern at higher levels and with better 2h weapons.<br />
<br />
Also aggro decays. You may find yourself with decaying aggro while whiffing 5 swings in a row. Again that's rare though.<br />
<br />
A GSoT will probably hold aggro better. It's not outclassed by much if anything that's droppable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's also part of the carryover from the olden days when the 2Hers weren't as spectacular as today's weaponry and when the warrior used a defense increasing discipline; it also negated his or her attack speed ( esp. with defensive )...and the 2Hers just couldn't pour out enough of anyhting to compare with the 1Hers.<br />
<br />
These days; the balance is slowly leaning towards all-purpose 2Hers ( Greatstaff of Thunder being one of the prime examples of this ); and the more new weapons are found/obtained...the consensus will be towards the 2Hers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i still hate em, till i get my BoW, im sticking with 1 handers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like using 2handers, but I wish they didn't have these ridiculous graphics. Stuff like GSoT, WMBS, or GSot4W don't even look like weapons -- they look like wizard staffs (staves?). What I want is a kickass 2hs axe graphic, like my old Exe Axe, or even Earthen Blade -- that's what an ogre tank should be swinging.</div></div><hr />

  In regards to the post above, I think the general consensus is still that 1HS can hold aggro better over time due to missing a swing with a 1HS is much less detrimental compared to a full round (or two) with a 2HS.  But I agree with Badaan, everyone needs a GSoT until (if and when) you get a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have to agree with Turgorok! WTF happened to the cool BIG ASS AXE look?!?!?! Some of the new weapons graphics are lame as shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Assuming that the proc rate on 2h weapons is the same as 1h ones, wielding two 1h proccing weapons would produce twice the rate of procs as a 2h proccing weapon - is this a reasonable assumption or is there something I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Close I think Rhag.  Off hand will not proc as much, as it only swings when you make a succesfull dual wield check.  You will still get more procs overall if you have 2 procing 1 hander weapons vs a 2 hander.<br />

There's been some debate recently in guildchat about which would hold better aggro, one of our warriors Swiftblade of Zek/Windworn Handblade combo or her Greatstaff of Thunder. <br />
<br />
This is no contest, GSoT will far outagro that combo, and out DPS it as well most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i only have dps 2hander, so have never been able to keep any aggro, i use BoC + FB IV shield on named and BoC + Primal on xp/trash mobs<br />
<br />
there was a warrior in my guild a whileback who used a GSoT and couldnt even out taunt the pets =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aluamilli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Last night I was using a Polished Shai`Din Naginata (38/46, nothing spectacular), and I was holding aggro alot better with it than I was with a Frosty/Chipper combo. Somehow the rogue managed to eat through 3 Frosty Procs when I was using it, but very seldom got aggro off of me when I used 2HS. In the beginning also the Chanter would get aggro if slow was resisted, however the mob would just summon her and as soon as I hit Taunt the mob was back on me. This was subsequently fixed by using Haunting Visage as soon as I attacked the MoB.<br />
<br />
We never tried the aggro Spell with my 1HSers though I suppose I should have. I was doin good though with the Nagi and figured why risk a good thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I' m liking the 1HS with EB shield combo. Its definately better aggro than my GSot4W but I get better damage from the 2-hander. Hard to say what I'll do if I get a BoW but BF/shield is good aggro, and the extra HP and AC from the sheild shouldnt be minimized.<br />
<br />
Dual wielding - I get about the same aggro I get with the shield. I lose a little when I got to 2HS - I think because of the aggro decay or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As to the 2x1h weapons proc'ing more than a 2hander Im sure there has been some threads here in the past about varying proc rates tho I can't remember the conclusions.<br />
<br />
From my experience some weapons proc more than others, a perfect example of this is the epic 2hs which seems to proc considerably more than the 1hs epic.  Also the proc rates on weapons from Velious and earlier seems to be pretty poor when compared with weapons from Luclin and PoP.<br />
<br />
These days unless I am raid tanking I keep my BoC + red blade combo bagged because the proc rate on them is pretty bad and my BBB seems to proc considerably more as well as doing much more DPS which is signifcant for holding agro over the 1hs combo.<br />
<br />
Apparently BF and HG both proc considerably more than BoC which would support the idea of weapons having tailored proc rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ainmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">2 handers cause aggro on misses as well as hits.  I don't know if this is true for 1 handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As to the 2x1h weapons proc'ing more than a 2hander Im sure there has been some threads here in the past about varying proc rates tho I can't remember the conclusions. <br />
<br />
What I remeber about proc rates for various weapons:  proc rate for most weapons is based on a number of procs over time with a fixed dex.  That is, if I remember right, at max dex(255 I think it was at time the tests where done) all weapons tested proced about once every 30 seconds over time.  Hasted and slowed, that figure remained the same.  Weapon delay did not change that proc rate.  Some weapons do have a higher proc rate(cleric hammer), and so it is generally believed that proc rate is variable for different(more recent) weapons.  I will look on shaman board in a bit and see if I can dig up that old test,, but that is as best as I can remember it.<br />
<br />
Edit:  found it:  Rate of Weapon Random Procness  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=10861) <br />
<br />
The conclusions drawn from this test are, to quote:  <br />
<br />
-The number of procs is determined by time, regardless of the weapon used. In other words, you will get the same number of procs over time, regardless of the delay of the weapon.<br />
-Hastes and slows do effect the number of procs per swing, in order to keep the number of procs over time constant</div></div><hr />
