<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yiktin Voxbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last week I finally realized a long held dream, I Looted a Cord hilted spike driver. At the time of tanking the beserk mechanized dragon, I was wielding CHoS with 50 pt tap Aug (MM Dungeon) and a Spiked vellium mallet with the 50 pt fire dd (Nro(I Think)).<br />
<br />
Will now bank the mallet.<br />
<br />
I have 2 Questions now, maybe 3....<br />
<br />
1) Weapons:<br />
I am wielding the driver in Main and Aug'd CHoS in off(@ Per Magelo)&lt;---, Is this the most desirable setup?(also have a bag of Alternate Weaps)<br />
<br />
2) Augs: <br />
Would it be *Sane* to grind out 1150 in Mir for the AngerIII or get the Anger II Now? Is there perhaps another Aug that may suit this Weapon (CHSD) better?<br />
<br />
A *Little* History.... I Was MT For my guild for a LONG Time, but being an Aussie in a Largely USA guild, has proved Problematic @ Times. Over time we have acquired Additional warriors So I have allowed myself to enjoy slighly more relaxed hours. I Occasionally MT on Raids, but Increasingly perform @ SA or TA( Gives me a chance to AA My way to more HP).<br />
<br />
Already have CS3/CA1/ND3/AE taunt and 1 Rank of Stalwart Endurance(LOVE this one)Along with Ambidexterity and 1 slot of Ingenuity(A Lil' Sugar fer Daddy), I next Plan to head to CA3 then mebbe some LR and ID or Even PD/PE.<br />
<br />
In Raid trim, I top out @ About 7.3k hp, looking to replace shoulders and champ bracer(Praying for a shaped rock) next.<br />
<br />
I perform well in Small groups but being a Gnome @ times I can get *Lost in the shuffle* on large raids. I have found my DPS is ok in LDoN grps but lets face it, the more you can bring to the party, the better off everyone is.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance to a helpful tightknit community.<br />
/BEER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Straythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Magelo is down, so I can't see what other weapons you have but...<br />
<br />
<br />
The 50pt tap isn't going to be much aggro, so that's not a factor.  I'd keep whichever has the highest dps/ratio in primary.<br />
<br />
I use a Great Blade of Storms in primary and CHSD in secondary.  The procs are nearly the same aggro as far as I can see so I keep the dps weapon in my primary.<br />
<br />
If you're really concerned about dps, go with a Greatstaff of Thunder 2hb.  Dirt cheap with a huge aggro proc and hits very fast with a good ratio.  And you avoid quite a few ripostes which is always a bonus.<br />
<br />
Once I have around 2 procs with the Greatstaff, depending on who's in my group and their weapons, I bag it for a higher dps 2hander like TSBS or war marshall's bladed staff.<br />
<br />
/edit: Magelo is back up, for dps in LDoN, I'd go with the GSOT you have in your bag.  But I'd keep the CHSD in primary considering the ratio of the CHoS.</div></div><hr />
