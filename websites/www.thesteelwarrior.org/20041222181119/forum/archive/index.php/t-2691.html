<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arnan</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a couple questions<br />
<br />
First is about aa and second is about agro weapons.<br />
<br />
1.  I currently have ND3 CS3 CA3 PE AE Taunt LR5 and I am working on ID now.  After I get to ID5, I am currious where I should go next.  I am in a small raiding guild (we average 20 to 30 people in a raid ATM)  Things I was considering, Ambidex(have yet to get 1 offensive aa). PP (all melee stats are easily capped in most groups ATM), PD(more hit points the better)  Anythoughts?<br />
<br />
2.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether or not a slow proc from a Willsapper still gives hate after a mob has been slowed?  My three Weapons are Willsapper, Cord hilted Spike Driver and Wind-worn Handblade.  To use the WS I need to equip it in my primary slot.  Just curious if WS/CHSD was a better agro combo then CHSD/WWHB<br />
<br />
thanks for any advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caeden</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll answer the second one, yes, the Willsapper proc will still give aggro even if the mob has been slowed.<br />
<br />
I have(had) all 3 weapons on my retired Warrior. What I found is that the WS/CHSD held aggro better (most of the time), but I also found that 'most' of the time I could hold aggro with the CHSD/WWHB, so I mostly used that combo cuz I got more DPS from it.<br />
<br />
So if you can get away with it, I'd use the CHSD/WWHB, but if you are struggleing with aggro, I'd switch to WS/CHSD.<br />
<br />
On another note, I'd try to buy a Copper Hammer of Striking (nothing more badass than Warrior weilding a pair of hammers).  DPS with the proc is better than CHSD/WWHB, and it holds aggro better.<br />
<br />
that's just my opinion though</div></div><hr />
