<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing I posted on my guild board, and the safehouse. <br />
<br />
Lucy entries (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=tome+of&amp;source=Test) on the various tomes. Not all are the melee tomes, but easy to figure out which are.<br />
<br />
 As expected everything is pretty underwhelming. Maybe now the hybrid boards will shut the fuck up about how overpowering this is gonna be.<br />
<br />
 Notable(not necessarily GOOD, just notable) things I saw for some classes.<br />
<br />
Monks<br />
4 tick root one<br />
105%(!!) slow for 3 ticks<br />
A 9 counter detrimental cure(3 more than max Radiant Cure)<br />
20% chance to *ignore* spell for 2 ticks<br />
2 sec stun with some unknown effect on it, doesn't look to stun higher level stuff.<br />
3 tick &quot;Increase Minimum Damage Modifier by 100%&quot;<br />
<br />
Rogues(lotta rogue stuff is either unfinished, or not explained by Lucyyet, kinda like Vie spells)<br />
Sneak Attack. Makes so you can't miss(10,000% increase chance to hit) and 200% damage modifier. Instant though, so no idea how/if it works with BS.<br />
Resist debuff, up to 14 to all.<br />
Snare. 5 tick, 40%<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
10,000% chance to dodge. But instant, no idea how it will work.<br />
10% increased group damage modifier. 1 tick=/<br />
180pt rune<br />
4 sec stun that works on mobs up to 65<br />
20% better mitigation, 2 ticks.<br />
10% agro multiplier, 3 ticks.<br />
<br />
 More interesting to me is seeing what disciplines actually do, and seeing the duration changes on some. Not sure on all these, but some are different for sure. They're being moved to the &quot;spell&quot; type system, so I guess all hafta be put on the 6 second tick system. Also, reuse times changed on some. Not sure if the Lucy ones are base re-use and it still gets lower, or if they stay the same. Sounding like they stay the same but I'm comparing to base.<br />
<br />
Rogue:<br />
Duelist listed as 2 ticks now. That would be 12 seconds, up from the current 9.<br />
Blinding Speed 3 ticks, so gains 3 seconds. Reuse down to 25 from 30.<br />
Kinesthetics reuse down to 25 from 30.<br />
Deadeye 3 ticks, gain 4 seconds. Reuse 25 from 30<br />
Counterattack 2 ticks, gain 3 seconds. 45 min, down from 60<br />
<br />
Monk:<br />
100 Fist 3tick, gain 3 second. <br />
Inner Flame 2 ticks, gain 3 seconds. I think.<br />
Voiddance 2 ticks, gain 3-4 seconds. Reuse down to 45 from 60.<br />
Whirlwind listed same as Inner Flame right now, bug I assume.<br />
Stone Stance reuse listed as down to 4 minutes. 8 faster than normal base, but 1 *slower* than level 60+ reuse.<br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
Evasive Reuse 10.5 min, 4.5 faster than base, 4.5 slower than 60+ reuse.<br />
Charge 3 ticks, gain 4 seconds. <br />
Mighty Strike 2 ticks, gain 2-3 seconds. Reuse down to 30 from 60.<br />
Defensive Reuse to 10.5. 4.5 faster than base. .5 slower than 60+ reuse.<br />
Furious 2 ticks, gain 3 seconds. Reuse down to 45 from 60.<br />
Fell Strike 2 ticks. Gain 3 sec? Not sure. <br />
Fortitude 2 ticks, gain 3 seconds. Reuse down to 45 from 60.<br />
<br />
 So that's what I can tell so far as changed and blah blah WTF ever I need sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They better make better changes than that to the War discs.  45 minutes is still way too long and they are increasing the reuse on def and evasive?  Looks more like a nerf to me.  I certainly hope that there is more than we are seeing here.  Judging by this alone they still haven't made any of the other discs worthwhile and have made the 2 we use now worse.<br />
<br />
The new attacks look cool, though.  Hope they pan out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the new attacks also have a reuse timer . . . <br />
<br />
I don;t think i'll need much endurce+ items . . . . . my endurance bar is always full because i can;t use anything becuase the aweful reuse times.  ummmmm FFXI is really starting to look really good</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, what do you want - a candy factory?<br />
<br />
Most of that crap...I could take it or leave it.  A 4-second range stun, a 10% aggro multiplier, and a 20% mitigation modifier (above and beyond the 5% we get automatically on test) that we can press at will are things that could change how we approach tanking.  Have to see how the mechanics work out, but the IDEA is exactly the sort of thing we've been asking for.  In addition to that, we got 383010383 new &quot;skills&quot; that might be cool and might not, but sure shows someone is paying attention somewhere. <br />
<br />
The only thing FFXI has on EQ is the cool spell-type graphics you get when you use your &quot;skills.&quot;  (I still think we need a &quot;kick me&quot; sign on the ass of the mob to signify a skill is available :D) <br />
<br />
And, yes, Haas and cynics, I'm sounding awfully bushy-tailed and bright-eyed roses glasses right now.  I plan to approach this with something nearing enthusiasm as it _sounds_ pretty darn good on paper.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as for the &quot;Power Slam&quot; WWF stun, a friend of mine had this to say which just cracked me the fuck up:<br />
<br />
<br />
Chal Torpek: LONG DISTANCE SLAM<br />
Chal Torpek: it's like breaking up over the phone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My coworker (who happens to be the asshole that first got me hooked on EQ) just got FFXI. I watched him play it a few times and it looked retarded, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him because he was so stoked on it at first. After about a week he was back on EQ. I still haven't decided if that's funny or not, but in my opinion FFXI is going to go away fast, just like all the &quot;other&quot; MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
And getting back on topic - In regards to the upcoming melee changes for EQ, I'm trying to remain optimistic also. Personally I still get pickup groups pretty easily and I still get chosen to tank over paladins and shadowknights the majority of the time, and I'm not elemental-equipped nor BoW+AngerIII wielding. I do however get frustrated with agro control, and really hope the warrior's innate agro management gets addressed sufficiently.<br />
For now, I'm really looking forward to the upcoming additions to the melee classes. I'll hold back on my getting pissed unless it all goes live and the real problems aren't taken care of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to consider here is that since the Defensive and Evasive disciplines now use endurance, its going to be a big problem if you are in a situation and need to tank (such as when the MT accidentally dies) and your endurance is depleted because you have been using your backslice, headbut, and bodyslam skills a lot.  This is basically the same situation that kept us from using our other disciplines before these changes.  It seems we are still going to be slaves to the Defensive discipline and not be able to use our other skills because they drain endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharak</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dude, what do you want - a candy factory?<br />
___________________________<br />
<br />
No i don;t want candy, but these skills are sounding more and more like the crappy disc's i never use because I don;t want to lock everything cause i might really need it later.<br />
<br />
I am complaining about how stupid reuse timers on these abilities are.  It's not like our endurance bar is unlimited and as far as i can tell it's not like i get 1 million openings to exploit the use of these skills anyhow.<br />
<br />
I am glad you are excited about the changes . . . and honestly I was too until i started working it on test.  Right now in the current form it's pretty worthless.  That could change, but you never know do you.<br />
<br />
I said FFXI was starting to look good . . . but so does shutting EQ down for good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyrilette</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The changes look a bit retard an d really not fun to use sadly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velk</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The changes look a bit retard an d really not fun to use sadly.     <br />
<br />
I have one word for you.<br />
<br />
Provoke.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as they make the endurance bar last as long as a hybrid's mana pool (ie practically endless) then I'll be happy. If it goes down so much using the twitch type abilities there won't be any left for when you need the really useful ones. Like was stated, we'll still be a slave to defense/evasive. I'm willing to wait and see how it is implimented before passing judgement, but I really only wanted a more reliable taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried Provoke last night and that change needs to go live.  I'll never have to restock on arrows again, it's a great skill for pulling and it has no message about a target being to high or too low to hit.  A good way to improve it is to have a bunch of symbols comming out of your mouth so it shows you are insulting the mob's mother.  The only other thing i don't like about it is the message you get in a min or so that says &quot;your provoke has worn off&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt seems to be working 90% of the time now.  I've noted a drastic improvement in it.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I've had a huge string of good luck, who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of this morning or in general?<br />
i seem to be taunting aobut the same as usual, works when i don't need it, fails when i do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myst Darkwind</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming everyone does feedback on test as I am, since after all they asked us too, Im hopeful that they will take into account some of our concerns.<br />
<br />
I am excited about some of the abilites (Provoke, Power Slame, the group DPS boosts seem useful )  Im sure some of the timers could be faster but I really think thats part of the balance we as warriors will have to achieve.</div></div><hr />
