<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harryfoot</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to have hit a wall for upgrades attainable without a raid force. Here is my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=559954<br />
<br />
As you can see my gear isn't 100% non raid items. I have JoS from ikkinz 2, Epic 1.5, shoulders from priest summoner in kod taz, and some VT items (which I'm trying to replace) The rest of my gear is all available with a group of less though. I am currently slowly farming Guk LDONs for anger3 augs for my weapons, but after I get those I DO NOT want to go back to LDON lol, h8 teh ldon! I'm looking for items I can get that are EPish quality... <br />
<br />
The new charged magnetic stuff looked really great and I was planning on getting a few of those peices, but after exping in MPG forever and seeing how stupid-rare those lightning cores are, I have crossed charged magnetic off my item list. My guild raid sometimes, but I play on a server with such a low server population (sullon zek) that it's super rare for us to manage to muster a force of over 25. We had around 30 for ikkinz 2 when I got my JoS. I also just like to try and get as many upgrades as I can without spending my guild DKP. <br />
<br />
So any upgrades you guys could think of would be appreciated (NO LDON OMG h8 Teh LDON!) although I can't think of much myself =/ looks like I may be forced to wait out on raids for upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what they run on your server, but usually they're pretty pricey. Also, if you can get the people an ornate breastplate probably would be pretty good and it only takes 2, maybe 3 groups at most of relatively well equipped people to take eindride out. I'd drop your boots in favor of bloodied boots of dark rites (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23588) or boots of the storm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6582)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd ditch those sandals for Armsmaster's Boots. Actually, you could do gloves and arms too and I think you'd make out pretty well.  <br />
<br />
If you get your faction up for Armsmasters stuff, then you could also quest for Muramite Officers Ring 11ac/120hp. Could also do the VP quested ring.<br />
<br />
BP from Seru, Ornate, Royal Attendant, or that one from RS Celestial Lorica could all be possibilities for Chest upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you got got gear already, you should be able to handle Riftseekers. Here, you can get all the augments you'll miss by not doing LDoN, and they will be even better. There are the following:<br />
<br />
70hp for rings/ears<br />
65hp for back, shoulder, waist, neck<br />
25AC for Chest,  Legs, Wrist<br />
20AC for Feet, Hands, Arms, Head<br />
<br />
Then I'd go with OoW armor for the slots as Frostpaw noted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get a ton of my armor from 1-2 group material, half if not most of my gear is ffa'ed with 1-2 groups np, requires time and effort however.<br />
<br />
From looking at your Magelo, I see that you need some AC. Kodtaz and Yxxta are great for that (3x 20, 1x 30)<br />
<br />
Two Ferubi 15ac's from Weapon Goats<br />
<br />
OoW: 4x 20, 4x 25 from RS<br />
        1x 20 from MPG<br />
<br />
To complete my set I still need 5 more 20's, but trust me, every time you get one, you'll notice it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time i checked 30ac = Yxxta Primals....<br />
<br />
And that is NOT 1-2 groupable (havent been there for over 6 months however)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harryfoot</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for those I forgot all about those OOW armor quests I'm going to try to do those for my weaker slots, although after looking at the drops it seems they are guna be fun fun stupid-rare camps yay !! lolie, but thats ok i get exp while camping them. <br />
<br />
And yeah I have the Ferubi AC augs already and my guild raids primals more than any other raid, cuz we can kill with 20ish or less, and I passed on the 30ac aug a couple times because I was saving for JoS, but now that I have that I'll get that 30ac aug. I'll have to get some of those other ones too.</div></div><hr />
