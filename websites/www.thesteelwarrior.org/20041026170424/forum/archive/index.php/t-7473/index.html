<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I always xp with the same group, 59 war, 58 ench, 58 shm, 58 cleric.  We have spent a lot of time in PoI, PoJ, PoN, and PoD.  However, since we've hit 58 and especially 59, these places have really slowed down for xp.  PoD near the castle still is pretty good, but the pathing there is terrible and I hate pulling it, I've died multiple times just to pathing issues.<br />
<br />
We tried PoS near armadillos pulling yard trash and xp there is great, but the problem is enchanter can only mez up to level 57 mobs and we were having major problems when we got adds.  Root just wasn't doing the trick due to the level of the mobs.<br />
<br />
Is there any place in storms or valor or another zone that will be better xp?  I never have xp'd much in valor, so I don't know the zone well at all.  Storms I know pretty well, but it doesn't seem like a very good xp zone.  What about crypt of decay or torment?  Torment seemed really hard for xp purposes when I went there.<br />
<br />
Is our best bet just to keep grinding in PoD/PoI until the enchanter gets rapture at 59 and can mez higher level mobs and then move to PoV?...   Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You may be able to handle EW/WW camps in PoV.   If you're careful, you should be able to get singles there.  There is the possibility of adds.  I tanked this stuff at 60 and it was tight.  You do take quite a pounding.  <br />
<br />
Have you been to the not-so-recently-revamped Plane of Hate?  I did 62-65 there on the upper tier dark elf mobs there, but I'd imagine a group of just under 60's could do quite well on the stuff nearer the zone in.  If you got yourself a wizard to get you up there I'd imagine this would be great.  Chanter is nice, but not required.  Aggro radii of mobs are small, so much so that at 65 a warrior can get around thru 90 percent of the zone w/o invis.  Little tighter at your level I'd guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Until your enchanter gets his next mez (or pacify), you will continue to have problems in any zones beyond the first 4 that you mentioned.  Honestly, you are still in the &quot;XP sweet spot&quot; for POI and PON, it is just that level 59 is a really, really long level.  You will be amazed when you ding level 60.  I think that level 60 is about 1/6 as long as level 59.<br />
<br />
In terms of XP per hour, PoValor wastelands is a little better (and a little easier) than PoStorms.<br />
<br />
Have you tried Chardok B?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice.  I haven't tried Chardok B, how do you get there?  Is the entrance the same as the old Chardok?  I spent a lot of time in the original Chardok, but I'm not familar with the details of the revamp, or is B an entirely new zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dalaniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoV (outer) or get in the Factory in PoI, those Factory Golems are just sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, B is a new zone.  The entrance to B is below the 3 bridges, it's a little lever on the wall beside the waterfall (this is known as the bank area in the revamped Chardok).  Mobs in B are levels 54-63, and do not hurt Chardok faction.  There are some quests and some decent loot.  Beastiary for Chardok B. (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=185)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PoN mephits cave is lvl 58? Can keep meat and blood for bazaar also.  Think some mephits / gobos can get 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mongrul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Plane of Hate i would suggest if you can get a port up there... <br />
the area where you port in is 47+ but below 51 if you go across the stairs to your right when you port in you area heading to Tier 2 of this zone... but Tier one is clear up to the catherdril (sp?) stairs around here they becone 52+ and cap around 55... if you go behind the catherdril (sp?) they become Tier 3 which is in the upper to mid 50's and if you get near Innky you are tier 4 and that is like 60+ area..  When i say this that is the level of the mobs....<br />
<br />
Also PoN at the docks  is a nice place to EXP also...<br />
<br />
Chardok B is a hard place to get to unless  you have good faction with Chardok.. So if you hunted there then you will have a problem gettign there as everything  will be KOS...<br />
<br />
SoL C is an ok place also and it is located Naggies Lair If i remember  correctly,, Some one correct me if i am wrong... Plus you get good drops for upgrades and selling...<br />
<br />
PoI is good in the factory but you will need a FD puller to split the first go around but once you get them split as you a lot of the times will be gettign 2 at a time.....<br />
<br />
PoV outter is good and there is only one place there that you will more than like ly get an Add but most of the time they area solo there  just have to watch trains out of the inner groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zanakus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO Torment is the most underrated exping plane in the game. Mobs there are tough (18khp to 25khp on non-named, and they hit occasionally in 400s) but the experience is simply phenomenal. At 56 I was getting a blue tick per kill, compared to the 1/3 of a blue tick I'd get in Innovation and the 2/3 of a blue tick I'd get in Lxanvom. Also, while the mobs hit hard they don't damage spike like the puslings in Lxanvom - I was the tank in group at level 56 and didn't have much trouble staying alive when mobs were slowed. Bring a good group to Torment and you'll be pleasantly surprised, I assure you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks all.  I'll try out some of the suggestions.<br />
<br />
Question about Torment, iirc there are ravens there that silence, how do you deal with them?  I have only raided Torment, never xp'd there, so any specific info would help.  I'd like to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zanakus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The blood ravens' silence is indeed a problem and a Torment group I was in once lost its healer over it as the effect kept me from being able to taunt. The good news is that apart from the first few mobs in the zone, you won't encounter many ravens until you've cleared most of Torment excluding Saryrn's tower.<br />
<br />
 Yes, the birds are annoying, but they're pretty scarce compared to the Kaniz and Boruks, which are straight melee. I don't think you should give up on hunting in Torment just because of the birds; to be quite honest spiky damage from entrance mobs in Lxanvom has caused much more trouble to me and my groups than the blood ravens' silence ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agreed, invis up and move past the entry ravens, and you are unlikely to see any more of them after that.</div></div><hr />
