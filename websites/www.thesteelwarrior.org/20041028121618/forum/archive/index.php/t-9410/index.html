<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want input from you guys on epic 1.5 effects:  both the click effect and the focus.<br />
<br />
Please keep the click separate from the focus.<br />
<br />
My suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. Focus:  Change focus from &quot;Decrease recast&quot; to &quot;Increase Range&quot; on incite based skills.<br />
<br />
2. Right Click:  Make buff last until rune portion fades, not a 1 min hardcap with cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Focus: Change focus from &quot;Decrease recast&quot; to &quot;Increase Range&quot; on incite based skills. <br />
<br />
Absolutely love that idea. Specially if we dont get the &quot;Throw Rock&quot; thing live.<br />
A reduced Endurance cost wouldnt be as good but could be ok.<br />
A lot people are complaining about 69 Incite.<br />
<br />
2. Right Click: Make buff last until rune portion fades, not a 1 min hardcap with cast time. <br />
<br />
Still dont like it. <br />
A 5% Group Hit reduction for 1 minute would be nice and not overpowering. <br />
It would be in the same series as the Paladin one, but more focused around the group.<br />
Paladins take 20% more healing (which is not 20% less dps but not that far).<br />
We make all group take 5% less melee dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. The focus should focus on all things that cause aggro in your target.... AETaunt, Taunt, incite line, spirit of rage - all of thouse should have their timer decreased. Perhaps it could up some of the certain hate from these abilities.<br />
<br />
2. The rune part is ridiculous. The only one that will be getting hit is you, the group doesn't need the rune part. My suggestion would be to just give us a beefed up vie soley. Part two, the 15% resist spells - I believe it should be upped to something more realisitic, 40% or 35%. In one minute, an average AEing boss shoots only 1 or 2 max ae's that affect us personally, and 15% isn't high enough to make a difference, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Insofar as the &quot;rune portion&quot;, perhaps I just see the way the spell was designed as not being a &quot;tanking enhancement&quot; but a &quot;oops&quot; mitigator, in that it was supposed to be for your group and not necessarily you, in case you actually did lose aggro, the fact that it also lands on you is kind of a very small &quot;bonus&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazghar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My suggestions:<br />
<br />
Focus: <br />
<br />
Suggestion #1: Increase the timer decrease part, so epic1.5 decreases 10 seconds, and epic2.0 decreases 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Suggestion #2: Scrap the idea of an Incite focus completely, and either make it an endurance or timer decrease on some of our disciplines (timer2, fortitude/furious would be an excellent choice).<br />
<br />
Clicky:<br />
<br />
Suggestion #1: Make it last 1 full minute, no cap on the absorbtion, no fading before 60 seconds have passed. Change the mitigation to be 5% on epic1.5 and 8-10% on epic2.0. Or leave 1.5 at 10% and increase epic2.0 duration by 50-100%.<br />
<br />
Suggestion #2: Chance the effect to add an aggro proc for 1 minutes, sorta like the Aura of Runes discipline, but adding maybe 250-300 hate per proc. This would put the clicky more in line with our role as tanks, helping us hold aggro rather than buffing the whole group with a cleric spell knockoff.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, I think our epic needs to be put more in line with our role as warriors. Currently is has a near-total useless focus effect, and a group buff cleric-type spell. Make the focus worth getting the epic for, and make the clicky a warrior effect, not a cleric effect. Statwise, epic1.5 is very satisfying. It comes really close to Demerix the Painsipper, losing out a bit on dps but gaining 3% shielding and 12AC. Currently, its close enough that I use my Demerix for everyday grouping, as the dps makes it a better choice for me, and for raid situations I switch to the epic to gain shielding and ac at a small deduction of dps. If the clicky and focus effects were more useful, i might make the switch completely and bag the Demerix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my suggestion: increase power of anger procs by a %age for the focus effect.  but like theyre gonna do that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Click:<br />
I like the idea of making the Rune not fade if it isn't used. Personally I would rather see it kept as is, but with a longer duration or not fade until used.  To put it into perspective, all of the other epics have some benefit for the majority group pretty much no matter what, whereas our epic should only ever benefit us.<br />
<br />
My ideal would be to have the 2 buffs incorportated into a single buff for the entire group, that offers both the current Vie like rune, and either % chance to resist OR just a spellshield with the same % as the melee portion. Of course, if either the melee or spell shield was consumed, the entire buff fades. Duration should be until used, or 10+ minutes. <br />
<br />
Although, the idea of making it some form of agro buff could be equally nice. Perhaps a buff along the lines of the Voice of Thule, not a proc though, procs are not reliable. <br />
<br />
<br />
Focus:<br />
<br />
Personally, I like the idea of extending the range of incite (this is presuming they are not going ot give us an improved Throw Stone), lowering the endurance use (however I think it should be an across the board end saver on all discs), or some form of agro modifier (along the lines of Echo of Anger, but would need to stack with EoA ideally. If not stacking with EoA, 10% on epic 1.5, 20% on Epic 2. If it did stack with EoA, 5% on 1.5, 10% on 2.)<br />
<br />
Hope this make sense and thank you for the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Druss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As it stands, most warriors that I talk to, as well as myself, use the epic for the stats (45 ac 3% shielding).  The effect has nothing to do with its use.  The stats more than anything else make it worth swinging (I replaced a Jagged Onyx Staff with mine, other warriors in guild will be replacing BoC's (or in one case, a Hammer of the timeweaver) with it.<br />
<br />
Some solid ideas Frodlin.  Reducing the timer of incite is pretty useless.  I know I usually only use Incite to start fights, and very rarely DURING fights (except for things where my aggro generation is gimped by a boss effect (ie Time VZ)).  The reduced reuse time on incite is about as useless an effect as they could get.<br />
<br />
As to the buff, 2 buff slots means I never click it on a raid.  In EXP groups, I'll click it before a hard pull is inc, but with the 1 minute duration, if the monk needs to delay the pull for any reason, than its wasted.  <br />
<br />
I like the extend range deal, but haven't the dev's insisted that incite is not meant to be a pull tool?  That being the case, won't they be reluctant to give a focus effect that helps turn it into that?  Unless the extend range benefit is so small as to not make it any more viable to pull (ie 5% more range), in which case, it'd still be a useless effect.<br />
<br />
What about a 4% aggro increase on all actions (the opposite of the wizard epic focus).  Its proportional to another epic.  Before the cries of &quot;I don't need more aggro with double auged weapon and Echo of Anger Focus&quot; start, some of the new OOW spells are making aggro a bit more challenging again (Case in point, some of the new shaman dots, some of the big wizard nukes, etc - especially in 1 group setting).<br />
<br />
<br />
The click group vie is fine, just combine the effects into one buff slot, not two.<br />
<br />
I think we need to be careful asking for or expecting too much on our focus effect/clicky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea but then take a look at effects like the ranger epic which gives 110% accuracy or the SK one which is a 500 hp nuke.  We have a right to complain, our effects are useless for most of us.  I agree that the stats are nice on it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My ideas are coming from what I have heard from other warriors as I don't have Epic 1.5 yet.<br />
<br />
Clicky: I have a few suggestions<br />
1. Make it have a 1min proc buff.  Make the proc like 100 to 300 dmg with a 3.0/80 stun componet.  Have that part only effect us and give the rest of the group a 20% chance to resist a spell cast or keep the vie look alike but make it die when used up and last until used up.<br />
<br />
2. Make it a Voice of Thule type click.  Have it last 1minute and add 10% agro to everything we do and then as a bonus have it a 2% agro reducer for everyone else in the group to help us keep agro and let them do more dps without getting agro.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Focus: I have a few suggestions for the focus<br />
<br />
1. Make it similar to Echo of Anger.  If it stacks make it 5% if it doesnt make it like 15% for warriors who don't have Echo of Anger and make it 20 or 25% on Epic 2.0, so that it will be more of a boost for warriors who manage to make it there.<br />
<br />
2. Make it an endurance preservation effect, such as 20 or 25% off of cost of endurance.  This would help warriors with 69 bellow because it is so endurance intensive.  Also would help warriors who are tanking chain their discs and still have some endurance left over if their end pool isn't very large like mine (4k).<br />
<br />
Well those are my 2cp.  Btw the beastlord epic clicky is a pet buff that adds a proc, increases evasion rate and dual wield and double attack rate, haste, and adds a chance to stun the opponent that hits them for 1 min.  The last part is similar to the 70 disc.  And their focus is also something they will use its a 35% bonus to cold dmg nukes, the only type they get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1. Focus:  Change focus from &quot;Decrease recast&quot; to &quot;Increase Range&quot; on incite based skills.<br />
<br />
Nooo!!! Incite is not a pulling tool since we need to use a bow first to get full benefit. a end reduction would be better, but since we have the same issue on all our disc above lvl65 it should be unnerfed as a pack and not on a single one via an item so it might not be the best suggestion either.<br />
I like the idee to get the oposite of wizard's focus. but I like too the idee the reduce the reuse time on all our disc, but since rogues get it only on one we may not get it.<br />
So finnally I will vote on the 4/7% hate bonus on everything not like EoA (which works only on incite and and less than the half of melee hate).<br />
<br />
2. Right Click:  Make buff last until rune portion fades, not a 1 min hardcap with cast time.<br />
<br />
fully agree.<br />
yes, we can ask for even more but getting it's full effect is the minimum (less, like now, is like showing a bone to a dog without giving it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the focus effect idea people have mentioned. It seems the majority if not all the caster classes get a 4% hate reduction focus. Giving us a 4% Hate increase focus makes a lot of sense and no one can say it's unbalanced. Just kick the relevant dev over and over to make sure it stacks with EoA, VoT etc.<br />
<br />
The right click effect is a tough cookie. Since we are tanks and have no channeling skill making the effect something to use in combat is pointless. Yes you can click it just before combat but that's not ideal if it's something that directly affects the combat itself. I'm guessing it's impossible to give us a Channeling skill of 100, fixed, at this point, although I think this would be a very good idea. We have so many clickable items now it would be nice to have some chance of clicking a 3 or 4 second cast clickable item during combat.<br />
<br />
I like some of the ideas above for this right click effect so I won't cover all that ground again. I'll just say, 2 buff slots is too much and even if it's just 1 slot couldn't it go into the bard buff box? I'd be pretty happy if it lasted one full minute and took up one slot in the bard box.<br />
<br />
I'll throw this into the pot though, for some flavouring! How about a right click effect that isn't insanely overpowering but focuses on the other things (other than Hate generation) we rely on as tanks? How about a group 50/tick HP/Endurance regen and 100AC for 1 minute? I was considering adding Mana and/or Damage Shield to that but either BST's would complain re:PoS or Druids would re:SotW.<br />
<br />
The problem I have with finding a good right click effect is that there's almost nothing left that you can have that doesn't directly impinge on or steal from a spell another class gets. It's a good thing really because it makes us reliant on having most if not all classes around to raid successfully and a good blend makes even exp groups that much more effective. Except Berserkers... WTF are they good for???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Except Berserkers... WTF are they good for???<br />
<br />
Dying.  Rangers &gt; berserkers<br />
 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DennyDarksavior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Focus: A focus mod making our hate 10% greater from the incite line.<br />
<br />
Clickie: Group Damage Shield of 55, with a 700 hp rune. Duration of 1 minute, instant cast. Call it Krekk's Addrenaline Rush or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">General Epic effect statement:  <br />
<br />
I'd like the clicky to be something that I want to hit right before a major mob comes in - something that makes us more effective at tanking the hard mobs.<br />
<br />
The focus I'd like to make us more effective in all of our roles, be it tanking, DPS or other.<br />
<br />
1. Focus: Decreased timer on Incite line is worthless unless it takes the timer down to 1 second or less (short enough to assure aggro lock before slow/tash lands), in which case it would probably be far too unbalancing.  Increased range is useless unless it is increased to the point it could be a pulling tool, which I'm guessing SOE doesn't want either (based on what happend to that pushback AA).<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
A. Endurance Preservation.  Either 10-20% for all abilities or 25-40% for hate specific.  Perferrably the general option so that it comes into play with offensive discs as well.<br />
<br />
B.  Echo of Anger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3922)  or equivalent.  Preferably something that stacks with EoA and the SK line, but that might be asking a bit much.<br />
<br />
C.  Not necessarily a focus per se, but above skill cap raises to combat skills (defense, offense, parry, riposte, dodge, double attack, dual wield, weapons, etc).<br />
<br />
D.  Avoidance and/or shielding (melee, spell, dot, etc.) additions with no true focus.<br />
<br />
2. Right Click:  The group vie line seems silly, for many reasons already listed.  A self rune is more appropriate, but needs to be far more than 5-10%, or even 20% to be meaningful, and the 750 hp number is laughable.  The 15% spell shield is in the right direction, but insufficient compared to other epics on its own.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
A.  Make it a self only rune.  A big one if clicky, a small one if a proc.<br />
<br />
B.  Leave it as a small % reduced for the whole group, but increase the total absorbed and increase the duration to 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
(neither of the above really appeal to me, but are the smallest change from the current clicky)<br />
<br />
C.  Ditch the vie type effect, leave the self shielding buff, but make it avoidance and all shielding types, stacking with worn effects (if it isn't already stacking).<br />
<br />
D.  Self proc buff, either massive damage (i.e. 1000 DD proc, unresistable), aggro, stun, debuff, snare, mez, whatever.  Something fun here.  Defensive proc or normal, maybe both?  Would have to be high frequency though, especially if only up for one minute.<br />
<br />
E.  Super-duper-uber damage shield.  Ever time we hit a mob we get healed, every time a mob hits us we get healed, etc.  Again, something fun and different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Reduce endurance on Incite line (5/10% maybe) would work for focus, or some kind of stackable +hate buff with Echo of Anger on the Incite line only.

<br />
clicky, self only rune with DS, 1500/150 1.5, 2500/250 2.0. stays till rune aspect used. .5 sec cast time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Focus:<br />
Is pretty much useless as is. Assuming they intend to keep it minor at best, switch it to enhance amount of Hate on incite line from refrsh time.<br />
<br />
And if they won't do that, next best would be Endurance cost; the reason to hold off on using discs or incite is to have plenty of End for when incite is needed, reducing incite cost can only help.<br />
<br />
I doubt they'll extend it beyond effecting just the incite line. Remember 1 feature of this sword is that it has no proc but 2 empty slots so you can configure how you want; adding an EoA type focus would end that. If you feel that the power of a stacking EoA is warranted, why not instead double Incite line hate?  :)  Again, I don't think SoE will agree that it should be that powerful, even if other classes' are.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Clicky:<br />
Lots of good ideas here, I agree with the general consensus that ours is weak compared to other 1.5s. But again I assume they won't change it to something good so a nice Minor fix would be to up the duration to like 5 or 8 mins. That would make it easier to use, don't think making it indefinate duration is really warranted.<br />
<br />
They might balk at increasing the duration by so much at first but just remind them: the effect is very insignificant anyway. Of course, would make much more sense to have this minor shielding buff stay at a duration of 1 min but with no dropping early due to HP limit being hit, but I won't hold my breath for that.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on sword in general:<br />
The focus and click don't measure up to what the other classes get. This should be fixxed. Yes the weapons stats and dmg/dly line up well with the others and are very nice for us and the sword will be used for that alone, but that doesn't mean we should roll over when they short change us on the focus and effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>werdara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Come on, we all know there's only one effect that they'd considering changing the focus to...<br />
<br />
End Regen +5<br />
<br />
Then in the same patch, stealth nerf our standing end regen by 5 pts so getting the epic puts you back where you were!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, in giving suggestions, I'm sure there's a few things that Sony would like to keep on the Warrior epic, to keep it in line with the others.<br />
<br />
For example, I'm sure they want to keep it at one clicky, and one focus. So making it proc the group vie is out. I'm also sure they'd like to keep the cast time to 0.8, since all the other epics are like that. So insta-cast is out. I'm also sure they want to have a re-use time on all epics' clicky so lowering the timer drasitically is probably not gonna fly either.<br />
<br />
That said, what I'd like to see on the Focus:<br />
<br />
Endurance reduction. Just on the in incite/bellow line, would make me more than happy. Would make me that much more willing to do this quest, as I currently use a 2 hander for agro, and don't have anything to weild with the epic.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see on the clicky:<br />
<br />
If not vie, then rune would be nice. Make it good agro, like regular rune cast/procs too! To add to usefulness, even if you don't need the rune. As far as how much to absorb? Might have to back down from 750, that'd be perhaps too good. Or, at the very least, stick with Vie, but make it last more than one minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think this wouldnt be too bad:<br />
<br />
Focus: 4% hate increase when using effects that increase hate.  As was mentioned, I do think it is fair that since all the casters get an anger reduction focus, we should get one that increases it.<br />
<br />
Clicky: I think this clicky isnt too bad, although a group buff similar to the clicky on Kizrak's Chestplate would be nice too.<br />
<br />
I think we should come up with something that works and that everyone agrees with, all sign it with char names and servers, and send it in to SOE.  Maybe theyd actually listen for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">1) Make the focus a 20 percent more hate from melee, bash, kick, incite, and taunt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hareng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For focus i'd like to see a faster refreshing of taunt... only 1 second maybe, but it'll still be enough... or like 20% more chance for taunt to not fail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">For the clicky they should either make it last 10+ minutes with a max amount of absorbed damage, or last 1 full minute with no max to how much damage it can absorb.</div></div><hr />

Would be nice to get a spell that gives an additional hate proc of some kind.  Whether it is a stun or like 250 hate or something.  Make the proc last like 1 minute with the recast of 10 would not be to unblaancing in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Focus Effect:<br />
<br />
I'll throw my vote in with the EoA type affect folks too. Not having an EoA item I don't necessarily need it to stack, but it probably would be nice. The incite timer reduction is absolutely useless. A endurance reduction effect or increase endurance regen would be ok with me too.<br />
<br />
Clicky:<br />
<br />
The 1.8 second cast or whatever it is shouldn't be a big issue... I have a couple 2 and 3 second cast items and I can get them off in a fight pretty consistently, expecially vs. slowed mobs. Vs a bad pull or something, i don't see it happening. Not sure what to suggest here, 2 buff slot icons seems really lame though, and the amount of damage reduction seems pretty lame too. Maybe just more of the same? Leaving the amount of damage capped seems to make it pretty useless in a situation where you'd really need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Personally, I think reducing the incite reuse time to zero wouldn't be overpowering in the slightest. It would require a much more keen judge of usage to balance with the use of disciplines and whatnot, but would be there for use in case of emergency. Would bring more skill back into the game, and less &quot;i can only use it once per fight anyway so i might as well just mash it and have my endurance never go down&quot;</div></div><hr />

With the click. takes up 2 slots.. 90% of the time i am maxxed (lack the new buff slot AA tho) plus it only lasts 60seconds which is kinda retarded. .08 sec cast time. I gotta click it like 10 times in mid fight to try to get it to cast sometimes. WRU war channeling~<br />

They should up the amount of dmg it takes (750 is really low) and up the amount of time it lasts. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rugal Bloodwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Focus:<br />
<br />
Indeed useless, more so..I don't even notice it. Endurance cost reduce of trigger and upkeep is good, altho a combo of that and endurance regen would be even better.<br />
Hate increase for taunt/incite/procs sounds cool, but is a double edged blade making us more dependant on this weapon (more so if stackable with EoA).<br />
<br />
I'll take either of those over the current 2 sec reducer of incite..hell I'd take a dps increase focus over that, or increased procrate, even though it'd be a weak focus for an epic weapon. I oppose the idea of the focus doing nothing but increasing taunt chance to work unless the way taunt itself works changes, it'd be almost as useless.<br />
<br />
Clicky:<br />
<br />
Instacast!<br />
Thought for the group-vie.. make it last 'till it fades, more than 750hp absorbtion as well. The one min duration is kinda lame.<br />
Increasing the spell block chance is a good plan, I kinda like that part..its different and should be useful.<br />
Alternately, I like the ds/reverse ds lifetap idea, thats kinda fun.<br />
/shrug, I'd give up the clicky for an innate proc (triple proc weapon, fun and unique in its own way!), but thats my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rune effect fading in one minute blows.  Make it last at least 10, if not longer.<br />
<br />
Just about anything would be better for the focus.  Longer range, less endurance, more hate, whatever.  Reducing the recast with the same END cost isn't completely useless, there are certainly times when I am mashing incite and watching the counter go down until I can use it again, but with the END cost you certainly can't chaincast it with the current recast, so it would be very situational at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">the issue with EoA is that, from breal's parses, it works like VoT. Thus it doesn't affect spell hate (tchao proc hate bonus) nor kick/bash/whatever, actually it works only on Incite and on the DB part of the swing hate (remember the Breal's formula : swing_hate = Domage + Domage_bonus*class_mod/(1-VoT%-EoA%) thus EoA is very very very limited).<br />
having 4% hate mod on everything would give us a bigger bang than EoA for DW and less for 2Her (EoA give around 7.5% more hate with a Fang of Feratha +A3 and 2.3% more hate with a BBoB+A3 / Thunderclap+A3 combo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I think the focus effect and right-click should benefit Warriors that use it as their primary hand aggro weapon or offhand as a DPS weapon.<br />
<br />
As an aggro weapon, I'd favor: EoA or Taunt +20, but 2 aggro augs alone should be enough to define the Epic as a tanking weapon if that's how a player wishes to use it.<br />
<br />
As a DPS weapon, I'd want Accuracy +15 or Cleave III<br />
<br />
I suppose because both pre-PoTime and at the highest equipment progression level EoA isn't available, that wouldn't be a bad choice.<br />
<br />
IF the focus effect were used to bolster aggro, then I definately would want the right click effect to be Cleave (a new buff, essentially Cleave IV - a 40% chance to crit or better) so that it could used seperately for a brief and modest DPS increase or in combination with the new discipline that coverts crits into crips so that the discipline isn't quite so worthless.<br />
<br />
I'm a little concerned with a rune effect, especially a group rune. It's new territory for Warriors and to my taste much too Paladin-like.<br />
<br />
Off-topic, but I feel the same about the level 70 discipline. It's one thing to increase the chances of Slam, Bash, or Kick to stun interrupt casters (of any level that aren't stun immune) that might be gating - it's another to have Warriors proccing stuns that are effective on higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Vick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Here is how i see it. Warrior Epic is meant for Warriors not clerics or pallies so get rid of the group buff vie shit plz. Its not our job to manage the groups damage just ours. A hate proc for 1 minute or a self 15% Vie with no max dmg for 1 minute would be cool. <br />
<br />
The incite timer reduction doesnt help us any. Other classes have hate reduction on what they do best. And we have a quicker reuse on our newist ability? I agree with the EoA type effect. But asking it to stack is a bit much. I think Making it have Echo of Anger on it would be perfect. Then on Epic 2.0  Make it Krekk's Anger or something like that. 25% agro modifier ect. People that already have Echo of anger still have a useless effect but it burns less than having a stupid effect. If you have Vadd bp and gloves, and somewhere better gloves drop you have EoA to fall back on. Besides noone really complained when they had Raex Bp and vadd gloves that OMG my gloves need a different effect its doing me no good! <br />
<br />
Not like it matters tho 1.5 will prolly stay the same. Hopefully we can influence some sort of change for epic 2.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Click:<br />
<br />
Seriously, this is sad. You could use this every time it refreshed in group and not a single person would notice or care. It would almost never save a life, or even help save any mana. Your cleric wouldn't notice you used it either. The only difference it makes is pissing people off with the buff slot usage. Ive grouped with warriors using epic 1.5, and I have yet to see the effect used, aside from when I requested it.<br />
<br />
Not only is the mitigation crap, the duration just kills this click. If it was unlimited duration, I would consider it to be... decent.<br />
<br />
There are a million cool clicks we could add. How about a self only short duration mitigation buff? How about a spell immunity self only buff? DS? Rune? There are a million balanced ideas in this thread already, the one clear thing is the current click HAS TO GO. You could give me a fireworks particle clicky with no other effect and i would be happier with it than this.<br />
<br />
Focus:<br />
<br />
Even worse for warriors that is worse than the Click mentioned above. What are we supposed to do with this, honestly? How many times do YOU use incite a fight<br />
? I use it once, rarely twice. Give us an aggro mod, a disc timer mod, whatever, anything is better than this.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed. Almost every single warrior on the forums and ingame I have talked to agrees that our epic effects are insulting and depressing when looking at the effort epic 2.0 will require.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I only like the clickie of this weapon because it's similar - not exactly so - to that which has seperated Warriors from other plate tank classes, our defensive disc. I'd like to see it last longer and possibly mitigate more damage; perhaps if the group component was removed, this would be allowable. However, I personally thought the group component was sort of neat...regardless of this, it should definitely count as a bard song and not as a buff.<br />
<br />
As for the focus, perhaps something that directly effects aggro generation would be more in line.  Would it be too much to have an aggro multiplier that directly modifies the sum total aggro generation, according to the formula currently believed to be accurate?</div></div><hr />

Now I know that I am not the only one that sees the differences just between the rest of the pure melee clicky and effect vrs. ours.<br />
<br />
IMO, to keep our weapon in line with the rest, they should make the clicky be a added proc that adds a AngerIV proc  (make AngerIV be 800 points of agression to keep it in line with the rest of the Anger line). Or how about a proc along the lines of the Guard series?<br />
And how about making the effect be something that decreases the endurance cost of our &quot;effect(hate allowed)&quot; (incite line) of discs. We already burn through a huge amount of endurnce on a disc with a reuse of 30 sec. I know in a good group I'm runnen out of endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I'm not really convinced being able to proc Anger IV for 1 minute every 10 minutes (which is what it'd have to be to be consistent) is necessary or even helpful.

<br />

<br />
2. Right Click:  Make buff last until rune portion fades, not a 1 min hardcap with cast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to see the recourse part that only the warrior gets changed froma 15 percent chance to resist spells to a reflect type spell that reflects Damage/Effect back onto the caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>recurse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I'd settle for a end foci, or god forbid.. endurence regen &gt; 5 a tick (gasp). Or trade in both effects for more shielding.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Barangi~E'ci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I've read posts now that state an EoA or something EoA-like as a desired focus effect. I'd agree that a focus along the lines of EoA would be nice, but considering that the epic is quite easily obtained, heck I got mine during the first week of OoW and we're neither a Time nor a Uqua guild, I think the focus should be a minor version of EoA or maybe an altered version boosting procs instead of Incite and the like. I fear putting EoA on an item that's somewhat easily obtained might trivialize the EoA effect.<br />
<br />
As far as click effect, well, to be honest I don't really care about the click. If the Epic had a decent worn focus, they could take away the rightclick for all I care. I can't spare the 2 buff slots the effect requires when tanking boss mobs and during regular xp stuff I don't really see the need to click it. The cast time, short duration and recast makes it useless and the AE or group effect of it only serves to mess up the buffs up those around you as well.<br />
<br />
If there's supposed to be a rightclick on the weapon, I'd much prefer it to be single target, fixed duration, instant cast. Recast would have to be there obviously, in order not to make it too powerfull. But as I said, I could easily live without it at all.<br />
<br />
Edit: Come to think of it, I'd very happily trade the right click for a proc mod on the weapon. A proc mod I'd consider alot more usefull than the current or pretty much any other click they could add to it.</div></div><hr />

I agree, all the epics should be equally hard or easy to get, but that's not how it is and that's not how it was with the first line of epics either. So since being able to balance out the difficulty of obtaining the epic seems impossible, all I'm saying is, that we can't expect them to add the mothers of all aggro procs and the focus to end all other foci to this weapon.<br />
<br />
Those 2 should be reserved for the 2.0 - but the 1.5 should have the younger sister of the mother of all aggro procs and the focus right behind the focus to end all other foci. If they want to stick with the idea of epic 2.0 being and upgraded 1.5.</div></div><hr />

Problem is, you aren't really protecting anyone with this click. The chances of it actually saving someone, if you lost aggro entirely, under attack from a mob in OoW/GoD are like 1/1000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">The same goes for /shield.  Making them take 10% less dps while you wait for taunt to refresh is better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I admit its better than nothing. Now, how many people do you know that actually use /shield? I don't know a single person on my server that does.<br />
<br />
Other epics have very significant effects, why should we settle for something thats barely worth using aside from novelty? I find it hard to believe that people are arguing FOR this click effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I use /shield all the time.  Although I admit most people don't, I think it has more to do with lazy tanks than /shield being useless.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I guess every tank on my server is lazy then.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">So why have your cleric tanking a 1100 hitter for 5-10 seconds when they could be tanking a 600 hitter for that time?  The good thing about /shield is that the tougher the mob you're fighting is, the better /shield gets.  <br />
<br />
The range thing isn't the issue it used to be anymore btw.  90% of the time when I hit my /shield key the person I'm shielding is on one side of the mob and I'm on the other and /shield easily reaches that far now.</div></div><hr />
