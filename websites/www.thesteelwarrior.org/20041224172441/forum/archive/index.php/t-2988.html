<br />
Although I dont think you guys should buy it because it will make it just that much easier for me to find a group.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought it, so far most of my guild has too.  Have done a grand total of 3 dungeons, walked away with exp and more points. Had a fucking blast last night, exploring a couple of guk based dungeons... and tonight had another blast with guildies exploring an everfrost dungeon.<br />
<br />
Worth the money for me? Hell yes. Am I miffed pure melee didn't get anything special in the way of skills? Hell yes. Had a group of Me (65 war), 65 war, 65 druid, 64 druid, 65 nec, and 65 beast. We owned everfrost dungeon today, and got some cool trinkets to boot..<br />

Boycott it if you want, you are just missing out on a good expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At normal difficulty the challenge is more clearing the mobs in time than keeping your tank up against the mob, I dont think knight agro lock is going to be particularly attractive compared to superior warrior DPS.  Haven't tried a hard one yet, maybe agro lock will be more important there, but from what I am reading mobs hit hard enough for a warrior's mitigation advantage to be important there too.</div></div><hr />

hehe, Haass, yeah this expansion has made MY dungeons seem like single instance dungeons for my group(s) :P<br />
<br />
BUY THE EXPANSION, leave MY dungeons now !!!<br />

I played for 3 weeks in beta and after seeing the same fooking cookie cutter dunegeons over and over and over and over and over again... well sure made old world EQ dungeons more exciting.</div></div><hr />

Not to nitpick, but sebilis never changed, cazic thule never changed (save for them making it higher level), etc, etc. How are these dungeons any different from the LDoN dungeons?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means that all of the sheep are finally out of the zones that Fae and I like to frequent, because they all followed the leader and bought a piece of crap expansion so they could get a &quot;Dungeon Experience&quot; instead of just using the dungeons that are available.<br />
<br />
6 people in BoT was mentioned earlier in this thread.  Why WOULDN'T you want that kind of freedom?  Keep on buying SoE's crap...it's helping me and my guild out a lot by having less people to compete with and less idiots around to listen to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But there's *nobody* to compete with and *no* idiots around in every LDoN dungeon (unless you're grouped with them).  If you're really that excited about going to BoT then knock yourself out though.<br />
<br />
Personally I already did everything there is to do in Seb a hundred times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, and how long is the new feeling gonna last with the same cookie cutter dungeons over and over again too?<br />
<br />
Everything gets old.  At that point it just becomes where you hunt that's worth the most bang for your buck.  This expansion had promise, but with 99% of all gear only being augmentable with type 1 or 4 (weapons), it requires that you buy all new gear off the merchants (which is usually crappier than what you're wearing now) and THEN augment it to be better than what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the hell are we even talking about?  I have the choice to do something I'm already bored with, or something I will get bored with eventually.  Easy decision for me, but apparently you think I am stupid for buying an expansion, even though I have been having a lot of fun playing in it?  What is your point here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like you're just bored and need to find a new pasttime.  Delaying the inevitable only hurts your wallet :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like 40 different types of dungeons (40 different layouts, like 8 for each theme) Is going to take me a hell of a lot longer then it took me to get bored of seb. Don't get me wrong, I love seb though.<br />
<br />
Loot+exp+fun (some peoples milage may vary on the fun part though) = a great expansion for me. Rather then camping stuff, I can find 5 other people tell them that in 90 mins  (maybe 2 hours if you wipe and for some reason can't get corpses back... ie, pacified all the way to the boss and wiped heh) we will be completed, or failed. Better then getting into a seb group then finding out the healer has to go and the group breaks up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope I don't have to exp in bot again personally. 1 aa per 2 dungeons is good enough for me untill I get into elemental planes or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to nit pick here but the dungeons are all the same.  There are 4 pieces for each dungeon; there is the straight line, the intersection, the curve, and the large room.  They simply added these four different structures together like a child's race track.<br />
<br />
I'm glad your having fun, the question was &quot;did you buy LDoN&quot; and I stated no and the reasons, because while y'all are doing what you think are different dungeons and different themes to make points to buy stuff your leaving zones that I have not had an opportunity to frequent...<br />
<br />
Thank you for purchasing LDoN, enjoy your &quot;dungeons&quot;, I did BETA for 3 weeks, I’ve seen enough dungeons to &quot;see&quot; that they are all the same pieces arranged in different order, like a kids toy race track... <br />
<br />
This expansion was &quot;sold&quot; as being the &quot;new dungeon crawl expansion&quot; that we’ve all been looking for.   My opinion about these dungeons is they are not a &quot;crawl&quot;.  Making people move down a straight path in order to get to the next cross intersection that looked identical to the one you just passed is not a &quot;crawl&quot;.  It’s an exercise in monotony.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it was fun the first two weeks after doing 2 adventures a night for 3 weeks I dreaded going into the same area again with a different &quot;goal&quot; just to &quot;buy&quot; an augment that only fir on an item that I had to &quot;buy&quot; or replace with something that rarely dropped...<br />
<br />
I didn't post to argue whether Brutul was having fun, I simply answered the original post question and gave my 2cp in order to &quot;help&quot; expand everyone's knowledge a little more.  You paid for 5 dungeons how ever you want to look at the &quot;kid race track&quot; they are the same dungeons re arranged in different orders.<br />
<br />
I simply posted here to let everyone know what they are &quot;thinking&quot; about buying and what my opinion is, not to say &quot;Brutul can not have fun damn it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well.. Whatever, I didn't get much of a chance to play in BoT or Sebilis on release because of the 40+ masses in there but I have had the opportunity this week to play in these zones with very little interference from &quot;the masses&quot; and it has been as refreshing to me as LDoN has been to y'all.</div></div><hr />
