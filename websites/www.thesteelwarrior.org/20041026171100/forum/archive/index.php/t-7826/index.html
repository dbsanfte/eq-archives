<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone noticed a major decrease of players online lately?  My guild isnt real big but what used to be loggin on to 20+ players is now like 7.  Talking to others not in guild and they say it is harder and harder to get pickup groups because lack of people on.  This is Cazic server but just wondering if you were experiencing it also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's summer. Raid appearances always drop during summer.<br />
<br />
Black Company and Omen are having the exact same problems on Tarew Marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Endorean on Luclin are actually seeing pretty decent numbers, with weekends being the exception (but it has always been that way)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its summer<br />
enough said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bazaar population implies a loss of one third of the accounts. population in all zones below level 50 content implies an 80-90 percent drop in the number of brand new players in the last few years. number of players in pok implies about a one-third reduction.<br />
<br />
while this isnt proof of anything id say the numbers are dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People are doing stuff, generally out during the summer months. <br />
<br />
That or they are playing other games. (CoH?)  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think it is safe to asume they are dropping. Lets face it SoE never had time for the players or cared what we thought. Now out of the blue they want input. I really dont think its because they realised their mistake but because numbers are falling. New games are coming out all the time and it that will  take its toll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most raiding guilds on Innoruuk have been hammered; several have just collapsed. Even in the summer, I never saw it this bad. I shouldn't talk though, since I have logged on maybe twice in 5 months, and just gave my account to my brother. Don't really see playing EQ anymore, though I guess you never know.<br />
<br />
Been enjoying CoH, though I don't play it as obsessively as I used to play EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We had 32 people quit eq in the span of 3 weeks... which left a brand new  , 80 active member, ele guild (new to ele's) more or less totally crippled. since then we've been crawling back up to where we were before, tonight we had 60 on, which is the highest we've had since 72 for our first rz kill almost a month ago.<br />
<br />
Attendance is down. People are playing other games. Also, there is no rush or desire to race home anymore, everything is instanced or so it seems, no need to fight over what you can patiently wait for...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Three reasons really<br />
<br />
 It's summer<br />
 Eq is 5 years old and burnout is rampant, GoD for many has finally ruined the game they loved<br />
 People don't trust SOE to fix things, player summit and supposed 180 in course is too little - too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's kinda interesting what I've been seeing.  The same people day after day are hacking away in KT, in various places at BiC things and in Vxed/Tipt/Ikkinz and such.  The rest are logging in for raids only and often only for specific raids.  <br />
<br />
It's kinda natural though, most have all the AAs they care about done.  They *could* grind out for HP augs and the like but don't frankly bother.  They look at BiC and laugh aloud.  Some play alts and some come on to chat and fart around but many, many simply log in when there is a guarantee of a decent raid on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good?  Bad?  Hell, I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've played this game for 4 years and summer always bring about lack of people online. It is the toughest time for smaller raiding guild since during summer I've seen a good chunk of them just break apart. There are always people claiming that a game, be it Newerwinter Nights, WoW, StarWars...etc is the reason for this and EQ is doomed.<br />
<br />
In the end September comes around and everything is back to normal. Although I agree SoE keeps screwing EQ, its player base and in the end themselves. Its more apparent now then it has ever been.</div></div><hr />

When Smedly takes the time to talk to the customers it's for one reason, and one reason only. The bottom line is dropping. Both my accounts are cancelled, and it's been about 3 weeks since I've logged in. Not that I won't play anymore, but I think I'll pay as I go. I'm still miffed about the 2 accounts worth of GoD that I bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">summer always has been bad for guilds as far as i have seen. its actually been kinda nice for mine because right before summer we were having about 70ish on every weekend raid which was good to get flag mobs down. now that we are in EP and its our main focus our avg amount of people on raid is mid 40s which has proven to be enough for basically anything that isnt a god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally, I've gone from raiding 6 nights a week to not logging in for the last 2 weeks...as most have said, it's summer, I like the evenings to play sports, go out and just relax....this happened to coincide with my guilds first ventures into GoD, and after having to do Vxed trial and Tipt, the urge to log in just fell...sure I'll play again soon, the urge to log in is still there, but the longer I leave it, the harder it seems :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They should time expansion releases around the seasons. Fall would provide better numbers since outdoor activities are at a minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Taurius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I heard Afterlife quit EQ as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I heard Afterlife quit EQ as well.<br />

Quite old news!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taurius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Quite old news! <br />

Perhaps, but I just read about it today.  Was kind of shocking.</div></div><hr />
