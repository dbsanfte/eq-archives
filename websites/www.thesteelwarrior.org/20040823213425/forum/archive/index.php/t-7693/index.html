<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate doing this, but the last donations we recieved were around the time we brought up the Advertisement-Based system. Obviously, we decided not to go with that, but we still need to pay our bandwidth fees  :D <br />
<br />
As of 6-20-2004 we have $85. We're paid up through June, and July will be $75, leaving us short for August. <br />
<br />
If you guys and gals are able to assist with this it would be much appreciated. Nothing is required, like always, and the lights won't suddenly turn off on August 1st. This is more a warning about the future. All funds are recorded and stay in TSW account to be used as we need them for the boards. To donate, click below:<br />

!!!paypalbutton!!!<br />
<br />
There is also the option for a recurring donation, if that interests you. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the support,<br />
