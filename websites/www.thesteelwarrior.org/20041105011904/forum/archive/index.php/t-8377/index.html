<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bopin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I'm bringing my level 51 Warrior out of retirement and need some advice on equipment.   Basically think of him has nekid cause the current gear that is left on him is sub par by todays standards.  Here's the senario, I have about 150k to spend on him and want to see if I can get some suggestions on what to look for.  It has been a while since I did any shopping for Warrior gear so bacisally I'm back to newb status with regards to todays offerings.  I'll post my magelo, but I'm sure I will be replacing everything.  To give you an idea on how long it's been, his Guardian armor was pretty uber when he got it  :cool: <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, I really appreciate any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get a Copper hammer and Sword of the Bloodsworn for agro weapons. Valorium Rings. Veteran, Blood Rage, or Bloodmetal earrings. Soulscream Belt for haste. Not sure what to suggest for visible slots for you as I always used Culture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sucana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have a lot of slots to cover, so you need to be conservative in spending.  Look up cultural armor.  Have you considered following the smithing guide at www.eqtraders.com, to learn how to make a set of your cultural armor?  Learning to smith can be expensive, but you can keep the costs down with some farming.  You have all the gear you need to kill spiderlings and wolves. :)<br />
<br />
And, of course, you will also want a haste item (soulscream belt, as a pricy example) and weapons.  Greatstaff of thunder is probably the most cost-effective weapon, although it might require level 55.  Otherwise, sword of the bloodsworn and copper hammer of striking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rorekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would say Copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn for weapons. As for armor, if you like the stats on your cultural go with that, if not search around the bazaar for some nice HP, AC, STA gear to up your hp. For rings go with valorium ring of gallantry x2 and Bloodmetal earring of engagement x2. <br />
Good luck.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Copper Hammer of striking ~6k<br />
Sword of Bloodsworn ~5k<br />
Valorium Rings ~12k both<br />
Bloodmetal Earrings of Engagement ~35k both<br />
<br />
maybe a Bow for Range slot - Stonewood is nice but also cost around ~45k on my server<br />
Bone Carved Shortbow also have nic stats and go for ~8k <br />
<br />
for you visible Slot ( Chest, Boots, legs,...) get Cultural its close to ornate and a lot cheaper. Also Ldon -Gear is nice ( but you have to do much ldon to get all upgrades)<br />
<br />
if you have a few friends you can do Loyalist shield of Honor Quest - will be a great upgrade for you. (Back Slot)<br />
<br />
Haste as gaspie said. I dont know you typical group - if you dont have a shammy/chanter to cast a haste spell on you, maybe Kizraks Gauntlets are worth it (have a 30% self spellhaste click-effect)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bopin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great information!  I'm getting excited to get home and do some shopping.  Anyone know the names of the cultural armor for a Brell Dorf?  I'll look into that quest, any chance of completing it with a partner?  The only piece of ornate I see as a must is the gloves, clicky haste will be nice...I could never stomach that stormfeather camp.  Also, are there any clicky items that are good for pulling or agro?  I've not played my warrior for a while and  the latest changes to warriors...changed things...so I'm going to be re-learning agro management.   :eek: <br />
<br />
Sorry for the deluge of questions but I'm excited to get out there and start stomping on things again.<br />
<br />
Oh and Sucana, you sure I'd be able to stand up to some wolves and spiders with my current gear?  :p <br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This order, if it were me:<br />
Droga weapons<br />
haste<br />
cultural armor<br />
non-visible slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bopin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What Droga Weapons are you talking about?   I've bought some stuff but just noticed that I must not have had magelo upadte running... Also, are there any weapons with the old SSoY graphic? I think I've seen some around but that might have just been a fabled one...Always been partial to the good ole SSoY look  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Droga Weapon aka droga combo aka CHoS (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62186) in Mainhand with SotB (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62188) in secondary.<br />
<br />
and Haste is more important than this combo, so fisrt find your tribute master for tribute haste, then head to the bazard for the weapons and armors, then head to LDoN missions to augment the DW combo with more hate generating proc (either stun +DD akka wrath/strike of the ykesha, or pure hate aka Anger2/3), and after aug your armor.<br />
<br />
EDIT : about the SSotY look, there is some of them, here is a couple (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=of+the+ykesha), I know there is more but I don't remember them all, mainly because none are better than the droga combo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yoda,<br />
Can a 51 warrior earn enough to sustain the cost of tribute haste? Or would he be better off buying 31% haste item, keeping it for a while, then selling it down the line when his earning power went up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bopin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks again for the info.  I noticed on the CHoS and the SotB they have a recommended level of 56, that just means that the stats will be less until I get 56?  As opposed to a weapon with a minimum level of 56 which I would not be able to use till I gain sufficient levels, right?  Weapon selection is probably the key to success and everyone is saying this combo so...I'll try and find them in the baz tonight.  Are they just drops in Droga or quested, if I can't find them or they are too expensive, I might give a go at getting them myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Droga weapons are both dropped items and the NPC's (king &amp; seer) are both in the same room in Droga. <br />
<br />
A Soulscream Belt (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=65570) Drops in Veskar on the Rotting Shopkeeper and would do you well hastewise.<br />
<br />
As an added bonus you can also go after Kylong Shinguards (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=65543) that Also drop in veskar off Feral Lord Gulok who's camp you pass both on the way In and Out.<br />
<br />
No need to spend upwards of 40k of the above when they can definitely be attained by a strong group at your level. Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye, I think the Veksar stuff might be doable if you have some mid-fifties friends and you play well together. And, of course, no one else is camping it.<br />
Don't have personal exp camping the Droga stuff, but Daggorr's probably right.</div></div><hr />
