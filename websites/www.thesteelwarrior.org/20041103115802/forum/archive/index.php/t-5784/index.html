<br />
it have a nice resist adjust and a 2sec stun also sound nice <br />
<br />
What you think better aggro then CHoS or SotBs ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am very amazed at what has been done to the english language here. I never will understand where the degrigation over the past year or so has come from. I am suprised it was not asked, &quot;D00D, Thix Roxor's. I am L33T!.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">English might not be his first language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Because judging from his surname, he is probably German, or at least European. Never occured to you did it? Asshole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't see any very compelling reason to swap this in for either a CHoS or SotBS if you already have those.  Ratio and dd aren't as good, and as far as I know, the longer stun doesn't generate any more aggro.  Besides, most things you fight these days are over the level that a normal stun will land anyway, so you won't actually be landing the stun.<br />
<br />
But if you happen to get one of these and don't have a set of the droga weapons, it's probably pretty close in the aggro department, so might as well use it. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Just looked at your magelo and saw you're 55.  It might be nice for when you're fighting mobs that are 55 and under in some situations, 'cause the stun will lower their dps a bit, although an average of 4 secs out of 60 stunned if you're main-handing it isn't going to make a world of difference.  Couldn't hurt to carry it around, just in case.</div></div><hr />

DEGRIDATION. With a D.</div></div><hr />

thx for your useful answer<br />
<br />
in the future i will place a note in my sig<br />

sorry English isn´t my mother-tongue<br />

<br />
Ahm .. degrigation?  And, he forgot to capitalize &quot;English&quot;.  English may not be Sisthar's first languge :D.  <br />
<br />
Looks like a decent aggro weapon to me, I'd venture a guess that it's on par with the Copper Hammer and the SotB, in terms of aggro.  I second Kamidari's opinion.<br />
<br />
P.S. It's degrAdation ;).  With an A.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not impressed with it.<br />
<br />
This happens every expansion tho, we end up finding a lot of weapons which really look like clones of weapons we already have, except they suck a little more, so that means they end up being virtually worthless.  Why get X when you can just get Y?<br />
<br />
Oh, and I just love it when grammar/spelling nazi's get fuckin owned.  It's priceless indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haha, damn wub, you beat me to it!<br />
<br />
And really, making fun of someone who obviously doesn't speak english as a first language is offside...answer the post or begone troll.<br />
<br />
Back to the thread, I'd say the weapon would prolly be ok for aggro, but think I'd defer to CHoS and SOtB if you already have em...tried and true. If you hear otherwise then maybe give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am glad this thread has at least amused me for a bit today. Thanks it has been fun to read please keep the flames comming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Lol. You get owned after being a jerk, then try to shrug it off as amusing? If you're going to post, at least pretend to be on topic. And if you want to flame people, go to any post in the Outhouse and have at it.<br />
<br />
  In answer to the topic question, I suspect it actually won't be that great of aggro, compared to the standard bought weapons. Stun duration has never really seemed to affect the aggro generated. Because its ratio is actually worse, and even the DD portion is lower, I'd suggest that it's worse aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i think i'll wait and see how much +end before making a choice is on the chos and sotb. you could prolly interchange all three though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Woojed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds like a good wep, but how much aggro does it produce?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The weapon could be a cheaper replacement for a CHoS, although I don't think it would be as good of a weapon, or generate as much agro, due to the poorer ratio, as mentioned. However, for a warrior who is at least 45, to reach this thing's required level, and below the rec level of 56 on CHoS, this might make a good alternative if SOE  ever does fix the rec. lvl bug.<br />

And as a last peanut gallery comment...  Sisthar, it's suRprised, you dumbass, &quot;comming&quot; only has one &quot;M&quot; in it, and punctuation is your friend.</div></div><hr />

Nope not last =P<br />
<br />
I for one am so tired of ignorant people and, (sorry It’s usually us American’s) Taking for granted that they aren’t the only ones on the  face of the earth. Being in the military for the last 11 years I have traveled to many O’ places and, I have found Americans for the most part to be the only people to make fun of persons of another nationality's grammar and accents.  Other nationalities are for the most part exited and enthusiastic about others trying to learn there language. <br />
<br />
I have been living in Japan for the last 6 years. When people laugh at my Japanese it's more of a giggle because they think it’s cute. Then they  usually will spend what ever time they have to help me correct my grammar.<br />
I wish more people would think about what they say before they say it. Anyway I can go on and on but here probably isn’t the place.<br />
<br />
I have my fire hydrant  here so flame me all you want<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit - changed nationalities to Nationality's =P my english sux</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would say its a good weapon for 45-56, when you cant use the CHoS and SotB with their full stats. Both of those weapons's procs have a higher DD value, and if we put the stun portion as a base value (ie. all produce the same stun agro), this new weapon falls in third place due to lower DD component. And the SotB can interrupt lvl65 mobs :)<br />
<br />
Btw, my native language is not english either, so I'll join the club haha :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Fuckit, you two write English better than most of the baboons graduating nowadays.</div></div><hr />
