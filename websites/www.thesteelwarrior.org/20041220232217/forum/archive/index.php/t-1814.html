Beat him round the head with a rusty spoon  till he stopped breathing. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WTF does SEWS have to do with a BoW?  Really, tell me... give me good hard facts what these two have to do with another?<br />
<br />
SEWS is damn high aggro... the proc isn't what does it either mmmkay.  Our non-MT BoW equipped warriors can't use them much at all when in DPS mode due to snap aggro / damage aggro.  However, our *one* SEWS MT, holds aggro great with it AND can use it for DPS (occassionally catching damage aggro cuz hell if that thing don't dish it out).  Now... what Pally / SK needs an EB weapon?  Not a damn one.  What warrior needs an excellent 2h non-snap-aggro weapon?  ALL OF US!<br />
<br />
That aside, at least in my DKP guild, BoW is warrior only... as are all EB/TB/Furious Bash items.  SEWS is highest DKP wins.  Course just so happens 2 of our 3 MT's use BoW's one has a SEWS... the rest of us warriors are well under the knights sooo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW is sought by warriors since it allows reliable aggro via DPS and proc along with lower damage from riposte, SEWS is well thought of for the exact same reason, if you're looking for a justification for taking an EB weapon away from a warrior or some half assed 'reasoning' that a warrior shouldn't bid on a SEWS do please go ahead, knock yourself out. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd seriously just snap on him. A paladin has about as much of use with a BoW than a ranja has with one: NONE! (Except when the BoW procs, the ranja would end up dead, not sure on the knight  :D )<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a similar note, if you are expecting BoW's to be warrior ONLY, do you bid on SEWS? <br />
<br />
When I feel like it, I will. Like when a pally wants to bid on BoW.<br />
<br />
ANNNNND, Let's not forget this quote:<br />

Sir I resent that. If I had a dueling glove, I'd slap you with it. But I don't, so....erm.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I said BoW and SEWS together because they are the 2 best pre time 2handers for both knights and warriors.  If you have BoW as warrior only, and leave SEWS open, where does this leave your knights? <br />
<br />
<br />
It makes sense to me if you want BoW as warrior only, to leave sews for non warriors, I just want to get other input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given all the other 2handers with great ratio's that are out there and available to knights, why are you so fixated on the one that is actually useful to the warriors. BoW's don't just grow on tree's now do they , if a warrior has expectation that he might get a BoW in the near future I imagine he will leave the sews to the knight (assuming the knight hasn't got better already elsewhere). If not then /shrug you want your warriors able to hold aggro don't you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd make a rule so BoW was warrior only (and did that already :P)<br />
<br />
On a similar note, if you are expecting BoW's to be warrior oly, do you bid on SEWS?<br />
<br />
Personally no, but I wouldnt hold it against other warriors if they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Mick</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First that ranja should be slapped with a 5lb tuna.<br />
<br />
Second, the guild / leadership that allowed him to get it should be slapped and sterilized so they can't reproduce.  You can only take pure DKP so far.  WTF is a ranja gonna do with a BoW?  Equip it while he shoots arrows safely outta melee range?  Use it when he shoots arrows in exp groups safely outta distance?  Use it when he BOT's a shammy / cleric / druid to duo in CoD?  I mean WTF??!!<br />
<br />
SEWS = Stone Etched Warsword<br />
<br />
And ya... SEWS much easier to get to than fighting over RZTW and the dickwaving contest on who should kill him when, and when you should be able to farm him; quit being a cockblockin asshole guild etc... fuck... it's much simpler and better all around to farm PoE for the SEWS.<br />
<br />
No offense or nuttin but leave it to a pally to ask such a truly inane question.  Our knights through fits over warriors being allowed to go in on a SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW - I see no reason for a knight to want this, unless he is another pallie who wants to wave his dick in the face of warriors. Fortunately, we only have one of those in my guild and he doesn't raid enough to get close to a BoW. This is an MT weapon, pure and simple. If all your MTs have em, then you can open it up to others, but until then, no way.  If a hybrid in my raid force obtained one of these before me, I'd tell the raidleaders to make the ass tank and laugh as they wondered why they lost the &quot;MT&quot; all the time. <br />
<br />
SEWS - A great weapon, but with the way itemization throughout EQ is pro-hybrid, I see no reason to put an artificial limitation on access to warriors if they have earned the right.</div></div><hr />
