<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shrikeavatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My tanking weapons are epic 1.0 in main, and CHoS in off.  I almost have enough pts to get the A3 aug.  Should I just put it in the red?  If I do put it in the red will it decrease the amount of times that the red procs rage of vallon?  Will the anger proc from the A3 aug be decreased over what it would have been in an item with no proc of its own?<br />
<br />
I also have a sludge-covered short sword, and was thinking about putting the A3 in it; but I heard that even with the aug, this weapon does not hold much aggro.  I plan on getting the warrior weapon from the cursed and putting the aug in it, but that is a couple months off.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">put the CHoS in primary hand chief...that alone will help without aug'ing anyhting.<br />
but; unless you see an upgrade in the future for the offhand, augging a red epic will be a decent offhander for what is available to you. just expect the epic proc to be resisted by a ot of stuff you'll be fighting.<br />
if i was you tho; i'd go get a sword of the bloodsworn and aug that...it'll get a lot more eusage and desired effect than the red epic will</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Technically, the innate weapon proc takes precedence over the augment. You *do* lose some insignificant amount of augment procs from augmenting a weapon with a proc. However, it only matters at all when both would proc on the same swing. Seeing as that is a very small amount of times, it is *always* worth it to augment an aggro weapon with an aggro proc over augmenting a weapon with no proc.</div></div><hr />

Meh...I used my red epic offhand with Anger II for ages.  I disagree with the statement that SotBS would get a lot more usage and desired effect.  As an offhand weapon, they are in the same ballpark IMO.  CHoS mainhand for sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep , CHoS+A3 / Red epic is the best PvR you will have right now since SotB is at best equal to red epic (aggro wise not dps wise nor utility wise).<br />
if you can get the bloodfrenzy then yes BF main and CHoS offhand. and get a second A3 for the offhand ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A3 in the red epic is like putting lipstick on a pig.</div></div><hr />

you're kidding, right? right? hell, i retired my red epic the day i got my SotB ( i used gnomb's old BoC mainhand+red epic offhand previous ) and never looked back for a minute. i swear; from fighting ToVN/Doze on up to getting my BoW ( on shik that is )...the red epic was resisted by damn near everything ( i kept breaking it out on occasion, because, well, i did dump 2 years into completing it so the f**king thing's gotta be worth somehting )...and to choose a 14/24 with a dd+hate over a 12/19 with dd+stun...is lunacy. the 2H epic v1 was a more valid choice of weaponry than the 1Hers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm pretty certain that even on a resist, Rage of Vallon (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1935) still gives you the benefit of the 500 hate...it's just the DD component that you lose.  So, for aggro purposes, one would think red epic in the offhand vs. SotB would be about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO of course;<br />
<br />
i was never a fan of the +hate +anger crowd.....people thought I was nuts saying my BoC sucked ass because the proc did nothing compared to a AC debuff or stunDD type proc ( believe me; i was the king of ghetto gear and i had a LOT of shit weapons i'd chain equip just for the proc on them....one of my favories was the praetor blade which the proc would keep my shammy friend alive, my BBoT for some more cheap proc value, a frostbringer for the debuff...and if i was really slick and awake i'd toss in a slow on my ToD for ghits and siggles ). <br />
<br />
the red epic was a failure to me and is nothing more than a trophy piece</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At best the red epic is equal to the SotB in offhand.  I'm not sure you get the full effect, as I've pulled mobs off a warrior who has had a couple epic procs, where a couple stuns easily hold it.<br />
<br />
I think people overstate the value of the epics, honestly.  I don't even see any coolness factor when someone uses the red epic, I just see someone who put too much work for too little value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cameronvk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For a slightly different take on using the 1.0 1h epics, I use a Chos with an anger aug primary and my Blue epic with a yekesha aug as my secondary.  I find that the 40 or so points of Dex it gives me makes up for a lack of an inate proc.  and the extra attack never hurts either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't have said it better myself lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what about dual weilding red and blue?</div></div><hr />

<br />
  40 dex won't ever outweigh an extra aggro proc, not even offhand, and attack doesn't help you hold aggro. It might do ok, but you'd be better off with a SotB.<br />
<br />
what about dual weilding red and blue?<br />
<br />
  It'll kinda suck. Just like it has for a long time. You'd be much better off with the droga combo or a GSoT. Just like when the droga combo first came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hmm...am still only 2 kills from epic...meh ill get it anyways and decide what to weild later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah, it is a pretty weapon...just don't get dissapointed when you finally put it to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ill just make a hotkey saying &quot;Incoming &amp;t, im about to go Luke Skywalker on its arse!&quot; :D</div></div><hr />
