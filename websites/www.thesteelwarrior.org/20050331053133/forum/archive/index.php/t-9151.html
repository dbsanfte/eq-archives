Those that have done it, I'm sure you're aware of the mob stacking issues.  If you're not aware, ummm...what happens is after awhile of killing, mobs start to spawn in one place in the dungeon.  They just keep spawning on top of each other.  They're not respawns of the older, non-stacked versions you've killed from different spots (those respawn just fine on their own), but rather new mobs.  Some of these will be lvl 70 a Shrewd Dragorn, and others will be the lvl 65 or 66 standard trash.  At any rate, all stacked up exactly on one another.  If you stay there for a long time and keep killing the other mobs, it makes for horrific lag.  But it begs the question: Shakerpage?  You've got your veritable pick of however many mobs you want (assuming you have a gar or something) to keep stacked up, they're all in perfect alignment, and none see invis so that you could get slowed, invis, and move right on top of them for a sexy click of rampage.  The mobs have roughly 35-40k hp or thereabouts.  Would this be a feasible thing to do?  If not, why not?! ; )</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the original question, fora single war ramp you would need something like 200 mobs stacked to have a successful rampage (more if high mr). How many mobs have you see stacked?</div></div><hr />

Going back and looking at the logs, it looked like approximately 64 mobs had popped. I could easily have just gone AFK in the expedition, and come back many hours later, and shakerpaged, for mass XP. I would have, but there was a patch that night.</div></div><hr />

It`s not a viable option, imo. Guessing you`d need upwards of 100+ rats to kill anything, and thats if you didn`t have any resists.</div></div><hr />

IE you rampage on a lot of mobs while slowed and wielding an ae proc weapon, so you get a whole hell of a lot of procs on all the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a huge thread about it elsewhere, but here's the basics:<br />
<br />
Earthshaker is a 37/70 2hs that has a proc that is an AE DD. So if it procs, every mob in range will be hit by the AE. Rampage, an AA skill, allows you to simultaneously have a swing at every mob in melee range. If your earthshaker procs an average of once per 3 swings, that means you should average 1 proc for every 3 mobs in range when you rampage. So if you train 100 mobs to one spot and rampage, you'll get ~33 procs with these numbers. Using this concept, you can train a huge amount of mobs to one spot and rampage, and hopefully kill them all instantly, since the more mobs you have = the more chances to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">earthshaker + rampage = shakerpage<br />
explanation :<br />
 * the earthshaker is a 2HS with a big delay (70) that proc a 250HP PBAE spell. thus when this weapon procs it domages every mob around the warior (within a given radius) for that much. <br />
 * since it has a big delay, a fully slowed warrior with WA5 has more than 70% chance to proc on each swing.<br />
 * rampage is a triggered warrior AA that hits once every mob around the warrior with the primary wielded weapon. It has the particularity to check for possible proc to fire on every swing (one per mob).<br />
 * the combinaison of 1. a fully slowed warrior with WA5 and wielding shakerpage, 2. a very very big train pulled (100+ mob) headed on top of this warrior ; leads to more than 70 proc of PBAE at the same time (rampage hits every mobs at the same time) on every mob around the warrior resulting in domaging all the mob around him by around 20kHP (no resist, enougth mob, lucky proc rate).<br />
 * some zones allow such big train of mob under 20kHP and decent lvl, and repoping fast enougth. so that it's possible to gain exp really fast (a pull every 15min ~&gt; more than 400 mob killed per hours...)<br />
<br />
<br />
drawback : it creates such a lag that you need few minutes to see what happened and if not all the mob are killed by the process, you will need a rez by the end of the lag.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />

<br />
40 mobs isn't very many at all.  Do you have WA5?  Were you slowed?  What color are your bracers dyed?  All very important questions.  Determined to sucker someone into this....now if only I could get my Earthshaker back from the zerker I borrowed it to.</div></div><hr />

We have been doing the Firepit mission getting the ft 3 shield for our casters and picking some runes while at it. Track seems to be pretty limited in these zones even for our ranger. So explain plz the mobs stacking up somewhere in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It only happened in Murkglider expidition, when a 69 or 70 obtained the instance.  In the &quot;pool&quot; room on one side was a spot where Dragorn could spawn, and it continued to respawn (either him or PH) every few minutes whether it was killed or not.<br />
<br />
In any case, the patch to the instanced zones fixed not only runes dropping for lower level expiditions (to prevent farming with 65+) it also fixed this spawn point.<br />
<br />
BUT, that doesn't mean you couldn't have a cleric IVU to the back of the zone, root a solo mob, re-IVU, wait for root to break, and book it back to zone a few steps ahead of all the chain aggro mobs. DI and warrior steps up....  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is the warrior slowed?<br />
<br />
<br />
So when you click the rampage button, you havem ore chance to proc.<br />
<br />
Let's make a weapon up, XXII. It has a 500DDAE proc.<br />
XXII has 100 Delay (10 seconds per swing) without haste. The person has 3PPM. Since you swing 6 times in a minute, there is a 50% chance to proc each swing (Because you have 3 procs per minute, and only swing 6 times, 3/6) Now let's try rampaging! You pull 100 mobs and click rampage, without haste or slow. Since you have a 50% procrate, you'll on average proc on 50 of those. 50x50 = 25kae, grats!<br />
<br />
Now, let's rez you up. Rez effects is a 95% slow.<br />
Without haste, that'd be 100 delay times 1.95 (The amount you're slowed, 95%), which brings us to realistic speed of 195 delay, or 19.5 seconds per swing. 19.5 x 3ppm = 58.5/60 = 97.5% chance to proc. Now, you pull 100 mobs again. You gather them up and click rampage - You have a 97.5% procrate, 500x97(roundeddown)= 48.5kAE<br />
<br />
That, my friend, is why slow owns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*cought**coughcough*<br />
<br />
well in essence I agree, but ...<br />
round_per_minute = delay / (1+Haste)<br />
indeed, you cann be hasted above 100%, there is no 100% slow in the game, being 100% hasted means you have twice has much round per minute, and being fully slowed (100%) would mean that you don't swing at all. thus the formula above.<br />
<br />
so a 100DL weapon at 95% slow end with a round of 200 secondes.<br />
with the earthskaker, 70DL, with around 2.5 swings per round (double, triple, flurry, ...), and with WA5 and CE0 we end up at 100% chance to proc per swing (actually at 2.5 swing per minute you need 86% slow to reach the 100% proc chance).<br />
<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />

Well the earthshaker doesn't drop anymore. ( as far as I know ) <br />
<br />
So you need to find one for sale .. after this tactic became common knowledge, ( curses ) The price on ES went from 12k ish to 130k or so on my server anyway.<br />
