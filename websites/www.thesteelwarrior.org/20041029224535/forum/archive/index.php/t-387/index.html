<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Briq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">blazz downed easily on our first try.  Kept tank up for 66% of the fight.  He doesn't hit for 5.7k anymore, 3kish now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wait...<br />
<br />
They upped him from 3500ish to 5700 and then to 3000?<br />
<br />
That SUCKS! I've been looking forward to a 5700 hitting boss, omg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as i know they didnt do anything to his melee, hes always hit for 3-3.5k. I remember hearing people talking about 5700 right after they beefed up the fire minis, but Im pretty sure it was just that, talk, he was his good ol' normal self melee wise when we hit him a day or so after that patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually I love the change to Blazzax, makes the fight a lot more like the old Trak kills. Of course raid MGB heals do make a huge amount of difference, but the last three times we've killed Blazz we lost 3 people total with average of 50 on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kimo_Sabbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Blazz is actually easier than everyone says he is. Our guild finally decided to attempt him expecting something godly we were surprised he dropped pretty fast and with few deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He was more challenging when his ae had limited range and you did your best to let the casters avoid it. We used to use the &quot;you go up there and let it hit you, Miss Warrior while we all shoot arrows at it&quot; technique.<br />
<br />
Now that theres no way to get away from the ae, we just send in most  melee and apply a healthy beatdown to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Old blazaax = HARD (had to keep him perfectly potioned)<br />
NO fucking way you could outheal him.<br />

New blazaax = Gimp kill me before your OOM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well hehe... we tried him for the first time last night (one try only). we had a good strat which would have worked IF ONLY MY AE TAUNT HAD WORKED after first MT went down at 40%-ish &quot;#¤!&quot;#&quot;%¤. so there was me swinging away in defensive with BoW and not procing, of course, until there were 3 clerics left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so there was me swinging away in defensive with BoW and not procing, of course,<br />
<br />
/cough<br />
<br />
Heh. <br />
<br />
Here's the big hint for Blazzax. We're 3/3 on him now: <br />
<br />
Druid rotation on the MT, clerics spread out in group hitting group heals ONLY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">we were doing fine mana wise with 9 clerics.<br />
<br />
oh yeah forgot to mention:<br />
<br />
another tank who was lower in tank rotation tried to grab aggro to hit /disc furious too, but couldn't.. and he was using BF + BoC.<br />
<br />
low HP aggro &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">another tank who was lower in tank rotation tried to grab aggro to hit /disc furious too, but couldn't.. and he was using BF + BoC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AET. <br />
<br />
And yes, LHA beats everything. That goes without saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We could not make AE taunt work on blazzax for whatever reason. We were not levi'd or unshrunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've heard about AET failing on FenninRo too. Might have to do with the mob's center being much higher in the air than ground level. I would levitate warriors and run 'em off a surrounding hill or the bridge first to see if that improves the hit ratio of AET. I bet it would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Whenever ae taunt doesnt work cause of heigh you dont get a &quot;You taunt Suchandsuch to ignore others and attack you&quot; message. <br />
<br />
On fennin, I always got a message but it never worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>vova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sounds like the developers have sneakily nerfed AE Taunt for some encounters. Remember slow mitigation? There used to be NO CONFIRMATION that slow had not hit for a full 75% -- in essence they fed players incorrect textual feedback. I wouldn't put it past them doing this again with AET.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sneakily nerf? What rock have you been living under? This has been a known problem since the AoW first started dying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">fulorian he is refering to the post saying on fennin AE taunt gives you the msg that the taunt landed, but it has no effect on fennin.  As in that same post its stating what you are saying that some mobs the taunt doesnt reach due to the z-axis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">pretty sure ae taunt works on fenin - we've had 1 tank go down, had another run to him &amp; grab agro before he went &amp; whacked the clerics/nukers so i'm assuming it worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">rofl whoever started the rumor that blazzax hits for 5700 should go kill himself.  His melee is exactly the same as it was before they upgraded fire mobs.  To top it off blaz has shit for attack and tends to land a lot of 462s or whatever his min it is.  He is actually a lot easier than he was before they upgraded him because you can melee him.  mass group sotw/paragon/elixers are more than enough to heal 2k dmg every 30 seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">hah blazzrax scared the shit outa me cause everyone talked about how hard he is...<br />
<br />
after a babxonis win (most mgbs down) we decide to try him....<br />
<br />
got him to 10%...<br />
<br />
Try again and hes owned...<br />
<br />
most overrated mini <br />
<br />
Reparm &gt;&gt;&gt; Blazzrax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've gotten area taunt to work on Fennin.  In fact, because I have, my guild has never corner tanked him.  I would get lev, get ogre illusion, and avoid getting on Fennin's aggro list so I could stand under him.  Then I would watch for the tank to die, taunt, disc, and take over.  A few times I manged to do it quickly enough that no one else died.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, it has always been unreliable.  It has not worked on our last few Fennin kills either.  I'm beginning to think that it might not work anymore, so I am advocating cornering him now (suck it, rangers)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Reparm &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all elemental mobs (even Fenin Ro)<br />
Even with 15 clerics, you will die, its just a matter of time (luck actually)<br />
<br />
To kill blazaax you need either a lot of healers or a couple of MGB<br />
Or like a LOT of DPS<br />
<br />
Btw Wise &gt;&gt; Blazaax for me , the UNDERWATER+AE stun+rampage just SUCK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">reparm is bad just because the proc is random and can go off up to 3 times per round.  most important thing with him is to get him slowed, crippled and weakened asap and pray di goes off.  I resist maybe 5% of his proc with 500 fr fyi.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Thats what I just said. The Z-Axis problem has been known about ever since they put the friggin AE taunt skill in to start with, on the AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Wrong.<br />
<br />
They changed it, so that the Z-Axis did NOT effect Ae-taunt. When Ae taunt was first implemented, if you AE taunted in Ssra, watch out for massive trains. . .  You would train the whole upper/lower floor on yourself.<br />
<br />
The inability to ae taunt mobs too high above you was intentional; but the effect it's having now, with larger NPC models, was not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">well ae taunt worked on him today with no shrink + levitate. <br />
<br />
(on a side note, i had no aggro issues tanking him from 90% to 0% with BoW.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Iksar_Overlord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">AE taunt works fine on Blazz, but I've been missing Quavonis Firetail with it.. He's higher than the rest of the birds. Anyone else having this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">ae taunt is tuff on fire birds, we have had some success with levved tanks.<br />
<br />
aet works fine on all the rest of the fire mobs in my experience. <br />
<br />
while aet is supposed to be guaranteed, i have seen it fail occaisonally. discovering WHY is failed is very difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kromagnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Best way I have found to tank bird models is to look straight up in the air.  Stand under thier feet while they are in the air.  Wait until they dive to hit AT or taunt.  Works every time.<br />
<br />
I have not tested this on Quavonis specifically, since we don't really do a standard MT thing on him due to the shadowstep.<br />
<br />
As far as AT missing, I hear about it a lot, but I don't think I have ever had it happen to me, even double shrunk.  I try to get as close to the mob's geometric center as possible before popping AT, and I really can't remember any particular time it has failed to work, except maybe on a bird that I mistimed the dive on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">tanking the 3 birds is all about being familiar with the area and knowing where your clerics are, because 9 out of 10 times your looking up in the air.<br />
