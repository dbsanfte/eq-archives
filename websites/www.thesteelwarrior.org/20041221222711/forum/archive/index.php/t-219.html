<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I asked once before and got some really good information on gear upgrades, so once again I come to you all for some help. I am in a small guild that isn't going to get flagged anytime soon and need some help so I can do my Job better.<br />
I find some nights I can hold agro with no issues, other nights I can't buy agro. The worst part is I am usually with the same group all the time.<br />
Currently I am at level 54 and working hard to get to 55, once there I am going 100% AA for a bit until I have a few of those bagged and ready to help out. Now for the big question, My Magelo has all my weapons I own in the Rallic Pack. What do I do, I have no cash cow roaming around to help me out and usually only have 2 -3 k in the bank I know I need gear and I know I need weapons, Please help a warrior to be the best he can be to help his guild.<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well just a few small suggestions.<br />
<br />
Helm replace with Raldukan helm maybe or Velious quest helm.<br />
<br />
Earrings I would replace 1 with Earring of the Solstice, very nice hp and other stats for the money (buy everything to make it for about 3-6k) or Black Saphire Electrum earring (not sure on cost, I would think cheap but 35hp on it)<br />
<br />
Mask replace with Death Mask of the Elysians (4-6k) decent stats<br />
Necklace replace with Clattering Bone Necklace (not sure price, should be cheap)<br />
<br />
Replace Cloak with anything  HP, Ancient Sea Horse Hide cloak is pretty cheap 1k or so. Heiro Cloak 75hp about 15k, Malestrom cloak about 5kish<br />
<br />
Weapons maybe a frostbringer but not needed that much there.<br />
<br />
Overall at 54 you are not doing bad, much better than I was for sure. Like I said shoot for every slot to have some +hp stat on it, no matter how small it may be it adds up.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try switching out for a more damaging weapon combo.  Maybe try Snowchipper/Club of the Ice Ocean.  I've never had a barnacle axe, but that seems a bit weak if you happen to miss out on procs.<br />
<br />
Look into cheaper things like crystal spider eyes, glimmering mithril torque, coterie general cape, another orc fang earring.  But mostly just start saving to upgrade your haste.  Sell off the weapons you're not going to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what ive heard the barnacle axe is nothign special aggro wise. I would sell it and pick up a frosty. Although i see you have a club of the ice ocean that should work well with the snowchipper aggro wise.<br />
<br />
I would sell the rest of your weapons and aim to pick up a decent 2 hander with a ratio of 1 or thereabouts.<br />
<br />
theres quite a few good ones out there these days. pity your piercing is so bad, otherwise i would say get a narandi's lance as they are good value for money and hold aggro pretty well.<br />
<br />
from here on in, i wouldnt spend bits and pieces on upgrades. save up and get a good upgrade for each slot till everything is well kitted out. for starters you need to ditch the crusty. the ancient seahorse hide cloak is also a good bet. id aim to get your ac up to around 1100 if possible.<br />
<br />
if your CoV faction is good, do the Bracers of benevolence quest, they willl get you 2 good bracers that you can use for a long time.<br />
<br />
Eventually youll have to ditch the SCHWs. Theres a lot of decent gloves that you can be using in their place. Id look to pick up a haste belt at some stage.<br />
<br />
Also, earrings once, save up for a solstice earring, they are about 5k and good value for money.<br />
<br />
BP wise id get in on some PoG raids or Kael raids and try and score a drop. Othewise, save up for one of the cultural ones. I know ur agnostic but i think you can use the rigid steelweave stuff. You can also pick up some of that for other parts of your body.<br />
<br />
Radulkan helm as someone said is a good upgrade. I see you hafe some moktor so stick out hunting in UP for a bit and hopefully you can score one.<br />
<br />
I know making money is hard for a warrior but its not impossible by any means. If you guild can manage, camp out OS for a few weeks. Try and get in the crypt if you can and you will start to see the money come in.<br />
<br />
Re aaxp, its been said before and ill say it again, levels beats aaxp, at least through the 50s. Dont forget, if you face mobs as a MA and they con higher to you, which you will do if you go to PoP, then taunt just wont work. So id get to 60 or 61 before you start doing aaxp. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kebilal</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have 2-3 k NOW:<br />
<br />
Get a Glimmering Mithril Torque (ac15) for neck<br />
Seriously think about wearing the cobalt vambs, or selling them and your crusty arms and buying Crystal Chitin Arms (I still use CC arms at 62!)<br />
Grab Crystal Eyes for face.<br />
<br />
Lose the BCA - 9/21 vs PoP mobs is a joke - earlier posters' advice about Snowchipper/Club of Ice Ocean is very sound.<br />
<br />
Save plat for a Frosty, and if your guild can take a Kunark dragon, look to get a haste belt - kunark dragons are easy kills, and you can fond info on their spawn times here. (think its under The Battlefield)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a few quest suggestions:<br />
-Draconic Pauldrons<br />
-Bracer of Benevolence x 2<br />
-Praetor Blade of Debility (not much for DPS but damn good taunt)<br />
-Earring of the Solstice<br />
<br />
Other gear:<br />
-RBG or SBC -- take some friends to Seb for fun, pp, and exp and hope one drops<br />
-take some friends to CT and camp a heavy rubicite girdle and mosquito leg earring or two.  exp there rivals the planes also.<br />
-frostbringer -- frostbringer + debility blade is some beautiful taunt<br />
-clattering bone necklace<br />
-vah shir claw earring<br />
-crystal spider eyes (or if you have a lot of time Eyepatch of Plunder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sakryn</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to say thank you to all of you that took the time to offer advice... I can say for sure that the list has been printed out <br />
and I am currently getting my piercing up to max... takes a bit but a week of not MA'ing anything or letting the agro roll around a little in groups for friends should have that maxed out easily enough.<br />
Again Thank you all.<br />
