<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I'm tanking Babnooxis, lose aggro, hit AETaunt to get it back, and AEtaunt fails. I blink, go WTF? <br />
<br />
Next tank up hits AETaunt to get aggro, and it fails for HIM, too. So, I'm pretty sure Babnoxis is untauntable. Can't be just me if TWO AeTaunts by two different people fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ur playing on test?<br />
<br />
you prolly had many ppl on low hp agro from dot ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Babs Taunts fine,if AE Taunt missed altogether like it didn't even give a taunt message it is becasue you were oor ,or to far below the mobs center.<br />
<br />
Lev is a good idea in fire or any area of the game with large mobs really but very usefull in fire agaisnt the birds and fiends,.<br />
<br />
If you got a succesful taunt message ,like as was stated above even a succesful AE Taunt will lose aggro rigth away if someone gets low health aggro all of a sudden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xocin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As of late AE taunt has been unreliable for a lot of warriors I know, Babs is definately tauntable, just AE taunt I think is broken atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, it's not Babs, it's AE taunt, I've seen it land several times on various mobs in the last couple weeks and ... no aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On a mob with a dot like babs my guess would be low health agro would be the problem as someone suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">one thing you need to watch in fire with ae taunt is Z axis.  Especially if you are puling her to birds and are on the hill ect, ae taunt can completely miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had the same thing happen on Tantisala in Eartha, AE taunt did nothing for 3 seperate warriors, although we've experienced some funky aggro with earth named in general nothing has had ae taunt fail outright that badly before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get lev when tanking large stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AE Taunt has been unreliable for the last month or so, even for exp groups. Cost some people their &quot;lives&quot; when couple come into camp and AE Taunt failed.Standing right next to 2 mobs and AE Taunt should work.<br />
I havent had a problem with it for the last week and a half though so not sure if its been fixed or its just a random glitch and Ive been lucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah... I know my AE taunt landed. I saw the text message.<br />
Dunno about the other guy.<br />
<br />
Guess AETaunt is just loopy.<br />
<br />
As for low health aggro... what usually happens with that for me is it briefly pays attention to me, for like a tenth of a second, then goes back to beating on the low health guy. which makes sense for how it's supposed to work.... this time, I didn't get its attention at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sargeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think what it is is AE Taunt has no Z-axis usability, or very low. Front and back, left and right... yes, but not up and down. I can't even tank Quav, Jax, or Craire with a successful AE Taunt unless I'm lev'd or up on the hill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">that's more an issue of AE taunt not landing than of something going crazy, I think.  I've been in situations where AE taunt just completely misses (based on z axis, I'd assume)...if you get the taunt message, it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bohkah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Low health aggro is my vote.  Can't beat that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Area taunt has worked perfectly fine for me since I got it long ago except a couple of times on large dragon type mobs with strange center areas that are hard to guess at where they are sometimes. Never had it fail on anything in fire. Worked just fine on Offossa the other night when I taunted off a weaponshielding ranger. If somebody has low health, there's not much you can do but pray they get a heal and you have agro immediately there after. I wouldn't say area taunt failed in this instance however. Area taunt early and often! Especially after getting the reuse down to 10 minutes 30 seconds :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">AE taunt has definately not been working right lately. I had it ignored yesterday on an LDoN advenure.<br />
<br />
Timeline went like this: Enchanter died, cleric group healed, I AE taunted and both mobs were snagged, cleric died.<br />
<br />
The cleric in no way had low health aggro at the time I taunted nor did she cast any other heals right after. AE taunt is just fucking broke or it was stealth nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>goobayouface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ws on offassaa is lol<br />
wish we had anywhere near enough rangers for stuff like that ;/<br />
only things i can think of we use ws every time are xegony, reparm, and the last miniboss guy in poeb<br />
wtb more rangers<br />
<br />
but on topic, ae taunt seems to fail me at completely random times and will work one day and fail the next in identical situations<br />
i could just suck though ;0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haramdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shrink can be an issue - sometimes mobs in Time will ignore your ae if you aren't shrunk the exact size.  Like I've noticed ae to fail on Rallos before because of double shrink.  As people said, tanking in a place like Fire, unshrunk and levitate is your best plan - but any mob who gets jerked around while you're ae'ing will probably cause you to miss.  I really haven't seen any other problems with ae, but I haven't tanked an elemental mob in ages.  Guess over the holidays I'll try stuff out - if there's a problem with it I wouldn't be shocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kilamthorngage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">With DMF I had no problem tanking her last night. Babs is fine. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Didn't AE taunt used to have too large of a z-axis for awhile? I seem to remember that when the skill was first in the game it would aggro mobs from the second floor of Hate when used...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">normally with dual eb this isnt much of an issue. 3rd and 4th tank let the 2nd tank attack firts and kinda hang back. normally its not an issue whose going to be tanking next if you watch when you start attacking. ae taunt is super, but i wouldnt rely on it solely for tank switches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you AE taunt and your target is out of range, you won't get a message.  If you're in range, you will get a message, and you assume automatic success, yes?   However. . .with the new taunt fail messages, I have seen AE taunt &quot;FAIL&quot; just last night on a PoAir avatar.  This would explain why avatars always seem to ignore AE taunt huh?<br />
<br />
In a related topic, what is up with PoAir boss mob's aggro anyways?  Does SOE just want to make it impossible for you to have a single tank with aggro all the time, or they want to force you to just zerg or what?  When I tank them, I use an anger3 BoW and can never maintain aggro throughout, not even with 10 snare charges, and AE taunt never works.  Likewise, just last night I wasn't MTing and was using a primal 2hblunt with my skill at like 180 and I still drew aggro off another BoW warrior. . .it's just silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Some mobs like to mem blur themself..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Air avatars, Monstrous Mudwalker, A Perfected Warder of Earth, Warlord Gintolaken all mem blur. Nothing in Fire or Water blurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">dont think gintolaken memblurs, he has that ridiculous slow ae though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">He memblurs, but it's got an emote to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">n/t</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">reason I dont know if gintolaken memblurs is cause mobs that mem blur usually chew up healers at some point (poair avatars always eat a cleric or 2), where gintolaken never summons our healers or nukers + only time he might turn towards the rest of meele is a second or 2 after that ae lands generally.  I've played a mage &amp; chain nuked gintolaken for the mages entire mana pool &amp; never even been summoned.  Mobs that fer sure mem blur like air avatars, seem to really wail on nukers/healers/meele in general a lot worse, but mebbe its cause we dont corner those &amp; proximity agro plays a factor /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ginto blurs at 50% I think.I don't know why he doesn't start out on healers when this occurs but he jsut doesn't,not on any sort of frequent basis anyway.He doesn't take a really fast chain to keep a tank up so it is likely that clerics are nto getting eaten simply becasue as soon as he blurs the tank typically gets aggro again off of sheer proximity thanks to everyone being so far from him thanks to ae ramp.</div></div><hr />
