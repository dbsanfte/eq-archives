<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I am having a chat about everquest with my family and I have a ranger in the family, We got 3 copys of OoW at EBgames (I got it, so shoot me) and we opened the box and looked at the epic weapons sheet....<br />
<br />
<br />
No ranger epic on it at all..... <br />
<br />
I guess rangers got their familer (play on words there) after all, not a sparrow or a hawk.... but the fucking bird! <br />
<br />
Way to beat your step children sony *laughs* oh well.... at least he is not a bard *snickers*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When did I say you would have to drag me to the store and make me buy it?<br />
<br />
I was in the beta... sort of... I time shared an account with a friend and I liked what I saw as far as eye candy goes and the monsters were neat, I am sick of killing BoT giants so I NEED this, comprende?<br />
<br />
Granted I played a few days before it went to stores but it was still neat.</div></div><hr />

Apparantly the EQ brainwashing has taken full effect on your malleable mind.<br />
<br />
Ooh, Raaj stuck a jab in.<br />
<br />
I'm not bitter..I'm actually relieved..I've got a couple months now to take care of some things before WoW really starts, and I'm only cheating myself out of EQ playing time :)</div></div><hr />

WoW Beta Account Phase 3!! REAL, NOT STRESS  (http://search.ebay.com/wow-beta_W0QQsokeywordredirectZ1QQfromZR8) <br />
<br />
I cancelled 5 of 6 accounts today.  Thought I would leave one for my son who likes playing on the test server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the bard nerf is going to bring about a protest, and I support em...<br />
<br />
How the hell are we going to do all the PoP encounters that used bard kiting as a staple for winning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Enc charm nerf (charmed mobs do half damage) is next in the pipe.  What are gimps that use Enchanters as a crutch to get them through GoD trials gonna do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, well, the bards would like to get shakerpaging nerfed. <br />

<br />
Go fig. Seems like AE kiting has been a staple for them, but I guess SOE doesn't like it. For all I care, any solo skill can be nerfed since warriors don't get jack along those lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eh let em nerf the shaker... its just sad that they set their sights on fucking a few of my fellow warriors with one, rather than restoring their class to what it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haass, here, incase you need a fix: <br />
<br />
I don't need no fix.  Paying for a beta is beyond retarded.<br />
<br />
Besides, I gots a new truck to pay for...I don't need to be skipping out on work early and calling in to play WoW any sooner than I have to be :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have some sympathy for bards who kited in legit ways, even soloing.<br />
But if I look at the number of times that solo kiters have purposely run over me with their mobs, bards for some reason make up more than 50% of the total. A little of that is more than enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Even if charm pets in Tipt/Vxed hit for half damage, they would still be pushing 700-900dps with ease.  Currently, the only &quot;nerf&quot; charming has is that they get their dual wield ability taken away, but even that is fully reversable by simply giving them weapons.  <br />
<br />
I don't want to see enchanters, or any class, nerfed by any means, but I will not lie when I say that I do not believe having an incredibly subordinate 1500-2000dps pet is very balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so what kinda truck you get haass? myself; i've been eyeing up a Ford F350 dually that seems to be strategically placed to catch my attention every damn day home from work :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmmm...pick-em-up trucks &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Noctix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just bought a brand new F150 two days ago.  So far, I'm lovin' it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry dude<br />
<br />
Return it. I'm serious.  All of the guys at work with 2k or newer F150's spend more time with them at the shop than in their garage.  Fords right now are ranked the lowest on the consumer reports amongst all the light trucks.<br />
<br />
I'm going out right now to custom order my truck...2005 Ram 1500 4x4 Quad cab.  Thanks to my place of employment having a very excellent affiliate rewards program with Daimler Chrysler, it's gonna be mine for dirt fuckin cheap :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1967 F250.<br />
Sides are cut down and homemade iron boxes run length of both sides, welded to the truck.<br />
plastic seats, hard floor, choke knob, no radio (grandad always said, &quot;Radio? Psssst. Why should I have to think about whatever some damn dj thinks I should think about?&quot;)<br />
If it gets dirty in the cab you can just hose it out.</div></div><hr />

Old ass fords are the bomb.  In fact, I drive a 96 F150 for the time being, just so you know that I'm not biased against them.  It's just that after they changed the body style in '97 and switched to the Triton engine, the truck has just gone downhill.<br />
<br />
Your '67 and my 96 probably have nearly the exact same body and engine..and that's what makes them great :)</div></div><hr />

I checked out Chevy and Dodge, none of the local dealers could get within 100 bucks a month of the payment I got on the F150.  Besides, I've got a car too so I can deal with the truck being in the shop occasionally.  Makes me feel like I'm getting my money out of that new vehicle warranty anyway  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any warranty work you have done is simply tacked on to the next year's price of the car. ;)</div></div><hr />
