<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Too rare... did about 20 Xanamech raids with my guild and saw none.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild has probably done tink at least 40 times (it makes excellent farming for haste items and tink hammers), and I believe we have 7 or 8 hammers in guild now.</div></div><hr />

I'd say for every 5 raids you should see at least one.</div></div><hr />

3 kills. 0 Hammers. 3 Haste Items. 2 Driveshafts. 1 Ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im curious - what kind of forces are you guys taking to kill this guy nowadays - in terms of levels/ numbers/equipment.<br />
<br />
The only time i did this guy was a few months back it was a pick up raid so we had a zerg army of 72.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Futumsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We're a pre-ntov guild (mostly because Aary's so contested), and our first Xana was with 22.  I expect we can do it with 3 groups, and probably less for better-geared folks.  With him slowed and 1-2 people to keep the MT up, you mostly just need a good balance of healers to mitigate the AEs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd rate Xan with Kland, Zland, or the Wtov dragons. 3 Groups 60+ should do it without too many problems...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">cool thts pretty useful to know. We are currently pre-NToV. Just started doing vindi and about done with HoT. <br />
<br />
I may moot this to our GL to give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You get him slowed. He can be a bit much with 6k-7k tanks before that if you have a hiccup on healing or there is an issue with cheal chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've onlyt been to one all i saw was a Etheral, Weapon's Driveshaft, and Woven Shim Choker.<br />
<br />
I don't think we have ever gottena  hammer drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GlowanMcLean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Farm him until you can do the clearing for gnome escort blindfolded, then farm him some more.<br />
<br />
This is what we do when nothing else is up.  The 41 haste necks and hammers are well worth the effort.  The hammers don't drop nearly as often as the necks, though.  The good thing is that everyone wants to kill him.  There are some nice caster drops too, especially the ring.  The haste neck is great for any melee; at this point it is going to our rogues and rangers, allowing them to move past their epics.  And soon all of our tank line will have this hammer or better for taunt.  Everybody wins.<br />

Good hunting,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bogrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Our guild which is basically Ntov capable, and regularly takes down Rumblecrush, IV, and Vindi half asleep is basically 1/4 on the mech dragon.<br />
<br />
We cant manage to setup our Ch rot since the stupid dragon does ae stun and kills the CH rot so we rely on fast heals on me as MA.  Im typically running 7900-8100hp buffed  and i always end up dying at 50%.. i guess thats when slow hits or when the other healers pays little attention to me and saves thier skin due to ae.  Our other tanks then pick up where I left off, and we usually run about a 30-40 peeps raid for this event.  Our only win we managed to barely survive, the rest we wipe at around 2-10% of mech dragon life.<br />
<br />
Anyways i figure with ch rot team being established this would go alot easier.. how do you guys do it successfully? and with even only 3 groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Last few times I did it, we used a Supernal Remedy Rotation, with a cleric outside the rotation keeping a constant Supernal Elixir on the MT. Seemed to work well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow...can't believe you're having that much problem with him (not looking down at you, we're not an uber guild). With tank at his back, once spawned  we debuff asap and slow - within the first 10 seconds. After that, its really a quick encounter.<br />
<br />
If need be, you can AE taunt so long as chanter blurrs the little fella.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fvighlander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you're not getting him slowed until 50%, something is going rather wrong... Other than that, maybe you just need an extra 2-3 clerics to keep up the heals since a CH chain is not an option against xana with his stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm...we use a CH rotation on our MT...I can't say we've ever lost an MT to stuns. I thought xan's AE was oilspray...snare, but no stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He's got three AE's if I recall. Stun, Snare, and straight DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah there are 3 aoes that he casts.<br />
<br />
Ok here is some details, after looking at one of my logs for xena about his stun aoe.<br />
<br />
It seemed to come in cycles of 3. so once you got one stun 2 more always followed.<br />
The 3 stun cycle was 3 seconds apart on each one of the stuns, and from looking at the time I was stunned, it was ~1 second stun.<br />
<br />
Just spam heal the tank with supernal heals an such, will be easier then with a ch chain. The time between the 3-stun chain is random from what I can tell<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
