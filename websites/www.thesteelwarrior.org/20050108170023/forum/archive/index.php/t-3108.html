<br />
i'm only lvl 54 (just dinged lastnight now want to get AA for regen 3:P )and abit under equiped so won't be MT but sure as hell wanna know what i can do other than bring bandages, donuts and coffee:P   (MMM donuts and coffee /drool)<br />
<br />
any help would be VERY much appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
RESIST GEAR.  You're too young right now that you can't get by w/o it.  You're not gonna be able to sit in the AE and just get by with high hp alone.  So invest in some resist gear (if you're a large race, get a stone of morrid) and you should be fine.<br />
<br />
Also bring some patience.  If it's your first time, you're gonna die.  Period.  Monks going to over pull, someone's going to be too close/curious and bring the train in.  Someone's going to get too close to the door that is KoS, or someone's going to be a dumb ass and open the door.  Don't worry... we've all been there, it's your turn.<br />
<br />
Other than that, enjoy the fact that plate drops basically 5 to 1 there, so you should gear out pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60 before aa, then run 3  then 65 and back to aa. The regen from aa is so minimal that it's not worth holding yourself at a lower level for it. <br />
<br />
HoT is pretty easy if you've done things like Kael arena. When you zone in, go through the door into a hallway with a lot of drakes, there's another door, go through it and head off to your right, antother door, open it, you're in HoT.<br />
<br />
Note, if you're KoS to Dragons it's going to be extremely hard to get to HoT without a CotH mage, and even then, it's not exactly the safest and may cause the drakes on Dragon faction to come in and burninate the person with the offending faction, and then usually the rest of the raid for assisting the dragon hater of the guild.<br />
<br />
Also, if you need to have bodies dragged, you need a monk or a SoS rogue drag them because from what I understand dragging bodies aggros drakes as well. Can't remember why however.<br />
<br />
Oh and the last door after entering MUST be closed at all times when pulling HoT because again, the drakes will get angry and start killing everyone.<br />
<br />
Final note - don't piss the drakes off, they can and -will- kill you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me say again, dont worry about AA yet.  You receive greater benefit by simply gaining levels at this point.  Yeah there are a couple nice AA's out there but levels do you more good for now.<br />
<br />
Since you are not going to MT for this raid, my suggestion would be to listen and learn from your MT and raid leader.  Provide some damage to mobs, making sure not to agro, as your healers are going to have a tough enough time keeping up with AoE damage.  Bring your resist gear, fire, cold, mr, its all here and at your level is it a must.  <br />
<br />
Lastly I will say this is one of the first zones were you can watch the power of your guild and yourself grow with levels.  What may seem nearly impossible at this level and requires a raid will quickly become almost trivial and require only a group or two.<br />
<br />
Have fun, enjoy the zone, and dont drag corpses!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danca</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha ya never /consent anyone but a monk or necro.<br />
<br />
Also, this is one of the first raid zones you get to where the range you can hit the mob from with melee is way huge.  Just keep that in mind, because it is one of those things that people still don't seem to understand at level 65 raiding PoP bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barja Bardagi</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get level 60, get Run 3 somewhere along the way, get level 65, THEN AA your heart out.  (Gee, are we seeing a theme here yet? :D )<br />
<br />
As for HoT itself, I'm going to repeat what others have said because folks learn from repetition....<br />
<br />
1.  Don't drag corpses unless you can lie on the ground.<br />
<br />
2.  Keep the door CLOSED.<br />
<br />
3.  Resist Gear - 100 unbuffed minimum in F/C/Mg.  Try for 100 in Poi/Dis if you can.<br />
<br />
4. Attack from the maximum edge of range before you get the 'You are too far away&quot; message.<br />
<br />
5.  Don't drag corpses unless you can lie on the ground.<br />
<br />
6.  Keep the door CLOSED.<br />
<br />
7.  Expect to die.  It will happen.  Expect to die again.  It will happen.<br />
<br />
8.  LISTEN!!!!<br />
<br />
9.  Breaking the pit is the worst part.  From there, it gets easier.<br />
<br />
And my general rule for ANY raid...<br />
<br />
10.  Know what to expect -<br />
      Someone will get experience on the raid.  This will not be you.<br />
      Someone will get loot on the raid.  This will not be you.<br />
      Someone is going to die on the raid.  This will be you.<br />
Go in with those expectations... Knowing that you are gearing up and empowering your guild.  You are there to make them stronger, to better them, even if you are not gaining strength yourself.  And when you finally do get your drop, you will savor it that much more because it was earned with the blood and sweat of your guild at your side.  And they still be standing beside you with their drop just the same, savoring it all the more because you helped them earn it.<br />
<br />
(Dear god, am I getting cheezy these days or WHAT?!?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulic</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info everyone. My guild is small but we have some good people and were planning on doing HoT soon. I'll be MTing so it's nice to read the warrior perspecitve.<br />
<br />
Question: Would it be worth it to wait until 65 to go to HoT? I know you'd probably resist a lot more at 65, but I don't want to wait forever to get geared up. My server has a LOT of warriors that have been playing 3+ years and when I join a PoP group they usually say something like &quot;What, no BoC?&quot;. Would like to be a GOOD level 65 warrior instead of just another number. I am currently two yellow from 60. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 60 warrior can MT HoT just fine. I tanked there earlier than that, but it rapidly gets a lot harder the lower you go. Levels really do matter, but you certainly shouldn't wait until 65 to go to HoT. Go now. HoT can be tough, but it can also be a great experience for a guild. Definitely a rite of passage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnidream</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry about it, grab 60, get run 3, then to 65. HoT can be done at your level though. I tanked there at like 55 I think, just look at the posts and remember..<br />
<br />
-don't drag corpses unless you can lie down-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd just add that the stuff about the door is unnecessary, imo. I just wouldn't bring KoS people at all -- make them earn their faction to go on the raid. If you have to have KoS people, make sure they keep away from the door. <br />
<br />
You really would like a good slower. On gating mobs you'll need people who can seive mana and especially a coordinated melee push. Positioning becomes a big deal in ToV. You want to keep mobs stable at the beginning, to keep them away from the casters (keep casters around the corner from the mobs to avoid the AE), and pushing into some furniture can be really bad. But when it comes time, every melee needs to hop to the same side to interrupt the gate. <br />
<br />
Avoiding the AE is pretty important. If the mob can be hailed with his name appearing, generally speaking his ae will get you. Casters need to monitor where the mob is and be responsible for finding the corner away from the AE, though the melees need to be smart and not push mobs into casters. <br />
<br />
HoT mobs will aggro anyone who drags, so you can only drag while FD, so only monks, sks, necros, and sos rogues can CR. Someone needs to get a HoT map, preferably one with spawn points listed. <br />
<br />
Breaking the pit is the hardest part I think. Generally you can seperate them by creeping someone forward and sitting along the far edge of the wall approaching the pit. Hopefully you'll find the point at which one aggros but not the other. Make sure there's no pit roamer when you do that. A small person sitting face against the wall under the tapestry facing the pit can actually see through the wall into the pit and give warning about roamers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. We were exactly 18 persons, all Ally to CoV, fighting behind the door the two spawns under the stairs, someone opened the door = bad idea. The drakes outside that con ally to you, will assist the kos wurms you are fighting inside.<br />
<br />
The first time I was there, we thought that pulling to entrance was better... till we died many times due to gaters. I would recommend moving and fighting gaters on their spawn spot to avoid your MT to get summoned and slaughtered (Thats me! :p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is on topic enough...a couple fo questions about HoT. We've been there 2 Saturdays in a row now. <br />
<br />
We have been doing the left door, which I was told was the easiest. All raiders have to be non-KOS to come. I thought I remembered reading that in HoT you wanted to have the dragon beating on the MT (me) in a corner and rest of melee behind it, and casters around a corner. I'm having trouble with the big dragons getting them to the corner because they have such a huge attack range. Can I have the puller run and stand next to the door, not opening it to get the dragon where I want it before taunting and getting agro? Also the cornering thing has worked great...until the mob is pushed so fat that I cannot see it anymore. Is that normal? I'm losing agro because I'm no longer damaging it and everyone else is. We have rarely even had a death because of it, but it's still sticking in my craw and I'm not sure what to do other than move to a position I can hit it at and attack again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ealsur, what you're seeing is simply proximity assist aggro. Fight drakes further away from drake mobs, since drakes will assist drakes, even of different factions. The door is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant is this. On one side of the door, there are non KOS mobs on CoV faction, named mobs and drakes. On the other side, your raid fighting KOS mobs. You can even get to the door, fighting the wurms, and if the door is closed (thats as far close to the CoV drakes you can get) you wont agro the drakes. If you move away from door, say 10 feet, and open door, the CoV drakes and nameds WILL assist the wurms you are fighting inside HoT, that are on different faction. Thats why, the door MUST be closed. Next time you go there, pull a wurm from the stairs, start fighting it upstairs, and open the door, it will prove my point :p<br />
<br />
Abividad, I had the same problem, there are pots on the corners and when I tried to get em cornered, their range is just too big, so I did this: I engaged em when they stopped coming, made the puller and only the puller (a monk) start to hit its ass, pushing starts to the pot, call assist, rest of meele will push it to the pot. But I found the corners a bad place, somehow nukers couldnt land sometimes (cause of the wall maybe). I would, on the other hand, move instead of camping the entrance, clear the first 2 mobs (and a roamer I think) and start moving, make your puller go ahead and check, and you keep moving, its easier to fight gating mobs if they are on the spawning spot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tug youre wrong. Opening the door will raise the range of aggro in there.<br />
<br />
You should not fight the first mobs near the door but opening the door while fighting a mob enough far away will bring the allys to assist for killing the casters and healers near the door and then jump further in to kill the melees too. Its not the aggro range from the mob to the mob but the aggro range from the healers and nukers to the allys. The door is closed .. its ok. The door is opened .... they're dead. Quite easy and simple. In the time we were in HoT ( or NToV while others were in Hot ) lots of Guilds were killed there cause a dumbass opened the door the wrong time or - if he was from one of these &quot; nice guilds&quot; - opened it right in time for having the others whipe and finding a fine free place for the own guild.<br />
<br />
And forget cornering there its not really usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last Saturday we were fighting a wurm near the left firepot just inside the door.  Someone who was KoS got agro throught the door and the chickens stormed in, killed anyone who was KoS, and then left.  We finished off the wurm.  I'm guessing they only care if you are killing another chicken (drake).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI  crawl in hot dont camp the door.  Inside hot away from the door you CAN drag corpses and if you fight mobs at spawn point you dont have to worry about gaters.  Just about every time I have wiped in hot was from a gater.  You can hot key &quot;GET ON MY SIDE AND PUSH&quot; all ya want and spam the hell out it and there are still some fools that wont move.<br />
<br />
   If you do fight at first door dont have KOS with you or you WILL DIE and prob more then once, if you have KOS crawl and COH past 2nd door.   When camping first door DONT corner white mobs unless you want a free trip to the center of HOT to meet the mobs friends.   When the mobs gate camp or gate out, have your casters bind just outside tov, gate is a lot faster then camp.   NEVER let casters sit within 3 sqs of the stairs, it argos the pit mobs.  Before you enter HOT ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS  shout is HOT CLEAR? or is HOT HOT? NEVER NEVER NEVER rush into hot.<br />
<br />
   I started MTing in hot 10 lvls ago with a chain tunic and found some of the mobs I could not tank without def they would tear the crap out of me, when you see a two leg'd mob get ready for some HURT (not all but some of em).  With two in a row it helped a lot to have a druid in the mt's group to work with the cleric, saved my life many times.  Its funny now I can off tank adds for some time without healing.<br />

forgot one thing as a bargie I can get stuck behind the damn pots while moving with the mob that the melee type push all over the damn place cause they wont listen, someone in group has to have a shrink ready to get you out.</div></div><hr />

I figured I'd throw in my thoughts on HoT as I have a semi-different perspective vs most people that have already posted.<br />
<br />
First and most important, visit <br />
http://www.geocities.com/waldi_waldmeister/<br />
<br />
This is a decent guide to HoT and I found it very useful.  Next, a little info on how I've done HoT.  I 6 box and first visited HoT when I was barely over 60 (war/enc/clr/dru/nec/56 mnk).  I found at 60 that my warrior could proximity aggro a single guardian at the initial 'pit'.  Over time, I've found that a monk is not required to pull a lot of the area (there are some areas that a monk would greatly help, but I simply avoid them).  I dumped the monk in favor of a 60 mage.  At level 60, 6 boxing, I found it very very hard to even do the entrance mobs.  I had basically full thurgadin armor from all my Kael time so I was ~5k hitpoints.  I had to go defensive on the fights due to their damage output and not wanting to get my enc smoked.<br />
<br />
I leveled up and came back at 65.  I can very easily do HoT, now that I understand some of the spawns and how things work.  Between the mage damageshield, druid protection of seasons and enchanter magic protection spells, my resists are 240fr/200cr/200mr which prove plenty high (coupled with my level) to resist the dragon AoEs.  Pay close attention to positioning as that is the key in this dungeon.  ALWAYS postion your casters around a wall, even a corner, so that they avoid the aoe and only take dmg when they move out to cast on the mobs.  ALWAYS push the dragons into some sort of corner to keep them pegged and from moving around.  Having only 6 ppl, basically 1 melee and 3 pets results in my pushing of mobs not stopping gate reliably.  However, I have my enchanter focus solely on mana tapping...  the torment series of spells are you friend, they are quite simply &gt; HoT dragons.  One enchanter can easily keep any caster in HoT from casting gate, simply by keeping their mana tap dots on the mob throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
Finding where to place casters is easy if you pay attention to the map on that webpage.  Keep that concept with you and apply it throughout the dungeon and you'll do great!  Keep in mind that if pets are setup to hit a mob through a wall, they do not take AoE damage either ;)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that red dragons are pure melee, white are casters.  I'll let you figure out the drakes, they're fun to play around with.<br />
<br />
Some additional tips to get you past the first pit, from there you should find everything else easy to figure out.  In the pit are always two dragons, at 60 &amp; 65 I could single pull by arrow OR by creeping along the farthest wall from the other pit mob and proximity aggro.  There are two roamers shown on the map, they roam THROUGH the pit.  They are roughly 10-15 minutes on their passby on the pit.  So, once you see one of them, you'll see the next roamer in roughly 10-15minutes.  Eventually, they can both end up roaming through the pit at the same time, so simply keep tabs on them.  The roamers are always wyverns/racnars.  They are never dragons (dragons cannot fit through doorways well, keep that in mind)  I don't think I've ever seen a drake as a roamer through the pit, but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Here's a brief rundown on how I do HoT:<br />
<br />
1)  Put casters on left side of wall (as I'm facing pit).<br />
   a)  Pull right mob and push into right corner at pot.<br />
2)  Put casters on right side of wall<br />
   a)  Pull left mob and push into left corner at pot.<br />
3)  Wait for a roamer.  If roamer comes from right side, wait until the door closes as there is sometimes another roamer there that will aggro.   Pull this roamer up to left side of entrance.<br />
4)  Wait for the final roamer.  I typically pull him to left side.<br />
5)  Drop into pit and head left.  I go left because I feel it is the easier side, all single pulls for me.<br />
   a)  Pull dragon at end of hallway, you can see him.  I fight him in the little crook near the doorway (pot there) and keep casters inside of the door.<br />
   b)  Pull dragon in the first door on the left.  I push him into the corner near the door, sometimes he can be pulled through the door btu usually he gets stuck and resets, so I simply push him into the corner at the door.  Keep casters outside of door and just open it to nuke him.  SOMETIMES the next mob will aggro on pulling this dragon, I've had it happen twice, no idea why.  So be prepared for that.<br />
   c)  Now, go through this first door and take your first left.  There is drake there.<br />
   d)  Now keep to the left and go around the bend, you'll find a wyvern/racnar type.<br />
   e)  To the right of this spawn is a dragon in the hallway, not the one straight ahead, but to your right.  He is basically at teh 2nd door in the first hallway.  I pull him and fight him up against the wall and place the casters in the U shaped portion so they avoid AoE.<br />
   f)  You're on your own.  Good luck and enjoy, this gets ya started.<br />
<br />
Final tip...   I'm heavily reliant on pets for melee dmg, so, DO NOT have pets up when pulling dragons.  Their aoe causes the pets to aggro even if casters do not take a hit... the range is huge.  Now, you have pets bashing the mob and it makes positioning it very very hard.  Recalling the pets is also hard, due to the aoe going off a lot.  The aoe also rips pets apart, so it is best to summon them during the fight if you require their added dps.  I go through great pain to keep them behind a wall.  I always have pets up for racnar/wyvern/drakes as their pushovers in comparison to the dragons and positioning is not a big deal with them.<br />
<br />
To give you the carrot...  plate drops are amazing.  I've gotten 3 full sets of plate plus 3 more sets of gauntlets/arms/bracers in the same time it took me to get 1 complete cloth/4 gauntlets/arms/bracers/boots and 2 helms/1 bracer/2 legs/1 hands/2 boots in leather.  I spent roughly 2 weeks there of moderate raiding to get this.  I found that making it a certain distance in, then succor'ing out to redo my way in was the best bet for me, but I'm only one group.  Also, not being kos to CoV is a good thing as it makes CRs much much easier.  Doing the mage coth is so very painful and time consuming.<br />
<br />
Good luck and happy journeys</div></div><hr />

You're right Tug, don't let em get to you.<br />
<br />
I've had fucktards open the door on me multiple times...no one has ever died because of it yet.  It definitely has nothing to do with open or closed status of the door, it's all about where the mob is and what mob you're fighting.  I remember reading somewhere, I think it was on TSW, someone had a really great explanation of the assist code in ToV that he figured out, but I can't find it.  I believe he said you could pull racnars and shit outside and fight them right on top of Zemm.  Be nice if I could dig that up, but I read so many boards they all blur together after awhile.</div></div><hr />

   YES the door does make a difference a huge difference, sorta like ALIVE and DEAD difference.  I have never fought a mob in hot near the door and arog'd Zimm with the door shut NEVER but many many times I have been killed by some tard opening the door when fighting a mob near the door so HOW can you say the door makes no difference?  Please explain.   OH dont say it depends on the mob thats BS the tard that opens the door does not know what mob your fighting!<br />

<br />
The door may be a part of it, but it is not the sole reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just leave the damn door closed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without it open, if a mob gets close an AE will agro everything.<br />
<br />
With it open, any mob fought BETWEEN the firepots will agro them.<br />
<br />
Any dragging in between the firepots will agro them, door or no door.<br />
<br />
Any mobs fought on firepots are not in LOS, and do not agro.</div></div><hr />

Combine this with the LOS info and I think that about covers the problem.  Some very good info here and for the first time I think I have a handle on the door argo.<br />

Just wondering because I just want to know if my 3 months in HoT was a fluke or not.</div></div><hr />

There will be times where it's accidently opened, you're fighting a wurm, and the drakes will rush in and slaughter the entire raid.  It happens.  Expect this to happen.  There will be other times where you're fighting something uncornered in the middle, someone opens the door, and nothing happens at all.<br />
<br />
If you play smart and don't fight near or open the door, you should be fine.  Most of my time in HoT was fighting at the entrance and we never had a problem... Unless someone opened the door. :)<br />
<br />
You'll hate HoT after a while, but it doesn't take long to gear your guild up.</div></div><hr />

Someone will get experience on the raid. This will not be you.<br />
Someone will get loot on the raid. This will not be you.<br />
Someone is going to die on the raid. This will be you.<br />
Go in with those expectations... Knowing that you are gearing up and empowering your guild. You are there to make them stronger, to better them, even if you are not gaining strength yourself. And when you finally do get your drop, you will savor it that much more because it was earned with the blood and sweat of your guild at your side. And they still be standing beside you with their drop just the same, savoring it all the more because you helped them earn it.<br />
 <br />
my resists are even above 100 unbuffed but magic cold and fire are atleast 60 or higher and i have 2 +10 sv fire rings and just had someone make me some BD electrum ear rings to raise poison and disease but will be looking for more resist gear ofcource:P<br />
<br />
actually the only reason i am working on regen 3 is to kill time while i build my 2hb with was a whopping 17 the other night when i got a greatstaff of thunder and i bought a great maul of hatred for 2.5k just to work on it with ( i just recently restarted EQ so don't have all the nice PoP gear and prePoP 2hb sucked and i was BROKE) now all i need to do is get 2hb to atleast 225 and get more HP gear.<br />
<br />
thanks for all the advice now i'm gonna hope everyone else gets drops they need then i can claim whatever is left lol (my rolls suck)</div></div><hr />

&quot;I once tanked in HoT with a jade mace and frostbringer and I was level 58!&quot;<br />
<br />
It sucked, but I manged until the other tank was rezed and healed up.  Levels make all the difference in AEs for Kunark/Velious mobs, and probably with Luclin AEs as well.  When I was 55, with my 100 MR/CR/FR, I would take a good bit of damage from AEs even with bard song.  At 60, I resisted the heck out of most AEs with bard, sans gear.  At 65, the AEs are a complete and utter joke.  One in three would hit me, most for less than half.<br />
<br />
For tanking, get to 60 and you should be straight.  Good luck and enjoy, HoT is one of my most memorable raids the first time I did it!  (For more than one reason!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's best to not open the door and if you are fighting a wurm up there and someone opens it eventually its going to get you aggro and get the raid in trouble.<br />
<br />
Luckily most people only kill the 2 wurms in the pit then drop in and you no longer have to worry about the door..<br />
<br />
<br />
Have knights tank the Green Drakes ,They have a slow on them, slime mist I think? been a while.Throwing the pallys on them allows them to keep stun aggro .Plus the  slow lasts quite some time and you would rather not have that on a warrior...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulic</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I've done HoT 6 times now in about the month since I posted here. I found most of the information valuble, and came to a few conclusions.<br />
<br />
Door makes no difference...it's all about proximity. KoS people die whether the door is open or closed. My non-KoS people are under instructions not to assist or heal them in any way...that's your punishment for being lazy with faction. Sometimes I will have a mob cornered and the drakes will come in and kill the KoS person, then leave without wiping the raid. I don't know if this is a bug or what but there were a few times we were in the middle of a fight and someone aggroed the drakes without wiping us. Incidentally, by our third HoT run I required everyone to be non-KoS anyway.<br />
<br />
Crawling &gt; Pulling. I know it's been said but I'll say it again. The best way to deal with gaters here is to fight them on their spawn point. Crawling HoT is teh win. Wanderers are a nuisance but not overly hard to deal with. We were there with 12 people last night and took 3 adds. Just have someone split and don't panic.<br />
<br />
Plate drops like candy here. In 6 runs ( maybe 3 or 4 hours each ) we have gotten 2 plate BPs, 4 plate greaves, and a ton of other misc plate. So far one pair of silk pants, silk boots, leather gloves, leather helm, and 2 chain bracers. This place is made for plate classes! Since I 2-box warrior/cleric I'm loving this. My friends who have done WToV say that the kael quested plate drops in a likewise generous ratio. Yay for us.<br />
<br />
We have done the named minis for symbols/tears. Now if we can just catch Doze up...</div></div><hr />
