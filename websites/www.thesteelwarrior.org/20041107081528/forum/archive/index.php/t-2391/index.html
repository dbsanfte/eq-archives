<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New patch, Aug 6th, TONS of stuff for casters, LOL. They really need it, really they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You read the pre-patch post, yes? We already knew all this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tons of stuff for casters? I dont see it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you quit your warrior yet?! I made $$$ selling off my EQ stuff, I mean to the tone of 2G's+! I am tired of getting the shaft from the group of low IQ monkeys at SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fuck off, troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Rumblingtroll should be banned if he posts about how he sold his warrior for lots of money one more time. He obviously has nothing significant to add to these boards and wants us all to quit our warriors to make his sell out attempt seem to mean something.<br />
<br />
You quit moron, you're not getting the shaft anymore remember? Ofcourse you are probably lying about that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just think it's funny how often you talk about all the cash money you got for your warrior. The dollar amount has actually gone up over time, even! You're like that little kid who keeps adding embellishments to his lies when no one cares or believes him. It's sad, really.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, stop trolling and stop talking about selling your warrior on PA or you'll be banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it's pretty clear that nobody would miss Rumblingdeth if he was gone :p.  Seriously, shut up about the Ebay crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DO IT EEEEEEEEEBAY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rumblingdeth, <br />
<br />
I bet you can get a good chunk of change by E-Baying your TSW account.... you should try it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah you could make bajillions of dollars spamming you sold your account on EBAY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FUCKING PATCH BROKE RUNNING AGAIN!! OMFG CANT THEY KEEP THEIR RETARDED TECH ILLITERATE FINGERS OF RUNNING COMMANDS !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe, since the demand is so freakin high, just make a pole, keep Rumblingdeth yes or no...............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OMG GUYS I went and went to player auctions and like sold my warrior account for 300 dollarz! Wait... it was really 600 dollarz because he had 4300 hp unbuffed and was all 1337 and stuffs. Haha I so clevar I sold him for 900 dollarz and change! I win ! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I saw that warrior, He was 4300 without any thing on....... He was so cool. He had blue eyes, long blonde hair and was a little more /cough equipted than any warrior before. he was at least 4 feet taller than anyother toon and could tri weild. He could use a flying kick and at times was known to pul an AK 47 out of his left leg armor and blow dragons away. <br />

<br />
