my stuff is not the be all / end all but i considering myself doing well atm. i would like to raise my dex and hp some more , without nuke'n my other stats. can any1 give some opinions on what armor i could purchase that would be considered a nice investment in compairison to what i have.<br />
unfortunatly im agnosic, so the diety armor is a no-go. ( continues to kick myself in the ass). i would also like to know of some armor that is no-drop that i could obtain from drops or quest , but within the capabilities of a 55 warr and a 46 cleric. <br />
<br />
<br />
any opinions or suggestions welcome, and as always, thanx ahead of time to the ones that can help out . stay cool every1 . -DoC</div></div><hr />

<br />
Earring of the solstice would be a pretty decent upgrade too.</div></div><hr />
