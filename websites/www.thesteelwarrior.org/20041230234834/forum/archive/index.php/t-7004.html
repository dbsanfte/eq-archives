Did you notice a considerable amount of DPS increase or only marginal?<br />

Thanks for your replies in advance.</div></div><hr />

If you plan to Dual Wield for a very long time, and have Ambidex already, I don't see a reason why this AA is not worthy of taking.</div></div><hr />

Just about every single skill, taken on it's own increases your abilities only marginally, but together they can make a huge difference.  So obviously, Sinister Strikes is much the same, in that it's a relatively small amount of extra damage, and you probably won't be able to visibly tell a difference but it's still there and it adds up.<br />
<br />
I just got the skill the other day, after finishing off other things and I don't really notice a difference but I haven't parsed and it's not like I would be able to even tell if I was doing 5-8 more dps without parsing extensively.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monk in my guild had parsed it at about 7DPS with a SEM offhand.  Its not huge and shouldnt be a priority but if you DW its worth considering when you get round to DPS AAs</div></div><hr />
