I looked threw all the old posts and cant find tactics to post for me guildies, anyone able to point me where to look? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">12-30-2004, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PHASE 1: 5 Trials, = undead, fire, water, air, earth.  60 minutes to beat all.<br />
air - 4 birds spawn, kill them and 4 more birds spawn with the boss, some are mezzable.<br />
<br />
water - 2 mobs spawn with the boss, kill the 2 mobs, then slay the boss, he pops out 2 adds at 90 percent and 50 percent, kill the boss, then the adds.<br />
<br />
earth -  3 rocks spawn initially, they split into between 1-3 more mobs on death, after a certain number of deaths i think around 8 the boss spawns, kill boss, then finish off the adds / splits.<br />
<br />
fire - 3 mephits spawn initially, each split into 2 more, once all are dead boss spawns, he spits out adds intermittenly, kill boss then adds.<br />
<br />
undead - 3 skeletons spawn, kill them and 4 unmezzable spawn, kill them and 4 mezzable spawn, kill those and 2 plus the boss spawn, kill boss then adds.<br />
<br />
PHASE 2:  3 Trials = undead, air / earth and water / fire i think you get an additional hour to beat these but you are allowed to have more people in each.<br />
<br />
Undead team is easiest, pull and kill all the trash is up, then kill the boss and his adds.  All the mobs are up from the get go in air / earth, water / fire.  You can either kill the mobs by pulling them to where you fought during Phase 1, or you can invis up and move to the door into P3 thats locked until you complete P2 and fight the mobs there.  Clean out all the mobs and you move up as a raid into Phase 3.<br />
<br />
PHASE 3:  10 waves of 10 mobs + 2 bosses, give or take a wave or two and 2-4 mobs, its been a while ;p.  You get an additional 90 mins i think to do this part?<br />
<br />
Pull the stuff in waves to one of the side ledges or on the lip of the main island.  Once you have cleared all the waves, 2 rock golem things spawn.  They arent very hard, just straight tank them and kill them, then zone up to Phase 4.<br />
<br />
PHASE 4:  4 Gods, Saryrn, Terris Thule, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek.  Tallon and Vallon are the hardest, Saryrn is the easiest.<br />
<br />
Saryrn - Spits out adds at random times some are mezzable, most arent, i dont remember the exact health percentages but you dont want me to give all the fun away anyways.  Have the MT corner her in the little inlet on either the right or left side of her opening, she does leash if you pull her out too far,  and she has a couple ae's including Torrent of agony ( 1: Decrease HP when cast by 1500<br />
                 2: Decrease Aggro Modifier by 60%<br />
                 3: Decrease Attack Speed by 40%<br />
                 4: Increase Disease Counter by 20 ) <br />
and Horrifying Affliction<br />
                 1: Decrease Spell Damage by 50%<br />
                 2: Decrease Mana by 175 per tick<br />
                 3: Decrease Mana Pool by 500<br />
When she dies either leash her adds or kill them, depending on how many peeps are alive.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule - Also spits out adds, some are mezzable and some arent, use your knights to AT the unmezzables, we always tanked her on her throne but its hard if your guild is bad at positioning, so like saryrn, just pick a corner and throw her in it.  She casts Quivering Nightmares<br />
                 1: Increase Spell/Bash Hate by 25%<br />
                 2: Decrease STR by 200<br />
                 3: Decrease AGI by 200<br />
                 4: Decrease STA by 200<br />
                 5: Decrease INT by 200<br />
                 6: Decrease WIS by 200<br />
and Phantastmal Torment<br />
                 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 200 per tick<br />
                 2: Decrease Mana by 150 per tick<br />
Again either leash her adds when she dies or kill them depending on how many are alive.<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek - Corner him in the cubby to the raids left as you are facing him.  Look at the tiles on the floor and make sure no one runs out past the first tile width from the opening to his room, or you are gonna aggro Vallon also and then you get owned like theres no tomorrow.  Throw him in a corner, fight him at max melee, hes got a variety of lovely ae's that make tanking him a real challenge at first including Tallons Balance<br />
                  1: Decrease All Resists by 300<br />
Barb of Tallon x 3, each doing something different like ( not all at once mind you)<br />
                  1: Decrease HP when cast by 1250 to 2750 (random)<br />
                  3: Decrease Attack Speed by 40%<br />
                  4: Decrease Movement by 40%<br />
                  1: Decrease Hitpoints by 300 per tick<br />
                  2: Decrease AC by 150<br />
                  3: Decrease Aggro Modifier by 60%<br />
Planeshift<br />
                  1: Increase Spell Mana Cost by 50%<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek - Arguably the hardest god in Phase 4.  Tank him in the corner on the raids right when facing him.  Some guilds use multiple MT's some use a single MT.  Depending on the route you want to go, stick 1-4 warriors in the corner and have them all make a 1. Stand 2. Autoattack hotkey to spam when they are tanking. If you use multiple tanks have your clerics assist and spray heal.  He pops out 2 adds that you can snare and have druids kite or knights AT.  His also has a proc, Tactical Strike which is loads of fun and does <br />
                  1: Feign Death<br />
                  2: Stun(30.00 sec)<br />
<br />
PHASE 5: There are 4 more gods up here, Bertoxxulous, Rallos Zek, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk.  CT is easiest, Inny the hardest.  There are also like 10 ish mobs in front of each of the gods you have to kill in order to make the gods go live first.  We usually pulled them into the zone in room and just ae'd them in clumps.  <br />
<br />
Rallos Zek - Hits like a truck, tank him in the corner on the raids left when facing him.  He ramps and spits out adds at 90, 70, 50 and 25 if i remember right.  4 adds each time until the last time, when there are 6.  Have a knight or someone call assist on the adds during the fight.  Start out the raid on rallos at max melee, when the adds pop, break the raid off and kill the adds then get back on rallos, rinse and repeat till he dies.  He has a stun proc but he barely uses it, lasts for about 10 seconds if i recall right.  He also has Rage of Zek, <br />
                1: Decrease Hitpoints by 400 per tick<br />
                2: Decrease Mana by 50 per tick<br />
                3: Increase Curse Counter by 9<br />
<br />
Bertoxxulous - We used to kill Rallos first, then we would pull Bert into Rallos's room and tank him in the same corner we killed Rallos in.  Bert does NOT leash and neither does Cazic, only Inny and Rallos do in this phase.  Bert's melee is pretty gimp his ae's kinda suck but arent too bad to resist with buffs and a bard.  <br />
Black Plague<br />
               1: Increase Disease Counter by 18<br />
               2: Decrease Movement by 80%<br />
               3: Decrease Hitpoints by 700 per tick<br />
Rain of Bile<br />
               1: Decrease Mana by 275<br />
               2: Decrease Hitpoints by 975<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule - Again we pulled him to Rallos's room and fought him in the same corner.  Cazic sucks for tanking because he has a single target fear he enjoys using on the MT, as soon as your SK and Pallys get beefy enough, just have them tank this and save yourself the headache.  He also has a silence so keep your casters as far away as possible.<br />
Call of the Faceless<br />
                1: Decrease Hitpoints by 200 per tick<br />
                2: Decrease Movement by 40%<br />
                3: Silence<br />
Aura of Fear<br />
                1: Decrease HP when cast by 2000<br />
                2: Stun(6.00 sec)<br />
                3: Decrease Hitpoints by 550 per tick<br />
<br />
Innoruuk - The biggest pain in the ass in this phase, he has an ae fear that blows.  Make sure your tanks have the fear resistance aa's and warcry, it helps alot.  We used to stick him up in his portrait of himself in the room and tank him in that, hes also got a bunch of adds he spits out intermittenly.  The adds are snare / rootable and we used to have druids handle them while we were on Inny.  <br />
Seething Hatred<br />
                 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 550 per tick<br />
                 2: Decrease Aggro Modifier by 75%<br />
                 3: Fear(1)<br />
<br />
QUARM: The big kahuna<br />
<br />
Last boss obviously, he drops the best shit, hes a real pain in the ass at first and a long fight, but a snoozefest once you get it down, much easier than innoruuk or even the zek brothers in farm status.  His melee is mean, up in the 3000's and he triples, but he attacks very very slow.  He has a bunch of tricks up his sleeve.  We used to have half the raid hide around one of the corners in the room and the melee would dodge in and out of the AE's as the MT or a 2ndary tank called them.  With levels and aa's being what they are now, you could probably just straight up tank him from the get go though, do whatever you have more success with.  As you kill him he pops a head at 75, 50, and 25, and he uses different AE's based on what heads missing, i wont spoil which ae's he using during which times --- mainly because i dont remember anymore!<br />

Plague Seism<br />
                 1: Decrease Hitpoints by 3000<br />
<br />
He also has some annoying adds that proc an uber slow on whoever is closest to them, they are mezzable, but not worth the effort to kill as he spawns them all the time.<br />
<br />
Good luck, man im bored tonight, most of that info should be accurate, but keep in mind its been a year, dont use it as a bible or anything =P</div></div><hr />

I can confirm otherwise, I have raided many times with Payns and his guild on MR.</div></div><hr />

Therefore, he did not earn the name of Payns as you said he did. Also, the reason he needs the strats is that he has never been in Time, but he has Time gear and therefore his guild will ask him for help with the Time bosses because they don't know that it is an EBay'd character and assume that he will be able to help them.</div></div><hr />

I suspect is probably is ebay too but might not be. Personally I agree with you I could never completely forget time to the point of not being able to cover the basics. Then again you and I have something in common that I'm pretty sure he doesn't. We're both officers in our guild and likely much more involved in figuring out strats in the first place and running them there after. For a average peon especially one i'm guessing was lower than average attendance in thier guild I could see them forgetting most of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very seriously doubt it. In every guild I have been in, officers have went over a strat in guild chat before we did the encounter. I know how to do Zoo/Cynosure in Qvic like the back of my hand I have heard them so much. Unless this guy has lost 70% he prolly was e-bayed, or the character was given to a friend/brother.<br />
