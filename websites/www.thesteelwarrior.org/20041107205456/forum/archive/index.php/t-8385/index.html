<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
i wonder if it is possible to stop a running discipline via a command. I tried things like &quot;/disc stop&quot;, &quot;/disc off&quot; and so on but nothing worked. I think there will be a way to do it because you can stop the disc manually by clicking the icon and you can start it via command too.<br />
<br />
The reason im asking is because i wanted to make a hotkey like this:<br />
<br />
/disc furious<br />
/pause 110<br />
/disc off ???<br />
/disc devensive<br />
<br />
The thought is not to have a gap between furious running out and starting devensive. My thinking is that its maybe be better to stop furious just before its running out and then start new disc immediately. So i dont have to worry about lags and so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can click-spam defensive while Furious is about to wear off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or why not just use the little hotkey that is already created to kill your disc?  It's in your disc window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">to my knowledge, there is no command to stop disc, only able to stop it using the UI window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Long pauses in hotkeys are bad I think. Unless it has been changed recently, while you are paused, you cannot use another hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i just spam click my defensive button when furious is about to wear off. more often the problem i get is hitting furious in time to start getting heals. some times i hit it but if i'm lagged it wont go off right away, or it will go off, but not register fast enough and i'll get killed, even tho when i pop at my bind point my furious button will be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is no way to do it w/o the UI...this of course means you are subject to the inadequetcies a mouse click.  It has been requested a number of times they add the /disc functionality at the keyboard level (like it used to have)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">typing /disc works now.  It didn't when the disc changes first came out, but has for a while AFAIK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Must have been introduced in the last month; I know it didnt in June</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe I'm deranged, but I could swear they made it work again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Technically, Brutal, even if you made the /disc functionality work, you could still be deranged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I typed /disc last night while defensive, and did not get any feedback about my disc timer or anything else.<br />
<br />
Is there a /disc command to shut off a discipline?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No. You can start discs using /disc, but you can not stop discs using command line, and they have not reimplemented the ability to use /disc to check timers.<br />
<br />
I would almost swear I read on the soe forums that they were looking at adding the ability to check timers with the /disc command, but I could have been just deluding myself ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gotta remember, Brutul is on test, so like it may work there /shrug.</div></div><hr />
