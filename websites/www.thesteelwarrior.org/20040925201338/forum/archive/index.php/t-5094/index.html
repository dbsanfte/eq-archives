<p class="largefont">View Thread : <a href="http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5094">Incite alone isn't enough</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What I am beginning to find out, is that in most situations, Incite by itself is unable to control aggro. Given how streaky the RNG is, I cannot guarantee a taunt on inc, and then, popping my Incite is next to useless, because as soon as the mob is slowed, it will be all over the caster even if you use Incite.<br />
<br />
At most, Incite allows us to get over the slow aggro hump IF we have a successful taunt. If I am pulling with Incite (the way Pallies do with stuns) I seem to be able to hold aggro almost every time. But if someone else is pulling, I'm still required to pull off a successful taunt in order to overcome slow aggro.<br />
<br />
What I propose is something that should have been put into Incite in the first place. Add to the component that it is a no-fail taunt that puts the warrior 400 points over the next person on the hate list. When Incite is used, the taunt button grays out for 6 seconds. One successful taunt every 30 seconds is far from game breaking.<br />
<br />
Besides (here is the flame) I HATE THE GOD DAMNED STREAKY RNG! I had nine (count them, nine) unsuccessful taunts IN A ROW when I was trying to taunt a mezzed mob. This should not be possible with a maxxed taunt skill. But it is. You think casters would start screaming bloody murder if they were getting streaks of casting fizzles the same way we are getting streaks of failed taunts? I sure think they would!<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also (this is for the devs at SOE) when are you guys going to give pure melee stat boosts to 355 like you gave to pure casters? I wouldn't mind a 355 Str, Sta, Dex or Agi. I know only one of those stats would go to 355 (can I hear stamina anyone?), but isn't it about time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Amen.<br />
<br />
I have sat and wondered myself why some classes can raise their most important stats to 355(by way of AAs) and others cannot. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i disagree...<br />
<br />
after much play with incite, imo its almost too good. Makes aggro seemingly trivial, and I know it is no comparison to pally stuns, but, its almost too easy to hold aggro forever now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">while incite alone probably wont let you control agro when the slow lands I have found  that incite + a couple of swings has the mobs back on me much quicker after a failed taunt then just the couple of swings ever did.  I have only had one occasion recently where I over agro'd with my chanter and she got splattered before I could do anything about it, but I think it had been so long since she'd been hit that I had let her buffs and rune fade.<br />
<br />
So far I have been loving incite as a pulling tool, its great not having to think about swapping in a bow or mourning the loss of AC cos you can't be bothered swapping bow/item each pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can't control agro with incite and hate augmented weapons, then it's probably your own fault. Incite isn't supposed to be an agro lock, so don't ask for one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not asking for aggro lock. Mostly what I am asking for is a little more independence from the RNG when it comes to getting aggro. Right now, I don't have anything near aggro lock. It's more like aggro luck. If I roll the dice and I'm lucky enough (with a 3 out of 5 chance I will win) the mob is all over me. This would be fine if the odds were even, and the RNG worked right every time. Yes, ther may be a 3 out of 5 chance I win, but of late, when I hit the taunt button and fail, I seem to fail in chains and am unable to get to the top of the aggro pile. To add to it, I still get a successful taunt now and again that fails to turn the mob on me. I am still very dependent on procs to build up hate, and procs are just as streaky as taunt. Yes, incite gives me a boost at the beginning of a fight, but it will never be able to overcome slow aggro by itself.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am asking for is a better than 3/5ths chance of winning at taunt. Is it too much to ask for, considering the skill is as good as it will ever get?</div></div><hr />

Edit - just can't stop yet. Procs have been proven to happen twice a min in main hand and once a min in off hand.<br />
<br />
That's 6 procs a min. If your slowers Can't deal with that, then they should die a lot and often until they grow a brain.<br />

or, if they get agro, just /shield them :( :( or not, let em die.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The best thing about incite is when an enchanter mezes, slows, you get a successful taunt and then hit incite.  It's pretty much aggro lock.  I tried to steal aggro with my wizard casting chain SoS and it just wasn't happening.  It may not be real aggro lock but its way better than what i had before and if you test it (just using it by itself) its not that powerful at all.  Just another tool to help with xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deliciouspk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">-if you can't keep agro with CHoS and SoTB and Ykesha and Anger III and Spirit of Rage and Incite and AET and taunt button then I want you to make caster now -<br />
<br />
Unfortunately an SK or Pally can still walk up to a warrior with all of that gear, and effortlessly take away aggro and keep it.<br />
<br />
FFXI has a no-fail taunt button that has a middling refresh speed and makes it work, I don't see why it would be such a nightmare for warriors to have something like that... it's just retarded.  Hell, it would make multiple warriors on raids more needed, instead of being half-ass dps untill it's the next persons turn to tank.  <br />
<br />
And ya, I'm an SK.  I still think it's bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FFXI provoke is not a taunt, it just adds a fixed amount of hate and recycles in 30 seconds. It is powerful though because no other class other than warrior gets it and at the lower levels this is the only way any melee can consistently get and hold aggro. Even the best tanks in FFXI (paladins) have to subclass warrior to help in holding aggro because their only other aggro generating tool is heals but their mana pools are horribly small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Provoke off a White Mage using Benediction. Go ahead, try. It ain't happening. It is NOT no-fail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It is no-fail, but the +hate is not enough to take aggro off a white mage who just used benediction.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Boy does this thread suck now LOL I am ashamed I am in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">But Jakle, in your post is the crux of the issue.<br />
<br />
Stupid people are playing casters and are allowed to remain stupified due to chain casting a low level stun or the magics performed by SK's.<br />
<br />
I now use a BoC w/anger III, a CHSD w/anger II in addition I have Veng 6 and guess what.....Dipshits regularly steal aggro from me in LDON's.  <br />
<br />
If taunt works and I get my proc-o-matic setup firing like a gattling gun - all is well.<br />
<br />
If taunt fucks me over and doesn't work and the RNG bends me over one more time without kissing me......dead dumb enchanter.<br />
<br />
Then, of course, the inevitable....... &quot;Christ Blood aint you hitting taunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, it aint fixed yet.  Is there ever fixing stupidity though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>deliciouspk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You wanna know the worst thing?  When groups pick a hybrid over a warrior because they're a more efficient tank, the warrior can't even go explore worth a damn except in newbie and mid lvl zones.<br />
<br />
I guess there's always tradeskills...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only problem is the way the Taunt &quot;skill&quot; is implimented.<br />
<br />
If you fail the first time (roughly 50/50) the chance you will fail twice in a row is roughly 50/50. This is a real loooong time for an Enchanter to be hit. Need I add if you fail twice in a row, the chances it will be 3 in a row are roughly 50/50.<br />
<br />
Now you statistics people might point out (using the 50/50 chance just to make things easy to follow) that one failure is 50/50, two failures is 25/75, etc. But it can also be looked at as I did in the paragraph above. Two or three failures in a row can be quite dire much less four.<br />
<br />
Yes, AE Taunt can do the job - but what's the refresh? I thought so.<br />
<br />
The Taunt &quot;skill&quot; is not set up like a skill where expertise insures not only a lower failure rate but a lower repeat failure rate. It is a coin toss - not a skill at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you can't control agro with incite and hate augmented weapons, then it's probably your own fault. Incite isn't supposed to be an agro lock, so don't ask for one.<br />
<br />
This is a classic example of a strawman argument.  You take his initial point (Incite isn't always good enough, and the RNG is too streaky) ... you then:<br />
<br />
1) ignore the streakiness of the RNG<br />
2) include Hate aug'd weapons<br />
3) then flame the poster for not meeting your &quot;new&quot; standard<br />
<br />
How about you address the specific points the poster lists instead of just being a wise-ass and trying to score some internet penis points?<br />
<br />
My own personal opinion is that with a good group Incite is damn near aggro lock.  With a bad group Incite doesn't make any difference ... I still have to resort to taunt mashing (and praying) to regain and keep aggro.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the taunt RNG is way too streaky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;Dipshits regularly steal aggro from me in LDON's. &quot;<br />
<br />
LDoN has odd geometry. And as such, can have unpredictable aggro situations. Proximity plays a big part in LDoN. And push, due to people going full boar all out offense due to the time constraints, can change aggro quickly in LDoN.<br />
<br />
However, just because a mob turns away from you for a combat round or two doesn't mean someone's &quot;stolen aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
In LDoN it probably means they just got too close to the mob.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you address the specific points the poster lists instead of just being a wise-ass and trying to score some internet penis points?&quot;<br />
<br />
There's no point in addressing the poster's original points. As you yourself pointed out, with good people AROUND you, Incite is more than adequate.<br />
<br />
The poster's problems are a combination of things he or she is probably doing wrong AND MOST DEFINITELY things the poster's GROUPMATES are doing wrong.<br />
<br />
You'd have to be one spastic enchanter/shaman to steal aggro and KEEP it from a warrior these days.<br />
<br />
Or one complete and utter wimp if you're worried about getting hit once or twice when casting slow.<br />
<br />
And, my final tidbit that I shall offer in this thread is for all those people COMPLAINING ABOUT THE RNG OF PROCCING WEAPONS:<br />
<br />
Gates of Discord, people. It's coming out soon.<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity, people. Look into it. Get it. Love it. And quit whining.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">People were actually complaining about the RNG of Taunt, but your point is well taken anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weapon Affinity:<br />
<br />
Through years of practice, you develop a close bond with your weapons. This affinity allows you to gain enhanced performance from your weapons in the form of an increased rate at which it triggers effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Increased proc rate?  Oh hell yeah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>deliciouspk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Nice!!<br />

So a warrior who's geared/AA'd all to hell and back will be able to hold aggro ALMOST as well as a shadowknight that dings lvl 15 and buys the &quot;Clinging Darkness&quot; spell.  <br />
<br />
What doubter ever said that fix wasn't coming...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My only gripe with people saying &quot;with hate augmented weapons&quot; here is that you get shit for points in LDoN as you level up so almost every warrior still has to level up to 65 and grind 23 everfrost LDoNs before they can get hate aug'd weapons.<br />
<br />
Thats a fairly long period of having having to deal with the same issues and less procs before they get into the still not ideal situation being painted above.</div></div><hr />

A level 20 warrior with PROVOKE can compete with the level 15 Shadowknight with Clinging Darkness.<br />
<br />
OMG, fix is here!<br />

<br />
Stolen aggro (for me anyway) means they are taking damage regardless of which way the mob is facing.</div></div><hr />

Can an SK steal aggro? Sure. So can a lot of people. STEALING AGGRO is JUVENILE. Your JOB is to kill the monster. If you are NOT the tank, it's your job to make sure the TANK IS TAKING THE BEATING.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>deliciouspk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">With the ridiculous mana regen/mana pools they have now a days, taking a hit isn't nearly as important as it was.  I've had clerics in my guild chain cheal me from beginning to end in xp groups and never complain they needed a rest at 2nd castle in fire.<br />
<br />
The objective of an xp group is to kill mobs.  With an SK/Pally tanking every person in the group can unload with their most damaging spells/dots without having to worry about getting hit.  This also helps the cleric, who only has to heal one person.  Mobs die faster, xp comes in faster = more efficient = better.<br />
<br />
Same deal with PoP boss mobs.  As long as you've got the hps to not get 1 rounded, you'll never die unless the cheal chain screws up.  Hybrids don't even have to swing to maintain aggro, thus avoiding the dmg spikes of ripostes.<br />
<br />
Try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;With the ridiculous mana regen/mana pools they have now a days, taking a hit isn't nearly as important as it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
And since it's ALWAYS been easy to make sure aggro stays on the tank ... your ability to STEAL aggro wasn't EVER important.<br />
<br />
What's your point?<br />
<br />
&quot;With an SK/Pally tanking every person in the group can unload with their most damaging spells/dots without having to worry about getting hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a warrior tanking this is also possible.<br />
<br />
90% of the complaints people have about getting aggro right now, post INCITE, come from LDoN. And I've seen these vaunted PALADINS and SHADOWKNIGHTS lose aggro in LDoN just as much as everyone else. It has NOTHING to do with the aggro. And everything to do with the coding and the geometry.<br />
<br />
Come off it man.<br />
<br />
Incite has done it's job.<br />
<br />
Warriors can tank just as good as anyone else.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
And btw ... whether you THINK taking a hit is important or NOT ...  doesn't matter. Why? 2 reasons. First, YOU'RE NOT THE CLERIC. To them it is important. Second, YOU'RE the assclown who asked for ONE THING a warrior was better at. And I provided your answer. TAKING DAMAGE. If taking damage was NOT important, more MONKS would tank. Guess what ... it IS important.<br />
<br />
It is you who needs to try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>deliciouspk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Unfortunately, it seems the only way I could prove this to you would be to group with the people you group with, get them spoiled as to what a hybrid can do, and then let them group with you again and tell you how much they have to hold back now.<br />
<br />
There is no possible way on earth you can hold aggro over a wizard chain nuking from beginning to end of the fight.  Personally, I've maintained aggro on 2 seperate mobs at the same time while a wizard chain ae'd them.  <br />
<br />
Tell the next necro you group with to unload as hard and fast as he can on the mobs.  I can guarantee that with a warrior tanking he'll be dead within the first minute.  With a hybrid that knows how to play tanking, he might get touched once or twice at the most throughout the entire xp session.  Even I have to work hard to keep a mob off of a necro thats going off, but I can do it, and I have.<br />
<br />
I consider &quot;taking a hit&quot; as being comprised of:<br />
<br />
1.  How much damage you take tanking.<br />
2.  How much anybody else in the group gets hit instead of you.<br />
3.  How fast the mob dies, reducing total dmg.<br />
<br />
By the way, if you DO want to just go off of &quot;straight damage&quot; and are convinced that warriors improved mitigation = less healing having to be tossed, we could factor in the 2 or 3 touch of Innoruuks I toss per mob and the healing associated and see how much it really ends up as being?<br />
<br />
I'm not downing you for having class pride by the way.  I had pride in my class back in original eq/kunark when an sk was good for fding in the corner and getting sk only loot that was going to rot.  I played my class to the best of my ability, and people respected that.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I ignored the fact that other people could do my job better than I could, merely because the class they picked provided better tools for doing it.</div></div><hr />

Two things.<br />
<br />
1- A Shadowknight tanks for me almost exclusively these days. He's one my RL friends. I play in a group comprised of him, me, a ranger, a cleric, an enchanter and a rogue. That's us. That's our group. I'm well aware of what shadowknights can do.<br />
<br />
2- Here's my magelo:<br />

<br />
Now tell me if you notice anything unusual about it.<br />
<br />
Let me know WHY the shadowknight tanks over me.<br />
<br />
(Here's a hint, I'm a 65 what?)<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Wubao.... <br />
<br />
I do see where you're coming from man.<br />
<br />
Incite is a new tool for warriors.<br />
<br />
a VERY VERY nice tool.<br />
<br />
I LOOOOVE IT SO MUCH.<br />
<br />
That being said, what the SK is saying is true, wars don't have aggro lock.<br />
<br />
We are not supposed to have flawless aggro control.<br />
<br />
Give a war flawless aggro controll, and you successfully made every encounter trivial, from the very first attempt on.<br />
<br />
Where warriors are now is good, because we're not the shittiest tank in the game, we have increased raid appeal, which is a plus.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd wait till the next expansion before tossing accusations.<br />
<br />
Right now, it would be something like seeing the lower half of a beautiful painting, only seeing the green of grass, and deciding the rest of the painting is plain and boring because of it,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The SK is engaging in a horrendous display of virtual dick waving, if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I recently started a SK and Clinging Darkness can't pull a mob off my pet while I was trying to save it.<br />
<br />
So while SKs are pretty darn powerful they're not THAT powerful.<br />
<br />
It's pretty stupid for SK to talk about how they can grab aggro.  Yes we know Fear is broken and of course Warrior loses very badly on the aggro department to a level 15 spell that does like 1.5 EB of hate.  SK can probably use a few more reduction on their regular spells (especially the Snare) and get a workable Terror line with an appropriate cost but it's not meaningful to talk about such things in light of Fear.<br />
<br />
And it's really tiring for people to go back to the 'more aggro is more DPS' argument.  I bring plenty of aggro to any group I go to, pickup or otherwise.  I have never seen a group conjure extra DPS out of thin air just because I bring a lot more aggro than the average warrior.  In an XP group, if the group claims to be able to do more DPS with a Knight that's a pretty reliable sign that your group sucks.  The only way a Knight brings more DPS to a group via aggro is if someone would've died with a warrior tanking.  Being able to do dumb things like nuke the mob on incoming does very little to your overall DPS when you grind for at least an hour or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>deliciouspk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Superchum - You're a monk?  And you're arguing with me about tanking and aggro?  Here's a tip, if your RL friend that's an SK is tanking, and that mob EVER hits you, or ever attacks a caster for more than 3 seconds, he isn't playing his class to its fullest extent and therefore isn't a valid comparison.<br />
<br />
Sorguran - Please describe how giving warriors a no-fail taunt with a refresh of 15 seconds say, would break the game.  Hell, give warriors aggro lock like a hybrid and it still wouldn't break the game.  Want to know why?  Because many, many, many time guilds are already using hybrids to tank every single boss mob encounter.  If aggro lock is already in effect, how would aggro lock break the game?<br />
<br />
Graal - Ya, I'm dickwaving.  Or maybe I see that this is a horrendous problem in a game that I used to enjoy.  I quit about a month ago because I was totally sick of the imbalance issues in pve ( don't even get me started about pvp ).  I guess we should chalk you up on the list with all of the other people arguing with me, and thank you when after the newest changes warriors will still be sub-par tanks compared to hybrids in just about every way.  It's about 90% Sony not caring, but the other 10% is warriors that are perfectly happy with the mob running here, there, and everywhere in xp groups, while a hybrid maintains effortless and complete aggro.<br />
<br />
Phantron - Think of what lvl your pet is in relation to you.  Now imagine that instead of a pet, it's another pc of that lvl attacking this mob.  Can you see why it's hard to get a mob off of your pet sometimes?  Especially when he'll kill the pet in 4 or 5 hits, it's not like you've got a large time frame to work with.<br />
<br />
-And it's really tiring for people to go back to the 'more aggro is more DPS' argument.-<br />
<br />
Let me say it again... more aggro IS more dps.  That wizard who isn't nuking as you pull in the mob and establish aggro?  He's sitting on a full mana bar while you do that usually.  Explain to me how him nuking on incoming on every mob over the course of an hour doesn't make them die faster.  Explain to me how slowing on incoming on every mob over the course of an hour doesn't save the healers mana and allow you to pull more mobs.  Explain to me how in the name of god you would go about dragging a mob off of a necro going full bore (and let me tell you, they NEVER run out of mana, and can do horrendous damage, with aggro being the only thing holding them back).<br />
<br />
Giving warriors some form of aggro lock now wouldn't fix the problem, it's too much of a shitpile that has built up over time.  It WOULD be SOMETHING at least though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">AGGROLOCK is BAD.. m'kay?<br />
<br />
the fact that SoE chose to give warriors limited aggro-lock like abilities, and limited snap aggro abilities, instead of fixxing the problem of aggrolock tells you the direction that they are moving the game. Look at all the changes, they constantly make it easier and easier for newbies/lowbies. <br />
<br />
For example... My roomate started a new beastlord yesterday at noon... she went to bed level 24...  <br />
<br />
The game has changed, for better or worse...<br />
<br />
I personally despise aggro-lock, but it has become the standard by which the game is played.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This argument means exactly zero, as any group worth half a shit should be banging through mobs fast enough to make a wizard go OOM. Put 4 big nukes on two mobs per minute (you said SKs make it so Wizards can nuke more and all the time) and you tell me that they will never go OOM. What is Max mana regen these days while standing? 70ish? so you get back 700 mana while you let out 2500ish less focus effects. Right...There is a thread up on Graffe's right now about Wizards being able to MAX OUT damage at 450k per hour. The mana pool will not support more (for anyone).<br />

<br />
A warrior with enough hps never makes a cleric run out of mana. We pull 3-4 mobs at a time in LDoN and I never see our clerics med. Even if an enchanter gets hit once or twice on slow, it still never makes the cleric go OOM. If you want to factor in your taps over time, then have the warrior pop his discs every time they are up. We will take less than half your damage for a quarter of the time we are tanking.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, I don't know any high-end slower who gives a crap if they get hit once on incoming. The days of waiting to slow a mob were over even before the warrior agro increases.<br />
<br />
Give me a break. You can argue semantics on paper all day long if you want. The pure fact is that your supposed ability to hold agro so well over a warrior is such a tiny marginal advantage to any group you come in contact with that they will barely notice any exp benefits.<br />
<br />
You reveal nothing but a lack of character that you would make such a big deal of it on another class' Boards.<br />
<br />
Troll.<br />
<br />
Not to mention you are nothing but an indication of the dumbing-down of this game and that a group that needs you to lock agro for them while they push a nuke button until they get to 500 aa's should be shot in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>deliciouspk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I love how everybody refutes my facts by posting examples from easy Ldon adventures.<br />
<br />
Let me cut you in on a little fact...<br />
<br />
Easy Ldon adventures are pathetically easy.<br />
<br />
I have personally done easy Ldon adventures at 65 with a group consisting of 2 necros, 2 wizards, me and a rogue.  This was Miraguls Menagierie, and we knocked it out no problem.<br />
<br />
Go try a Hard adventure, and you tell me that the shaman or chanter doesn't care whether they get hit.  Go xp in 2nd castle in Fire, or Earth, and you watch how fast that cleric runs out of mana, and how fast everybody but the tank crumples like a ragdoll if they get aggro.  Nobody cares if the mob is hitting them, untill the mob is quadding for 900 etc.  Then it's suddenly a problem.<br />
<br />
I honestly really can't believe that people are arguing the point that warriors don't need any improvement...<br />
<br />
Next time that chanter slows the mob, and you're jamming taunt and incite repeatedly into its back as it ignores you, you think about how that enchanter feels, and which scenario he prefers...  <br />
<br />
1.  Dying every now and then because the warrior can't taunt off of him.<br />
<br />
2.  The mob never even looking at him as he slows on incoming, and then pays attention to any possible adds etc.<br />
<br />
Standing behind the point that warriors don't need improvement is basically saying that you prefer your groups to die/wipe every now and then for no reason that you can control... when a hybrid played with the same degree of skill could have pulled the situation out no problem.<br />
<br />
If you intend to plow through easy LDON missions for the rest of your time in EQ however, then yes... you'll do just fine with the tools you have.  In that case, no improvement is needed, go for it.<br />
<br />
I however still agree with the original poster... warriors need tools that work if they're to remain competitive.  Good luck with the openings deal I guess?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I do hards. I tank them too. Pulls are usually slowed on inc. I have no issues grabbing and KEEPING aggro unless I'm with a paladin who gets stun happy. The enchanters and shammies usually can take a hit or three, as well. I've even had an SK comment on how impressive my aggro control was.<br />
<br />
Also, since we're talking hards, not many average geared warriors are going into them anyway, simply because they'll become a fine red mist.  Same would go for an average geared pally or SK.<br />
<br />
Sinking fast, you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hey dumbass, if the mobs are that hard, then your cleric will go OOM even faster on you then he will on me. Then guess what? You are sitting around doing nothing, waiting for the mana to regen. YAY! Your mega agro control helped you get to that point 15 seconds faster than I did!<br />
<br />
At least I can pop evasive or stonewall and mitigate that badass mob every 10 mins or so.  You are going down like a sack of potatoes.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I wonder if they will trade your agro lock for not having to heal me as much. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.<br />
<br />
I just did LDON hard with our resident Quarm Killing guild as part of my group. The Enchanter never got agro once. Not even once.<br />
<br />
He even complimented me on how good a job I was doing.<br />
<br />
I don't know what your warriors are doing, but I am tagging with arrows, hitting incite to tag off the puller and making sure my enchanter is standing next to me so that I can hit a taunt the second he even thinks about getting agro.<br />
<br />
I like the game like this. Don't frigging touch my warrior. If I wanted to drop a $13.95 a month into my computer and 8 hours later get 15 AA's, I would give my character to Yantis.<br />
<br />
In addition, we have AE Taunt for when someone does something really stupid. That is an agro tool that outaggroes even you my fine SK friend.<br />
<br />
Now Go pull something for me to tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In November, pre-melee patch, this MAY have been an issue.<br />
<br />

Warrior aggro is far better than it was before. So much better that they can now compete with the other tanks for XP group slots. And the other tanks don't take hits as well as warriors do.<br />

The point is moot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Please describe how giving warriors a no-fail taunt with a refresh of 15 seconds say, would break the game. Hell, give warriors aggro lock like a hybrid and it still wouldn't break the game. Want to know why? Because many, many, many time guilds are already using hybrids to tank every single boss mob encounter. If aggro lock is already in effect, how would aggro lock break the game?<br />
How many of those guilds using hybrids to tank every single time boss mob are using elemental geared hybrids?  I bet the answer is none, they are all using time geared hybrids and before that were all time geared they probably used warriors to tank.  Once you've killed a mob once or twice and you've got the strat down its farm time, but those first tries to learn the mob are the challenging part of EQ and giving warriors agro lock makes that challenge pretty much go away.<br />
<br />
deliciouspk, knights have great agro, go them.  On raids these days if I see a mob turn and I assist it 90% of the time its on a paladin.  If I am offtanking trash and someone takes it off me, it is always a knight.  <br />
<br />
I can hold agro off pretty much every other class in the game and the job gets done, so the way I see it my agro is sufficient, knights can out agro me sure, but I don't need that much agro to tank.<br />
<br />
Add to that that I have been parsing at 140-160 DPS in XP groups, have a defensive disc which doesnt effect my DPS, offensive discs that put me over 200 DPS, I have a DA that I can use and still hold agro, and I have the best multiple mob taunt in the game, Im pretty damn happy with how I tank compared to a similarly geared knight.<br />
<br />
Warriors don't need knight like agro, what we have now is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Geez, you guys have gone overboard with this. All I was commenting on really was the fact that taunt fails, fails often, and often fails repeatedly in chains. The first ont (taunt fails) is a fact of life, and we have to deal with it. The second one (fails often) is boggling to me. If my skill is maxed, then shouldn't I have a higher success rate than 60%? The third one is just ridiculous (often fails repeatedly in chains). I think the most you should ever see taunt fail in a row is three times. Or maybe code should be added that doubles the chance of success on the next taunt if taunt fails, or have the refresh of a failed taunt be half the refresh of a successful one. Or make my initial suggestion a reality (Incite=sucessful taunt+400hate+hate DOT). Whatever. Taunt is still broken, and Incite just doesn't work right UNLESS you have a successful taunt. And by &quot;work right&quot; I mean that the mob stays on the warrior through the initial slow. I do not mean aggro lock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps SOE is not worrying too much about it from the perspective of the hybrids at the present time because sooner or later the curtain will come down on that little parade?<br />
<br />
Not all the changes from Test are on Live; the GoD AA's and whatever else they have in store are not in game; they said this was the first step in their plans to bring playability back to certain classes; the opening system is not live, and that may add more aggro chances (admittedly tied to the RNG, but more chances still)...<br />

We do not have an aggro lock. Yes, people do need to be a little more careful with a warrior still. We are not in nearly as bad shape as we were. We can hold aggro. Taunt, however, is still busted because of the horribly inaccurate RNG. Taunt is for gaining aggro, not holding it. And that is what started this thread.

Just because you're saying another class should get upgraded doesn't somehow mean your opinion is more valid.  In fact overpowered classes tend to say other classes should get better to try to avoid their inevitable nerf.<br />
<br />
15 second no fail taunt is such a ridiculous concept I'm not sure why anyone would think it's not game breaking.  Sure it won't be game breaking if mobs mem blur themselves every 4 seconds which is what will happen if Warriors are given this tool.  You do not seem to understand mobs are given better deaggro abilties to compensate for any increase in aggro a warrior receives (minus Incite, which we got for free).  LDoN for example is just harder in general for aggro for every tank classes.  I mean even Knights sometimes can't get aggro if they're not hammering their fear or cease every 3 seconds which most Knights I group do not do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anybody's trolling at this point, it's you bub.  I can quite honestly say without feeling bad that as a 52 warrior, you have no conception of how things work in the high end.  Don't feel bad, the first time I leveled an SK up to 60 I didn't know crap either.  When I was sick of being useless and leveled up my monk to 60, I learned  more than I thought I would honestly.  When I started over on Sullon and leveled yet another SK up to 65 and 250 AA I learned even more on top of that.<br />
<br />
I don't pretend to know everything, but I've been around the block.  I've boxed just about every class in the game at one point or another.  I've boxed warriors several times on raids for flags when people were out of town, etc.<br />
<br />
I know how taunt works, puts you at the top of the aggro list.  I know how Incite works, adds a static amount of aggro.  I know how aggro procs work, and the advantages/disadvantages to using a BoW with aggro/stun proc added to using dual weild setup with extra procs.<br />
<br />
Incite is great when taunt works.  It puts you ahead of everybody by a respectable margin when you hit it after taunt works.  However, it is totally useless, or close to it if taunt fails.  I have never seen Incite alone pull aggro off of a shammy that slowed, or a necro that drew aggro.<br />
<br />
Depending on the RNG is not something I ever have faith in.  Hell, ask a tradeskiller if they enjoy how streaky the RNG is at times.  I have personally sat at my wifes shoulder and watched taunt fail 5 times in a row...  It doesn't happen often, but it happens.  If you believe that's acceptable, then more power to you.  I don't believe that's acceptable and neither do any of the people I talk to on a regular basis that still play.<br />

Boggle is -500 hate.  Concussion is -400 hate.  Both are extremely powerful anti-aggro tools for probably the 2 classes that pull the most aggro in XP groups.  This +400 hate tool that you believe doesn't pull aggro off anyone just happens to give you a nice start when it works?  But it's ONLY 400 hate!<br />

You even contradict yourself.  If Incite doesn't work then there wouldn't be any noticeable differnce to use it after Taunt.<br />

Oh, and the RNG... you obviously have no idea what a random number generator looks like if you're complaining about it not being reliable.  That's what random means.  50% success rate doesn't mean succeed and failure alternate over and over again, but I guess that's not easy to grasp.</div></div><hr />

Taking 2 mins to explain to the chanter why they drew agro and how to avoid it is probably a much quicker and more effective solution than trying to convince SoE that you need even more agro, especially when a decent portion of the warrior community here are finding incite to give more than enough agro to do what we need to do.<br />

Its not agro lock and on its own it doesn't pull agro, but it is a good chunk of hate that isn't dependent on the RNG and when combined with your melee and procs is enough to keep agro off any non-retarded enchanter.</div></div><hr />

It's just a stopgap measure, but honestly, the only way to nerf hybrid aggro would be to:<br />
<br />
1. Make all of those snare/stun/fear spells have a negligible aggro component.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2.  Re-itemize so that hybrids and hell, even wizards, don't approach warrior hps in the high end.<br />
<br />
Of course, either of those fixes would cause a backlash and they'd be forced to change hundreds of other things.  If the aggro spells are nerfed, I'm sure the hybrids would just find another spell they have that causes mad aggro... it's not like it hasn't happened before.<br />
<br />
Juice up warrior damage a little and give them some sort of no-fail taunt with a reasonable timer imo.  It's stopgap, but not as stopgap as the other crap they've pulled.<br />

The mechanics are the remarkably similar.  You get a bigger tool kit at 65 but the principles of playing a warrior are remarkably the same.<br />
<br />
You've never seen incite pull agro back off a slowing Shaman?  I do this REGULARLY.  It sounds like other warriors here do to.  Its not guaranteed....but heck I don't think anyone expects it to be.<br />
<br />
Inferna posted the most lucid comment so far: proximity, facing and tagging play a HUGE role in agro aquisition.   Its possible as any class to not get agro if you don't tag, stand on the backside of a mob and fail to strafe to be in the right facing constantly.  The key difference; post Incite, is that if you follow good mechanics as a warrior more times than not you get and keep agro.<br />
<br />
As far as LDoN vs PoE exp vs exp on the darkside of the moon: the difference isn't the zone its the z axis/object characteristics you are wrestling with.  It doesn't matter what zone you are in...it matters what terrain you are fighting in.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;agro lock&quot;.  This has been discussed Ad Nauseum.  I think the general consensus of folks is that most warrs can live with Paladins having it as long as our own agro generation is decent (greatly improved after incite), our mitigation is superior (update helped) and we have inate HP advantage (something I believe SoE is looking into).<br />
<br />
People are calling  a troll Delicious because you are raising you points with the anger and vehemance that was present before the current round of changes.  SoE reads these boards; I think most of again can agree that Incite is not the end of the changes needed but it was a BIG step forward.<br />

I rarely feel that I am seeing a true random.  It seems a poorly seeded and randomized distribution, leading to the famed &quot;streakiness&quot; of the thing.  I haven't parsed it, and I'm not likely to (too indifferent) ... but so far as I am concerned, a truly random distribution of results should not show a distribution pattern.  To me, it's not fully random just because the results over time are equal to a 60/40 spread - for as long as the pass/fail results are bunched or streaky, IMO that's randomized, and randomness occurs when I am unable to see deterministic patterns.<br />
<br />
My skill-ups come in bunches, my hits come in bunches, my misses come in bunches, my procs come in bunches.  (If I flip a coin, and it comes up heads 5 times followed by tails 5 times more often than not, than I say the coin is broken.)  The same sorts of results I used to see with random number code when I skipped a proper reseeding of the generator.  If you ask me, the thing is pseudo-random and not truly random - which is typical of any computer application (nature of the beast) - and the output is deterministic.  I also think that we notice the flaw more in EQ than we might do elsewhere, as we're paying more attention, and we do get a lot of hard data in the feedback.  Perception superceding reality is also likely. :p</div></div><hr />

It's the Taunt SKILL. Just for you I'll say it again.<br />
<br />
Smasher McGurk with a .600 batting average is on your team. If he doesn't get a hit in a game, he studies the video of his at bats with the batting coach. He looks at the pitch selection. He takes extra batting practice. If he doesn't get a hit in the next game, out comes the the computer analysis of his swing compared to his &quot;ideal&quot; swing when he's hitting good. He works on his visualization, preperation, etc. until he's well out of the slump.<br />
<br />
With a skill vs. a coin flip previous results matter. You take extra care after a failure. That is exactly what is wrong with the Taunt SKILL - it's a coin flip.<br />
<br />

Hey battta ... batttttta ... batttttta ... NO BATTAH!<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Taunt is just a coin toss that lands head (succeed) 60% of the time.  Saying taunt should work more often just because it's a skill is like saying after a Wizard lands a nuke that gets fully resisted the next one should do more damage because he'd be more careful aiming that Fireball.  Or saying a FD should fail more often after a fail because the mob's aware you might not be really dead.  You simply have to throw out any *realistic* reasons and just make the skills a coin flip.  If you want to argue logic Taunt should fail more often after a fail because the mob will realize that pounding the cleric turned out to be easier than pounding the warrior so he's more likely to ignore you.  Now that wouldn't be good at all wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
As for the streaky argument, you're confusing alternating between success/fail 60%/40% of the time versus having a 60% random chance to succeed.  A sequence of say S S S S S S F F F F is no more random than say S F S S F S F F S S S even though the latter distribution sure appears to be more 'random' than the first.  <br />
<br />
Now if you can show a distribution like succeed 6 times in a row and then fail 4 times repeatedly showing up in a large portion of the time given a large sample (at least thousands of taunts) then you might have a case, but in any small sample (i.e. anything you happened to notice) the result can be virtually anything.  Anything you can observe by eyeballing is almost certainly too small to be statistically meaningful because you're only capable of observing the special cases by eyeballing.<br />
<br />
A RNG is not different to write.  If you think people can actually screw them up, you probably don't really understand what a sequence of random number looks like.  The previous events do not matter when it comes to a coin flip.  Just because you failed 4 times doesn't meant he game owes you the next taunt to be a success.  The next taunt still only has a 60% chance of succeeding.</div></div><hr />

Are warriors in the shitter like they used to be? No.  Does incite help alot?  Yes it helps a ton.  Do many groups still prefer hybrids over warriors? YES THEY DO.<br />
<br />
Even with incite, a BoC augged with anger3 and a CHoS I can still lose aggro to even just tash on inc.  It was happening 2 nights ago in BoT.  Yes if I have a reasonable round my aggro is fine.  If I have an exceptional round people can chain np.  If I have a bad round suddenly what was fine BEFORE is now causing caster types to get beat upon.<br />
<br />
Thi is the crux of the arguement.  That warrior aggro is STILL unreliable.  Are people lazy and not willing to adapt to a warrior? YES.  Would many groups of 65's with 50+AA's rather get some assembly line xp without having to think....saving energy for when it counts during things like raids and RL jobs etc??  You'd better believe it.<br />
<br />
I seriously believe with 4 aggro procs, the new GoD AA ability to increase proc rate, and Incite, warriors may finally be able to go for hours at a time without having a &quot;critical failure&quot; round resulting in unwanted classes pulling aggro for doing the same things they've been doing for 10 minutes prior.<br />
<br />
Hell what warriors need that would really fix aggro would be an AA allowing them a mainhand proc or 2 on the first swings.  you could call it &quot;Force Process&quot;.  That way after a few rounds everyone would know exactly how much debuffing/doTing, etc they can do on INC and in the first few seconds without worrying about wild aggro fluxes.<br />
<br />
I can't believe all the warriors who came out to flame a SK for stepping forward and saying we still need help on some issues.  This is a guy that has an ADVANTAGE over us in game putting that aside and being HONEST and people flame him?? /boggle<br />
<br />
He never said the changes weren't helpful, or that we shouldn't be grateful.  He simply pointed out the fact that as a SK his aggro is much more versatile and for that reason many casters can and will continue to prefer hybrids over us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">The solution to tash aggro is don't tash.  Most stuff aren't that resistant to require tashing.  Also, stop the bogus arguments about people wanting a Knight for XP groups because it somehow gets them more XP.  I doubt the average EQ players is even that smart but even if they are, unless your server is overflowing with Knights the time it takes you to find a Knight instead of a Warrior would cost you more XP than whatever you happen to save, especially since apparently all XP groups described by people must end after about 30 minutes because there is no way any realistic group can keep up that kind of damage potential (and resulting aggro) for longer than that.   I have formed enough pickup groups for LDoN to know that the time spent waiting for the 'right' class to show up is simply not worth it if you're serious about maximizing your gain per time spent, unless your server just always has 10 Knights ready to LFG for any group.  <br />
<br />
I don't have aggro problems in xp groups, and yes I am probably a lot more powerful than you, but that's what progression means.  There is no reason why any random warrior should be able to pull aggro anywhere close to what I can in PoTime gear.  If you expect that you should have played a Knight while their class is still broken.  I have held aggro with an Obsidian Greatblade (roughly ratio 1 2H with taunting blo)from Sol Ro tower (long before I was in Time) and consider you can buy a Great Staff of Thunder or whatever it's called for around 100pp, don't pretend the tools aren't there.  Was it hard to hold aggro using a Obsidian Greatblade compare to a Vanazir?  Yeah, but it's certainly doable.  And that was before you can augment your weapons too.</div></div><hr />

I would prefer to tash and have my 2nd cast be a slow that lands 90% of the time than have slow resisted the 1st time and then pull agro with the 2nd slow and still have it resist cos its the unslowed mobs that rip you up.<br />
<br />
Also mobs are fairly resistant.  In PoP I always tash then slow and same for hard LDoNs.  In easy LDoN I tend to have one go with my faster casting 50% slow and if that doesnt land then the mobs gonna be at 25% by the time the 2nd cast lands so I just dont bother.<br />

You are supposed to loose agro to tash on incoming.  Sorry, but I doubt very much that SoE wants chanters to be able to cast tash immedietly without any repercutions, because if they did they would lower the agro on it.  The argument that knights are too powerfull at agro is because with a knight chanters can tash on inc.</div></div><hr />

For a ONCE every 30 SECOND ability, Incite should be enough to keep/regain aggro during/from a tash. <br />
<br />
If my weapons dont proc, I loose aggro like I always used to, even with Incite. Yes Incite has helped my pulling, taggin on incoming and increased my long term aggro in long encounters(which I had no problems with).  A guaranteed Anger II proc every 30 seconds is a good thing even if its not enough to hold aggro from a tash. <br />
<br />
My expectations of Incite were that it would allow warriors to regain aggro when taunt failed and procs would not go off.  You know when really needed. Specially those hard adventures where a mob can plaster a caster in 2 rounds. <br />
<br />
There are 3 tank classes and 2 of them can hold/regain aggro from almost anything on demand(in less than 6 seconds). One of them(the warrior) can't unless the RNG allows it. <br />
<br />
The next expansion is going to give the Weapon Afinity AA to warriors, so Incite will be enough at its current state since procs will go off more often. If they are introducing this AA is because they are aware of the current limitations of Incite.</div></div><hr />

The only thing thats stupid is that a knight can cast 1 level 9 stun or snare which the mob will either resist or be immune to and that pisses them off even more.  The agro from low level knight spells needs to be tuned down and then stupid chanters who tash on inc will die with knight tanks aswell as warrior tanks and all will be good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">The premise is correct, incite isn't enough by itself.   The reality is that it should not be nor do I believe that it was designed to be enough on it's own.   It's exactly what it should be, added hate on demand with a reasonable refresh.   It's leaps and bounds more than we had 2 months ago, and it works SO well that with attack off, and using incite only, I was able to easily offtank a Rathe Councilman while our pally was ressed, rebuffed, died again, was ressed, rebuffed (she had terrible luck that day), died AGAIN and was ressed/rebuffed.   A month ago, I couldn't have done this using taunt alone.   <br />
<br />
Paladins and SK's having a fair shot at exp group tanking spots is a GOOD thing, they deserve to have fun playing EQ as much as we do, and they deserve to be able to and considered to be tanks as well.   I dont' even mind them being preferred for tanking in high aggro situations, as LONG as people don't cringe when a warrior is considered.   I dont' believe that people cringe at the thought of warriors tanking any more, so a general preference for one or the other based on group makeup is FAIR and BALANCED which is what I was seeking.    I CERTAINLY didn't want to see the pendulum swing too far in our direction and I strongly believe it hasn't, that they did it just right.</div></div><hr />

The situation is over.  Warriors are more or less fixed - they could use a few tweaks here and there, but so can every other class in the game.  Nothing in this game will ever be perfected (except the Rallos Zek script /drool).<br />
<br />
What you're doing here is trying not to be a martyr - how could someone that has it, as you say, better than everyone else possibly be a martyr? - but you want to act like you're a superior who bemoans out of sensitivity what warriors &quot;have to go through&quot;.<br />
<br />
You're a month too late and a cry for attention now doesn't really do anything productive. <br />
<br />
Warriors have EXACTLY what they asked for...a failure message on taunt, unlinked disciplines, enhanced mitigation, and a definite aggro gainer.  Does it give them aggro lock?  No, they generally don't want aggro lock, it would trivialize quite a bit.  Not to say that aggro is the only issue on raids and groups, things are trivialized enough as is, why do so any further?<br />
<br />
The &quot;I feel for you&quot; card doesn't work to gain attention, especially when it's a month too late.  If anything, this is trying to incite more unnecessary fights between warriors and hybrids - fights that simply don't need to be.  <br />
<br />
When I first started playing (when Kunark was first released) I would hear a class gets a new skill or a new ability and I'd go &quot;hey that's great for that class!  That'll really help in groups!&quot;<br />
<br />
Generally that was the attitude throughout Everquest.  Lately it's turned into &quot;Why the hell should he get that and not me?  That's not fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
That isn't a good attitude, that isn't something that should be promoted in Everquest, and why you're trying to do so is beyond me.  Instead of feigning pity, why don't you express joy that they're &quot;fixed&quot;?</div></div><hr />

More reason for you to have actually been playing recently.<br />
<br />
Quite a few shadowknights, paladins and rangers have been complaining about a stealth nerf to their high aggro spells.<br />
<br />
It's all over the message boards.<br />
<br />
Aggro lock is becoming a thing of the past. SOE is actually working to BALANCE aggro.<br />
<br />
So really, stop trolling. You had over a year of Planes of Power-ness to bring this crap up. Now that it's being worked on, and being fixed, you choose NOW to bring it up?<br />
<br />
Why bother. It's either, a- OLD NEWS, or b- a blatant attempt to troll.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Breako</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I believe that incite works very well to hold the agro. What i don't like is if for some reason the mob turns on the slower and the incite button is greyed then the fricke Tuant should work to get it back off. Not &quot;you have failed to Tuant&quot; message every 6 seconds for a minute. <br />
<br />
IMHO Yes they have helped the agro problem but made Tuant useless beacuse it doesn't work. Incite is 30 sec refresh and Tuant is 6 sec. If you hit your incite button then if mob turns on caster you try to tuant fails 5 times before incite ready to use agian. Lets see in BoT 5 failed tuants= Died caster. At max tuant we should not be failling no where close to that if at all.</div></div><hr />

I read your posts. Taunt is called a skill. There is no escaping the fact that there are different results from applying a skill and random coin tosses.<br />
<br />
There is no difficulty in writing code to simulate a skill. I did it 25 years ago. People did it years before I thought I invented it.<br />
<br />
Skills are skewed to avoid unskill-like runs of failure. Feedback is pretty standard stuff and there's no mystery about it at all.<br />
<br />
Now maybe the developers put this in right from the begining. I don't know. If they have we'd see shorter runs than would otherwise occur.<br />
<br />
If they didn't, then very likely other programers will in other games which won't share this particular deficiency.<br />

<br />
The reason aggro-lock at the moment isn't game breaking is because there is a trade off.<br />
<br />
Paladins cannot take the hits, they will melt under the same pressure a warrior would normally take.  That's the tradeoff...defensive ability.<br />
<br />
So let's give an overview of that:<br />
<br />
<br />
Aggro Lock...<br />
<br />
Advantage: Can Keep Mobs stuck on one target unchangeable<br />
Disadvantage: Classes that can maintain aggro lock cannot survive this aggro lock for long.<br />
<br />
If a warrior can survive AND never lose aggro, it's trivial beyond trivial.<br />
<br />
Aggro lock in the hands of someone who needs extra healing isn't trivial, or at least isn't &quot;as&quot; trivial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No reason for Taunt to work more than 60% just because it's a skill.  And if you make it skill-based there's actually more argument for Taunt NOT to work because frankly it can't possibly take a lot of intelligence for a mob to realize that this warrior yelling profanity at it is a harder target to kill than the guy in a robe.  On anything that ought to have intelligence (non insect, undead, summoned stuff, etc) Taunt shouldn't even work period by the skill argument.  Surely the mobs can consult their own warriors (if not themselves, after all 95% of mobs in EQ are warriors) and realize that warriors are always the hardest person to kill.<br />
<br />
And even if it's 'skill-based' it'd still be random-based.  You might throw in some parameters like factoring some other stats you have versus that of the mobs but ultimately it's still random.  Unless you make it work 100% of the time, of course, but that isn't going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Untrue. The fact is a well geared Paladin can mitigate and absorb 80-90% as well as a warrior.<br />

Taunt should not be any worse than any other skill, and it is. Warriors are the hardest to kill, because the Programmers solution to make the game harder is have the mobs fight at silly abilities. <br />

The whole concept behind EQ is broken, Clerics, Druids, and Shaman (plus others) should be able to tank effectively! Warriors should CRUSH an even. Or can you tell me why it is remotely logical, an untrained blue Lizard, with no combat training can beat and Ogre Warrior who cons red and lives his whole life training to fight? Has God drop weapons and armor too on top of that? Logic has no place in EQ from day one. Don't try to excuse the fact taunt is failing 6 times in a row when nothing else in EQ fails at the same rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have to change anything at all to switch from a warrior main tank to a paladin main tank?<br />
<br />
If the answer is yes, then that disadvantage still stands.<br />
<br />
The paladin DOES require more healing (I assure you, paladins melt in comparison to warriors in some areas) - unless you factor in BoV which is more begrudgingly casted than anything else - on average.<br />
<br />
Now you say that if you beef him up in time gear and whatnot, he can mitigate at 80ish percent a warrior can.  That's great, he can take hits better than an average tank.<br />
<br />
But you can't compare a paladin at time level to a warrior at BoT level, it's simply put not fair.<br />
<br />
Paladins did that once.  They compared a level 65 elemental equipped cleric with his new hammer toy and AA's against a level 60 paladin - could've been a 65 as well - with a ghoulbane with no AA's.  Needless to say, the cleric outdamaged him, and it got the hammer nerfed.<br />
<br />
Now if you want a FAIR comparison, you need to compare the Time paladin to the Time warrior, the Time warrior will STILL be better, the Time paladin will simply be the next best.<br />
<br />
An 8000hp Ranger locks aggro well too, and will out-tank your typical casual EQ player's Warrior<br />
<br />
Good!  It's supposed to be that way!<br />
<br />
End-game melees are supposed to be substantially better than average melees, no matter what class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Knights aren't anywhere close to only 80% of a warrior's tankability.  I'd estimate that number is probably around 95% before the 5% mitigation went in.  Now it's probably in the low 90s.  This is, of course, undisced but then since most people seem to one-tank stuff it only matters whether you survive after the disc runs out.<br />
<br />
If the remaining non-itemization problems are fixed (most notably being able to use a shield for free, and Aura of the Crusader) this will probably drop Knights to below 90% and toward the high 80s in terms of tankability compare to a Warrior.  That'd be appropriate I think...<br />
<br />
Of course, this is on the high end.  Warriors have bigger advantages on the lower end since items aren't nearly as powerful there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Ezedriel, the one thing you are kind of missing here is that at a certain point, more mitiagtion, more hp's etc do not truly offer an exp group much more.  Once you have hit a certain point, healing is not an issue, and then other things are used to determine what class to pick to tank.  Most players these days have passed that point.  An average knight in Bazaar bought gear is not a mana drain on a healer in any zone he is lickely to be exping in, especially with tanking aa's.  There no longer is a true tradeoff for agro lock, as mitigation is not an issue(outside a small handfull of zones), but agro lock still is.<br />
<br />
You are absuletly right tho about not being able to compare end game players with casual players.  A time geared ranger can outtank me.  That is just the nature of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Clearly HP and AC do matter to xp groups because most people don't have the luxury of having Time monks or rangers tanking for them.<br />
<br />
If for some warped reason you really only care about getting more XP your order of tanks would go like Monk - Ranger - SK - War - Paladin (higher in Undead areas).  A Ranger certainly will not lose aggro to just about anyone but you simply don't see groups looking for Rangers for tank, so obviously people still care about HP/ACs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">The trouble with that line of reasoning tho is that an average geared ranger cannot tank well, and healing does become an issue.  Note my use of the words 'Once you reach a certain point'.  Below that point, ac/hp's are an issue, but past them they are not, or at least are not as much an issue.  It is very easy for any of the three plate tank classes to reach that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Past that point, however, warriors still provide quite an edge in tanking, and their DPS is pretty good too, considering.<br />
<br />
It really all depends on the situation and your goals for that evening. <br />
<br />
And seriously do we want to spend even more time trying to come up with the most efficient group makeup for Situation_X when someone else is going to have Situation_Y and it'll always be different?<br />

I.e: RAngers should be the go to guy to drag the mob of the Robey RIGHT Now... just make the tank get it off the Ranger asap pleeeeease.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest issue we have, is the use of low level , low mana spells being used to lock in aggro, then coupled with an almost warrior level tanking ability.<br />
<br />
If  a mob resists the stun spell, (or is immune to it) is he going to view the caster as a threat? {Pitiful pally... your wimpy stuns do not scare me... mmmm Robeys... chewy...} As opposed to &quot;That Mofo STUNNED me... c'mere... where's me can opener&quot;<br />

SKs should have a faster version of incite, as they do now... just not the ability to handle a mob quite as effienciently as a warrior.<br />
