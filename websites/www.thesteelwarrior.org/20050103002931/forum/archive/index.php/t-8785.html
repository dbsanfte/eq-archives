<br />
Fortitude used to be a 12 second melee invulnerablity.  Now according to the Discription in the Combat window, its a glorified Evasive.  I only noticed it after hitting Fortitude during a massive train that I continued getting hit which seemed kinda messed up.<br />
<br />
This is the old Fortitued Description (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4670&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
This is the apparent new Fortitude (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4615&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
This second description is even worse than a glorified evasive.  What use is +60 AC for 12 seconds?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So /disc Fortitude should still render me invulnerable for 12 seconds?<br />
<br />
<br />
If so, then I will /bug report today.  The lucy link says this is Live 8/11, and not just on test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4670&amp;source=Live (Fortitude Discipline)<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4615&amp;source=Live (Fortitude skill)<br />
<br />
The skill is Live but since the Openings thing was scratched, it has no use and doesnt exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My absolute favorite thing about this skill...<br />
<br />
Popping Fortitude at 3% hp... then waiting 10 seconds for the CH to land.  <br />
Gotta love yer cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is also nice for backing into a corner, popping fortitude, and slamming down a gate potion while many mobs are beating on you.  I'm pretty positive it is not broken, as I have used it many times recently.  Perhaps you were taking spell damage as part of that train, or maybe popped Furious instead and took some non-frontal damage...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only things that'll hit you while in Fortitude are spells/procs...and I'm not even sure about proc's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">innate procs will not land, but if the mob is wielding a weapon that procs, it has a chance to go off and it WILL land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octawan</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, if I am not mistaken, mobs behind and to the sides of you will still hit you, so if they are not all in front of you, you will still take damage, just like an enraged mob does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope thats furious.Fortitude will protect you from all sides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sometimes mobs randomly hit through fortitude, tanking reparm just yesterday he landed 1 hit through fortitude. obviously not enough to kill me or anything just odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quarg</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably because fortitude isn't 100% chance to dodge, it's just something like chance to dodge + 10000... meaning there's still a very very very small fraction of a % chance to  not dodge an attack, but in general it means you're pretty much invincible to melee damage.</div></div><hr />
