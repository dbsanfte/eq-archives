Stuns with no listed level limit are lvl55 capped, and the ratio and dd on the sword are worse than the other two options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use this weapon for one reason: The stun proc actually has a duration. A string of 2-3 procs and I can get 6 seconds of damage mitigation, stop a runner for long enough to kill him, keep a caster from casting for longer etc. It's not the best weapon, but for the 1k I paid for it I don't think is a better combination of aggro, decent stats and an altogether usefull proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Everlord</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That May be True, But the Proc from the Bloodsworn is a stun and the CHoS is a Partial Stun, Which Both Generate Agro just aswell...have better Damage/Delay Ratio's and better stats.</div></div><hr />

I never said it was better aggro or a better ratio, merely useful. Right now I feel that there are better upgrades that I can use my money on. I don't remember the last time that I lost aggro in a normal XP group barring a whole fight w/o a proc or a necro that throws poison dots on inc then snares.</div></div><hr />

<br />
His point was that the other sword had a duration stun rather than a 0 second stun.  Both have aggro this one has utility on runners and dmg mitigation as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I guess depending on the wielder's level and what he/she is fighting, there could be some utility in the duration stun.  I answered based on my situation, and that thing wouldn't be stunning many mobs I fight. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Athrias's first point was the utility of the duration stun at that level of the game, and i could see how it would be handy.<br />
However, at level 56 Athrias also appears to be mainhanding a BoC with Yeksha aug on it. I would think that mainhand gives a 56 war some fair latitude in chosing an offhand with utility and still retaining aggo based on the very nice mainhand attributes.<br />
For the original poster, the question is how to maximize aggro and dps. Looks to me like the best dps weapon is the whip, and I don't think you should switch out a CHoS for the sandstone sword. Even on the level of utility, I think a regular group including a shaman and a druid would reduce the need for the sandstone's utility component.<br />
If you're trying to squeeze every bit of dps out, you could do about three LDoNs for the heated blade aug or around five for the icicle aug out of Everfrost (sort of guessing on how many missions it would take. the heated blade is 60 points and the first icicle one is 100 points). They'd add a bit of dps for you without migrating to higher dps weapons that have no aggro procs.<br />
Getting weapons that produce substantially better aggro *and* dps than your current set up outside of raiding and given your level might involve lots and lots of plat.<br />
You are probably already pondering an LDoN Yeksha/Anger III augment combo, so I won't go into that.</div></div><hr />

The biggest reason I was looking at the 2sec stun was due to the casters I am fighting in Nurga.  They seem to channel thru the instant stuns.  With only a druid and shaman, I have no serious stunning ability.  At 55, with a stunning kick, things may change a bit.  But right now, I am having to swap in a shield when I see the casting message to get off a bash.</div></div><hr />
