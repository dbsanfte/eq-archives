Now I am not a great mathmatician and not the best at gramar so if you wish to correct me please feel free to. Also I hope it makes sence if it does not let me know and I can explin what I mean :)<br />
<br />
<br />
First lets look at the agro cheep generating spells (the high end say they never use the low level spells to generate agro (I would stake a large sum of plat on the fact in some cases they do IE low on mana whatever even if they don¡¦t I know 60¡¦s use them either way it kind a moot point we could argue all day about it only SoE has the ability if even they do to poll the server to see what people have memed.)<br />

Ok then lets take me as a example on mana and I for one do not have a big mana pool but for the sake of argument lets use my stats. magelo is below so you can check it yourself. as I am only 60 will have to take the spells above 60 out of the equation.<br />
<br />
Base Direct Indirect Total <br />
MANA 1140 305 960 2405 <br />
<br />
ok so 2405 is my mana pool without KEI. (Not sure how much the wis from KEI adds to the mana pool.<br />
<br />
Koadic's Endless Intellect <br />
<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1: Increase Mana Pool by 250 <br />
2: Increase Mana by 14 per tick <br />
3: Increase INT by 25 <br />
4: Increase WIS by 25 <br />
<br />
So I have 2655 mana without the mana from the wis added by KEI (not sure how much mana that adds)<br />
<br />
ok based on these numbers I can cast (not including mana regen we will get to that):<br />
<br />
Quellious' Word of Serenity:     13 <br />
Force of Akilae:                       40 <br />

Holy Migh                                44<br />
Stun                                        75<br />
Desist                                      106<br />
Cease                                      177<br />
Flash of Light                            221<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so now lets assume the average 60+ fight with groups going full burn last 1 min and 1 min for a pull so we have a 1 min window of standing regen and a 1 min window of sitting regen (if pally is not the puller) so we have a total of 20 ticks to regen mana. <br />
<br />
With KEI (not even looking at the higher end mana regen spells which most 60+ will have on them) the pally will regain 150 mana just standing there and fighting. Assuming the pally is not pulling and regen 20 mana sitting he/she will gain back 340 mana while the pull is happening. Now mind you I am not sure on the normal fight times for groups if someone would like to correct me then fine correct me ƒº so in 2 min 490 man is replaced. Lets say for argument sake not that I want to start any the pally does not mem any low level stuns the are using the 64 and 63 one. On inc they pop the mob with the Quellious then pop the mob at camp with Force Of Akilae that uses 265 mana at this point they have pretty solid agro to allow the casters to nuke at will lets say they use both spells one more time. (they also get self buff weapon procs that add agro and if have a proc weapon they will get even more agro) so the we spend 530 mana to keep agro. And we regain 490 mana so we loose 40 mana in between fights this means we can sustain agro lock for how long kiddies? 132 minuets! Granted this includes no secondary heals to the enc or whatever but with the pally tanking there is no need to heal them as only the pally gets hit unless of course the pally is sleeping on the job. So for over 2 hours a pally can sustain agro loc and we all know people afk which allows pallys to med back to full so we have a indefinite agro lock going on here.<br />
<br />
The above numbers were pulled with a level 60 mana pool using 64 and 63 stuns so obviously a level 65 pally will have quite a bit more mana.<br />
<br />
So how do we correct this imbalance here? IMHO no one should be allowed to lock agro indefinitely. So the solution would have to mathematically make it impossible to lock agro for a indefinite period of time. (by lock agro I mean keep so high on the hate list there is no chance of a burner getting agro.) To keep it simple lets see what happens when we double the mana cost on the 64 and 62 stuns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quellious now costs 400 per cast and force would now cost 120 per cast. Again using my mana pool and the 1 min to kill and 1 min to pull formulas we get. To cast both stuns twice would now cost 930 mana and we will regain 490 mana during fight and pull time. Now we loose 440 mana and with my mana pool this still allows me to go 10 min without having to med now this is more like it maybe a bit much but a lot closer to balance then we have now.<br />
<br />
I will not even go into the low level spells as it is pointless at this time. But i will state Flash of light should have a level limit :)<br />
<br />
So in short if a stun does not lad it should not agro (SoE can change the stun procs if warriors are worried about the weapons they use for agro so that they hit up to level what 65? If you are fighting above 65 mobs I would assume you have access to better weapons but I could be wrong (in fact I am wrong a lot). Raise the mana cost and possible tone down the agro a bit on the stuns (I know they can do this cause our AA stun does not cause much agro). This still allows pallys to have much better agro control then warriors, just that they cannot do it indefinitely in a exp group.<br />
<br />
To help warriors I would suggest changing shield to not affect the current tank classes exclude them those being warriors SK¡¦s ans pally¡¦s then change it so th shielded person takes only 25% of the dmg from the mob and the warrior takes 75% dmg from the mob (get rid of the extra dmg shield causes to the warrior IMHO there is no need for the extra dmg assigned to the war) I mean from a RP perspective if you stand in front of someone wielding a sword you would mitigate the sane as you normally would just the person would be trying to hit past you at the person behind you.) and increase the range a bit not much just a bit and also make it if the person is not in range the war does not waste shield IE like the change to LoH  so you cannot LoH a corpse and so on.<br />
<br />
IMHO once we bring balance somewhat close again then classes can cry and whine and play class envy all they want :)<br />
<br />
Discalimer.<br />
<br />
Sk's prolly needed looked at also but seeing as I have never played one past like 12 I ca NOT speak for the changes that they need I can only speak for the class I play. if you wish to discuss what needs to be done to sk's that's fine but mu input would be worthless as I do not know the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite simply I'm stumped.  What is the point of all of this?<br />
<br />
You can double and probably quadruple the amount of mana it takes to cast a stun and a Paladin can still hold agro over a given fight.  The only thing you change by screwing with the mana and amount of agro is the timing.<br />
<br />
If it is your attempt to hobble the lower end Paladin this is exactly the way to it.<br />
<br />
If you really wanted to restrict the amount of times a Paladin can use a stun change the reset/cooldown time.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, how does this help Warriors in any stretch of the imagination?  Why is this even topical?  It doesn't change how Paladins behave on any particular pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not hobble pallys it's to bring them closer to warriors. you know the thing called balance. I don't care about the amout of times they can cast it what i care about is unlimited aggro by rasing mana cost the exp group has to wait for the pally to med eventually as it is now they don't have to the pallys can hold aggro indefinately.<br />
<br />
It doesent help warriors at all it brings the classes closer to balance. onc that is done then you can work on improving if improving is needed.</div></div><hr />

nice insite there did not think I had to say it since I said it many times but I cannot speak for SK's someone else will have to balance them to warriors. SoE has stated they should be able to generate hate hence the hate spells they are givin but how much and if it's mana effective I cannot say.<br />
<br />
But again NICE insite there gimmel thanks for the post.<br />

<br />
 and since I am in one of thoes modes.<br />

I should have known that at some point in your alcohol-addled posting history that you must have said something somewhere about SKs that now makes you immune to criticism.

I'm a lousy typist, but geez man, the fact that you are a tester in Windows explains so much to me about software quality.<br />

If you ever bothered to read my posts at the PoN (oh wait, you're banned!), you would realize there is only one sycophant in this thread, and it's not me. Get off the &quot;I got banned from PoN! Nerf paladins! Please like me!&quot; kick, it's tiresome.</div></div><hr />

I find it humorus they banned me cause of my views do fell teh need to point it out. and btw nice comeback bet ya took a long time to think that out and type it.<br />
<br />
My gramar/puncutation has nothing to do with my testing ability. it ever occur to you that most geniuses have problems with easy stuff?? I am not saying i am one just pointing it out. Kind of like a friend i have they have issues with addidtion and subtraction and the such but they know high ordr math it's not even funny shit i cant even comprehend. I do not test the text or manuals in windows so I have no need to be gramtically or punctually correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
and I have said many times I cannot speak for the SK&quot;s but I am sure you neglected to reconise that on purpose.<br />
<br />
and I read all of your post's at PoN just have to log out from the account they banned :p</div></div><hr />

Well you knew you might get flamed for this one Pally boy :D  <br />
<br />
He'd also get flamed if he came out and said Defensive is too strong.  It doesn't make it a good arguement. ^_^<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but Apothes has a narrow view of Paladins if all he sees is stuns.  A narrow and incorrect view at that.<br />
<br />
And no you got banned for constantly flaming.  It had nothing to do with your ridiculous ideas but more with the fact that you called people names.<br />
<br />
So by your own admition the post is nothing but an attempt incite people to respond negatively (no flaming has happen yet).  Yeah...this is the same old Apothes. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That possibly solves the narrow problem of stun agro--but at this point there is so much mana that any agro producing spell will give a hybrid a significant advantage in agro generation over a warrior. <br />
<br />
So campaining on a warrior board for a narrow paladin nerf, while not addressing the larger issue is not likely to win you a lot of points. Add to that that is not a complete solution and would likely require hand tuning of the whole of SK and Pally spell lines, and many of use are not to taken with the idea. <br />
<br />
Add to that you are asking for a nerf of a brother class on a warrior board, where feelings are already running high, and I think you are aksing for trouble. <br />
<br />
Given the combative nature of your sig and responces... *shrug*<br />
<br />
1) Its not a complete solution<br />
2) Your numbers are completely fungible. 1 minute between pulls is way too long. Humming XP groups should be continously fighting. No more than 15 seconds between mobs. <br />
3) Still does not solve the probkem that for 10 or more (or less) minutes you have on demand, agro, which you can maining for a long time.<br />
4) There is no reason, as people hit 65, that defesive warriros are needed on many encounters, even outside uber guilds. Knights will make more sence.<br />
5) Knight can technically significantly reduce damange spikes by not swining at mobs. I remember, and I beleive this was pre-PoP an SK keeping Vindi agro by casting only. Guess how many times he was reposted. <br />
6) This is not a Pally board, while you are dealing with--as presented, a Pally only issue. It does not belong here. <br />
7) Even the core of your idea is not expandable to even other Pallly spells, much less the SK spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't help but really be kind of more for a nerf back than a fix really. I just think the kind of aggro locking ability they have put in the game trivializes the group fighting the same way warriors having the ability would trivialize raid situations. I fight with a 65 Palli friend often and I am 65  warrior myself. When we group he will cast his stun 2-3 times the entire fight usually and play his cleric the rest of the fight. It gets to where it's kind of funny when someone doesn't push right and you watch the mob stay aggro'd on him as it moves around and he's not even facing it for minutes at a time. I am not sure what they could do to nerf back the locking ability and still leave Palli's as a nice tanking class but I think they should look at it. Being able to lock a mob down just takes to much of the skill out of the game to me.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why doesn't his ability not nerf most raid encounters? You think he could MT Vindi? HoT? Dozekar? AoW? <br />
<br />
I think you are falling into a trap by saying that his ability does not trivialize raid encounters. If it isn't yet, it will be soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ability of knights to gain aggro is not a new ability, and it doesn't trivialize the game anywhere but in zones that have already been made so trivial that aggro control is the only thing left that is even remotely challenging (like PoP). No one cared much that a knight could lock aggro on a single frog in Seb, because lack of aggro control didn't get people killed, multiple mob pulls and repop did. In these situations, the aggro control to tankability ratio gap was still just as wide, but it didn't matter, because aggro control wasn't the be all end all ability. Nerf knight aggro and then rangers and beastlords are going to start looking even more attractive as tanks, and I don't think that's what anyone wants.<br />
<br />
That's why I don't want to see knight aggro gimped, because it wasn't so out of whack in everything pre-PoP, and would just serve to nerf knights in areas where they weren't really broken before PoP, and encourages devs to keep on making mobs in the PoP template. I'm hoping that content after PoP isn't going to be the same lame &quot;single pull trash mobs that hit like Vindi&quot; paradigm. Aggro control doesn't trivialize exp groups, SOE already did that. Aggro control doesn't make things boring or trivial, exping in the level 65 equivalent of Dreadlands does. The problem is that there are no alternatives. As far as I'm concerned, PoP is a lost cause, give warriors an aggro boost to make it until the next expansion. They certainly do need it, since the ability of players to generate aggro has scaled up far faster than the warrior's ability to generate aggro. Then give us properly designed zones and the problem will cease to exist, just like before PoP. Then nerf the hell out of the PoP ZEM so that everyone forgets this lame expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I meant was I keep hearing that for warriors to have aggro locking capabilities that it would  make raid encounters trivial. I think that any aggro lock makes the raid and group enounters trivial. I don't mind if they keep it in the game, I take advantage of it also. Like i said i fight with my Palli friend 2 boxing a cleric all the time. I just do not think being able to lock it down that tight should be in the game at all. I miss the day when someone had to know when to cast or when to sit in groups. Now that stuff just gets saved for the raids.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm do you all even read my post? yeah I want a nerf but in no way does it not allows the pally to still lock aggro just there would be a penalty of having to med after 10 min in my chars case and mana pool usign 65 spells which he cannot so it would be longer for a 65 before needing to med. I also put in a solution for warriors to keep the debuffers alive. I swear every one has thoier fucking blinders on lately and fingers in thier ear saying laslalalalallala</div></div><hr />

Not fizzles, something more involved that would atleast take the reliabiity down some, 5-10% maybe. I just the the aggro generated from the stun spells specificly is to much. By no means do i want a total nerf back to the Kunark days but a little tuning down to atleast make some unreliability would be more what I would want to see.......</div></div><hr />

Couldn't have said it better myself. Oh wait, yes I could, but the point still is valid, though perhaps not for who you meant....<br />

I swear Apothes, you are becoming the Goodwind of the SW board. You are like Bizarro Goodwind (which explains your grammar). It must be a paladin only skill. He's far more entertaining though.<br />
<br />
Let's put this very simply: Before PoP, could knights lock aggro cheaply and indefinately? If so, was this a major balance issue at the time? If not, then why not?<br />
<br />
The problem is not the ability, it is the environment. Nerfs are not the best answer, especially one like yours that doesn't even address the entire issue.</div></div><hr />

Make zones harder to pull and you get the monks a job yes but given that people are realising how little difference there is in the tanking ability of knights and warriors now (MUCH less than the difference between Warriors/Knights and Rangers/Beastlords) why would anyone put up with less than total control of a mob? Make em hit less hard so the durability of the tank means even less? Not many people are gonna sweat even a well equipped ranger tanking light hitting mobs these days it seems heals just don't drain the mana pool like they used too. I'm at a loss to understand how changing the zones away from DL central will actually help when considering who you choose to tank.....Specialised zones and multiple mobs or whatever would play to even more of the knights strengths...<br />
<br />
The idea of opening up the warrior class to greater utility is great yes but without a total redesign what can we expect to get?</div></div><hr />

I think you have to admit that they were. Any time that the mobs don't hit hard enough that the mob has to be slowed immediately and the warrior can take a few seconds to build aggro without getting beaten to a pulp makes snap aggro much less valuable. Combine that with a warrior aggro and dps increase, perhaps a warrior only mitigation bump, and mobs that mitigate slow (to make the warrior hp gap more meaningful), perhaps some random mobs that proc a small mana drain, and I think that warriors would be in a pretty good spot.</div></div><hr />

I am not trying to be entertaining, if you find it as such more power to ya.<br />
<br />
So you want mobs changed and not knights humm ok lets thrown in 25% of the mobs in every zone now mem blur themselves randomly. ummm 15% of the mobs nor randomly FD the current target ummm 5% of the mobs now specifically go for healers no matter what they are on the hate list if your healing you are numero uno 1 um what else can we do to make fighting interesting again. 25% of all mobs now proc a 500 mana drain spell on their current target. what else there has to be more ummm 15% of all mobs now proc silence on their target. Lets see there has to be more out there we can do to make it balanced with mobs ummm well that's all I can think of for now. this would affect all mobs in all zones. Make the change to /shield I suggested and balance is once again achieved.<br />

<br />
Make aggro random so the mob randomly chooses people to beat on that are on it's aggro list.<br />

<br />
Actually I remember Frodlin mentioning how he predicted this problem back in SoL Days. <br />
<br />
Aggro Lock back in Kunark was considered balanced by the dev's by the fact that the knight couldn't hold a candle in relative tankability to the warrior. That perception held warriors in the spotlight through Velious and SoL (during which itemisation,  spells, and upgrades to the knight defensive package eroded much of that superiority). With PoP and the great use for Aggro lock knights were thrust into the spotlight and lots of people suddenly realised that &quot;hey, they don't fall over!&quot;<br />
<br />
I have to think that now people know they're onto a good thing (total mob control) that most people will stick with the ease offered by a knight because there isn't any real cost to doing so <br />
<br />
Can you really suggest that with hp, AC and etc totals being boosted by level 65 and numerous AA's we can go back to mobs that hit for less? Seems like we'd be trivialising things even further if we did that. Similarly i don't like the idea of a blanket fix by upping my mitigation further. Adding and adding and adding to everyone is what got us into this mess, heh. <br />
<br />
<br />
Lets just take a snippet from Wraq's post...<br />
<br />
I fight with a 65 Palli friend often and I am 65 warrior myself. When we group he will cast his stun 2-3 times the entire fight usually and play his cleric the rest of the fight. It gets to where it's kind of funny when someone doesn't push right and you watch the mob stay aggro'd on him as it moves around and he's not even facing it for minutes at a time. <br />
<br />
Do you really think this occurrance can EVER be justifiable in the game? it's pretty clearly broken that that amount of control  should be available without any real cost in terms of risk. It will remain broken even if you alter the environment to 'cover it back up' although as i said i'm not so sure that now the cat's out of the bag you will be able to cover it.<br />
<br />
Even IF we get lots of upgrades, many people prefer the sure thing, it's easier and simpler it's what made the Warrior king back in Kunark, because it was a DRAG to have a knight tanking with their high maintenance cost. Nowadays the warrior and his lack of aggro is the drag....If we boost warrior aggro to be comparable enough to make them a good choice then we're removing an important part of the risk involved. If we give warriors a significantly large upgrade to mitigation to attempt to offset the 'lock' advantage then I'd hate to see how the rest of the game would be trivialised by it. Or are you suggesting that exp should be nerfed in the older zones so that you MUST go only to the new ones? That didn't go down to well in PoP. What are the soloer's gonna make of 'special' mobs?<br />
<br />
What about the level 65 people currently gearing up through the older content? Aren't the raid mobs trivial enough yet? Paladins and SK's are already becoming more viable than warriors against many Velious and SoL era mobs due to their aggro control. You want to place warriors on steroids up against that stuff? Or are you gonna insist on cramming everyone back into the smallest box of viable raid mobs possible?<br />
 <br />
Ahem, back to Aggro lock.<br />
<br />
Remember, arguing that knights had aggro control before PoP and it wasn't unbalanced then is a false arguement since back before POP  most knights WEREN'T tanking (due to skewed perceptions it appears in hindsight) so the vast majority of people (myself included) didn't notice how the balance was shifting out of line. No doubt some people were noticing how great it was then and that's great for them but the vast majority hadn't twigged to it. <br />
<br />
Had i known then what I've now found out I'd have been arguing against 'Aggro-lock' back then, I don't think giving me my own version of it is a good thing :p<br />
<br />
Just out of interest, If we need to give paladins a more defined role how about we add more healing ability to paladins so they can be a viable alternative to a Cleric in a party? Tell me why that's a worse idea than the current situation where they can take the place of a warrior without any real drawbacks? :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before PoP, it wasn't that people didn't realize that knights couldn't aggro lock, I know I did, it's that it wasn't that big a deal (and bringing up Kunark is just silly because the classes weren't even remotely balanced at that time. Paladins were a running joke, and nobody even wanted them in their groups, much less tanking for them). It wasn't the single largest factor determining groups success, and that is simply because of how hard the mobs hit. Mob damage output scaled up WAY faster than pcs. Before PoP, and after the exp changes, Juggs were pretty representative of an exp mob that level 60s would grind on. Juggs are level 58 and have a max hit of 187. Golems in PoV are 62ish and have a max hit in the high 600s. PoP mobs are different than the mobs that came before, period. Make mobs that are like scaled up Pre-pop mobs, in a real dungeon, and the issue would not be anything near as bad as it is today.<br />
<br />
As far as paladins being made better healers, it would be a pretty radical change to the paradigm of the paladin, one I suspect that paladins wouldn't want. I guess it's just my D&amp;D background, but I have always seen Paladins as primarily a tank class, I think it's pretty obvious that is what they are intended for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I fail to see why it's acceptable for warriors to be less useful as a tank than a warrior that sacrificed something for spells -  that doesn't fit the D&amp;D paradigm either eh? And lets not forget the Roleplay and other limitations that made Paladins less popular which do not have any concrete effect on computer game mechanics....it's not really a valid arguement. <br />
<br />
I know at least one paladin that wrote to this board considered himself a defensive healer/warrior, he just wanted to be viable in a group - currently paladin healing (we're told) is too poor to make them as valuable as they need to be to get a group in that position so why not boost them in that direction? <br />

Actually, IF you could askk every post 60 warrior, If they would give up DEFENSIVE for real skills and usefull abilities to make us truly better tanks... <br />
<br />
I think it would be almost unanimous...<br />
<br />
But then I regard Defensive as almost as Bad as EB for warriors.<br />
It was another bandaid added by EQ to warriors, this one to fix the fact that we no longer had a significant tanking advantage over knights. <br />
<br />
Give me a SEPERATE mitigation table, and you can have your defensive. And comparing Defensive to Pally Aggro lock is a red herring.. 3 minutes of glory every 9 minutes or so, with a huge nerf in DPS.. to INFINITE aggro lock... no comparison in the difference in powers.<br />
<br />
Also on a side note...<br />
Was playing in POV on my 59/60 shaman.<br />
63 Pally MT, was PULLING so no med time for him. <br />
Outer caves.<br />
He would cast stun to stop the mob as soon as it made it across the rocks.<br />
I would malos/ini as soon as in range, chain cast SLOW, Chain cast cripple, chain Epic dot, chain Bane of Knife, chain Envenomed Bolt, Chain Plague... Thast 500 damage in dots a tic.. also had 2 wizzy going nuke crazy 3k+  nukes...<br />
<br />
Oh, did i say I never got hit?  Nor the wizzies...<br />
and we had a 59 druid as main healer...<br />
<br />
Thats not over powered at all...<br />

Oh and without KEI, just BST crack/PoTC... we only had to stop to med when the druid was LOM... about every 1 hrs, for 5 min, when we switched to a 61 Cleric as MH... My Group buffs wore off 3 times, and we never medded...</div></div><hr />

So then you have a paladin with less tankability and more healing power, which is pretty much...a cleric. Whatever floats your boat.<br />

<br />
You assume that paladins were balanced before they brought up their mitigation, though pretty much everyone knows they weren't. Paladins sucked, hard. If something is out of balance, you don't balance it by bringing one thing up and reducing something else an equivalent amount. That simply rearranges the imbalance.<br />
<br />
To radically improve a class that is already one of the premier tanks in the game to have cleric class healing without reducing the tanking ability would be....dumb. <br />
<br />
I KNOW THERE IS AN AGGRO GAP. I know that the warrior tankability advantage is miniscule compared the knight aggro advantage when fighting PoP mobs. Trying to convince me that warriors are at a disadvantage is wasted time, because I already agree with you. I KNOW IT IS TRUE. I've spent the last 4 months or more arguing this on the PoN board, and made lots of enemies and pissed lots of paladins off in the process because I won't shut up about it. I just don't think that nerfing knight aggro is the right fix.</div></div><hr />

Dumb. However they shouldn't be a head and shoulders better choice as tank.<br />
<br />
You've still not provided an answer to my questions about how boosting my aggro/mitigation/DPS might mess up the old content in game. Nor have you looked at the question of wether just maybe given the escalation in character/group power in PoP the mobs really are balanced to the groups potential at this time. People do survive with warriors in group as tank so removing aggro lock (not ALL spell aggro) shouldn't kill peoples ability to exp. Why should making knights compete on a nearer even footing (given they can now compete much better durability wise) be unbalanced?<br />
<br />
Making it so no one has any trouble controlling a single mob just makes for more boring grind. If a pally wants burst aggro then have him stun multiple times at high mana costs for hecks sake, he still has his 'role' if he wants it :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
My number one alt is a mage, so saw that comment and had to say something(while I sit lfg on mage in fact...59 today by god).  As a mage, I do no more damage with a knight MA than with a warrior MA.  I just time it out a bit different.  With a knight MA, I Malosini on inc, followed immedietly by sirrocco, then either another sirrocco, or a small nuke, depending on mana.  Only difference with a knight MA is I hold off on casting that first sirrocco a bit.  I still get just as many casts in.  So for me, agro lock is almost a non issue as far as my mage is conserned.  Does not help much with issue at hand, but lfg is boring, so thought I would add these comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah well, I suppose nothing will satisfy some of you until you see it in action. Here are my predictions:<br />
Pure melees get a DPS boost in the next couple months, probably fairly minor.<br />
Warriors will get a minor taunt tweak, perhaps simply bumping up the success rate a bit.<br />

<br />
1. Change it so that a person at the top of the hate list can only be above the next highest person by say 200 hate? for the first say 30 seconds of aggro then resume old style hate(random number there Say cap it at about one nuke so a nuker or slower is going to steal aggro from the Knight regardless of how many stuns or whatever. but they can gain it back and a war can use the improved shield to protect his debuffers) this gets rid of aggro lock.<br />
<br />
So in short on the first 30 seconds a mob is aggroed the hybrid will not be able to massivly load the aggro list basically be on par with the war. then after that the hate list would return to the way it is now. This still may not quite bring the balance back but it would be a start<br />
<br />
Also implement my changes to shield and I would consider everything fairly balanced.<br />

Oh this change would only be for non raid type mobs as doing to raid type mobs would make it a bit tough hehe<br />

My memory is getting fuzzy about those times but if I got to 4K HP, our guild's main Warrior could get to 5K.  Back then 1,000 HP is a lot of efficiency in exp groups back then.  As Gimmel mentioned players in exp groups tended to die because of unclean pulls (the reign of the Monk puller) and failure of CC.<br />
<br />
Back in the Velious and Luclin eras you stuck your high HP tank out in front because it is maxing efficiency.  In POP you do it because it is the only way you can make the group work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back in Velious 1000 hps constituted a much larger proportion of the characters hps and a much heavier impact on the healers mana pool. How does making mobs hit less hard so that when things go wrong the tank just sit 's there and yawns while everyone sorts out the add make the game (and the tanks relative hp levels) less trivial? Especially when you're still garanteeing a mob will stick to your tank? The more sure things (ability to survive for long periods without support, ability to control a mob with ease) you add to the game the less pressure on the party the less likely that risk will actually exist, the more experience grouping (which is just as vital to peoples enjoyment of the game as raiding) becomes a dull, tedious waste of your hours online. <br />
<br />
Back in Velious don't forget many people still felt (perhaps rightly, perhaps not) that they HAD to use the Warrior with inferior aggro control to Tank the mob due to the high maintenance cost of knights (this basic 'balancing point' is RIGHTLY gone). We cannot turn the clock back because everyone (especially spell casters (read healers) who have much less reliance on gear and AA's) is that much more powerful now...<br />
<br />
I don't see that these arguements fly because they don't consider the changes to the basic power structure that have occurred over the course of Velious/Luclin/PoP....<br />

Bleh, whatever, hug your aggro control /shrug if you can't see how leaving something obviously out of balance in place (even if you CAN wallpaper over it) is a bad move then there's no way I can reason with you.</div></div><hr />

The start of this thread was talking about the case for lowering stun aggro (lowering being the key word). I think it is a little valid. I do play with a pally friend in groups and we are both level 65. He can cast stun 2-3 times in CoD or BoT and turn attack on then switch to his cleric the remainder of the fight and never lose aggro. I just do not think that kind of lock should be in the game at all. Not taken away completely....just toned down a little.</div></div><hr />

I am just confirming a little back history.  The environment has changed dramatically which is why we are even discussing this.<br />
<br />
In Velious and Luclin, people didn't mind stray agro as much.  For goddess sake I could solo Velktor spiders and Grey Skeletons.  No one spider or skeleton was a serious problem for a caster for any particular moment in backed up by an exp group operating normally.  Keeping agro tight meant a more efficient group.  People frowned on stray agro as more an anoyance than anything.<br />
<br />
Now in POP, any tank can break the 7.5K HP level (heck I bet casters can too).  Keeping agro focused on the tank means living instead of dying.  Casters will just plain die if agro isn't constantly focused off of them.<br />
<br />
For the longest time I reserved spell slots 6,7,8 for stuns.  Initially it was Stun, Holy Might, Force.  Later it morphed into Cease, Desist, Stun.  Now I only use two spells FoA and Serenity plus Divine Stun.  I didn't load these because of the huge amounts of casting monsters I faced daily in Velious and Luclin. ^_^ I loaded because it helped me control the monster and helped people escape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for the aggro locking and casters not being able to get hit at all period but...  Most of the casters i seem to get grouped with can take some hits. If it was toned down some it wouldn't mean it wouldn't work the same as before on some fights. It just would not work on every fight. Warriors do not have that kind of aggro lock currently and we still do tank in pop sometimes. It does not mean that every caster in our groups get killed every time because we can not lock down the aggro. It just means they have to know more about what they are doing than just casting at will. I wouldn't want it toned down so much that it was not useful...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone bother to play any of their low lvl alts recently?  Or did we all quit them b/c we can't get C3 anymore? j/k<br />
<br />
Seriously, a thought has been turning in my head and just wanted to share it.  I was playing my lvl 28 shammy the other day and I got to thinking.  What exactly is it that they have done with the recent group exp bonus and the lvl requirement for spells like C3 being enforced?  Chew on it for a second.  <br />
<br />
It seems to me that they have gone a long way towards rebalancing the game, at least at the lower lvls.  The group exp bonus is once again making grouping a viable alternative to soloing.  The same goes for a lack of C3, no longer are people able to solo to their hearts content without stopping, they must med break occastionally.  Indeed, grouping seems to be faster and more efficient to me than soloing anymore at the lower lvls.  <br />
<br />
So what does this have to do with warrior aggro and tankability?  People are forced to group again, and such learn the general rules of aggro control and grouping that have been so lost in the recent lvl to 50 solo-grind that EQ has become.  I have NEVER seen more enchanters, necros, and mages looking for groups as I have since the patch that added the group exp bonus.  <br />
<br />
Mana is yet again a concern for the healer in the group.  Without a bottomless pool of mana to draw upon it again becomes imperative that the person most capable of taking the beating gets the beating.  Also, pally_01 is no longer capable of chain casting his stuns to the same extent that I am no longer capable of chain casting heals on him.  <br />
<br />
So what does this have to do with the original post?  I guess I'm trying to show how the lvl requirement on C3 and some of the other recent changes they have made has restored at least some balance back to at least the low end of the game.  Maybe the bottomless pool of mana is in fact the real problem here.  I'm not sure about that, but if them enforcing the lvl requirement for C3 is any indication, perhaps limiting mana/increasing mana costs will be SOE's eventual fix to the problem.  <br />
<br />
So what am I suggesting?  Nothing.  I'm not supporting any type of nerf, or advocating any particular fix.  Just sharing my thoughts and giving you something to think about :)</div></div><hr />

When I looked at trends of hps/mana over time, one of the things that jumped out is the relative explosion of mana pools -- especially those of the hybrids. Coupled with mana regen increasing from both items and spells, plus new spells, and that's a lot of extra power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arny</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do play with a pally friend in groups and we are both level 65.

<br />
Then you need some more dps! <br />
<br />
I play a pally/cleric/necro combo (amongst others) and in pop zones I cannot agro lock a mob by casting only 3 stuns. With my necro in full flight I have to chain stun from the start of the fight to the end if I want to hold unshakeable agro, even then one fizzle and I can lose it. Granted this is the extreme and can easily be avoided by waiting untill the mob is around 85% before the necro applies the majority of the dots, even then I still need to stun the moment it refreshes but I can get away with just using the one stun then.  <br />
<br />
The point is complete and easy agro lock is a falisy! Holding this sort of agro will typicaly cost me about 35%-40% of my mana bar per fight when 3 boxing (no kei as I twitch my pally near the end of the fight with my nec .....gotta love 50 points of mana regen per tic). If I have kei or better then i can stun all day long and remain fm. <br />
<br />
The probem as I see it with raising the mana costs or lowering the agro on stun is that you screw the less well equipped characters (low ft and mana pools) and their groups, while leaving the better equipped ones mostly unaffected. You also open up the possibility of other stunning classes, eg clerics, being able to stun lock mobs with no consequences.<br />
<br />
My *fix* to the current problem would be to give warriors some kind of quick agro that can only be used in the first 10 to 20 seconds of a fight and that doesn't work on raid mobs, how? I have no clue that is soe's job, or increase the group size to around 9 so pallies and warriors can group together on a more regular basis. Given a warriors tanking abilities and a pallies agro they really do work together quite well!</div></div><hr />

Hybrids are fine in POP because they do something else than just melee.  Casters are strong in POP and Paladins are very casterish.<br />
<br />
Only now in the twilight of POP I see how badly my melee skills have whithered.  I still seek out HP items but I'm far more excited by getting an FT item.  I would kill for an IH IV item.  Furious Bash rocks not because of bashing but because I can multiply my hate through spells multiple times.  The last 20 some AA points have all been for caster abilities.  If I can't hit a target because of the the other melee trying to scrambling over each other to get to the monster I just stand back and heal.<br />
<br />
These are all symptoms of how out of wack things have gotten.  Every Hybrid class has been shielded from this because they can stand back and cast or do something else.<br />
<br />
So the question in my mind is how to fix the Pure Melee classes to address this.  I don't believe monkeying with casters is necessary.  What ability and skills can Pure Melee get to balance the raw power of casting?</div></div><hr />

It should not be as simple as casting one or two spells before contact though, not with a plate tank. Make Knights have to work at aggro lock on the initial contact (as a warrior needs too) make the difference in ability less clear cut and then people can decide who to tank on other factors. As has been said casters don't die all the time with a warrior tanking even right now, balance in my mind calls for all plate tanks to have aggro generation either around warrior level or slightly higher. Not where it currently stands. Improving my ability to near knight levels doesn't seem like a 'good' fix to me. Much as i detest the random element of taunt/aggro push button aggro (at it's present level) is worse for the game. In all honesty this thread doesn't address warrior to knight balancing so much as a fault with the current aggro generation methods....</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thread about mana being borked only touches on it.  As much as anyone thinks Paladin/SK mana is too strong its stronger for casters.  And they have the stronger effects and are often more flexible.  Every class that can cast saw a jump in strength and skill.  That is important enough to repeat: every class that can cast saw a jump in strength and skill.<br />
<br />
As shocking as it is, exp groups have been trivalized for awhile.  Exp groups since the days of Lower Guk and SolB have always been about tight control of monsters.   Player attitudes are still the same: clear as many monsters as possible by controling as many monsters as possible without killing yourself.  By saying &quot;agro lock trivializes the game&quot; is odd since every one in the group seeks to &quot;trivalize&quot;, in their own ways, the exp monsters as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm off track here but every time I see &quot;agro lock trivializes exp groups&quot; I think &quot;Do Warriors really think its a bonus to not have agro lock?&quot;  Please tell me what this means.  More importantly tell me why Warriors shouldn't have some access to solid agro generation?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The balance needs to be closer to (not right at) warrior level or there's no RvR ( on a tangent I'm not a massive fan of long term mezzes but given that the chanter is in the game there's not much we can do about that without destroying an entire class :p ) <br />
<br />
Basically there needs to be more 'effort' to holding mobs against slow etc. When one class can accomplish this without real costs the situation is unbalanced. <br />
<br />
Don't forget, spell aggro for most other classes than plate tanks is a penalty not a benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it wasn't just Knights that trivalized exp groups. <br />
<br />
I agree with that 100 %.  What I feel tho is that trivial exp is a bad thing, and in the context of plate tank balancing, further trivializing exp is bad.  To balance warriors and knights, the first thing that has to be decided is whether the level of agro generation that warriors are at is best for the game, or the level that knights are at.  In my opinion(and I fully admit that making that judgement on where to make the balance at is subjective, and therefore only opinion),  warrior agro generation is a better level to balance to.<br />
<br />
As shocking as it is, exp groups have been trivalized for awhile <br />
<br />
Again, a true statement, but again, I do not see making them even more trivial a good thing.<br />
<br />
By saying &quot;agro lock trivializes the game&quot; is odd since every one in the group seeks to &quot;trivalize&quot;, in their own ways, the exp monsters as much as possible <br />
<br />
Change the word 'trivalize' to the word 'control' and I think that statement is a little more accurate.  Every one in the group seeks to 'control', in their own way, the exp monster.  Higher level monsters are harder to control, and hense have a better reward in terms of exp.  I feel that when that control is trivial, this takes the challenge out of the game, ruining the RvR concept, and taking the level of skill needed to play to far lower levels.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm off track here but every time I see &quot;agro lock trivializes exp groups&quot; I think &quot;Do Warriors really think its a bonus to not have agro lock?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Do you feel that agro lock is needed to tank exp mobs?  The current situation, where 2 tank classes have it, and 1 does not is certainly out of balance, and we have to go one way or the other(and I hope soon), but is it mandatory to have it?<br />
<br />
More importantly tell me why Warriors shouldn't have some access to solid agro generation? <br />
<br />
We do...every point of damage I do generates agro, every weapon proc I get generates agro, every time I successfully taunt a mob off another player generates agro.  In any group that is willing to work within that level of agro generation, it is sufficient.<br />
<br />
Can I now ask a couple questions of my own?<br />
<br />
1:  Is making exp even more trivial than it is now good for EQ?  <br />
<br />
2:  If knights had agro generation on par with warriors, would they be able to function within exp groups?  Note, I am not asking if they could get said groups(that is a seperate issue), but having gotten it, and assuming reasonable levels of skill among all 6 memebers of the group, could it function?  Note that exp groups do function with warrior level agro every day, so explain why you would not be able to.<br />
<br />
3:  With trivial exp, how will the game continue to hold the interest of the more casual player, the player who does not have the time to raid regularly, or who simply does not want to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it depends on what you call trivial. IMHO it's about balance and exp wise I think they have it about rite at the moment. Whilst gaining exp is relatively trivial now, levelling your character and fleshing him out with sufficient aa's to reach his full potential certainly takes a non-trivial ammount of time.<br />

<br />
Yes knights could function, but the exp would roll in at a slower rate, and I do not consider that to be good for the game. But as well slowing the exp rate down you also remove some of the functionality of the knight if you reduce their agro. I am often in a situation where I need to keep 2 or 3 mobs agro'd on me and reducing this ability would hurt my groups potential to fight in more fun places thus eq would become less fun!<br />

I fall into the latter category, raids generally bore me tears, but there are plenty of places in EQ where I can 3-box or take a full group that are challenging and therefor fun and so hold my interest ......and of course I am really looking forward to the next expansion!</div></div><hr />

So the EXp would be at the slower WARRIOR rate of exp gain, so not only do you want to Keep your aggro-lock, but you want to maintain it so that you gain exp faster and thus AA's faster to further increase the gap between Knights and warriors....<br />

This is a &quot;false delima&quot;.  You have yet to show how improving Warrior agro skills will make exp groups any more trival than what we have now.  Remember the complaint is that SKs and Paladins are already make this trival so improving Warriors won't change functional groups let alone make them worse.<br />

Of course they could.  I will not deny that.  I just think it sucks that anyone thinks they have too.<br />

I fight tinkering with Paladin and SK agro because it doesn't fix anything.  As long as either class has any spells either class will have more chances for gaining agro than a Warrior.  Nerfing changes nothing and only seems to be ill will crippling.  Instead I see the problem is a general weakness in melee classes.  When Warriors get more things to contribute to a group we can then discuss tweaking.  Right now there is no comparison: Knight classes are just as capable tanking and have more group friendly skills than Warriors PLUS have stellar agro control.<br />

I personally have never found much entertainment in exp groups.  I don't hang off of each pull and I don't know anyone who is.  Unless there is a named monster lurking around I find myself chatting with people in group and across the guild in exp groups if I'm not pulling.  I'm sorry but seeing the same set of monsters coming in and dying over and over again really isn't my idea of prime entertainment. ^_^</div></div><hr />

I'd really like some utility too yep, in the meantime however why not address something that IS out of balance whilst we try to get Sony to fix the problem more permanently. As you yourself say it won't cripple knights advantage, however it will require more 'effort' to aggro control - and that's as it should be for any tank class. <br />

I had fun trawling around Plane of Torment last night, the group wasn't perfect and there was a real chance of dying if people Fked up. That wasn't a drag at all it helped raise the bar from boring drone fest to something I could take some pride in my performance in. Isn't it the fact that exp is already too trivialised that makes it boring, why does your keeping a further trivialisation because it doesn't fix my class make this better? <br />

<br />
Of course I want to keep it! It would be kind of dumb not to want to, who the hell wants to slow exp down? However what I think you are getting at is that it isn't fair that a warrior group gets exp at a lesser rate than a knight group, to which i agree. <br />
<br />
Please note I would be perfectly happy for warriors to be brought up to the same level of functionality as knights! But I have no clue how to do that without unbalancing other aspects of the game, and neither, unfortunately, does soe so it seems.<br />
<br />
Any kind of agro nerf to knights will not fix warriors, it's not knights that are broke it's warriors. ALL classes (except warriors) have recieved more agro ability with pop (whether they want it or not) and in the unlikely event that knight agro was nerfed would warriors be then be on an equal footing? Hell no! Knights are still going to be prefferred, we just hand the tanking over to the highest ac class that can hold agro eg BL/Shammy while the knight stuns to mitigate damage.</div></div><hr />

As a MT, I too have a lot of pride, and like to think I cant be replaced... but except for about 6 mobs, I can. This is all zones prior to Elemental planes.

<br />
Think that's the biggest point really. <br />
<br />
TBH, level 65 and 60 plus AA's (especially if not a raider BST and so focussed on personal upgrades) is gonna make just about any melee class able to tank slowed exp. mobs handily. <br />
<br />
I'm beginning to think they really messed up PoP exp along with everything else, 5 levels in a 1-2 weeks grind? Lvl 65's 'bottom feeding' in PoV getting an AA point every 2 hours? Nuts. Popular yes but in retrospect, Nuts.<br />
<br />
Only reason it's taking me so long is that I 'was' raiding all the time when I was online. Wandering round in torment (branded as a less than stellar exp zone) with an 'inefficient' group for about 3- 4 hours got me almost a yellow in 63 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a &quot;false delima&quot;. You have yet to show how improving Warrior agro skills will make exp groups any more trival than what we have now. Remember the complaint is that SKs and Paladins are already make this trival so improving Warriors won't change functional groups let alone make them worse. <br />
<br />
If I had better agro control, it would require less skill, less concentration, less thought to tank successfully.  I would not have to watch cast messages, I would not have to time taunts, I would not have to do all the little thing that, tho not in and of themselvs teribly difficult, are so important to playing my class successfully.  If I could exp while watching tv and talking on the phone, it would be far more trivial than it is.  And yet that is what you are preposing.  You talk later about being bored with exp, and yet you desperatly resist the idea of added challenge, and in fact ask to take the challenge away from the one tank class for whom exp tanking is still a challenge.  The dilema is not false.  Trivial agro control does in fact trivialize(alsong with other factors) exp.<br />
<br />
I fight tinkering with Paladin and SK agro because it doesn't fix anything <br />
<br />
Since the issue with plate tank balancing is the difference between warrior agro and knight agro, then yes, lowering knight agro would in fact fix that issue.  The best fix?  Impossible to say.  As we have seen many times in EQ, changing things often have unintended consequences.<br />
<br />
As long as either class has any spells either class will have more chances for gaining agro than a Warrior. Nerfing changes nothing and only seems to be ill will crippling. Instead I see the problem is a general weakness in melee classes. When Warriors get more things to contribute to a group we can then discuss tweaking. Right now there is no comparison: Knight classes are just as capable tanking and have more group friendly skills than Warriors PLUS have stellar agro control. <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, I think knights should have more opertunities to gain agro than warriors.  It is the tradeoff for warriors having /disc defensive and higher skill caps.  It is my opinion that the level of knight agro generation currently tho is broken.  It is too  powerfull.  Charming had to be nerfed by SoE because it was too powerfull, reducing RvR for charm classes to a rediculously low level.  It was not ill will that many people called for a nerf of charm, it was because that ability was broken.  In my opinion, agro lock is broken as well, reducing RvR in exp groups with knights to too low a level.  You admit that you could function with agro control at warrior levels, and that you have many group friendly skills.  Lowering your agro generation then should not break your class.<br />
<br />
I personally have never found much entertainment in exp groups. I don't hang off of each pull and I don't know anyone who is. Unless there is a named monster lurking around I find myself chatting with people in group and across the guild in exp groups if I'm not pulling. I'm sorry but seeing the same set of monsters coming in and dying over and over again really isn't my idea of prime entertainment. ^_^ <br />
<br />
This is I think the second important comment you made.  It points out our big difference in expectations, and why we see different solutions(part of the reason).  You find a part of the game that occupies the largest part of most peoples time who play EQ not entertaining.   I expect a game to be entertaining.  I expect to be challenged, and I expect to have to play skillfully.  I find the notion that a large part of the game has to be kept at a mindless, skilless, boring level inconcievable.  Why would you play a game to do something that you do not find entertaining?<br />
<br />
Of course they could. I will not deny that. I just think it sucks that anyone thinks they have too. <br />
<br />
This one is the big one, the key statement.  You state here that knighs, with warrior like agro ability could function.  You later state 'Knight classes are just as capable tanking and have more group friendly skills than Warriors'.  Then you say that you think it sucks that anyone thinks they would have to.  This puzzlies me.  Sucks why?  Because it would require thought, and attention, and being on your toes while you exp?  I think it is reasonable for exp to require a certain level of skill, of challenge.  I think that abilities that remove challenge from any aspect of the game are game breaking abilities.</div></div><hr />

I remember the dark days of Kunark very well.  No one should in a MMOG should feel like a 5th wheel all of the time.  It sucks that anyone thinks they need to play gimped because that is the way it is.  It sucks that people have to deliberately help someone else do their task.  It sucks to think its the caster's fault for over agro problems.  It maybe but it may not be.  Reguardless what is the group going to do to fix it?  Roll over and die?  That would really suck.<br />
<br />
Why did SOE make one of the most group dependant classes in the game so group unfriendly?  Its ironic...To this day I can not figure out where the screw got turned but it got turned hard.<br />
<br />
Also the idea that &quot;tanking should require thought&quot; is an interesting thing.  Exactly what about how Warriors play &quot;requires thought&quot;?<br />
<br />
One day I traveled to a real world guild gathering.  There were three computers there so some of us would goof off in game.<br />
<br />
Someone suggested &quot;Hey why don't we switch characters?&quot;  I decided to was going to play the guild's pretty much primary tank while he would play my Paladin.<br />
<br />
I was disappointed by what I could do.  I basically approached the monster, turned on auto attack, and hit Taunt when necessary, Kick when it popped.  Very dull.  On the other hand he had his hands full enough he ran me out of mana a couple of times (at first I had to tell him to sit and med ^_^).   I offered suggestions and hints when appropriate (&quot;Don't let that thing gate!!&quot;) but he got the hang of it soon enough.  He made some comment on how different it was to play a Paladin because he was doing stuff beyond melee.  I can see why....<br />
<br />
So tell me exactly how is giving Warriors more things to do to a monster, more decisions about what they can do to a monster, more things to do protect your group more boring than what you have now?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You yourself are now dealing out a 'false premise' Aeka. We contend that knight aggro control is too effective for the output/tradeoffs it requires of the knight. Warrior balancing is a side issue to that point. Fixing the massive disparity without making it even more boring for the warrior (i.e. total mob control) seems like a good first step to me :p Especially since it makes for less predictable and thus slightly more interesting group play than stun three times and watch TV (which appears to be your idea of perfect exp grouping!)<br />
<br />
You seem to be a victim of just how trivialising your aggro and the PoP zone design have made exping. You're totally jaded about exp because the chance of having something unpredictable that requires thought and reaction, thus making for a slightly more engaging experience is virtually eliminated....<br />
<br />
Isn't that a bad thing?<br />
<br />
Wether it fixes me or not, shouldn't we do something about it?<br />
<br />
Dramatise overmuch btw? Warriors can tank for groups and those groups can enjoy the experience, just so long as people actually play smart. The 'weakness' of warrior aggro actually makes their own input and how they play more important to the success of the group, isn't that a plus for them also??? if the mob never breaks away from the tank a cleric never gets the accolades for being an excellant group healer, how people handle a loose mob in camp sorts out the good players from the mediocre. More unpredictability actually makes for more fun if you ask me, so long as things aren't totally rediculous.<br />
<br />
Thing is people are lazy, hell I'M lazy, often people are so driven by the level/AA point treadmill that they ignore everything about their exping except how fast the little blue line moves. Exping in Torment? (An AWESOME looking zone) Nahhh you only get x amount of exp/hour there and the mobs are tough to pull, there's limited space so mob positioning is an issue, etc etc. So they go to their nice safe camp and they pull in their massive amounts of AA and they bore themselves shitless. Believe me I've done my share of that, with a full raid schedule I never had masses of time to exp, but was i enjoying myself? No not really.<br />
<br />
Pandering to that nihilistic urge by not 'making' people deal with non-trivial exping isn't really doing them or you any real favours. Unless youreally want to log on just to get bored silly while grinding out your N th AA point so you can spend hours clearing crap to (in many cases) zerg (cause it's simpler) the latest in SoE's half baked mob encounters.<br />
<br />
Oh and as for not having anything to do, hah. Positioning of mob and maintenance of mob positioning i.e. watching the push to ensure mob dosent go where you don't want it (over a cliff, into a wall, into mob pathing etc) readiness to shield, deciding wether to blow that one disc or not, working out offtanking, spotting the adds as they're incoming and intercepting, knowing what those adds do and wether they're slowable, keeping position of slower, healer in mind for shielding and tracing a mob that peels off, keeping rooted/mezzed adds positioning in mind, being prepared to react if the chanter/healer/slower in group gets into trouble. <br />
<br />
Sure i could just sit there hit attack and kick every few seconds but I wouldn't be a fully competent warrior as we measure ourselves if i did just that. <br />
<br />
The less options you've got the more wisely you need to use em. Not that I wouldn't mind a few extra options as you know :) <br />
<br />
I keep fairly busy with that type of stuff, which can be make or break for a group that's not sitting on a zone wall in PoV....</div></div><hr />

Hitting auto attack and keeping within melee range doesn't take a great deal of skill.   The fact of the matter is not that being a Warrior takes more skill to play successfully, it is that when a Knight performs his functions 90% of the time something actually happens while for a Warrior 40% of the time nothing happens at all.  It doesn't take skill to have abilities that do nothing 40% of the time.<br />
<br />
If we want to talk about the game requiring skill, then it should in fact require skill.  It should not be based on a random occurance that only succeeds 60% of the time and fails the other 40%.  That's not skill, that's playing craps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're arguing that Knights need to be hit with the nerf bat in order to make the game require more skill, or at least that's how it appears.  Which takes more skill, craps or solitare?  Solitare actually requires you to take some thought and preform certain things in a certain sequence for success.  Craps just requires you roll the dice and hope to get lucky.  Right now Knights are playing the EQ skill equivalent of solitare (having to perform certain functions in order to achieve certain results), while Warriors are playing the EQ skill equivalent of craps (we roll the dice and hope to get lucky).<br />
<br />
You like playing craps and think everyone should play along?  Okay, I can see how you might.  Personally I prefer solitare over craps because then I have some real input in to the success or failure of the situation.  Rather than just hoping to get lucky.<br />
<br />
And I'll continue to campaign for something the Warrior can use that requires some thought, which to me is more skillful than just pushing a button and hoping it comes up sevens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solitaire when you 'push the button' the skill isn't in the actual button push it's in the thought behind the overall strategy. A stun isn't solitaire either, there's no skill cause no matter how you push the button (right hand, left hand, from the side you choose) you still win.<br />

Being able to predict with absolute certainty your every move in solitaire wouldn't exactly be a fun game now would it? Why bother playing?<br />

/shrug.  Maybe it does.  But it's true what the Knights say, it's always been that way.  It's only now in PoP that it has the impact it does.  Improving us will put us on a more even playing field.  Nerfing Knights would do the same thing, I agree, but I don't particularly care for how it works currently and nerfing them would only mean we're all unpleasant to have tank rather than just Warriors as it is currently.</div></div><hr />

I play around with alts alot.  Yes, pretty much all classes(except rogue) have more options on things they can do.  Warriors are a pure class.  We do one thing(take damage), and we do it very well.  If I wanted to be diverse, I would play my shaman more, or a druid, etc.  Why this calling to turn warriors into something they are not?  We are, simply put, meatshields.<br />
<br />
It sucks to think its the caster's fault for over agro problems. It maybe but it may not be. Reguardless what is the group going to do to fix it? <br />
<br />
This is the other part of the problem.  Agro management used to be an important skill in EQ.  Now agro management consists of finding a knight who is LFG.  It is, and I can see no nicer way of putting it, a dumbing down of the game.  Any skill or challenge required from players of all classes has been greatly reduced.  Sorry, I prefer that the game be more of a skill type game.<br />

My ex husband was a big wargamer.  He loved to play wargames, both on the computer, and on a tabletop.  These where about as demanding a game as there is, as far as requiring skill.  And all of the games he played had random elements to it.  The way to succeed is to tilt factors most in your favor, so you win enough battles, to win the game.  EQ has random elements in it.  Not going to change, nor should it.<br />
<br />
I don't particularly care for how it works currently and nerfing them would only mean we're all unpleasant to have tank rather than just Warriors as it is currently. <br />
<br />
Unpleasant how?  Because the other group members have to think about agro?  Because there is a chance that something just might go wrong?  90 % of the time I am in a group, things go extremely well.  Deaths are rare, exp is good.  In what way is that unpleasant?<br />
<br />
Improving us will put us on a more even playing field. Nerfing Knights would do the same thing <br />
<br />
Which is better?  I think it is a personal preference thing.  I do not think there is one best solution.  I am by no means trying to say that my veiwpoint is right, only trying to explain why I hold that viewpoint.  I do know for sure tho that I sure as hell hope SoE does something  soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please explain! <br />
<br />
The knights agro advantage has been in the game since day one, so why was it not important pre-pop? Perhaps because losing agro for a few combat rounds didn't usually result in someones death. So in reality agro management was no more important then than it is now, what has changed is that people now realise that agro lock is available with a knight, and it reduces the risk/speeds up the exp in pop.<br />
<br />
What bugs me is warriors wanting to nerf knights/change the way I play ( I was using stuns and fol to agro lock long before pop) because their class is in need of some attention. <br />
<br />
Agro lock is not new!<br />
<br />
Get off your butts and come up with a warrior fix that doesn't involve trying to fundamentaly change another class, otherwise you are wasting your time, because an agro-nerf is not likely to happen.</div></div><hr />

Most Paladins dont get it...<br />

Before SoE gave Knights, the sun moon and stars... aggro lock was balanced, people DIDNT want paladins to get aggro lock, it was a BAD thing except to save the cleric/enchanter/shaman.<br />
<br />
Now people do not want anything BUT aggro lock.<br />
<br />
your aggro abilities were balance with you lower tankablilty, Since paladins were given 99% of everything a warrior now gets, there is no longer a need for the aggro-lock as a class advantage.<br />

AGGRO LOCK was BALANCED when KNIGHTS SHOULDN&quot;T TANK...<br />
<br />
AGGRO LOCK is NOT BALANCED when KNIGHTS DO TANK...<br />

<br />
Sure, a random element is fine.  But one of the goals of a war gamer is to stack the deck as much in their favor as possible before allowing the random element to become involved.  While occassionally winning or losing an entire battle solely on the role of a single die might be exciting, if you always play that way eventually it just boils down to gambling.<br />
<br />
A Cleric, when healing, has a random element involved.  Sometimes they fizzle.  Yet if they fizzled 40% of the time people would be seriously pissed, wouldn't they?  A Wizard, when nuking, has a random element involved.  Sometimes they fizzle and sometimes they get resisted.  But again if it was happening 40% of the time people would be up in arms.  Basically your arguement appears to be that having a random element involved in the game whereby your choosen action (and many times only available option) fails 40% of the time is a good thing.  And not only do you think it's good for Warriors, but you think Knights should have the same problem as well.<br />
<br />
No other class in the game has a 40% failure rate on ANYTHING unless it's a high end trade skill or when first improving a skill to a new level.  Yet Warriors have been living with a 40% or GREATER failure rate on one of their most important core abilities since Kunark.  This is not 'challenge', this is pure dumb luck.<br />
<br />
Is kiting a challenge?  It doesn't rely on a 40% failure rate to be so.  Is quad kiting a challenge?  It doesn't rely on a 40% failure rate to be so.  It's much more rewarding to have the game a challenge, not because your abilities frequently fail so everyone has to be extra careful and walk on egg shells around you, but because it requires you to actually think about what's going on, even if your abilities succeed by far the majority of the time.<br />
<br />
Do you really think that the majority of people are saying, damn I sure hate using this Knight as a tank because it lacks significant challenge?  Or do you think they're saying, damn I love having this Knight tank because I can play the game in the way I enjoy and not have to worry much about getting my ass handed to me?  Why do you want to force people to not enjoy the game as much as 'challenge'?  Is EQ entertainment or is it some form of sadistic IQ test?</div></div><hr />

Sure, a random element is fine.  But one of the goals of a war gamer is to stack the deck as much in their favor as possible before allowing the random element to become involved.  While occassionally winning or losing an entire battle solely on the role of a single die might be exciting, if you always play that way eventually it just boils down to gambling.<br />
<br />
A Cleric, when healing, has a random element involved.  Sometimes they fizzle.  Yet if they fizzled 40% of the time people would be seriously pissed, wouldn't they?  A Wizard, when nuking, has a random element involved.  Sometimes they fizzle and sometimes they get resisted.  But again if it was happening 40% of the time people would be up in arms.  Basically your arguement appears to be that having a random element involved in the game whereby your choosen action (and many times only available option) fails 40% of the time is a good thing.  And not only do you think it's good for Warriors, but you think Knights should have the same problem as well.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Actually, something that also annoys me, a little off topic though...<br />
<br />
Why is it that other classes get to complain when they dont hit for MAX damage more than 50% of the time? I mean I hear wizzies complain when their nukes 'ONLY' land for half damage...<br />
<br />
I would love to complain, that my attacks only hit for half max damage...</div></div><hr />

yeah it was always that way they had aggro but untill velious changed knight mitigation it was well balanced because if we got aggro it qwas a bad thing before velious and the mitagation table changes.

/shrug.  No it's not a secret.  He's all of level 52 now and leveling slowly.  I find I have less and less interest in EQ these days and a large part of that is because I've come to the conclusion that you can't predict when SoE will come along and make 4 years worth of effort almost meaningless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that sounds more like a jaded comment more then anything else. I can tell you none of the classes are worthless and none of the classes I have played have been made meaningless by SoE improving/breaking the game. It's a game you play to hgave fun or I do anyway I still find it fun not as much as I used to but it still holds some of that for me. Obviously for you it is not and you lash out at SoE because they are easiest to blame but they have the least amout of controll over the fun factor of EQ. Find another game because even if SoE made the warrior class gods you still would not have fun bro.</div></div><hr />

It seems there is a fundamental definition difference involved with the word 'challenge'.  One group seems to feel that having things work or not work on a random basis defines challenge.  I happen to believe that having things be difficult even when everything works as it should defines challenge.  <br />
<br />
I suppose that sky diving when your parachute only worked 60% of the time might be considered challenging by some.  Yet I perfer the challenge involved in sky diving where you can pretty much count on your chute opening pretty close to 100% of the time.  Then you add challenge by deciding to wait longer to pull the cord, jumping with more people, trying to land at specific points and so forth.  And if parachuting from the same altitude using the same type of chute and adding no other random factors into the situation is your bag, people shouldn't be coming along and saying, gosh this isn't enough challenge, lets rig their chute so it won't open every time.....</div></div><hr />

Personally I would perfer not to jump out of an airplane LOL, but I do see your point, but I tend to believe the games like EQ should be fun, and you'll get out what you put into it. The warrior class is funked, but until they fix it I will still play my class and have fun with it as much as I can :D</div></div><hr />

Don't worry btw Knights, I have very little doubt that you'll keep your aggro edge despite the fact that i feel it'd be better for all concerned if it was toned down. Enjoy your exp by the numbers. <br />
<br />
I'll continue to do my own little thing for as long as I can get fun from it, if they give me more nice crap to do that'd be great, if not I'll live i guess. Ultimately so long as i have friends to group with I suppose i shouldn't give a shit about where the game goes from here. Sony appears fully engaged in a policy of appeasement that will only see the game getting more and more trivial. But i guess for this generation the idea of checks and balances is far outmoded.<br />

I have not givin up and wont untill SoE fixes Knights (pallys for sure sk's may be balanced in mana cost and the sort for aggro but no idea as I havce never played one past like 12).<br />
<br />
Alas it may be a battel already decided that I am fighting and no matter what I do the outcome will be the same, but untill SoE states that they have madea  change to adress thhis issues and the issues that surrond it I will not give up. Everytime I talk to a GM (not guides they powerless) I bring up the point about my class being too over powerd in aggro generating ablilities I cna hope eventually I might get one that has some power to get things changed I can always hope anyway :)</div></div><hr />

Nahh just the edit button is small and there is this nice big box at the bottom ou can enter text in... Playing a pally with total aggro lock has made me lazy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, back from running errands now, so lets get started.<br />
<br />
The knights agro advantage has been in the game since day one, so why was it not important pre-pop? Perhaps because losing agro for a few combat rounds didn't usually result in someones death. So in reality agro management was no more important then than it is now, what has changed is that people now realise that agro lock is available with a knight, and it reduces the risk/speeds up the exp in pop. <br />
<br />
True, knight agro advantage has been in game forever, but at first it was a disadvantage...knights where not wanted to get agro.  Also back at this time, C3 was not around, and mana was far more limited.  While dying from gaining agro was less common(tho still happened), clerics running lom due to having to heal casters was common.  So to be efficient, agro management was just as important.<br />
<br />
No other class in the game has a 40% failure rate on ANYTHING unless it's a high end trade skill or when first improving a skill to a new level. Yet Warriors have been living with a 40% or GREATER failure rate on one of their most important core abilities since Kunark. This is not 'challenge', this is pure dumb luck. <br />
<br />
Slightly different issue Glatius.  Taunt does not lock agro, it regains it.  I do feel that taunt success should be turned up.  The idea that caught my eye, and that I most like was having a new warrior skill 'double taunt', that based on skill cap gave you a chance to perform 2 taunts.  This idea seems even better now in light of Brutul's taunt test from last night.  I think there is a definate difference tho between agro lock(raising your hate far above others, making it difficult for them to overagro), and taunt(regaining agro once it is lost).<br />
<br />
Psst don’t tell anyone but Glatius2 has a pally twink he has been leveling kind of makes you wonder why he is siding with Knights and doesn’t want stun nerfed huh? <br />
<br />
OMG...Glatius is the enemy !!!  OH NO!!(please not that that is said with extreme sarcasm...sometimes tone does not come thru the typed word well).  Apothes, I like you, but please, do not try and make this an us against them kinda thing.  Glatius, Aeka, Val, you, I,  landrain are all on the same side.  We all want basically the same thing...plate tank balance.  We only disagree on how best to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
you started one of these threads where everyone will argue but no one will listen and nothing will get solved <br />
<br />
I think we are listening to one another, but no, nothing will get solved here.  I post to these things because I enjoy discussing it.  Almost everyone who posts to these things I like, whether I agree or not.  Aeka, whose views are almost exactly opposite mine, is actually a favorite poster to me.  Well thought out, intelligent and articulate(and wrong in my opinion).  Hopefully tho, over at SoE, a group of people are having similar discussions, and working out a solution.<br />
<br />
I suppose that sky diving when your parachute only worked 60% of the time might be considered challenging by some. Yet I perfer the challenge involved in sky diving where you can pretty much count on your chute opening pretty close to 100% of the time.  <br />
<br />
That is a horrid metaphor.  Even when taunt fails, there are a number of things a group can do to recover.  Root the mob so caster can get away pops to mind as the first thing that can be done.  This buys time for the warrior to get that succesfull taunt, and the healer to get the caster healed.  Aeka will pop up now to point out that this is the group doing the warriors job for them, but I again point out that in fact it is just solid teamwork.<br />
<br />

Hmm?  It didn't particularly bother me.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Aeka will pop up now to point out that this is the group doing the warriors job for them, but I again point out that in fact it is just solid teamwork.<br />
<br />
I can see how you might look at it that way.  But here is the rub, the teamwork you speak of is required because the Warrior can't effectively hold up his end of the situation alone.  Every other class can.  Do Clerics really need anyone to help them heal?  Do Enchanters need someone to help them mezz?  Do Wizards need anyone to help them nuke?  Each one of these character classes has a primary function in a group, one they are able to perform without much other group assistance.  The Warrior however must rely on everyone else in the group assist him in his function.  This, to me, seems kind of funky.  Why can't we perform our function, that is to keep the focus on the mob primarily on us, without massive accommodation by everyone else who plays with us?  Obviously others see this as a problem as well or Knights wouldn't be as popular as they currently are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At times it certainly helps them out, yes.<br />
<br />
Do Enchanters need someone to help them mezz? <br />
<br />
Again, at times, a quick root to help control a mob while enchanter mezzes is a blessing.  Also, a bard guildy linked a thread from a message board on class board about how to work with enchanters, to get the best use out of both being able to mez.<br />
<br />
Do Wizards need anyone to help them nuke? <br />
<br />
Most wizzies like to have C3+ to help them nuke, does that count?  Also, as my number 1 alt is a mage(61 tonight by god), I like to think I do help the wizzy nuke.<br />
<br />
EQ is a social game, and interdependability is an important aspect of it.  A warrior solo is not going to go far(nor a knight for that matter).  We depend on other classes to help get the job done.<br />
<br />
Why can't we perform our function, that is to keep the focus on the mob primarily on us, without massive accommodation by everyone else who plays with us? Obviously others see this as a problem as well or Knights wouldn't be as popular as they currently are. <br />
<br />
As has been pointed out frequntly, the reason knights are preferred in groups is because of the huge edge in agro generation.  This makes it easier for others in group, as they have more of a margin for error, agro wise.  We all want to see that disparity lessoned.  I feel that by lowering knight agro, it will increase that interdependency I mentioned earier, making the game somewhat better, to my mind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, at times, a quick root to help control a mob while enchanter mezzes is a blessing. Also, a bard guildy linked a thread from a message board on class board about how to work with enchanters, to get the best use out of both being able to mez.<br />
<br />
Sure, others can assist each other in one way or another.  But for the most part Enchanters mezz, Wizards nuke, Clerics heal, and so forth with a minimal of assistance in doing their primary function.  Not so the Warrior.  The degree of required accommodation is completely out of kilter when compared, not just to Knights who could be argued as needing too little assistance, but pretty much all other classes as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do Clerics really need anyone to help them heal?<br />
<br />
No but they are not effective at it without some sort of mana regen. ask the warriors who wait on a cleric to run to PoK or nexus to get a KEI.<br />
<br />
Just like warriors do not need anyone to generate aggro for them but they are more effective at it if classes work with them or cast aggro spells on them.<br />
<br />
 Do Enchanters need someone to help them mezz?<br />
<br />
again no but they would not be able to do it without heales there to heal them and keep them alive (even with a knight tanksing if more then 2 on the pull they can take a beating or when mez breaks if the knight is still working on the first mob)<br />
<br />
Do Wizards need anyone to help them nuke?<br />
<br />
again no but they are not very effective without  some form of mana regen. and if they do get in trouble they need some sort of healer to keep them standin.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you see every class needs anotehr class to be effective. Warriors can tank and tey don't need anyone to help them do it but they are more effective if the groups helps them contol aggro and is consious of actiaons and reaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No Apothes, you're missing the point.  Warriors need the Cleric healer, Warriors need the Wizard nuker, Warriors need the Enchanter mezzer.  Without them the Warrior is ineffective.  However, we still, even with all this dependence already built into the game requiring teamwork, still need them to go one step further and accommodate the fact that we do our job, hold the attention of the mob, in a pretty unreliable piss poor fashion.   And Knights don't.  Nor are they likely to.  I find it very hard to believe that SoE will nerf the Knights at this point, just when they've got them working fairly well.  So the level of 'teamwork' required to use a Warrior tank is complete catagories greater than using a Knight tank.  Yet using the Knight still requires teamwork, it just isn't as glaringly obvious that you have to carry the Knight as it is the Warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last post on this topic.  I swear it. ^_^<br />
<br />
I'll spell it out for you again Apothes.<br />
<br />
Your assertion is Paladins have it too easy holding agro because of stuns.  So your solution was to monkey with mana which I believe is silly in the first place (it doesn't fix Warriors, doesn't consider SKs) not to mention it doesn't even approach what you want to do (restrict casts on Stuns).<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what a mid-high end Paladin has for mana pool?  Upwards 4k and beyond.  Simply doubling the mana it takes for a stun only hurts low end Paladins.  Unless this is your intent that is.<br />
<br />
If you really understood the game like you say you would have figured out by now that Mana is transitory.  If you really want to restrict spell usage on a caster you change the reset time.<br />
<br />
Simply put, players can get pretty uber which negates your attempt to nerf with mana costs.  Reset times are however hard limits.  No matter how uber one is you will never make a spell reset faster.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you ignored my two posts on it (one was in the first version of this thread that is now gone) and continue to yell at me.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised at all though given past performances.<br />
<br />
To the others out there on this thread, I appreciate where you are comming from but I can't shake the feeling your wrong.  Being a Warrior means being without spells.  This doesn't mean being a Warrior is without skills.  I really believe that getting some new skills will not only fix agro issues but help with a general utility issue.<br />
<br />
With out any further changes, tanks are only necessary to distract the monster long enough for casters to operate.  There are groups out there that function without tanks.  If anyone thinks nerfing Knights will make groups run back to Warriors you are sadly mistaken.  Strong casters are just as likely to do without tanks than to try and work with broken ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
THat is in your opinion if the mana cost is scaled right then you can effectivly require a knight to have downtime and no it does not hurt the lower end because they have lower verions of the spells. I don't care about recast time that is your suggestion which is fine i did not ignore it I just don't belive it's the soultion to use because it severly limits aggro where mana cost doesent do that simply requires more downtime.<br />
<br />
and no I dont want to hurt lower level players but if your 65 then you should be capable of getting the stuff to reach a mana pool where a uber 65 is at mana pool wise you may have ot sacrafice ac or hp where the uber does not but that is a trade off.<br />
<br />
So aeka you have arguments but I do not belive they are valid. <br />
<br />
btw I used capes because you continue to take pot shots at me and claim things that are untrue instead of debating the issue obviously you do not consider the ground you are on very firm since you resort to name calling.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh and I have no idea about sk's I have said that repetedly in this thread they need ot be looked at and maybe nothing done as SoE has stated they should generate aggro I have never seen them state that for pallys. but I am sure sk's need tweaked a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm any group needs others to be a group not just wearriors. I think it is you that are missing the point guess we have a difference of opinion but show me one group that does not require any of thoes classes you listed wthat warriors need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the original post dealt with stuns and mana costs, etc...<br />
<br />
How about this for an idea, something that considers more than just mana.<br />
<br />
Here is my idea, and yes this would take a bit of work, but I bet any team of coders/game designers could fix it in less than 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
There are many spell 'lines' these lines are shown by the pally stun line, root line, etc...Why are these spell lines? to make more efficient/greater powered versions of basically the same spell.<br />
<br />
We know that spells can be restricted for what levels they can be cast upon. IE C3, etc... <br />
<br />
We know some mobs are immune to some spells. So there is coding for that already in the game...<br />
<br />
Lets example a theoretical spell line... The WEDGIE spell line.<br />
<br />
lvl 10 Wedgie - mana cost 20 - effect wedgie - duration 4.0 - reset 12.0- recast 40.0<br />
lvl 25 Wedgie 2 - mana cost 60 - effect wedgie - duration 6.0- reset 12.0- recast 60.0<br />
<br />
lvl 40 Wedgie 3 - mana cost 90 - effect wedgie - duration 8.0- reset 12.0- recast 80.0<br />
<br />
lvl 50 Wedgie 4 - mana cost 120 - effect wedgie - duration 10.0- reset 12.0- recast 100.0<br />
<br />
lvl 60 Super Wedgie - mana costs 200 - effect wedgie - duration 10.0 - reset 12.0-  recast 100.0<br />
<br />
lvl 65 Ultra Wedgie - mana cost 400 - effect wedgie - duration 10.0 - reset 300.0-  UNRESISTABLE  - recast 300.0 <br />
<br />
How about we make it so that spells in certain spell lines do not work on very high level mobs? Example a level 10 wedgie  spell Should NEVER work on a lvl 65 Mob, It should be immune, completely resist, and cause NO AGGRO. Should have no effect on the mob.<br />
<br />
What should happen is as the level of the mob increases vs the level of the spell, the effectiveness should lower and the aggro generation lower. So that level 10 wedgie spell would be resisted 50% of the time by a level 25 mob, and a level 40+ mob would be immune. This spell would cause ZERO AGGRO on any mobs level 40+...<br />
<br />
Another thought I had about these spells , is recast times. Not reset, reset is the time before the spell can be cast again, but recast, if the spell gives a mob a wedgie, it is under the wedgie effect for say 10.0, but there is a buff icon on that mob, not allowing another Wedgie effect to be cast upon it until it wears off.<br />
<br />
Any  thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
But what SKILLS do warriors get that we can use in combat?<br />
<br />
Do we really want to look at these and say we get skills?<br />
<br />
Taunt? Kick? Disarm?  Bash? <br />
<br />
Seems to me, that most other classes also get all these skills...<br />
<br />
When SoE sent classes to school Warriors got the short bus...<br />
lets just look at a few of the melee class skills..<br />
<br />
Monks -<br />
mend, safe fall, sneak, tiger claw, block, FD, Intimidation, Eagle Strike, Dragon punch, Flying Kick <br />
<br />
Rogues -<br />
sneak,hide,pick lock, pick pockets, sense traps, backstab, safe fall, apply poison, make poison, disarm traps<br />
<br />
Paladins -<br />
taunt, bash, disarm, LOH, spells<br />
<br />
SK's -<br />
taunt,bash,hide,disarm, HT, spells<br />
<br />
Rangers -<br />
taunt, forage, kick, sneak, intimidation, hide, disarm, spells<br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
so for our 10% extra hps and KICK! and being able to dual wield, we give up the entire sk/pally spell books.. Dont even say Defensive because it was added later, again as a bandaid to fix what was already going bad...</div></div><hr />

I tend to like that idea. I don't see any downsides atm either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aeka's point is that Warriors need additional skills, not that the skills we currently have are sufficient.  Just thought I'd clear that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think why I oppose the idea of new warrior skills, and support making changes to knights, is simply that I like my role as is.  I know I can do my job, be successfull, and have fun with things as is.  So purely for that selfish reason, I think any changing that should be done should be done by knights.<br />
<br />
I constantly felt when arguing in this thread that it seemed to me that Aeka was trying to push any change that was to come off on warriors, because Aeka enjoys pallies as is, and I am trying to push it back, since I enjoy warriors as is.  We both know something needs to change, but would prefer it to be the others class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back for just a moment, I don't believe making knights work harder will 'fix' warriors. i do feel that the current situation is out of balance and should be changed. If any evidence was needed of this then look at the SK's that never use their pure hate spells in exp grouping because their taps and etc do a better job :p <br />
<br />
I agree with Aeka that boosting mana costs, whilst sounding fair enough on the surface will never approach a complete solution  since there must be a massive difference in knight mana pools through the scale and as the mudflation continues any revisions will quickly become trivialised. <br />
<br />
I cannot fathom what SoE's current thinking is, they continue to provide paladins with low mana cost, high level stuns and appear to have no thought for what is clearly a major imbalance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stuns have always had a max level they could effect, but even if the mob couldn't actually be stunned by the spell it has always generated aggro.  I've seen nothing that indicates this has changed, only that now they've added a message to the spell descriptions that inform the player at what level the spell stops stunning.   So if someone else has better or newer information, please feel free to share.</div></div><hr />
