<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, as the title says, this is shameless.  It's really not needed, but I'm doing it because I'm bored here at work and I feel it could use a little fine tuning.  :)<br />
<br />
Facts about the Inny encounter:<br />
<br />
-You're supposed to fight it with adds, however you can avoid ever getting the adds if you pull Inny right.  I won't disclose how to get him single, as I really don't know how it happens or why, but I will say this; I think it was intended that way.  Inny with all the adds in their full glory is an INSANELY difficult encounter and NOT worth doing.  Inny without the adds is hard enough as it is, but it's certainly where the RvR is supposed to be imho.<br />
<br />
-The event is semi-blowable.  The Inny that stands in front of the throne is the fake version.  Killing him starts the script which spawns the real Inny down in the pit.  The fake Inny has identical attributes to the real Inny except with a lot less hp, mass single target dispell, and for some reason is NOT cornerable.  There's something funky about the fake one.  It's actually a different model.  Moving on, if you kill the fake Inny and lose to the real, the fake Inny will respawn 24 hours later.  What does this mean?  Means ya can't get back up on your feet and try again, haha.  It also means it takes some time and dedication by your guild to keep going back up there to learn the script.<br />
<br />
Facts about the real Inny:<br />
<br />
-Inny is a pretty mean mofocker.  He quads for 866 max at a delay of 11 (unslowed) and pumps out just a tad over 600dps.  His hit connection rate is about 45%.  Once slowed and debuffed however, the dps number is more around the therabouts of 430-460dps.  <br />
<br />
-Inny AE Rampages.  Oooph!  While Inny really doesn't hit all that hard, this really starts to take a toll on the raid because of the next fact.<br />
<br />
-Inny has a bujezus amount of HP.  His AC is quite low, but it took us a good solid 11 minutes of wailing on him to final down the blueberry king.<br />
<br />
-You can only land spells on him if you're in melee range.<br />
<br />
Ok, so where does my gripe come in?  <br />
<br />
Inny's loot table doesn't seem quite.... right.  Some of it is REALLY awesome and some of it just doesn't make any sense.  In fact, once I copy/paste some of it, you'll understand where I'm coming from.  First and formost, I'm start off with the Corrupted Valorium Armband.<br />
<br />
#1  Corrupted Valorium Armband (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21958)<br />
AC: +26 Str: +21 Dex: +15 Cha: +5 Wis: +5 Int: +5 Cold Resist: +25 HP: +85 Mana: +105  <br />
Classes: Wizard Magician Enchanter Necromancer  <br />
<br />
In the final and classic words of Garrett in the ending of Thief II: The Metal Age, &quot;Tell me&quot; why an INT CASTER ONLY armslot has 21str, 15dex and 5wis?  On top of that, why only 5int?  My fellow officers and I had to *plead* our casters to take this, especially considering far better caster only arms can be found on the birds in Fire who, I must say, are far easier encounters.<br />
<br />
#2  Constricting Curass (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21956)<br />
AC: +68 Str: +20 Sta: +20 Wis: +15 Int: +15 Magic Resist: +15 HP: +125 Mana: +75  <br />
1)  Vengeance II (+10atk)<br />
2)  Haste of Mithaniel (20% Beneficial Spell Haste)<br />
Classes: Cleric Paladin Shadowknight Bard Warrior  <br />
<br />
In all honesty, it ain't a bad bp, but why are some of the stats SERIOUSLY skimped on?  Inny's itemization is based on a 200-250 Luclin scale and some carry solid resists in either two or three areas (Magic+Fire+Cold or Disease+Poison).  If the Anathema can carry a 125hp/125mana (250) ratio and 15mr/cr/fr, so can this BP.  Hell, even the Akkirus (Cleric-Skyshrine) BP has more overall svs than this.<br />
<br />
#3 Anathema (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22405) 36/30 Ratio<br />
Str: +18 Sta: +12 Wis: +12 Int: +12 Fire Resist: +15 Cold Resist: +15 Magic Resist: +15 HP: +125 Mana: +125  <br />
Weapon Skill: Two Hand Slash <br />
Classes: Ranger Paladin Shadowknight Warrior  <br />
<br />
Awesome name, unique graphic, and is a truly one of a kind sword.  However, to keep in line with all other major hate weapons in the game post-Velious, where is the AC?  The Bloodfrenzy and Hategiver have 25ac.  The Blade of War has 50ac.  While I don't expect some outragious amout of AC to be on here, it would be nice to keep the trend going by adding say 35ac to this blade.  The ratio, though lacking slightly in terms of Inny's difficulty, is fine.  I certainly wouldn't expect to blow A Doomfire Guardian's boxers off while I tank him.   :P<br />
<br />
So that's the end of my gripe.  I don't actually expect anything to really happen.  Hell, I'm only one voice out of four hundred and fifty thousand.  I just think Inny's loot table could use a little adjusting for not only its difficulties, but also to keep it in line with the rest of the items on his loot table.  The rest of the items are pretty freaking incredible.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I'm small.  I'm a haffin.  Time to step off my soap box.  :)<br />
<br />
PS - I'll be editing this if the links don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice post :) Thanks for the soapbox, I wish all gripes were like this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">atl east the ft3 stuff is decent and has a nice mask, but naturaly 90% of the time he will drop the .... loot you have to force people to take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kavariel Baenre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it was intended that way[/b].

 <br />
<br />
I disagree.<br />
<br />
First off, you say &quot;You're supposted to fight it with adds&quot; then you say when you can get him single &quot;I think it was intended that way&quot;. I can tell you that the script is supposed to be fought with adds in camp. Saying that Inny is INSANELY difficult is a fact about the Inny encounter and not worth doing means your ops team either sucks or doesn't know the script well enough to CC it.<br />
<br />
The script is difficult until you know it. You pulling him single somehow gimps the encounter entirely. RVR for him is great as it is. Think about it, he drops THREE loots every time for a mob that takes 30 min to kill and 30 min to clear to.  He also drops some book for a quested range item.<br />
<br />
Splitting him has to be a sploit, its like killing RZ without adds.<br />
<br />
what a joke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On my guild's first ever attempt at inny, we had low numbers &lt;seriously low&gt;  and we almost got him, something like 50% ish.<br />
<br />
It's a gimped ass encounter as it is, for sure.<br />
<br />
Only reason we lost was because too many people were taken out at the beggining to survive against Inny's DPS.  <br />
<br />
Plus we had tanks including myself on the adds or at least a few of them, so when MA bit the dust, the low end tanks stepped up, and the clerics coulden't do jack to help them.</div></div><hr />
