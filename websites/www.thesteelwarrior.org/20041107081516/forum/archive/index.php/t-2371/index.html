<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We're in POV this morning, pulling and exping fine having our 65 ranger tank for us... she's put some time into her defensive AA's and it's working out okay since we have a cleric healing and a shaman slowing.<br />
<br />
Finally she's gotta leave for work. We've made plenty of paper-tank jokes about her and she's laughed it off, really we've all been impressed with how well she did after the Paladin left.<br />
<br />
So we're looking for a replacement and we see a 64 warrior LFG. He's in a good guild, good reputation, nice guy, and I like warriors. I like anyone who doesn't wiggle their fingers and speak the heebie jeebies. We pick him up immediately. When we see him run in range we're all relieved at the fact that he's wearing great gear too. <br />
<br />
So we get our first pull.. I land a great backstab a lil too early and it jumps to me. I quickly evade and remind myself to wait a bit. Shaman goes to debuff and slow and the monster immediately jumps to her. Clerics goes to heal and it jumps to him. <br />
Shaman says without any hint of malice or anger or frustration as she apologizes to the group &quot;Ah sorry, forgot we had a warrior tanking now.&quot; <br />
<br />
After that we slowed things down a bit, monster still jumped at the shaman on every pull though, even waiting. I started off like I usually do with warriors, wait for a bit and wait to backstab until after I've landed an evade or two. Things went fine after that.<br />
<br />
Talked with the cleric a little bit, a guildmate, about the situation and he agreed that it was goofy. He offered that he's seen the warriors in the top guilds on the server hold aggro pretty well at least.<br />
<br />
But what about everyone else? <br />
<br />
It's not a problem reserved for level 65 characters raiding the top 5% of the game's content. <br />
<br />
Hope they're addressing this and all the other puremelee concerns along with the 1278 spell changes on Lucy over the last few days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now if we can just get the devs to listen to what every other class (except for maybe pallys and sks) is saying and actually do something about what we all see as a problem, we'll be in business. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You've some pretty sad people playing melee classes if you need to complain warrior isn't pulling enough aggro for you.  Rogues pull perhaps the least amount of aggro out of anyone unless you're using weapons with nasty aggro procs (the dagger that procs Obsidian Shatter from Sol Ro comes to mind).  For monks, getting aggro and not FD just says you deserve to be slapped.  <br />
<br />
As for the shaman getting aggroed, just same old news of people who don't learn.  If you do something to a mob and it slaps you around, you'd think people would learn to stop doing it.  It's not a warrior's problem that a slower insists on continue getting slapped around for slowing too early, and it is never necesary to slow a mob early because if it is then your group is already dead if the mob ever resists the slow.  It takes more mana to heal a shaman on a slowed mob than healing a warrior on an unslowed mob.  It's not the warrior's problem the shaman refuses to cooperate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you missed his point.<br />
<br />
he was simply saying they had to hold back when the war tanked but did not when other classes did. he wasnt trying to say anyone sucked, just that he sees that there is an issue with the class it self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Phantron you're argument that warriors are fine has been ripped to shreds in other threads. Do you really need to continue that here? All you have shown is that you are pretty clueless to EQ.<br />
<br />
It is obvious your class pride is showing.  But your ego is blinding you to the truth that warriors are hurting right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it IS the warrior's problem because any other class that might be used as a tank doesn't have that problem.  Why would a group voluntarily choose to slow down and get xp and loot at a worse rate than they could with a tank who can lock aggro?  There may be nothing a warrior can do about the problem but it's still very much his problem.<br />
<br />
The tanking difference between a warrior and another tank in an xp group is meaningless especially after slow lands.  And a hybrid can guarantee they hold aggro even on resisted slows while a warrior can't.  You may play in nothing but guild groups and be happy with your aggro but most people aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It has become painfully obvious to me that some people argue just for the sake of arguing. <br />
<br />
Seriously Phantron, did you even read that post? They laid down exactly what was done in the group to accommodate for having a warrior in it, while also expressing exactly how they felt along with other group members’ actions.<br />
<br />
Hell it wasn't even against what you said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kinda missed my point Phantron... <br />
<br />
We all could flip back into &quot;Warrior Tank&quot; mode, just required us all to tone down our playstyle which made us less effective.<br />
<br />
The shaman was able to chain cast malo, slow and then cripple when the ranger pulled and then immediately sit down without the mob ever changing target.<br />
<br />
When the warrior pulled the shaman had to cast slow late and then stand up for a while to avoid getting beaten around.<br />
<br />
It's just... not as fun to hold back. And that stinks... Warriors should get to lead the charge of badassitude, not make everyone else tone it down :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just would like to thank you for your support Junk.  That last was very well stated.  Warriors, by their very existance, are indeed supposed to be the badest of the bad.  Ironic, isn't it, how that meaning has gotten perverted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i agree with everything Junk said.<br />
<br />
the sad part is, i can outtaunt warriors unless they dual wield EB or have a BoW, and i don't even have to try hard.<br />
<br />
this shit needs fixed.</div></div><hr />

see thats all we do. I'm 62 i'l be amazed if i see 63. seriously i'm gonna buy Warcraft if no changes in LDoN i mean it's total BS my friend amazingly still wants me in groups  and always tries to get me but still it never seems that it'll be good enough exp so that'll get 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">These days I don't even screw around, if someone is pulling aggro off me I tell them to slow down.  It absolutely sucks because it shouldn't be this way.  Knights draw most of the fire about our aggro woes but even a good &quot;paper tank&quot; in the right gear can out-tank us through no fault of our own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love the<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not the warriors problem, its theirs for getting aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
Realistically it is our problem if we cant find groups.  Perhaps level 65 warriors dont have it so bad with or without the uber gear, but getting to that milestone, as simple as it is now with the exp bonus's is still tough for me(someone who took a 3 year break from the game)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaotzuQigong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The current situation with Warriors is beyond retarded.<br />
<br />
Fact is, with slow in play the mitigation/mana efficiency difference between warriors and knight classes is trivial.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, SK's not only get fully controllable aggro through spells, but have &quot;snap&quot; aggro as well.<br />
<br />
Right now, there is virtually no reason at all to use a Warrior in a XP group unless they have EB weapons.  And even then, their aggro is often subject to the RNG.<br />
<br />
With hybrid utility/dps, caster utility/dps, pure melee's are simply in a world of hurt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Why not have the shaman tank... With Q and slow he should have no problems staying alive, especially with a cleric there.  I've seen shamen tank far bigger than Ovalorthere mobs.</div></div><hr />
