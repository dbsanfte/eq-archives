<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blaacker</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And yes, I use the lfg box, and try like hell to end up in valor, bot, or hoh.  But I am asking for the times when I can't find anything else to do.  I play off hours, which is sometimes good, and sometimes not so good.<br />
 <br />
I've read every thread I can find on dual boxing, here and on the old Steel Warrior board, and I've found some good tips.  I used to duo with a shaman on Rallos.  Everyone I played with quit, or transfered over to E'ci, so I gave up my primals and my coldain rings and my jboots, and transfered after them.  One of them quit playing, and gave me his cleric.  I'd much prefer a shaman but beggars can't be choosers, and the cleric is 65.<br />
<br />
My tank is level 62 currently, and I use a ToD for slowing.  Decent gear, I'm fairly pleased with it, magelo is at the bottom of this post.  What I am really after is some advice from the post 60 duo crowd.  I gotta get to 65.  Spent too much time farting around, and now being left behind  <br />
<br />
1)Valor is a little rough, though I have never tried the larvae.  Are they any good?<br />
2)Never tried PoS, which mobs are duoable in there, if any?  And do the npcs inside the tunnels give a negative faction hit when killed?<br />
3)PoN is the modern day DL, and trains are a pain.  Is there a camp someplace in there I haven't been too?  And where is it?<br />
4)PoI is almost always camped (at least the entrance) and it seems too easy.  Is there someplace special in there?  And no, I'm not keyed for the factory.<br />
5)The bottom of the hole any good at 62?  I can gate out with the OT hammer, or worse comes to worse, drag with a rogue mule.<br />
6)I don't have my HS key, on either toon.  Is there someplace in there, or should I just skip it?<br />
7) any place I missed?  LoY?  Some secret spot in the old world?<br />
<br />
And yeah, to repeat, I spend most of my time LFG or grouped in valor, and I have used the &quot;I can bot a cleric for heals, even outside the group&quot; trick.  Tell me there is someplace I can duo, even for slow xp.  Thanks<br />

<br />
personally, i'm not sure myself on what you should do. i'm sure more people will chime in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shirmar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to go to LoY there are acouple places you can go: acouple spots in nadox you have db mobs - in hates fury if i remember right most mobs are db (fun zone)- torigan mines(sp) go all the way to the castle area watch yer step there are traps in some places.<br />
The hole isnt a good option as almost all are either green or lb not enough to gain noticable exper.<br />
PoN isnt a bad area you can go out to where the wolves are if you set up short of that camp you can pull trees, birds, spidies with ease and not really anything to worry about as far as trains (only worry is if someone is at wolves and they mess up and run past you but i think that would be rare.<br />
HS isnt something ya would really want to do for exper most will be green until you get to the end of the zone which would take alot of time to do.<br />
hope some of this helps</div></div><hr />

first off do you have eypatch of plunder? if not 2 boxing in pop with warrior is not really fizzable cause xp will be probably really gay.<br />
<br />
2 boxed pov larve/frogs - ez xp not as good as golems and other mobs in that area<br />
factory in poi - ez gotta pacify decent xp<br />
poi - shit xp very ez<br />
HoH - ez gotta pacify too boring for me<br />
pos not worth it mobs summon or hit too much or both<br />
pon - if too many trains move on other side of the river<br />
HS at 60+ is not worth it neither are any of the old world zones even juggs(lvl57) in os pretty shity comparing to anythin in pop<br />
2 box - tactics chalenging but fun :)<br />
<br />
If you want best xp go for pov wastelands or caves if you can handle them unless you are tactics flaged ofcourse cause that zone rocks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of my duo exp comes from Crypt of Decay.<br />
I did a lot of tier one when i was bored and the cleric was not yet 60 (i didnt want to bother anyone to push him through exe trial although i had the offer before that).<br />
PoI entrance, not bad, often camped though, exp not that good (at least not for a level 65).<br />
PoN, tried left side from GY toward the canyon, could single pull easy, but not that hot, snare whip highly recommended.<br />
PoD, never really tried.<br />
PoV, duod outer caves for a bit, not too hard but highly contested.<br />
Halls of Honor, probably very nice, but hard to get to a camp due to being dependant on potions for invis.<br />
Tactics, nice exp, but dont try without kei on cleric and a snare whip is a must.<br />
PoS, did frog cave, not really worth it though, desert worked better, pulling the cactus type mobs for reasonable exp and some cash loot, risky with adds as snakes are sometimes hard to see and assist the cactus for some reason(they are non agro usually).<br />
CoD is always my first choice for my duo. When i want to get an AA especially bad, i dont group them, just bot the cleric.<br />
Have to use my clerics earrings then to cure disease or poison depending on mob after kill.<br />
With pacification you will not have any problems to break entrance and i can for the most part single pull without knowing pathing, proximity agro.<br />
Wake of Tranquility works ok as well unless there are some greater foul/corrupted puslings up that are above the level limit (drop some crappy pally only 1hander or cirled toe bones).<br />
I'd suggest to get a KEI for your cleric.<br />
I had a hard time keeping up with the healing when i had ~40 or 50 AA.<br />
Now i can do with 2 to 4 Complete heals, depending how fast slow takes on the mob and with my cleric having ft1, mc1 and scm3 he doesnt need kei anymore to keep up on healing.<br />
The greaters are bad news to you usually, as they cannot be snared or slowed and hit for 600+.<br />
I can down them now but it uses around 80 percent of my clerics mana pool for 8 to 9 percent aaxp (solo).<br />
regular puslings give you around 4.2 percent aaxp (21 percent for 5 kills).<br />
Drops are tainted planar essence (sells well to peeps dabbling in pottery), bricks of ethereal energy, strands of ether,all 3 diamond types (raw, blue or regular diamond) as rare, some foul liquid, chunk of flesh as cash loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
This might no longer be valid with the opening of zones.<br />
I play offtime, being on GMT so spots that are camped on US time are often open on my playtime.<br />
CoD is now open to 55+, there were sometimes some 51/2 shamans/clerics inside in guild groups from guilds who got the flag via quest.<br />
Just check the places, might no longer as easy as it used to be as you are dependent on a few select spots where you wont get adds and a snare whip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd vote for the desert in PoS.  I think you'd do OK there, and better exp than most of tier 1.<br />
<br />
The courtyards in PoD are nice, but unless you're awfully good at pulling you'll get adds every now and then, and adds when both mobs are hitting for around 325 can be non-habit forming.  When you are two-boxing, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Duo'd there when i was 61 with a 61 shammy.  Shammy pulls with slow, and sicks pet when it gets to camp.  Pet sucks up HT, and then it's all gravy after that.  <br />
<br />
I used to mow down Gnolls in SK to collect Gnoll Hide Lariat's for the shammy pet.  61 shammy pet duel wielding those that stun, along with HoS and buffs and the pet is a proc'ing machine.  Mob can't run at all.  Just make sure you pull the SK's and not the cleric ones.  /shake-fist at cheal<br />
<br />
SK spiders are usually not camped in PoD because of the groups in rcy, lcy and castle.  Along with the ranger / druid kiting rats, and the little guys (50-54's) taking the goos and flys.<br />
