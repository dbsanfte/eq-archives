<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shaman cripple along with rogue poison cripple helps a lot with this fight, not only for the proc but with his rampage.  If you have rogues with make poison skill of 250, they should be able to make rage of incapacitation (60 dex debuff, 150 hate reduction) that procs for  a 15 minute duration and stacks with spell cripple.</div></div><hr />

Last two times I've done this fight I've resisted at least half the procs and partially mitigated all the others with most doing less than 1k dmg.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kbam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Befriend one of the IT guys and take him to lunch or do a favor of some sort.  Being on good terms with your IT crew is crucial - it will get your problems resolved faster and more favors done than most people realize.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hehe, I work for a company with over 17,000 employees worldwide. Since we are so large everything is done by a certain standard and with a certain procedure.  I wish I could just talk to my IT guy and ask him to help me out but the servers that are actually responsible for checking what is acceptable and banned content exist in NY and I am in Ohio. <br />
<br />
I have tried requesting ezboard access for work related debugging / message board scouring but I was told that I should just check those sites at home in my off time. /shrug<br />
<br />
I appreciate the suggestions but there isn't much I can do in this situation.  Maybe setting up a proxy server at my apartment would work but I haven't thought about it enough to put in the time.</div></div><hr />
