<br />
Before this I was using a BoC w/ A3 aug and Double Edged Stormblade w/ A3 aug.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping this is an aggro upgrade but not sure. Anyone else done much testing with this weapon? I was able to stun mobs up to level 70 with this weapon. Mobs level 71-72 resisted the stun portion most of the time but the lvl 70 mobs in PG resisted it very little. Does it make any difference whatsoever if stun lands or not?<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

And while it clearly can not compete with DBlade &amp; Fleshbiter, it is enough for the guild.</div></div><hr />

Little off-topic, but I looked at your Magelo and I'm curious ... where did the &quot;Trickster's Chalice&quot; come from?</div></div><hr />

Feratha in RS drops it.  Has a nasty ae Feratha's Aura (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5743&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the clicky cloak though now, with &quot;form of defense.&quot; I figure 26 AC is &gt; 90 hp.<br />
<br />
--oh btw got to do a bit of testing with this weapon augged w/ A3. Very nice aggro. I'm not an owner of BoW so I can't compare but hopefully this can hold up well in raids / exp groups for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
don't know if the link was mined or if someone owns it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
claymore is from an mpg raid trial, dropped this afternoon for someone.  from the adaptation trial i believe.  note on claymore - lowish ac, mana for some crazy ass reason, and lack of shielding make me a sad bear looking at it ;( <br />
<br />
oh well, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far the itemization on OoW looks like someone simply forgot to put any mods on most items and put too many mods on a few items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, thanks. Have killed Feratha a couple of times but never saw that drop.  I was hoping the chalice was grabbable with an xp group.  No way I'd waste a raid claim on it though. =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is, he was just saying also that Feratha is pretty easy(the one who drops the fang)  Yeah some of the items are definantly lacking effects but at the same time the items have higher hp/mana and sometimes ac then items before, 270+ hp/mana maybe so your put in the choice of balancing higher hp/mana items with effects you want eh.  Saw the 100ac shield with like 280ish hp/mana and no shielding, mana regen click, avoidance or anything but it could just be a trade off.</div></div><hr />

Uh huh.  Sounds like the devs have been playing Thief: The Dark Project series.<br />
<br />
Seriously.</div></div><hr />
