<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cacker</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am my guild's MT.  We just reached time a week ago and I have been deciding what route I would like to take in reguards to upgrades.  I know I might be close to a month away from seeing items such as a DBoTW.<br />
<br />
Obviously I will get a DBotW for my main but my question is what should I get to go along with it?  I dunno if I am the only one but a DBoTW+EoE combo sounds weird.  Normally you dont have a slow weapon in main and a fast weapon in secondary.  SoPP is 29/30 as oposed to EoE's 20/20.  Too me the SoPP would make more sense for a MT, it has a usefull effect and the dely is better for ripo's.  The EoE just sounds like a DPS weapon to use when one is not tanking.  <br />
<br />
As I look at all the high end warrior magelos I dont see many SoPP's, its always DBotW+EoE.  I would like to know your thoughts about this and maybe help me understand the reason for all these EoE's.  <br />
<br />
One last question I would like to throw at you guys.  I am currently using a BoW to tank everything.  Once obtaining the DBotW do you totally bag the BoW and tank everything with DBotW + EoE/sheild/etc?  Is there a time when you say BoW is &quot;obsolete&quot; and its time to use this new uber time weapon (DBotW) to tank everyhting?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.  Any comments are appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The EoE is popular due to the stun component and high ratio weapon as an offhander.  The SoPP is also a good choice but you'll probably want to add the Anger 3 proc for tanking.  Fully raid buffed, there's generally few slots, if any, for extra buffs, so the SoPP proc might be something to think about.</div></div><hr />

Edge = better ratio, better proc, 25 more hps<br />
<br />
Also it's probably easier for most people to get since it drops off of one of the easiest time gods vs a backflagging event that everybody hates.  Most guilds do the Rathe maybe 3 or 4 times but Time is farm city.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EoE = slightly better ratio<br />
<br />
EoE = slightly better stats<br />
<br />
<br />
- I would pick whichever came first to you, for m e SoPP came first and EoE is not even a worthy upgrade if you already have a SoPP,rune for 80 + heal for 80 is nicer than a 155dd stun for tanking.<br />
<br />
I dont have anger 3 augged on my DBoTW or my SoPP, I will however upgrade my SoPP when I get a chance to get a hammer of timeweaver, basically because nothing else is worth the DKP if you have one of those 2 weapons since they are basically almost the same 1:1 ratio with slightly different stats and the SoPP having the better proc. <br />
<br />
Also have no problems getting aggro having no anger LDoN augs with a DBoTW so dont see any reason for having one.<br />
<br />
Both weapons are awesome, the only difference is, EoE is used in mainhand lots of times when someone gets it, SoPP is mainly just an offhander, and a fairly nice one.</div></div><hr />

ED is a complete piece of shit.  Its got a horrible ratio for the place its dropping, and the proc *never* goes off.  The few tanks that did get it in my guild banked it within a week because it was so bad.  <br />
<br />
With all the other alternatives available, avoid this thing like the plague.  The fun of seeing a 750 DD crit go off does not make up for the uselessness of this weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely wrong. The proc goes off as often as ANY other weapon, ie 2ppm.<br />
Actually, I use it as a non aggro dps weapon main hand with EoE off handed and the proc rate in main hand make up for the bad ratio. On some Time gods I can do nearly 200dps using that combo, with 20-30 dps being non melee damage (750dd 2ppm proc is 25dps on average, critical proc excluded). I don't think ED is as crappy as so many people say but it's not for tanking though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was planning to do that as soon as I have the time, but the main purpose of thoses parses was to show ED was a viable option as a dps weapon, I can calculate ppm based on these parses but it won't be really relevant. I'd need to do that on a parse dummy but unfortunately I don't have the time right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well seeing as the 2 sides of the argument are that the proc &quot;*never* goes off&quot; and &quot;The proc goes off as often as ANY other weapon, ie 2ppm&quot; then yes, the proc rate is kinda interesting to know. Though moreso just because I want more samples from the weapons with modified proc rates.<br />
<br />
 Anyhoo, if you get a chance and the willingness to do it, post results here or in the proc rate thread please.</div></div><hr />

The proc is like most others, it comes and goes. sometimes it procs like a machine gun, other times it won't go off for 2-3 fights.<br />
<br />
during the p1 trials, i put ED in mainhand and jagged shard of frozen flame off (auged with rujarkian bile). I didn't parse the fight, but i counted the damage from procs in my head. came to over 8k in procs on one mob, hehe so it's not so bad. <br />
<br />
are there better weapons, yep, but it's not a terrible weapon either. the proc really helps the dps and a crit blast really helps, but i wouldn't put this on a high priority to loot. If it's gonna rot, grab one for fun, else save for something much better imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my parses though, w/o ambidex the SoPP in offhand outdamages the EoE.  I'm pretty sure w/ ambidex the EoE will outdamage the SoPP.<br />
<br />
As for aggro, the EoE is slightly more aggro.  I have my SoPP aug'd with lifetap and my EoE is not aug'd since I rarely use it.<br />
<br />
I generally just leave SoPP in my offhand all the time, and swap DBotW (w/ anger3) for aggro and CoW aug'd with lifetap for non-aggro DPS.  And then often swap in a shiled w/ DBotW.<br />
<br />
DBotW is generally enough aggro for me that a tiny aggro boost from offhanding the EoE isn't worth the extra ripostes.  And I don't have a Raex BP yet even.<br />
<br />
I'll likely eventually put Ykesha on the EoE and it might make it a bit more attractive, but in general I'm just not a big fan of it.  We have so many EoEs in guild that apps pretty much can get one after 1-2 raids with us.<br />
<br />
I guess the advice that I would give is just keep which ever one you have.  It's not at all worth it having both of them.<br />
<br />
Personally I love utility weapons and things that warriors can make use of that are more than 0 utility and EB.<br />
<br />
For the buff slot thing, I generally always use Virtue and it's rarely a problem.  Sometimes I click off Runic to make room for an AE heal or something, but it's hardly an annoyance.</div></div><hr />

I have to second this.  How does a slower weapon with a worse ratio and no damage proc beat the EoE in DPS?  No way it can happen.<br />

Hadn't thought about it but SoPP with a lifetap augment would be pretty damn sweet for exp groups, non-aggro dps, and farming greens though.</div></div><hr />

If you're the MT of your guild, this is your eng-game weap setup.  The EoE + Aug pumps out a very nice amount of anger alone.  The DBotW goes w/o saying of course.  Together, these will enable your guildmates to really crank up the DPS.  Bottom line...GET THE EoE!!<br />

Not sure 'how it can happen' but I've parsed it twice over 8 hours in length and it happened both times.  Also happened in shorter parses, which I've posted on this site.  Like I said though, this is without ambidex.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which would be better offhander, EoE or Bloodfrenzy, purely in terms of aggro generated?  My assumption is BF, since it will proc 2X as much, which should more than make up for the 4 points of dmg that it gives up to EoE, imho.  But I am interested in other opinions.</div></div><hr />

ED has a negative proc adjustment, so it does proc less than other weapons :)</div></div><hr />

That basically amounts to 21.25 DPS. Not bad, but probably not worth the craptastic ratio.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to WA5. With WA5 your net proc rate will be 50% higher, or 2.55 PPM, which amounts to 31.875 DPS from procs. This of course does not include crits, so the actual increase should be higher. With the -200 resist adjustment it is rarely resisted as well, particularly since MR is usually the most debuffed resist (at least Tash, often Malo of some sort). Pretty stout as a DPS weapon.</div></div><hr />

I've been using it for around 5 months and it's a good offhand. Like I've said before, not my first choice. But if you're gonna loot one for free, I'd say go for it. <br />
<br />
I posted this about 4 or 5 months back on this thread: ED (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4026) <br />
I picked up a Ethereal Destroyer last week because it was going to rot and my other offhand weapons weren't that great. I added a Anger III augment to it and I think it makes an ok offhand weapon. Personally I think LDoN is insanely easy to get points so I didn't have any problem spending 1150 on the aug. I'd rather have a EoE but I wont be looting that anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I ran a parse on the Katta banker using my augmented Darkblade and Ethereal Detroyer, both have Anger III. Total time was 7 hours 28 minutes (448 minutes). My haste was 41% and I don't have any combat effect items yet. Here's the results.<br />

Parse was 7 hours 28 minutes in length (448 minutes). Non-stop swinging. 305 Dex. Bracers of Earth Energy for haste (41%). 1476 atk. All AAs. No buffs. No Combat effcts. Target was Bella Helsin, one of Katta's bankers. Attacked from behind.<br />

My suggestion goes along with Jateki's, if it's going to rot, pick it up, but I wouldn't reccomend persuing it as a choice offhand at all.</div></div><hr />

In the offhand, it doesn't proc enough IMO to make it worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

 ED is fun cuz and surely is a nice DPS proc weapon with a lil 20 ac and decent HP . Weilding a giant chicken rotted leg with spikes is always a bonus to pick up hungry ogress and troless ( if you have The Rotting Fist you won t go back home alone that s 100% sure ) . It smells bad enough to keep the poshy paladins away from you ( even some dorfs would stay clear ) .</div></div><hr />
