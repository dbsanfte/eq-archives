<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">very old, paladin only, nodrop etc etc.. not sure what you mean by saw it for 5k.. but I very strongly doubt it was being sold due to being nodrop.. course I could be horribly wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">maybe hes on FV o.O its not really good tho, except for how easy it is/5 cheal charges (cheal right?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, it has 5 charges of Complete HEal, instant cast if I remember correct.<br />
<br />
Can only be used by Paladin.<br />
Think you have to be Paladin to use the charges too.<br />
<br />
Old world item with particles, used to be THE only item with particles except a torch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Troll warrior here, I'd made a dozen or so soulfires before they got nerfed to pally only (thanks BOTB).  Pretty easy quest if you have the faction for it, took about 2 hours tops depending on how lucky you got on the rare spawns.<br />
<br />
Pretty much useless for warriors nowdays, unless you happen to need a REALLY bright lightsource (works in toplevel inventory spot).<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its part of one of subquests for Paly epic, Soulfire.<br />
Aye, it's a part of their Epic.<br />
<br />
The Soulfire is a nice quest in itself (Zimel's Blade quest) that has been in the game for as long as I can remember and was one of the defining items for a Paladin, pre-Kunark. Involving nasty NPC's such as Sir Lucan D'Lere (mean level 48 NPC, man he was tough) and a barkeeper in Neriak !<br />
Ok, ok .. so you didn't fight the barkeeper and nowadays there's another NPC in freeport that can do that part of the Quest as well.<br />
<br />
The Paladin epic is the Fiery Defender, in which you need the Fiery Avenger. To get the Fiery Avenger, you need a Soulfire and a Ghoulbane. so the souldfire is now reduced to a sub-sub-Quest in the Paladin Epic. :p</div></div><hr />
