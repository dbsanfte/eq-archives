I am currently wielding xana hammer in main, and red epic in my offhand. now it would be fairly easy for me to obtain a stormrider's carapace or a greatblade of storms. what I am thinking i will do is mainhand  a GBoS and put my xana hammer in the offhand. is this worth the effort? and should i spend points on a carapace if one drops?</div></div><hr />

(About 1 per 10 kills on CHSD, about 1 per 3 kills on GBOS.)<br />
<br />
Never seen a carapace drop in at least 8 trips.  Seen 7 GSo4W in that time though :)</div></div><hr />

as for your weapon set up, i used GBoS main hand, hammer offhand and ghetto bash with the shield while i was tanking.</div></div><hr />

Don't spend any effort getting one of these until they fix furious bash.  I wouldn't mind giving up 33% of my damage to use a shield if it gave me INSANE UNBREAKABLE AGRO, but right now I think that furious bash actually gives less agro than using a non-procing offhand weapon</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">on the drop rates my guild seems to get the exact opposite. on our 6 xanamech kills 4 hammers have dropped and on our 7 5 icestorm kills only 2 greatblades dropped. right now i use the GBoS in mainhand and CHSD in offhand and when i switch the two around i cant tell all that much of an aggro difference except the GBoS is better dps. the stormrider carapace has really limited use, i only use mine on AE mobs where i need resists or if im tanking and i have really sweet aggro early on from duel wielding and can switch for more ac/hp</div></div><hr />
