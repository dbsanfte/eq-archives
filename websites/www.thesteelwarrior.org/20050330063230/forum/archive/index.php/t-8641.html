hehe.. it's Avatar of War. ;)  lol got a mental image of a huge bird. ;)<br />
<br />
1)  It's relative.  I took him down with 2 groups and just 2 clerics healing me.  But for someone on that level of content I would guess around 40-50, with 7+ clerics in in CH rot on the tank.<br />
<br />
2)  Pretty simple.  Clear arena, pull Vindi(don't HAVE to kill Vindi but may as well), pull Statue, pull Idol(killing Idol un-slowed is a good test to see if you can kill AoW), pull AoW.  Corner pin in either corner of the arena for all of them.<br />
<br />
3)  Pretty random.  He doesn't have a huge loot table so your chances of getting one to drop are pretty good.  I've seen 3 drop at once before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiadan</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">try kiling Idol unslowed. If you can do that you can kill AoW. Back in the day; that was the final check of yor CH rotation and your raid DPS/tank rotation(s) to pull it off.<br />
If you can't kill Idol unslowed; you're not ready for AoW yet. Nothing to be sad about tho; it's a great progression check to see what you're able to do next. Once you can gank AoW you're ready for a whole new set of monsters.<br />
<br />
I like that Aviak of War name though. Sony should re-name The Spiroc Lord as the Aviak of War. Too funny !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to reiterate:  Idol unslowed is uncannily close to the AoW in difficulty.  On some servers, there are generally accepted agreements that you can't slow the Idol the first time you do him.  This prevents the AoW frrom being blown (once AoW pops you have 20? 30? minutes to engage him b4 he depops)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bustauff</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've killed him 6 times in a row with no BoC, then they started to fall like rain. But more than the BoC is the other items on his loot table. BP, Helm Pants for Monk, Mask for Rogue/Bard. He has an excellent loot table and if you take him down you will continue to farm him for some time. And with your Gear you should have no problem doing him, depending on how many healers you got.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has done AOW 24 times.  Out of the 24 times, we have gotten 15 boc, 12 bows, 10 rings, 10 masks, 9 legs, 9 helms.  I am not sure if we were overly lucky but that is how our luck went :)  <br />
<br />
We have seen 2 BoC's in one kill once, but as lucky as the person above who saw 3.<br />
<br />
This mob does open you up for more oppurtunties in mobs.  Best of luck to you, hope you get you a boc soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XAclylospradaX</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure on your servers but there is a 7-8 man team that either blows or kills AoW, on every spawn(inc tmax also). Looking at playauctions.com on TP, sometimes you will see auctions for AoW ring. It's rather sad that this encounter has been perma camped by a team or possibly 1-2 people multiboxing and selling aow loots for PA pp auctions.  <br />
<br />
Kael was always a fun zone to go to after raids, and have a community of players help out on AoW, it was even more gratifying seeing the lucky warrior get awarded his/her's First real agro weapon. <br />
<br />
One of the best things about the zone is King Tormax's zonewide emote, probably one of the best in the game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I am on the same server and AoW is constantly camped by a small group who do it for plat.  I have been told that AoW is taken down by only 4 characters, not sure how this is possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see 4 people taking down the AoW.  The best possible combination would probably be 2 clerics, a warrior, and an enchanter with a charmed pet.  And that kind of DPS won't bring down the AoW before the 2 clerics mana pool runs out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barmoz</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest that a bard would add more DPS than an enchanter on this fight, the damage shield was always the biggest single source of DPS back when we were killing him.  <br />
<br />
I'd say a single group could do it pretty easily, probably want three clerics, a bard, a warrior, and a rogue.  Get buffed from druid, shaman, paladin, ranger, and enchanter before starting and they'd win without breaking a sweat.</div></div><hr />
