<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">/rant on<br />
<br />
So there I am in PoV, join a group at RC and start tanking...<br />
<br />
60% life left, no CH heal message from cleric.<br />
<br />
50% life left, still no CH heal message.<br />
<br />
40% life left, finally a CH heal message!<br />
<br />
HP goes down to 5% before CH lands.<br />
<br />
Hmmm I think, ok maybe he was just laggy on that one.<br />
<br />
Next mob, same thing - 40% CH start.<br />
<br />
Mob gets a lucky streak of hits on me and I pop evasive when it seems the CH is gonna be late.<br />
<br />
I survive.  Disc used.<br />
<br />
At this point I'm thinking, should I say something to the cleric?  Will he take it the wrong way and get snotty with me?<br />
<br />
So I keep my mouth shut.<br />
<br />
2 mobs later, I go down.<br />
<br />
I get rezzed, but lose a little xp and also lost the xp on the mob I went down on.  No apology, no explanation, no nothing from our gambling cleric friend.<br />
<br />
Downtime whilst I get rebuffed and lose rez fx.<br />
<br />
Cleric announces he's going...yay!  New cleric comes, CH starts at 60% and I never die again, and cleric never calls for mana breaks. Heaven!  I don't have to keep glancing nervously at my HP bar, I can concentrate on tanking and keeping aggro without worrying, I know the cleric will do his job fine.<br />
<br />
Do you suffer from clerics who like to gamble with the tanks life and xp?<br />
<br />
Now if a cleric starts the CH too late I always send them a /tell to ask them to start a little earlier.  I'd rather piss off a snotty cleric than die all the time.  <br />
<br />
/rant off:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've come across a few &quot;gambling&quot; healers, but I've never really died because of it. The heals always seem to come just in time. o_O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I am in a Pick UP with a stranger cleric the first thing I do is to inform him about my momentary ( groupbuffed ) hp.  Cause I am a female gnome the clerics are mostly a bit impressed about the number :D but then they have the idea how much hp I have left ín fight.<br />
<br />
Its not real nessessary cause a good cleric knows how much hp you have when he has healed you in some fights but the safer the better.<br />
<br />
Btw I hate this type of cleric always trying to land his heal in the last 10 % life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe i guess the cleric was used to some more beefy tanks or a botted cleric lacking AA's as well.<br />
I usually tell the clerics in group that its safe to start complete heal at 30 percent when mob is slowed (in tier 2).<br />
But i am over 8200hp with virtue and self buffs and all defensive AA's.<br />
Elementals is another story with mobs that proc dd's and other nasty stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With some tanks in PoV, a cleric can start a CH at 25% in the fairly certain knowledge that it will land early.  With others, you can start a CH at 60% and still be taking a risk.<br />
<br />
PoV is a break point.  Level 65 tanks with 100+ aa can still go there to earn big experience, and sometimes they do.  Equally, level 55 tanks with 3aa and less than 5khp can also go there and sometimes they do.  It takes a cleric a few critters to figure out how badly the tank's getting owned.<br />
<br />
Equally, level 65 clerics with 180aa still go to PoV for exp; I did, yesterday.  Level 55 clerics with 3aa can also go there.  A higher end cleric can play it a bit cooler, because she'll have tools like Divine Arbitration or Supernal Light to cope with any sudden damage spike; a level 55 cleric has only one spell which can produce the hp/second to cope with a double 500 + proc, which is CH.<br />
<br />
A high end cleric can compensate for a low end tank and vice versa, but lower-end tank + lower-end cleric against PoV critters is a total party wipeout waiting to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been neglecting my warrior the last week, trying to join a new guild and all the raid guilds require a lvl 60+ main.  So I lived in PoV for most of the last week.<br />
<br />
I was at LC with my monk(59 that night) with a pretty good group.  63 sk, 59 war, 65 bst, 65 chanter, 62 cleric, and me.  SK was buffed to just over 5500hp, warrior was just breaking 5k so the sk got the nod for tank.<br />
<br />
I go pull us a Golem and the sk snares him and we start to beat it down.  HP on the sk is dropping fairly fast...they only hit for 500ish :rolleyes:  Anyhow, sk is at half health and no heal message from cleric.  Chanter is working on slow, mob is tashed and slow is inc.  Slow got resisted and sk is at 30ish percent.  CHeal inc on tank.  Ooooook, maybe he'll duck and hit a fast heal.  Nope, down goes the sk.<br />
<br />
Slow lands before warrior can hit taunt and lock agro.  Mob on chanter.  Smack, smack, smack, chanter down.  Taunt refreshes and warrior gets agro.  Mob at 65% and dropping.  Warrior health is down to half and again no heal message from cleric.  Warrior bangs defensive and asks for a heal.  30% and CHeal Inc.  Warrior at 5% and CH lands.  Warrior is back down to 40%, mob at 30ish.  Cleric fizzles on CH.  Tries again.  Warrior goes down.<br />
<br />
I tank the mob til it dies, got entirely too close.  Cleric thought he was gonna land a CH on me(4500ish HP) after letting me get to 40%... I hit mend and make it.  Mob drops, rezzes inc.<br />
<br />
Buff up and try again.  Cleric waits too long to start CHeal and sk goes down again.  He did manage to keep the warrior alive this time(barely)<br />
<br />
Bst asks the cleric why he is waiting so long on the first heal against unslowed mobs.  Cleric says he has it down to a science.<br />
<br />
5 more pulls, sk dies 3 times, warrior died on last one.  SK finally loses his temper with the cleric.  Asks him wtf is wrong with him.  Cleric gets mad and gates out.  No rezzes for the war or sk.  Another named added to the Do Not Group With list that I share with ingame friends.<br />
<br />
I've seen some pretty sorry clerics, but this guy was the worst I've seen in the planes.<br />

 &quot;not gonna land&quot;<br />

I died laughing. literally :D<br />
<br />
t'was my fault though; i told him &quot;lemme see if i get some cripples and whatnot&quot;.. bad to try out on rampaging mobs tho :p</div></div><hr />

Last night I had a real freak occurence when tanking Vindi. I was down to 1% life for at least a few seconds, maybe 5. Vindi  did not land a hit on me once.......then finally a shaman heal hit me and the cheals came in again....Now that s scary :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm the exact opposite of this, I absolutely hate when a cleric CH's me at 60%, or even 50% for that matter.  I tell clerics not to heal me until 35 or 40% (when doing non-elemental exp).  I guess I just like to live on the edge and watch those crips fly by, makes life more interesting to see some nice big hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When something like this happens, the BEST thing to do is to send a tell...don't say it in group.  Healers sometimes hate that.  Letting them know your hp ahead of time, so you don't die in the first couple of fights while the healer gets used to you, is always good.  If you ever have any problems with the cleric, try to resolve it in tells, and remember that you're probably looking at two different sides of what's going on...sometimes.<br />
<br />
Personally I'll CH at 60% on groups I'm not sure about, then lower it to near gambling levels as I get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When grouped with new clerics I make a habit of sending them a tell with my current hp's. Playing a cleric myself sometimes I know this to be valuable information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is only one cleric I trust to gamble with my red bar.<br />
<br />
He doesn't play any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I take credit for this.  I bitch at clerics for healing me early.  If I don't get at least my unbuffed HP out of every CH (I'll consider buffs the margin of error), I get annoyed at the mana efficiency.  I got no time to be waiting on cleric mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The worst thing for a cleric is when tank hps are dropping like a rock, and you start your CH, and the red bar just stops. Somehow my tanks seem to stop taking damage while my CH is running just to piss me off. It really adds insult to injury when their hp % ticks up and CH lands with a higher hp % than when it started. That's when I start start trying to add Purple Club members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like to gamble with my own life on my bot cleric :)  Landed a CH with 17 hps left last night.  Have purple-clubbed myself twice, one of them the heal landed for something like 28 more than my max hps at the time.  Pretty tough to make the purple club on stuff that hits for 500 though, pretty much gotta be lucky.  I thought 17 hps on a 200 hitter was pretty good tho.<br />
<br />
Really the experience you lose with a 56 rez is less than one exp kill in PoV.  I don't get upset at all if I die a time or two in a couple hours, as long as the cleric can get me buffed back up without any significant downtime.  If you spend any time as a raid MT you have to stop getting upset about dying or you will spend too much of your time mad :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah...The Quon started a big thing called the Purple Club where you try to land the CHeal while you're knocked unconscious....<br />
I just dumped clerics who did that....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My cleric is 51 and being in PoN with a 51 sk as tank was hmm interesting :) but on a tank a few levels higher i tend to start the ch around 50%, problem is as mentioned above the hp stops there, so i might interrupt and of course the hp drops to 30% in 2 secs :eek: to bad at my current level i lack a good non ch heal, superior is only 615hp and that don't help much unless mob dies.<br />
<br />
Think i will stay my cleric out of the planes to 53 when i get a better heal, maybe guild groups since xp in PoN with a 62 tank,62 bst is damn good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dont be afraid to speak up and ask the cleric to start their heals sooner if they are cutting it to close. No reason to wait for the first death to occur imo. <br />
<br />
Just 1 death will totally obliterate any small efficiency gain there is from starting a CH at 40% instead of 50%, its simply not worth it.<br />
<br />
No offense to clerics, but YOU the maintank is in a much better position to judge a mobs damage output and when they should start the CH. You see exactly how much it hits for, how fast etc.<br />
<br />
Also giving pointers to clerics can save your ass.. like if you notice the mob for some reason is unslowed(slower maybe slacking), relaying that info to your cleric can save your own skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">unless the cleric is a sleep he shure will notice if mob is unslowed or not :D<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>SnapricotOrange</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I have played a cleric since I started playing EQ.  Personally, I like to time it so that CH lands right around 20 to 30% hp left.  This will allow for the occasional lag spike, damage spike or the rare case that during those 10 seconds,  the person being healed runs out of range.  20% life should give me the time to throw on a Supernal Remedy real fast and then assess the situation and plan my next action.  Normally that is enough to tide me over and get back on track.  Landing CH around that time is a pretty decent balance between mana efficiency and safety.  I know I am timing right when the warrior I am healing gets berzerk message and is healed maybe 3 seconds later.  That is what I use to judge accuracy and adjust.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;The Quon&quot;, he is kind of the embodiment of cleric frustration, but a vast majority of clerics don't actually play with that mentality.  See, the problem with a lot of clerics is that they get pushed into the role of &quot;healer&quot; and are not allowed to deviate from it to expand their knowledge of what they can do or what their spells do.  It is sad to see a lvl 50+ cleric who has no idea he/she can summon food, mem blur mobs, make themselves invis to undead mobs or heal over time (I have seen this on more than one occasion).  Clerics are a very capable class if you get someone who plays it to its full potential and doesn't sit back and be a bot like most clerics. =P <br />
<br />
On a side note, Brutul, you sound like the type of warrior who would be ballsy enough to let a cleric be the puller for your group.<br />
<br />
So I also play a warrior now.  It's weird being on the other end of all those CH's.  I can understand now what the apprehension is when grouping with a cleric you don't know.  In fact, I was in CoD and this cleric in my group let me die without casting a single heal.  When I popped at bind, I asked why he didn't heal me and he tells me &quot;You aren't the main tank, so it isn't my job to heal you.  That is what shammies and druids are for.&quot;  I was horrified.<br />
<br />
Personally, I blame SoE for this mess.  They made it too easy to get to the high levels and now you have a new generation of newbs who have no clue how to play their classes because they have had no practice time to learn the game.  <br />
<br />
I remember a time when being high level meant you knew what you were doing and had a grasp on the game.  Now it just means you had the highest bid on eBay...<br />

Im only level 59 but buffed up I was sitting at close to 6.5k hp. We had a 57rog, 58mag,57chanter, and a 59 bard. I am tanking the mobs, and the rogue got riposted a few times, so he is at 70% hp. Cleric cheals the rogue, and then casts a 1k heal on me. So now I am at 60% hp and she cheals another caster, and 1k heals me again. SO I tell her to stop the 1k heals and cheal me. She keeps doing it. . We get a 58 sk there. they want him to tank now. /shrug. I bet with the mage he is dead either 1st or second pull. First pull I slap /shield on him when he hits 15% hp, cheal lands at 9%. he lives. 2nd pull, he goes from around 100%, 60%. to 9%, and dead. So I tank the mob, mob dies im at 70% hp still. Finally replace the cleric. New cleric rocks. no down time, no deaths, all goes smooth. An hour later cleric has to go, and old cleric logs back in. I leave group. Lol. Now why cheal casters/rogues? and 1k heal the MT? Blew my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I often see 4000HP unbuffed warrior with few AAs trying to manage the damage in BoT and 4000HP unbuffed Hp does just not cut it there.<br />
I expect to the be able to start the CH at 50% HP and still land it in time on an unslowed yard trash mob. Named and PHs in BoT are of course a different matter.<br />
The HP/numbers might be a bit different in PoV, but I would still expect 50% HP to be enough for a CH to land.<br />
<br />
I suspect the problem comes from the huge amount of powerleveled/powergamed toons that go for level more than gear in the false hope that they can get the ubah gear from BoT once they hit 65.<br />
If a warrior can not reach 4500HP unbuffed and atleast 1AA in CS and CA, then he should not be in BoT at all.<br />
<br />
Just because you can get into a zone does not mean you can XP there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I talked alot about BoT before, mainly because I did not see the PoV word in the first post, but the same goes pretty much for PoV also.<br />
I do not consider my own 61 warrior fit for PoV and although a 65 warrior takes hits a bit better than a 61 warrior, its not really enough to make Gonaden fit either with the current gear and AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree 200%. If planes Xp wasn't that good, people would not be all xping in Plane_of_easy_as_shit_xp_07 but in zones like sebilis, charasis, chardok etc, where they could actually learn how to play well....and it would save everyone the trouble of getting complete noobs that can't even stand getting advice from people who knows what they are talking about.<br />
Sadly, planar xp just helped dumbing down the game another degree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I often see 4000HP unbuffed warrior with few AAs trying to manage the damage in BoT and 4000HP unbuffed Hp does just not cut it there. <br />
<br />
I've done it dozens of times at 4k unbuffed. Granted I'm around 6500 buffed most of the time though. I wasn't PL'ed nor did I race to get to 65. I just recently got 65 as a matter of fact. <br />
<br />
Just because a warrior isn't someone's Bazaar baby or the main tank for an elemental guild shouldn't make them totally worthless. Add in being agnostic and going the levels&gt;AA route, getting much higher than 4k unbuffed is pretty hard to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should see all the uber advantages there are to using a Warrior.   Like healing more often early in the fight.  Running the risk of pulling aggro when slowing.  Having everyone else have to hold back a little to a lot, just to allow the Warrior to keep the mob's attention.  Stupid n00bs, don't they see how great this all is?  And the fact that the exp rolls in slower with the potential for more CRs, gah, what are these retards thinking?  That's just pure fun!<br />
<br />
I just can't understand the stupidity of people who play other classes.  It just boggles the mind.  These folks should have grown up in dungeons where they'd KNOW how wonderful it is to die repeatedly and have to attempt a real CR so they'd see how much fun having a Warrior tank can be!<br />

Stupid n00bs.</div></div><hr />

6500HP is pretty low for a warrior that has to tank an unslowed mob for 10secs without heals in order to be able to hold agro against tash, slow, cripple and heals.<br />
You might be able to handle the lower leveled mobs with a chainhealing cleric, but you will most likely get a reputation as a bad tank, and it would be impossible to put you up against the boss mobs or PHs.<br />
<br />
I don't think people are calling people who pick paladins over warriors stupid noobs, I think they're calling shitty clerics stupid noobs.<br />
The cleric most lileky has all the important heal spells available to him, but he has to manage his mana and agro.<br />
The problem is in the most cases by far the warrior that is taking on a zone that is too high for his level/AAs/gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Missed a line in last post. Here it is.<br />

Cleric cheals the rogue, and then casts a 1k heal on me. So now I am at 60% hp and she cheals another caster, and 1k heals me again. SO I tell her to stop the 1k heals and cheal me. She keeps doing it. .  <br />
<br />
40% life left, finally a CH heal message!<br />
HP goes down to 5% before CH lands.<br />
Hmmm I think, ok maybe he was just laggy on that one.<br />
Next mob, same thing - 40% CH start.<br />
Mob gets a lucky streak of hits on me and I pop evasive when it seems the CH is gonna be late. <br />
<br />
Slow got resisted and sk is at 30ish percent. CHeal inc on tank. Ooooook, maybe he'll duck and hit a fast heal. Nope, down goes the sk. <br />
<br />
Warrior at 5% and CH lands. Warrior is back down to 40%, mob at 30ish. Cleric fizzles on CH. Tries again. Warrior goes down. <br />
<br />
I'm no rocket scientist, but the bitching in this thread is about clerics who heal WAY too late for their group makeup, which is pretty much bullshit.  Clerics have one freakin job.  The first heal should even err on the side of caution, and then adjust after that as needed.  There is basically zero reason to ever be dying if you have a cleric with mana.  I know CH is 10 seconds, but if you've been playing a cleric for even an hour you should be able to figure out how to time that crap.<br />
<br />
I will admit that there are plenty of people playing where they probably shouldn't, but that's not the point here.  If the cleric thinks that you as a tank are a damned mana sponge, then he should be kicking your ass to the curb before you get the chance to say that he's a bad cleric.  In doing so tho, he should most definitely have the resources at his disposal to keep you alive for a mob or 2 to determine the fact that you are indeed a mana sponge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I'm another one that takes part of the blame for this. :-) I often bitch at the cleric if the cheal is for a low amount. :-)<br />
<br />
I run about 8k hp in an exp group, if the cheal lands for 2k or less, chances are I'm gonna tease the cleric. <br />
<br />
As for PoV/etc... ack. I just can't quite grasp the idea of a level 55 war tanking there... When I got into PoV, I was running about 5500 buffed, I think, and I had to use 2hand epic, was getting owned dual wielding.  And we didn't have EP geared clerics to keep us up. :-)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I normally xp in BoT. Clerics tend to land the first few heals for 3-4k or so, and it works up to 5-6k, with the occasional 7k or more.<br />

I agree 200%. If planes Xp wasn't that good, people would not be all xping in Plane_of_easy_as_shit_xp_07 but in zones like sebilis, charasis, chardok etc, where they could actually learn how to play well....and it would save everyone the trouble of getting complete noobs that can't even stand getting advice from people who knows what they are talking about.<br />

<br />
Granted, but its not impossible. I've died 1 time so far in BoT and that was a 4 man group doing a tower mini. Letting the cleric know before hand what sort of hp's they have to heal helps them alot. I have  63 cleric, and I like knowing what 50% health is.<br />
<br />
The groups I've been in haven't had excessive(if any) downtime so I don't see it being much of an issue. I'm working on ND3 and some other upgrades as we speak, but these things take time.

I hear that.  I'm in barbarian cultural, made with my own hands.  I have a few NToV drops.  I have earned 45 AAXP, at least 10 of which have been outside of PoP in the last couple of months, so far more time intensive than PoP AAXP.  As a result I've added somewhere in the neighborhood of 300+ HP to my stats so that I'm currently 5k unbuffed.  And to hear people talk, I should consider myself marginally capable of tanking in tier 3+.<br />
<br />
Yet I don't hear the same thing being said for Paladins or Shadow Knights.  Why exactly is that, do you think?</div></div><hr />

I was in a group fighting the magma giant guys on the bridge in fire; they quad for about 1100. . .and had 2 clerics in the group.  So they decide to play a little game.  One cleric has to pay the other 100p each time he does a 7500 heal. . .god, that game sucks.  I think there were three 7500 heals in the same fight once, and I'm the &quot;half-elf-bard-paper-tank.&quot;  I didn't die though till later in the night.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

It has 100% and nothing but 100% to do with gear. How can one not think its about inventory? Hybrids have store bought spells that even the youngest of player can afford at the apporpriate level. Warriors are all about the HP/AC. <br />
<br />

<br />
This game is all about the toys, and even more so for a Warrior than a Knight. To think otherwise doesn't compute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I will admit that some of the healing technics described here really makes me wonder how the clerics got to those levels in the game.<br />
I guess I got a small flip when I saw the first post and gear, because I had at that point really added a huge number of paper tanks to my list from my last BoT session. :(<br />
<br />
I also remember reading numerous threads where it was stated that 4k unbuffed was the minimum for tier3 zones.<br />
<br />
True, I have read those posts too, but I also found that the ones that said that had several levels in ND, CS, CA and PE, which make a significant difference in damage taken.<br />
I still agree with those posters, 4K is the minimum, but its sadly nowhere near the requirement for most groups/camps in Tier3 planes where XP is constant pulling is expected.<br />
<br />
Yet I don't hear the same thing being said for Paladins or Shadow Knights. Why exactly is that, do you think?<br />
<br />
Like some warrior run a list over bad clerics, many clerics run a list over over paper tanks.<br />
I do not like to have warriors with less than 6500HP buffed (mainly with virtue only, since a shaman is not always around) or knight with less than 6000HP buffed.<br />
Knights get a 500HP benefit because they can agro on inc and allow a much earlier slow.<br />
This list actually holds alot more knight toons than warriors, because warriors get the HP benefit from STA.<br />
The list is however not balancing warriors much, because once the tanks reach 7000+HP buffed, then it really does not matter much on my mana or timing of heals in tough situations, so knights win the tank spot with their near instant agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense at you personally Steenky, but realize this :<br />
<br />
There are MANY, MANY people in this game who have outleveled their gear, plain and simple.  Gear should never be an issue, because if you're doing fine with the gear you have, then you have good enough gear to be doing what you're doing.  If you're getting your ass handed to you, and clerics and blowing mana left and right on heals other than CH to keep you alive, or chaining CH alternatively, then there is something wrong.  That's a completely seperate issue.  You should have the gear to do what you want to do, and if you don't, then you should stop and do something about that.  <br />
<br />
I spent so much time in Kael in my early 50's it made me sick.  Utterly fuckin sick.  I can't even go back there today, I leave my guild to get their own CoV faction because I personally can not stand the zone.  I realized when I was level 50 with 865 AC that I wasn't going to last much longer wearing crafted and Guardian armor, where my BP was ac 22 and I was lucky to get 15ac on every other piece.  I stopped the leveling and I started the quest to become a TANK instead of just a warrior who happens to be around.<br />
<br />
When Fierce Heraldic came out, I did NOTHING except powersmith a level 1 human cleric to 240, because there was no level, no AA skills and nothing else I was going to get that was going to be as big of a power increase for myself AS A TANK than getting myself the best gear available to me.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, there is absolutely zero excuse for anyone to be wearing gear that is any less than they are capable of getting.  Have a healer friend?  Then you should be wearing full champs that you looted from the bank in Kael, and don't tell me that nothing drops there because i did just that, and my goddamned breastplate dropped there, while I was duoing with my shaman.   Have a cleric and a chanter?  Get your ass to HoT.  You have plenty to do it, and you have no excuse not to be wearing full Myrmidon in time, especially if you are level 65. Worship the Tribunal or Zek?  Farm some plat, farm some components, kiss a smith's ass, do what you have to do to get yourself the gear that YOU NEED.   Then get your ass to droga and get yourself some aggro weapons.  If you are doing any less than that, then you have other issues besides clerics not healing you correctly.<br />
<br />
The reason we end up with situations like this is because there is WAY too much emphasis on Level &gt; All.  It gets spouted on this board and every other one over and over and over again.  It's complete bullshit.  Stop, look at your gear, look at other people your level in equivilent situations.  If you're lagging behind, then FUCKIN STOP logging on and going to PoD and do something about it.   There was a shaman in my guild who did nothing but whine and bitch and complain about how he didn't have Malo and Torpor, but the bastard never did anything except sit in PoN and grind XP.  Never farmed any cash to buy them, never went to anywhere they could possibly drop, just did more XP and wondereed why he didn't have his spells.  If gear is an issue for you, you're doing something wrong, because with the way the game is set up right now, gear shouldn't be an issue for anyone, and then it all comes down to skill playing the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's one thing to say that a certain level of gear is beneficial and you should do your utmost to gain it.  It's something else altogether to look down on people who've worked their asses off to get what they have just because they haven't made raiding their number one priority.<br />
<br />
And lets be honest, some gear just is not possible to acquire in any fashion other than raiding.

You must have linked the wrong magelo.  First off that guy has only 8 droppable items out of 22 possible.  Yes, many of his items appear to be ornate.  So how do you think he got the ornate?  Bought it or raided for it?  Any clue how much that many pieces of ornate would cost?  A lot.  So he is probably no bazaar based Warrior.  And the flags listed are pretty much all but 4, so your statement about flags is incorrect.  Plus he has 142 AAXP, which means he's been getting groups and grinding exp for a long time now.  I also noticed he has a weapon with taunting blow and is wielding one of the Warrior epics off hand.  Right, this guy got his stuff primarily from the bazaar.....<br />
<br />
Next you'll be telling me that getting an EB weapon is a piece of cake and any Warrior worth his salt will have one.<br />
<br />
You know, my comments weren't really targetted at you to begin with, other than my counter to that general comment you made which seemed to indicate that everyone that didn't adhere to your level of overblown excellence was pure unmitigated n00b.<br />
<br />
But you've really proven my point for me.  A friend of mine in a raiding guild recently sold a boot ornate mold for 50k, which isn't unusual on my server.  Some people might have 50k, many don't.  The Helm of Ralos Zek that guy in the magelo is wearing goes for 90k easy on my server.  Basically you're saying that if you're not in a raiding guild, you need to be farming plat non-stop at almost hard core raider like frequency.  And if you don't, you suck.<br />

They take having accpetable equipment for granted, because it should be for someone that has played for years.

I must agree that sony has not delt well with the aging game over the years from the lowplayers perspective.  When I was in my 30's, guk was soooo fricking crowded that I spent all my time in sol B.

You have no concept of what is difficult to someone not in a guild of your caliber, because you don't have to try and deal with it.  I've spent litterally hundreds of hours and hundreds of thousands of plat working on smithing just so I can make my own armor, and now I have to listen to the arrogant comments of someone like you who thinks I should just come up with 500k to purchase ornate molds, and if I don't then I'm not fit to tank in BoT and PoV.<br />
<br />
And while you may consider the Warrior epic a joke, if you're guildless it's extemely unlikely you're going to take down the queen in chardok, the spiroc lord in sky, or get a green scale.  The three pieces to completing my epic I've been without for over 2 years.  I make do with a willsapper and a copper hammer of striking these days.  But of course these wouldn't be up to YOUR standards, because I should be in a raiding guild to meet the minimal requirements in your mind.<br />

Expecting people to have velious/cultural armor, some good non-visible stuff from the bazaar, 36% haste, and a couple decent aggro weapons is perfectly reasonable.  That does not make you 6k unbuffed though.  Hell my warrior only has 5800 unbuffed with 2 AoW loots and 4 things from VT.  I only have 29 AA points.  I can tank very well in any tier 3 zone...well enough that a shaman can keep me up with no problem.  I play a cleric and I know what a paper tank is like.  In the tactics pit I can start a CH on myself at 20% hps weaing sub-optimal buffs (with the mob slowed) and it will land 99% of the time.  Even unslowed I don't start a CH before 50-60%.  6000 unbuffed hitpoints is far more than you need to tank exp groups in tier 3, and a non-uberguild warrior with 6k hps unbuffed is going to be very rare.<br />

Kunark created that problem, not PoP per se.  You could go from the newbie yards to the places like Oasis, to some place like East Karana, to LOIO, to FM, OT,  to DL, to BW, to Skyfire and never once step foot in a dungeon.  You could easily get into the mid 50s and have no idea what a dungeon was.  All PoP has done has been to continue a trend that has been going on for years.<br />
<br />
I happen to like dungeons, but many people don't.  The one thing that I've always found the most annoying about dungeons has been the bullsh*t involved with a CR.  It's bad enough that your group blows it and wipes, but to then have to spend, sometimes, several hours trying to recover the bodies was just insane.<br />
<br />
With lots of people all it takes is that happening once or twice to convince them to give up on dungeons altogether.   And while those players who keep at it may learn things they wouldn't have otherwise learned, those things don't always translate to being skilled at their class.  Nor does it mean that someone who dislikes dungeons is a poor player of their class.<br />
<br />
You know what we can agree on?  Some people are crappy players.  Some people are idiots.  It doesn't matter if they have great gear or crap gear.  You know them when you see them.  And it doesn't matter if they've experienced only in dungeons or in open zones.  If a player sucks, they suck.</div></div><hr />

The point being that not everyone is in an Elemental guild, nor has the time to farm plat to buy Ornate.  This being the case, people like myself are delegated to third class exp group members regardless of skill level or time played. I say third class because undoubtedly the hybrids hold the first spot followed by warriors with more hit points than god allmighty and the 4k warrior left in the 3rd position. I've been playing this toon since the beginning of 2k when my cleric decided to make a pet. The gap has widened immensily between the hardcore and and semi-casual players with the last 2 expansions. Basically a 2:1 ratio now.<br />
<br />
I levelled to 65 because the overwhelming opinion on this board that 65&gt;all. When it comes to getting that tank spot, this holds very true, but in terms of relative power not so much. Owell, this is my boat and I'm willing to sail in it happy go lucky until someone says it's not about gear. It honestly is.<br />
<br />
Tell me the difference between a warrior in elemental+ gear and a SS gear warrior in terms of hp/ac. Then check them again at the soulbinder.</div></div><hr />

There have been some great points here from both sides. As you have said, you can and do tank in BoT. Now that you are 65 you don't have to concentrate on levels. AA is going to be your concern and I see you have been working on ND and STA. Keep at the ND and you will see a nice jump in hp's for free. Work some defensive AA's and you will feel the difference. I can't tell you guys how happy I am with Warrior AA after listening to some of my rogue and monk friends.<br />

Gear will always be a struggle for most of us. The best thing we can do is pick 1 slot and upgrade it with the very best item we can attain. It works for raiders and it works for us too. You get that Top-notch item and you won't be worry about that slot for a long long time.<br />
<br />
Stick it out in BoT and tier 2 planes. A couple pieces of plate Ornate molds drop there and are easily attainable given the time. If you are in greed groups then winn and sell things that aren't useful, and buy what is. The road of a warrior is hard, but then again so are we.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, Trondir doesn't know what he's talking about, despite denying that fact repeatedly, and proving it more repeatedly<br />
<br />
:p  <br />
I was simply exaggarating, you schmuck<br />
if your cleric runs mana problems when all he does is casting CHs and some very few fast heals / celestials on  the tank something is very wrong.<br />
There was a shaman in my guild who did nothing but whine and bitch and complain about how he didn't have Malo and Torpor,<br />
<br />
an excellent example of how much YOU actually know about this game. Do some fucking research what mobs actually drop these spells, and at what droprates. Then check your bazaar prices for it.<br />
My wizard has ALL her good spells, but not because I worked for it(which I did, too) no, because I had dumb luck at the right moment.</div></div><hr />

You don't wanna go there pal.  You see the name under mine below?  That's my wife's shaman, which I took over at about level 34 when she got bored with this game.  By level the time she was 50 (This was pre-luclin btw) I had Malo, Torpor, Pox, and Bane of Nife sitting in my bank.  Don't tell me I don't know what i'm talking about because I did that shit way back in the day when no one was single grouping dragons.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you can't get your spells, you're not trying hard enough.  You don't have good enough gear to do X or Y, you're not trying hard enough.  Did I pay out the nose for some things I own?  Yes.  But it's fuckin platinum and if you're not an idiot, you can get platinum.</div></div><hr />
