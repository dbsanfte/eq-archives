I've become interested in aquiring a SoD and just wanted to look at what I might be looking at price wise... I've never seen one for sale on Tribunal but then again I don't hunt the bazaar... So would like to try and find out what SoD's go for on other Sleeper Awaken servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx<br />
<br />
Edit: Updated Profile to include Magelo... Since ppl seem to say SoD is a bit overpriced and should go with CHoS what armor might I look to be saving up for... have about 90K in the bank atm...<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree that they are a bit over priced, for now... glad I just managed to sell mine.<br />
<br />
But BoC are something like 300k... so it's not that bad...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anywhere from 120K to 300k+ on terris; depending who has the only 3 or so on the server for sale up on the auction block that week :D<br />
<br />
i swear it must be the same 3 SoD's being sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can twink with a sod, harder to find something equivalent w/o a 55 req on it. Same of Salindrite Dagger going for 100k+ when you can find 15/20 piercer for 25k.<br />
It's clearly overpriced for a main, but for a twink...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">200k or so on Xegony.<br />
<br />
Brutal is right.  The CHoS is about 80/90 percent as good, for 10 percent of the price.   If you still need to spend money on any armor or anything, seriously consider weather you want the SoD.<br />
<br />
I will say though, as a non elemental warrior, dual wielding SoDs, people are usually surprised that I can hold agro as well as I do in pickup groups.  2x SoDs are more than sufficient agro for anything you will find in LDoN, or Tier 1 and 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would expect the price to fall anywhere from 200-300kpp, Sleeper on tribunal was woken a couple of months before SoL release, but I don't think more than 2 guilds would have had access to farm SoD's and I don't think much farming was done.  Most SoD's you see sold on tribunal are probably imports from Stormhammer.<br />

Server board is at http://pub101.ezboard.com/bthetribunaldotorg if you dont already know.</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile, a copper hammer of striking is 90% as good for 5k.  SoDs are nice weapons, but extremely overpriced due to rarity IMO.  But Brutul, everyone KNOWS that the SoD has 5x the proc rate of other weapons ... oh wait ... scratch that, guess that was just a rumor.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Brutul is right. Depending on your server you can get a copper hammer for around 10k or less. Unless your magelo looks something like this - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=718156&amp;resize=true - then there are probably quite a few upgrades you can get that would be of more benefit that the difference between an SoD and a CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread has been somewhat hijacked, the original poster just wanted to know the average prices on SoDs...<br />
<br />
On Cazic Thule, they were 300k+ for quite a long while (I bought mine for 350k about a year ago). Just recently they've really started sinking in price (most droppable loot has sunk to nearly 2/3 or 1/2 of its price just a few months ago).<br />
<br />
They're now about 180-200k.<br />
<br />
I'll buy into the hijacking a little I guess too. Yeah, CHoS is great bang for the buck, where as if you want one of the very best droppable weapons (SoD) you're really going to have to pay a max price. If I was walking around in total crap armor, then I would get a CHoS and some upgrades. OTOH, if I had decent gear, I'd rather have an SoD than a couple pieces of 70k+ armor. I guess that depends on one's play style though.<br />
<br />
Something to also keep in mind: I've found Anarchy to be resisted far less often than Force Shock.</div></div><hr />

They both check against MR with no modifications so I don't think that is the case...<br />
