<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would just like to discuss this idea a bit :p,<br />
because to tell you the truth, I don't really like it.<br />
<br />
Yes, multi-tanking is something that hasn't been touched much in this game. And it could of been an interesting path to take for Warriors.<br />
-Warriors being able to control a massive amount of mobs, and survive (would fit class description too!)<br />
-Hybrids being able to uncomparably control one or two mobs at a time.<br />
<br />
There are slight problems though.<br />
<br />
First of all... when controling a massive amount of mobs, it would be silly to spread out the damage. (except in very few circumstances).<br />
Damage would be focused on one mob at a time... so aggro on the other mobs isn't that critical.<br />
<br />
Another problem is the warrior's tankage ability itself...<br />
in ldon groups ive been tanking 2 sometimes 3 mobs as often as possible. Luckily they hit like wimps.<br />
But if you want a multi-tanking tool, it would be for tanking 5, 6 + mobs..<br />
and a warrior's tank effectiveness would need to be tweaked some to support that.<br />
Which would bring us back to square one.. about upping Warrior hp/mitigation blablabla<br />
<br />
And dont forget that you'de have to retarget each mob, to introduce into their body the aggro dot.<br />
Leave the mob you were tanking, target another, dot it... what happens to the mob you were tanking? with people hitting on it... they'll certainly get the aggro.<br />
And if you make it so the dot alone, is as effective as a decent Warrior aggro... then it would be overpowered (or seen as overpowered by SOE anyhow).. &quot;Double Warrior aggro just like that?.. never.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a nicer way, in my opinion, for multi-tanking. And that already exists partly..<br />
Rampage and AE taunt. Yes they suck bad now, hardly serve of any use.. (except tank switches and the first seconds when theres more then 3 mobs around.. yay).<br />
<br />
There was that idea about linking discs and a aggro skill, to a stamina-like bar. (that I've spammed around already way too much :p ).<br />
So imagine linking Rampage and AE Taunt to that...<br />
<br />
Want multitanking?? save up your stamina for multiple rampages (use the right weapon, and you've got loads of mobs dotted or nicely aggroed)..<br />
of course, after all those rampages, you'de have little room for a disc.<br />
So if you wanna make a gigantic train and &quot;exploit&quot; multiple rampages with Earthshaker... you can't.. because you wont have room for /disc Fortitude, and .. well.. duh..<br />
<br />
Well that's how I see it,<br />
feel free to discuss, criticise, hug etc...</div></div><hr />
