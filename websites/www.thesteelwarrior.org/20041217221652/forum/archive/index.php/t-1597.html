I know crossposts are evil but I was hoping to keep the discussions in one thread and I assume that everyone here has an ezboard account.  Let me know what you think.</div></div><hr />

EB is almost useless cuz it wouldn'tproc every 12 seconds. now if this had like a 40% succes rate it would work and also if it worked like at 80% then we could use those awsome high dmg with uber dd/dot proc weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giving that overpowered class evasive will basically result in me switching entirely to my cleric immediately. At least then I can stop getting angry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grocolo</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel you are missing the point.  Warriors get Snap Agro and Agro lock and Knights get Defensive and Evasive.  Yes the amount of Agro is alot through the ability, just like SKs get alot of agro Snaring and through Direct hate spells and Paladins get alot of hate through Stuns.  Its seems balanced to me, that doesn't mean it is, but if you are only going to pick a certain part of the post to rip on I can't really see why you think this is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Assume that the direct hate is resistable maybe a neg30 MR resistable stuns and snares still add agro and SK Hate spells are unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grocolo</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also as it stands right now a Paladin with a Bronze Two-Handed Axe could compete with a Warrior with a Blade of War, in terms of agro generation, yes if the warrior gets a few lucky procs he'll keep agro if not the paladin would easily hold it in between taunts.  It doesn't seem right to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Giving the Knights evasive, defensive, and aggro lock up the wazoo will spell the demise of the Warrior raid role.  Who would use a Warrior tank with perhaps 1k more HP when they could use a Paladin who could fire of their own LoH for a couple of k hp when in trouble?<br />
<br />
So Warriors will at most be weak DPS, no other reason to take them on the raid, and rapidly they'll get dumped for real DPS.  Sorry, no sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrikBludgaard</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much as I hate to agree with Glatius,<br />
<br />
Knights should not receive defensive.  (nor evasive)<br />
<br />
An auto-parry or auto-riposte discipline would be fine...<br />
(something to last long enough to get a CH chain going)<br />
Even an auto-shield-block discipline would work.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANY ability that allows a Warrior to add + hate would be welcome.<br />
<br />
BTW, + hate spells/skills are not snap aggro....<br />
<br />
Snap aggro is TAUNT skill...<br />
<br />
+hate spells/skills are for KEEPING aggro.<br />
<br />
Taunt +hate +hate +hate means you stay the target of the creature's &quot;affections&quot;....<br />
<br />
TAUNT is the single best and fastest way to SNAP aggro anything at melee range.<br />
<br />
Even for a shadowknight who has quite a few other choices...<br />
<br />
Another nice feature would be to increase TAUNT range to outside melee range... even if this was a warrior-only change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let the warrior keep their raid role edge thank you... let the knight keep their taunt edge...  just get the two a little closer to each other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Aerin`Dar last night, we had a fucking 65 Afterlife Warrior there (obviously equipped to the hilt).  Guess who MTed?  A Paladin.  When one of the top three guilds in EQ has a Warrior pre-empted on a raid kill....you do the math.  Paladins do not need Defensive.  <br />
<br />
The Paladin did great and held up fine, but he was not near as uber as you might think.  Clerics kept getting stunned, so we had a few Paladins (including himself) LoH him in that event.  Snap aggro locked Aerin`Dar on him throughout the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok if we would get aggro like that. we shouldn't have to give up our 2 best disciplines (aggresive owns while tanking with gnoll hide lariats tho. hands down)<br />
think about all the stuff paladins already have:<br />
heals. can heal if downtime is needed but is never.<br />
stuns even a low aggro gives him aggro<br />
Lay of Hands<br />
those are the most general heres warriors<br />
evasive/defensive <br />
good hp/ac<br />
...<br />
again most general.<br />
i don't see it fair we give up maybe our biggest advantage in raid situations to get something in groups. it will totally screw us up in raids including sometimes pals/sk's tank anyways because aggro is more needed then the extra hp/ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with giving warriors the same aggro lock knights have and then in return giving defensive and evasive to knights is that in that scenario the only advantage warriors would have over knights is a higher skill cap in a few skills.  <br />
<br />
Knights would still have all their spells.  Defensive and evasive are basically irrelevant for xp groups but for raids they are the ONLY thing warriors contribute that is not exceeded by another class.<br />
<br />
For knights to get defensive and evasive warriors would need not only roughly equivalent aggro but also either significant utility added or a huge advantage in skill caps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I don't think paladins or knights in general should get evasive or defensive. <br />
<br />
The reason?<br />
<br />
Agro lock. The balance of evasive is that you hit less often and you get hit less often, generating less agro. Since knights agro is tied to their spells and not their dps, their would be no draw back to useing this. Now couple that with LoH and knights become even more powerful in the raid situation. <br />
They could pretty much escape any situation  as well. <br />
<br />
That one thing would unbalance the game so much in the favor of knights that I wouldn't hold your breath hoping for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and another thing, defensive/evasive is the only thing that makes a warrior a warrior in the end game. Everyone else trumps us in everything except hit points. <br />
<br />
Paladins getting evasive would be like giving warriors LoH.<br />
<br />
I don't know of a paladin who wouldn't agree that giving warriors loh would significantly unbalance the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madine</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with giving warriors the same aggro lock knights have and then in return giving defensive and evasive to knights is that in that scenario the only advantage warriors would have over knights is a higher skill cap in a few skills.<br />
<br />
This statement cuts to the heart of the problems with warriors now. Other than defensive, what do warriors do that another class can't do better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been my firm stance as given Paladins don't need any /disc avoidance.  Paladins at this stage don't need any defensive type disc either.  We already have an escape move that is handier and IMHO works better than a disc.  Defensive doesn't make sense from a gut feeling.  I would rather stand back and assist off tanking or just flat out healing than take point against raid monsters.<br />
<br />
As Madine says, what else do Warriors do but this?  This is one reason why I believe Warriors need a boost instead of seeking changes in other classes.  If a Warrior isn't tanking what should a Warrior be doing?  It should be something more than just contributing DPS since there are so many other classes that do that better.</div></div><hr />

Naaaa, would be more like giving warriors a right-click insta cast CH...</div></div><hr />

<br />
sometimes on backflag and oldworld stuff we let the DRUID tank...<br />
<br />
We have warriors with 10k+ HP.... we have Knights with 9K+....<br />
<br />
Aerin is not exactly much of a challenge for Elemental/Time equipped guilds.<br />
<br />
That paladin was likely given the nod just because they COULD do it...  not because he was the best choice.<br />
<br />
Certain of our druids have more HP than the average poster on this board...  I bet they complain about druid tanking next!<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to stand up to Vallon just once and wipe that grin off his face...  even if its for a measly 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like my time/elemental-equipped knight to be more durable under fire than my bazaar-equipped rogue please...<br />
(we are talking against the TIME version of Vallon Zek)<br />
