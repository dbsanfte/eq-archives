<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Off TT in Time, we got one last night and it sparked some discussion about whether it would hold agro enough for a warrior w/o a BoW to use.  So do any warriors have one and how does it stack up agro/dmg wise?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Granthor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe what a coincidence.  I just posted a similar question on my guildboard.<br />
<br />
Vanazir will probably outdamage the BoW.  I doubt very seriously that will have anywhere near the taunt that a BoW or dual hates has.  It would have to litterally proc non-stop for it to be remotely effective imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dual wield is not an option considering how much more damage you take from ripostes.  Which means that there is a total of 1 end game weapon in game for warriors to use, BoW...and we don't kill RZ any more so i'm looking for alternatives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just out of curiosity Gorlab, why don't you guys kill RZ any more? We are in the same position you are in Time but we still get RZ a couple times a month. The fight is pretty trivial now and it's not like it takes that long. I think we have something like 7/10 warriors weilding BoWs now.<br />
<br />
Other than a BoW, I think you are pretty hosed for a good 2h agro weapon. At least until we find the Time warrior agro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right there really only is one viable weapon to hold taunt 2hs wise, and its the Blade of War off Rallos Zek.  That said, i would imagine that the elusive and often hypothesized &quot;frenzying blow&quot; weapon might drop off the Plane of Time rallos?<br />
<br />
I have a blade of war, but if i didnt, i would wait to see if Rallos in Time drops something similiar before shelling your DKP or merit or whatever you use on the Vanazir's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carpedium7th</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stone etched war sword is another option, I use one and very rarely have problems with aggro. 2hs is a heated debate with hybrids and warriors, since hybrids pretty much always had 2 handers by default, but times have changed and that is different now. <br />
I would think it would be good to come up with a compromise between hybrids and wars on the stone etched war sword and that 2 hander off terris for tanks that don't have BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stone Etched is more rare and harder to get than BoW.  We don't kill RZ any more because the officers deem it not important to get BoW's for the rest of the guild is all.  So we have our 5ish BoW's and the rest of the tanks just deal with dual wield crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stupid double post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An alternative to the BoW is the 2hs Amenatha that drops from the New INNY in Plane of Hate.<br />
It has similar stats to the BoW.<br />
<br />
Naralli Ironsmith<br />
Overlord of VoLS<br />
the Rathe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh Anathema, 36/30 procs EB I suspect its not even as good as the 35/23 from PoFire that I already have unfortunately.  But its certainly nothing close to BoW's 45/30. :(</div></div><hr />
