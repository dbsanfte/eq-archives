<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having played around pretty much exclusively in the LDoN environment since it's release thus far, I'd like to take this opportunity to share my preliminary views on tanking and &quot;class balance&quot; in the arena of tanking in the environment of LDoN.<br />
<br />
Normal Adventures:<br />
<br />
Mobs do not hit very hard, nor do they represent a grave threat to groups in &quot;normal&quot; adventures.  Furthermore, most &quot;normal&quot; adventures seem to be optimally done with multiple tanking rather than the older method of &quot;Crowd Control, then kill 1 at a time&quot;.<br />
<br />
It seems esier overall for a warrior to find a spot in an adventure group in LDoN than it did in PoP, because there appears to be a lesser resistance to multiple tank groups.<br />
<br />
In guild based groups, which is all I've done (I fear an LDoN pickup group), guildies look for a &quot;tank&quot; and the one who shows up at the adventure site first and is the least burden on the group will be the one who gets the spot just about every time.<br />
<br />
You want groups?  Learn the fastest way to get to every wayfarer's camp, and you'll get em.<br />
<br />
Get out your snarewhips boys!    If you don't have a snarer, you're gonna need them, as mobs run early and they run fast in a couple of the themes and the aftermath is bloody indeed.<br />
<br />
I have some concerns though, and that it with the balancing of mid 50's &quot;asassinate&quot; adventures.   Bosses are a tad too tough in those adventures relative to player power, and require a more &quot;fine tuned&quot; group to succeed.  A mob hitting a 55 player for the 500's is a significantly more difficult opponent than mobs hitting level 65 players for the 800's.    While benefitting warriors with /disc defensive, nonetheless it isn't really 'balanced' with the rest of the expansion.   <br />
<br />
There's a couple more &quot;class balancing&quot; concerns that I currently have.   <br />
<br />
The first has to do with mobs low avoidance skills.     I spent a bunch of AA's in &quot;Tactical Mastery&quot;, and in LDoN it seems to be going for naught, as mobs have relatively pathetic avoidance skills, reducing a nice advantage I've had in tanking DPS.<br />
<br />
The second has to do with Undead and SU3.   I'm sorry but it is simply wrong for 2/3 of an expansion to undo what warriors have had as one of the sole things that separates them from their Paladin cousins, which is a DPS advantage, particularly while tanking.   If mobs have low avoidance, mitigating the effectiveness of Tactical Mastery, and at the same time, a preponderance of Undead, playing to the strengths of Slay Undead 3, then I have a problem with it, as there's no &quot;warrior friendly&quot; alternative.    <br />
<br />
Just prior to the release of PoP, there was the whole proposed Slay Undead change, and this I fear is the reason they were considering implementing it, it had nothing to do with PoP but with THIS expansion, and had I KNOWN that there would be a situation like this in advance, I probably wouldn't have supported the positions of paladins at the time, where there would be no tanking advantage AND no DPS advantage, while there still being a major aggro advantage.<br />
<br />
Hard Missions:<br />
<br />
I'll withhold my judgement on these missions while they work out the changes on test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the undead, it does make Paladins very strong, but it also makes Necros VERY group desirable, which is something they haven't had since the FS Daggers got nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Re: SU3<br />
<br />
Paladin in my guild has claimed to parsed out SU3 in LDON vs SU3 in SoL and in PoP and said that there was a 'significant' reduction in the proc rate of SU3, however what that reduction was he didn't state and I was too busy setting up groups to press him on the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SU rate in LDoN has been discussed at Paladins of Norrath, the consensus seems that SU acts normally there.  <br />
<br />
I understand 40% of LDoN has a fairly large amount of undead in it.  I don't know where Frodlin gets 2/3 from.  If I am mistaken in my 40% number, please explain why 2/3 is correct.<br />
<br />
Again, Slay Undead does not turn a Paladin into Superman vs. undead.  It adds an AVERAGE of about 20% to our DPS versus undead (this includes using Holyforge at every opportunity).  The individual slays make nice eyecandy, but an SU3 Paladin will not really do much more damage than a similarly equipped Warrior against undead over the length of a 90 minute adventure.<br />
<br />
I do agree, however, that having 40% of the expansion with concentrations of undead increases Paladin groupability at a time when we are very strong already.  This is also being done at a time where Warrior groupability versus Paladins is at an all time low.  Just trying to add another perspective to the conversation.<br />

<br />
Mistmoore, Guk, and Miraguls are primarily undead-oriented zones.    This is 60%, 3/5ths would've been more accurate, but it's closer to 2/3 than it is to 40%.   <br />
<br />
I also agree that SU doesn't turn you into Superman vs. undead, but it DOES turn you into &quot;somewhat better than warriors vs. undead&quot; which is my &quot;balancing point&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The unexpected boost from Slay Undead comes from fighting lower HP monsters (which is what made it really attractive in Luclin).  If a monster only has 20K HP taking a 3K chunk + your melee is meaningful damage.<br />
<br />
Even saying this it doesn't transform a Paladin into an unstopable juggernaught.  You can go entire monsters without gaining a large hit.  You can do a dreaded &quot;bash slay&quot;.  Slay of course doesn't help tanking beyond making the fight faster.<br />
<br />
Slay is fun but just not reliable without Holyforge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kinda funny that youre trying to watch out for pickup groups frod. Im 4-2 in LDoN 4 being with pickup groups the 2 mostly guildies. In my experience Ive met some people in the pickup groups who are very good player for there class. Might just be my luck though. <br />
<br />
  One other thing about LDoN before it came out I thought I would never see 60 as the game had been losing some of its luuster. In the past week I have gained 2 levels and am not 58 the exp in those dungeons are awesome for me. Now i just have to update maegleo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.  If all of the tanks are very well geared for DPS then that might work but just about every mission I have lost has been due to lack of DPS, not lack of tanking power.  I've gotten to the point where I flat out won't do an LDoN adventure without at least 2 pure DPS classes unless I know everyone in the group is very well geared/AA'd.<br />
<br />
I've succeeded missions with more than 60 mins to spare and I've also done a collection mission where it took 90 mins to collect 7 of the 20 items we needed.  (I refuse to do another collection mission).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) I never seem to remember the &quot;L&quot; in your name.<br />
<br />
2) I think you need to address loots at least some (and I feel like I am being worked over...again).  Considering the 760 plate state has no stm and belefical mana stats, yet again itemization favors hybrids. IMHO the correct way to have done the armor is +stm on it (whihc we all want) and remove mana stat. Make hybrids decided on mana or hp, while letting us specialize more in armor.<br />
<br />
The collect drops are very uneven. I am 1 and 1 on them. The one I failed we only had 9 of 26 after 2 hours. <br />
<br />
Certantly normal LDoN missions have me spending my AAing on offensive...and I only have AE, ND2, CA 1, CS1, PE and now PB1 and TM1. I buff to 6-7 KHp in an LDoN group and considering normal max is about 373 I have more than enough defences  to keep the healer from going OOM. Since all the missions but assassinate are about regular kills, I don't feel that defensive AA pay enough for now. I don't have the gear (from what I have hear) for the hard missions anyway...so. <br />
<br />
To me it sounds like the step between normal and hard is a bit much. (Even considering I am 5-5 so far...)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
The point of multiple tanking though is to apply a DPS multiplier to your group.<br />
<br />
IE:<br />
The group I played with this weekend was:<br />
65 Warrior<br />
65 Warrior<br />
65 Enchanter<br />
65 Wizard<br />
65 Druid<br />
65 Cleric<br />
<br />
If we pulled 3 mobs and mezzed 2 and fought 1 it would look like:<br />
WarA 150DPS<br />
WarB 150DPS<br />
Enc 250DPS (90 from pet, 11 from strangle 8 from Aspyphixate, 150 from nuking)<br />
Wiz 250DPS<br />
Dru 240DPS (150 from nuking, 50 from vengeance of tunare, 40 from swarming death)<br />
Clr 100DPS (Hey he had to heal occasionally!)<br />
<br />
For a total of 1140 DPS.<br />
<br />
Now, if you split the group to be on two mobs and the Enchanter/Druid dot both, your DPS goes up to 1249 a 10% increase.  If it took you 60 minutes to win before you're down to 55 minutes, over the course of the day... That can be a full extra Adventure.<br />
<br />
Add in a class with more DoTs like a Necro over the enchanter and the multiplier would be almost stupid (Necros can do what? 250ish DPS in DoTs alone?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To which I reply.  Let's see the parse.  Perople's perception of things is often far different from reality.  You see a couple huge slays pop up and you figure your DPS must be going through the roof!  However, when you parse several hours of action it will come close to a 20% increase.  That figure is not the result of a one-off test.  It has been parsed and corroborated by many Paladins over quite a while.<br />

DPS Damage Per Second. <br />
When your fights are only lasting 30 -35 seconds and your paladin has 1 - 2 cleansing strike's their DPS goes through the roof.  My fights in LDoN on normal with most paladins btw only last that long.<br />
So damage per second when 35's seconds and even two SU's go off for lets say 3500 points for those two strikes has already assured the paladin of 100dps.<br />
<br />
Tell me how that is incorrect for only two hits to take a paladin to 100dps not counting anything else he may do on a normal adventure? (havent tried hard yet so that average can change there)<br />
<br />
Im not whining im just making a small simple fact. MM and lowerguk were designed to utilize every skill a paladin has. and their dps in those zones can make a ranger blush and get jealous.<br />
<br />
If you wish to pursue this discussion more we can take it to the outhouse but I think I have proven that a paladin with SU3 can and will see a 50 - 70 percent increase in DPS on any normal run in LDoN with a undead setting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You have proven nothing. Post a parse. You have not demonstrated that a paladin gets 2 slays in a 35 second time period over a large period of time, you have simply asserted it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sigh, <br />
For a second lets assume one SU per every encounter for 1500points. <br />
Parses are fun things but can take up lots of space. But even on a 35 second encounter with say one 1500 strike for a extra 50dps per fight. Thats still a vast increase over what they can do to a single living mob. <br />
<br />
When fights are trival to 30 seconds per mob dps on every class can increase a bit but not spike as much as one can see from a similiarly armed paladin with a few select aa's. <br />
<br />
If you want to see for yourself grab a 65 pal with SU 3 and go dungeon hoping I guarentee whatever there DPS is on living mobs will increase by at least 50% in a undead setting. Why is that such a hard thing to comprehend?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yes people with lots of skill as paladins have done logs before with fights that drag on for a minute to two.<br />
Thats great and dandy ask them to go and parse LDoN normal 65 runs with SU3. <br />
<br />
Im not asserting that their entire DPS is upgraded like that at all. I am saying in LDoN SPECIFICLY that their dps has higher increases due to low hp on mobs and higher numbers of AA.<br />
I have also stated that everyone on a normal run in LDoN should see a improvement in their DPS. <br />
<br />
However what you misinterupt is that in MM/LGuk paladin's with SU 3 will see more then a 20-30% increase in DPS due to low non pop / non luclin style AC undead mobs allowing for more max hits, as well as higher damage per slay undead.<br />
<br />
My own dps went up by 15 points in no way due to gear upgrades augmentations, just simply because of the AC of the mobs I was fighting. <br />
<br />
However my point in general is that from my own views and in the talk with a few friendly paladins that grouped with me have told me they have seen significent rise in their dps up to but not limited at 50%. <br />
<br />
Now I can go and grab a paladin and parse with him on a undead mob in Cyrpt of decay. Then take him on a normal 65 run in MM. Then see about results, However i'd rather see the experts in their field do their own LDoN test's on both Normal / High risk and see what exactly their DPS is and put those parses agasint PoP undead / Luclin undead and see what they are like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm going to say this.  I know what Paladins have parsed their DPS increase as with SU3 and holyforge.  And I also know what the common perception is of Paladins using SU3 and holyforge is aganist undead.  Allow me to paraphrase someone in my pick up group today, as they were deciding that I the Warrior should play back up tank, while the Paladin played MT, &quot;Paladin X should own these undead&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can't refute that SU3 and holyforge do 20% more DPS simply because I don't have the numbers.  But I know that the common perception is that Paladins to &quot;massive&quot; damage to undead, and it isn't just the Warrior community who thinks it.  And therefore while the reality might be different, the perception is enough to get them even more preference for a group.</div></div><hr />

Right.<br />
<br />
None of the baselining against Luclin or PoP mobs needs to be done. Simply do (slay damage)/(total damage - slay damage). That should give you a pretty close idea of how much slay increased your DPS (though it will actually overestimate the % slightly). Do that for a couple hours, and you will have some numbers worth reporting.</div></div><hr />

If you read through the entire thread, it starts with a paladin thinking that he was getting more than the usual number of slays (2.36% of hits, as opposed to 2.09% pre LDoN). He then goes on to find that over the course of more LDoN adventures, it equalized to about 2.05%. A slay multiplies damage by 10x. The math isn't too difficult to follow from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Glatius brings up one of the hardest parts of balancing imo.....<br />
<br />
 do you balance for reality, or do you balance for perception?<br />
<br />
P.S. Slay is nice when it goes off...<br />
<br />
But its really not too much of a DPS increase, yes if you get a slay or two it signciently increases for that fight, but I *usally* go from fight to fight w/o a slay, with an occastional one here and there,<br />
<br />
P.P.S. SU3 takes 18 points (ignroing Crit costs)  Flurry 6 takes a good amount more, but works on everything, just curious how much of an incresae it does...<br />
<br />
 persoanlly i'd rather prob have flurry6 , unless your in all undead dungeon I bet the TOTAL dps increase is about the same, not withstanding all the dungeons w/ little to no undead....<br />
<br />
 but this bring us back to point 1....<br />
<br />
balance on perction, or reality?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Paladins prior to PoP were routinely balanced on perception and not reality.  The reality was they were gaining on Warriors at a significant pace and people just weren't aware of it and didn't make grouping decisions based on it.  Along come PoP which throws it right into everyone's faces, because lets be honest most Warriors and Paladins don't have access to PoP gear but are using gear from prior expansions.<br />
<br />
So, did Paladins need all the heals and other changes they got in PoP, LoY, and LDoN or have the been being balanced on perceptions?  I'd say perceptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Sorry I kinda disagree on baselines not needing to be done.<br />
SoL brought us perhaps the highest ac's ever seen in the game. Making it harder to do max damage agaisnt mob's.  Come around PoP you see ac's being reduced by a slight bit for all mobs making it easier to increase dps.<br />
<br />
Here comes standard LDoN.  Mobs with insanely low AC for a change which will affect everyone's dps giving them a boost. Then add in the short fights.  Thats where you will see a spike in pure dps is based off one to two lucky strikes or lucky SU's. <br />
<br />
Thats why I have said what I have. because in short burst fights having burst damage like SU will dramatically increase anyone's DPS.  A fight that lasts saw a minute and a half agaisnt a mob vrs a fight that last say 30 seconds will show a much better increase in dps on the 30 second fight due to burst damage. <br />
<br />
Add in the fact that the undead mobs in LDoN seem to be nothing but burst mobs I.E one maybe 2 SU's going off will show prolly put best by Glatius a perception of paladin's dps increasing.<br />
<br />
Which is really why i'd love to see the paladin experts that know how to due their parse's parse combat in LDoN non undead setting vrs a undead setting. then post their results and I bet you will see a more then 20% increase between the two.<br />

<br />
Oh come on. This would be true IF they could cast it at will. It is totally random. It will go off on some mobs, and not at all one others. So they may have huge &quot;burst&quot; damage on one mob, and not at all for then next 10 mobs. Over time, about 20% DPS increase.<br />
<br />
If the paladins DPS increases because of low AC, then the SU DPS increases at the same rate, but it is STILL the same percentages. About 2% of hits are Slays, slays still do 10x damage, they still account for a 20% DPS increase. No baselining is necessary to determine how much of a paladin's DPS is due to slays over a given period of time.<br />
<br />
If you are fighting a high ac mob, and your average hit is say, 60, then your average slay will be 600. If you slay 2% f the time, that is a ~20% dps increase. If your average hit is 100, then your average slay will be 1000, and once again if you average 2% of hits are slays, is still a 20% DPS increase. The AC of the mob as NOTHING to do with how much of a % DPS increase you get from SU.</div></div><hr />

I could care less about necros undead slowing or whatever.  Give me my mind wrack and zevfeers, now please.  Necros are damn good additions to groups, especially with the need for speed.  <br />

Add a shaman and you have some serious mana generation.  Let's put is this way... canni 4, mind wrack and theft of vitae is better mana regen than KEI for a shaman.  So much so it's not funny. <br />
<br />
Of course, we managed to lose one because the shaman was mana heavy and would nife right after slowing and got pasted 3 times.<br />
<br />
Also worth noting, there are some unlullable mobs in the dungeons, as well as a fair portion of unmezzables.  Best to bring 2 tanks along and crowd control that way - other CC methods take too long and time is not something you want to waste.</div></div><hr />

You can either choose to go all HP, (as a paladin) at the loss of Mana for a 220/100 or whatever HP bp, or you can go more balance for  a  160/160...<br />
<br />
While I dont if this is what they are trying to do, in effect they are trying to avoid a double &quot;penalty&quot; (Using the word loosely in balancing war/pal gear, if pal usable items were lets say 75% of a warrior item, and augments were the 50%  (40 vs 20/20) they are now, thats  nearly a 40% difference, but what they appear to be doing is having the baseline be hte same (100/100) but the end result be varying, with HP about 20% difference in items, if a pal went HP/MP augments and war went HP....<br />

The point isn't the &quot;massive damage&quot;, it's as follows:<br />
<br />
1. The warrior has historically been, and should remain having a significantly higher DPS than Paladins.<br />
<br />
2. The current &quot;worst case scenario&quot; using accepted 3rd party numbers (Ref:  &quot;Brodda Thepp&quot; in a testing sequence accepted even by the most insane rabid 'Paladins need a group advantage cause warriors tank on raids' types such as Drayron)<br />
<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=41073.topic<br />
<br />
Monk    684793  134.5  52.0   3.8      33%     51%      14%     1%      1.81       3.9 <br />
Pal     762397  111.9  49.1   3.6      34%     59%      6%      1%      1.74       0<br />

<br />
<br />
Shows that while tanking a mob which has  high rate of avoidance skills (most PoP mobs do) AND with a rather large Atk advantage and the Paladin had no Crit AA's, while the warrior did.  To quote Thepp:<br />
<br />
 In these tests both the paladin and the warrior have options to increase their dps other than a weapon. The paladin is missing quite a bit of atk which could be gained through items. He also has no crit AAs. With crit AAs and 100more raw atk you would see the DPS increased by a good 10%. <br />
<br />
So, understnading that with a favorable situation with Tactical mastery, there's approximately a 20% difference in DPS.    Taking Thepp's word for it, assuming that CF3/Atk would pump up the Paladin DPS another 10%, we're looking at a 10% melee offensive advantage.      Removing the avoidance compensation skill of Tactical mastery, the paladin makes ANOTHER leap to the warrior (a 5%ish difference).   Now we're at 5% difference between knight and warrior *using Thepp's numbers and conclusions* which are not necessarily biased toward warrior or knight in collection or conclusion (Thepp is a monk).<br />
<br />
So... we trudge off to good ol Mistmoore or Guk (or many Permafrost adventures) and what do we find... with SU giving a 20% increase in DPS (as noted by Romidar in the link provided), you have Paladins doing more melee damage than warriors in more than half of LDoN.   The aggro issue STILL stands, the defensive spread is STILL way too close (and I would argue that Paladins through the use of stuns are actually better at the damage prevention/mitigation equation on stunnable mobs than warriors), and now there's the new wrinkle of doing more DPS than warriors with equal weaponry.<br />
<br />
Madrone, incidentally, the warrior in Thepp's test had flurry3.   <br />
<br />
No, it's reality, NOT perception.   This is a serious class balance issue in that in ALL 3 areas of warrior 'expertise' (melee damage absorption/prevention, aggro generation, and melee damage output) warriors are BEHIND paladins.   What reason again besides &quot;an extra tank&quot; is there for warriors under these conditions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I forgot to mention...<br />
<br />
There is also the issue of warriors not attacking during enrage, which is ok, yet a Paladin can nuke during it, essentially causing consequence free damage.<br />
<br />
It's not a huge issue to me, although compiled with the rest, it's still an annoyance, since there's a good number of enraging mobs in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Thepp mentions that BOTH the Warrior and Paladin have ways to increase their DPS other than a weapon, but you only explore the ways a Paladin can increase DPS and then say that it closes the DPS gap.  What ways could the Warrior have increased DPS, and what effect would they have had.<br />
<br />
Also, I suspect the Paladin would have had at least CF1, as almost all Paladins seem to take that, then hold of on CF2 and 3 until they are getting Slay Undead.  Unless, of course, you are talking about PoP Crit AAs.<br />
<br />
Your argument is quite powerful anyway, but it strikes me that you are reducing the DPS gap a bit more than is credible.<br />

<br />
Frodlin, that my very well be the case, it will take some parses to bear that out, my point is that SU3 doesn't turn paladins into ungodly DPS machines, and it doesn't up thier DPS by the asserted 50%. It bumps up them to right around or slightly above warriors. This may be too much, given the pervasiveness of undead in LDoN. That's not the point. The point is that nobody is going to take warriors seriously if they run around representing things that are patently untrue about about knights. The arguments should be based upon verifiable facts. SU giving paladins 50%+ more DPS is demonstrably false, and does not bear up to examination, and it should not be used as an argument for class imbalance.<br />
<br />
You should know that I think that warriors need help. I don't think that misrepresenting the facts is the way to argue for it. There are plenty of real grievances, to manufacture false ones only serves to cast doubt upon the veracity of the true ones. I think that too many warriors at this point are so desperate that they are simply throwing anything they can at the wall to see if it sticks, and truth is optional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Boleslav,<br />
<br />
From Thepp's post:<br />
<br />
In this case the monk had all offensive AA except double riposte and return kick. The paladin had all offensive AAs except crits. The warrior was missing raging flurry 3 and tactical master 3 and all double riposte AAs.<br />
<br />
The DPS boost would've come from Tactical mastery 3 on mobs that have standard avoidance skills, but as has been seen in LDoN, mobs have incredibly weak avoidance, so the benefit would be fairly minimal.<br />
<br />
Where the warrrior would certainly pick things up would be in Double Riposte, the only other offensive AA the warrior didnt' have, but considering that the warrior riposted over 89 minutes, 4.2% of blows, and the 'double&quot; rate isn't impressively high, the amount of extra damage would be negligible.</div></div><hr />

We'll be glad to stop as soon as knights who cling to their current edge of power do the same.

Agreed.  While you may not be able to balance classes with gear, you can certainly unbalance them with gear.  Every additional item added the game that both a Warrior and Paladin can use that gives equal amounts of HP and Mana is clearly a greater improvement to the Paladin than the Warrior.  We've gone through what, 4 expansions now with this continuing trend?

This is ignorant to the point that it does not deserve a response, but here I go anyway.  Slay Undead 3 adds about 20% to a Paladin's DPS when fighting undead mobs.  Most Paladins do not even use the undead nukes because the ratio on them is so poor that the mana is better spent healing or stunning.<br />

I'll agree that I find the Wizard level DPS to probably be extremely overstated.  However, I think a case can be made that given some of the high end weapons for Knights in the game, which brings their DPS within spitting distance of a Warrior's, combined with SU3 and Holyforge, it's well within the realm of possiblity that some Paladins are doing better than Warrior damge on undead.   I haven't seen the numbers yet to establish this, but I believe it is likely.<br />

And I know that many people consider Paladins as being extremely effective against undead, to the point that they're seen as being preferred versus undead, even if their DPS is only matching a Warrior's.</div></div><hr />

If the DPs ratios for melee (80/100/120/140) were still true, then a 20 percent increase to paladin DPS would put them in warrior DPS range.  I'd say a SU3 paladin out DPSing a warrior on undead is practically certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Guk has a very high undead concentration, perhalps 80% of mobs are an undead of some type on almost all missions. Mismoore would be second, I'd say 50% of mobs are undead. Miragul's is more about 30% if that, still has an undead presence tho.</div></div><hr />

parses:<br />
i'll parse some when in LDoN to give some an idea of raw paladin undead dps<br />
<br />
SU3:<br />
it is dps vs undead, +~20%.  Meaning that a windblade 65 paladin with 100AAs and SU3 and 41% haste in PoV doing golems with vallons quickening will do bout 70dps (not tanking, dps drops like 40% if we have heavy agro group and have to constantly get mobs off casters), and will do about 90dps in HoH crypts or CoD undeads (not tanking)... as far as *not tanking*, not sure how much dps you lose every time your stunned and spin around and lose swings while doing so (no un-stunnable PAL class).  Thus when im XPing and make my own group I have a WAR or SK tanking.  Slay Undead is completely unpredictable, you can 3 slays in a fight in HoH, and ive went a whole day without a slay, and i can think of 2 instances where Holyforge got me no slays.  But on average, i would say 1 per fight, a fight in HoH.  Put this in LDoN mobs hps and youd be lucky to get one in a fight.  A 40delay weapon (average 65 PAL weapon) against mobs that die in 30sec + a 2% chance to slay means low chance to slay in LDoN.<br />
<br />
While it has a ~20% dps increase, it does not mean we go over warrior dps.  Ive been through a few undead raids / xp groups where there are always a couple warriors that out dps me...</div></div><hr />

Flame of Light - 125dd<br />
Deny Undead - 651dd (3.2second 250mana cast undead only)<br />
Pious Might - 150dd weapon proc<br />
Ward of Nife - 300dd vs undead only weapon proc<br />
<br />
Paladins best nuke is 125dd, just curious where you got 781?...  Versus undead we got 651 not 781 (waste of mana/buff slot, our normal dps is better than casting this).  I take it the 360 is from a weapon proccing Knights Blessing (180hp heal)<br />
<br />
*critting every few swings*, combat fury 3 allows knights to critical hit 7% of the time, far from every couple.  We slay undead 2% of all our hits vs undead.  &quot;nukewise&quot; with max AAs (Spell Casting Fury 3 = 12AAs), 7% of our procs/dds are crits.  Healing wise, with max AAs 16% of our heals are crits Healing Gift 6 = 21AAs).  Best eye candy ive seen = berserk warrior.</div></div><hr />
