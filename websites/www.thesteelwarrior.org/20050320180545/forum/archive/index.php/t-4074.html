<br />
Remember SoE's huge block with Avatar of Smoke not respawning until the server crashes or patch?<br />
<br />
Now look what they have done.<br />
<br />
Consider this:<br />
<br />
All the bees cleared on the bee island, to spawn some red con bees to eventually spawn that Clawpike guy to spawn Avater of Wind.<br />
<br />
Well guess what?<br />
<br />
The stormriders that spawn kill/attack their own. Other NPCs seem to attack and kill Clawpike, low and behold, Avatar of Wind spawns and then poofs from track cause some NPCs killed it too apparently.<br />
<br />
So basically, not only SoE have &quot;fixed&quot; AoSmoke from spawning, they practically blocked everyone who wants to try to get their Xegony key.<br />
<br />
How smart can they get? They always broke bards at one time. They always messed up when it came to expensions. When will it ever stop !!!<br />
<br />
Aaaaaaaargh !!!!<br />
<br />
/cough /cough<br />
<br />
Thank you, I feel better now.<br />
<br />
I think I can actually understand why Furor is so mad at them. They are just so poor at trying to make this game enjoyable for us. Is there actually anything we can do as players?<br />
<br />
Technically, we feed them with our money and this is how they treat us back?<br />
<br />
Anyway, how are you experiancing with this lame bug? I heard PoEarth rings are doing the same also.<br />
<br />
Share your frustrations !!!!</div></div><hr />
