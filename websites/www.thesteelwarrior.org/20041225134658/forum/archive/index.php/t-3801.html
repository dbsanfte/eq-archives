I learned that you have to have your feet firmly planted to get a spell off.  Cant be moving at all.  I was wondering...<br />
<br />
Do you think this applies to Taunt also?  Do you have to have your feet firmly planted to successfully get a taunt off?  <br />
<br />
I always had trouble getting aggro when I ran up on a mob and taunted.  Now I make sure I'm not moving before I taunt and it seems to work better.  I have not done any real in-depth testing of this, so I'm not positive.<br />
<br />
Anyone know for sure?<br />

The two aren't always in sync tho, and the client does some prediction to smooth things out.  It's entirely possible that you are getting taunt fails simply because you (or the mob) aren't quite where they appear to be on your screen...<br />

Anyone else get this feeling?</div></div><hr />
