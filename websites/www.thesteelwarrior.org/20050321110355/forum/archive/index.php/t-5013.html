About a year ago a friend turned me on to screen skins. I experimented with a few and at the time, the skins were getting a lot of bad rap about being tough to manage and upkeep. I would like to possibly try to find one again for me. Anyone have any suggestions on where I can go to find the skins and which ones seem to work the best? I am very ignorant when it comes to loading and selecting the skins. Any imput would be very much aprreciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />

They have quite a large database and you can even mix and match skin parts to your liking and the Message boards there have a lot of walkthroughs on how to install them and whatnot.</div></div><hr />
