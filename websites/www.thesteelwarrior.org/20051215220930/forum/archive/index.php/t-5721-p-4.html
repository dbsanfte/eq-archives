<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, are named on the same timer as the regular mobs?  In other words, can you possibly get 2 named in a row, making it worthwhile if other named aren't up to just double back and reclear rooms even if you just killed a named there?  <br />
<br />
That's what we're assuming, which means ferubi can comfortably support several groups and small raids hunting the named.  <br />
<br />
Also, do they have a specific spawn point in the rooms shown or should you be sure to clear everything in the room?  We've run through rooms 1-4 a number of times.  We've gotten the elite in room 1 several times.  We never see a named in room 2.  We never see a named in room 4.  hmm...<br />
<br />
I'm in a pre-elem guild and lately I've been running the occasional small raid to Ferubi as sort of a &quot;welcome to GoD&quot; thing for people.  It's a good experience to get everyone crawling through an area where everything, including roamers, can be so deadly and once in awhile a good drop is had.  People learn to stay on their toes.  Guildies dying random &quot;probably wasn't paying enough attention&quot; deaths are down 68% since the first time I ran it.  Ok, I made that number up.  But they're down a lot.  :)  Good zone.</div></div><hr />

Also saw a series of nice trash mob drops that you don't have listed, but a few look close, my guess is they upgraded them and renamed them.</div></div><hr />
