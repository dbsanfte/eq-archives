<br />
Over the past couple years I've grown bored, regained interest, and grew bored again with EQ (during SoL and PoP mostly).<br />
<br />
Now, with LDoN (and some PoP) I'm having fun in EQ again.  I came back last week, did my later half of 55 (the level I had been at for at least a year and a half) and since Saturday night have done a little more than 4 yellows (planning on finishing off the last tonight or tomorrow night) in 56.  My goals are set on 58 for next week and 60 by December.  The last time I raided was when Dain Frostweaver was hard and Warlord's was uber.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I recently bought an Elite Steelslave Stone Blade (I think that's what it is, 13/20 with some stats) for my mainhand and am using my Frostbringer in the off hand.  I'm having some trouble keeping agro off of melees and casters with this combo, what do you recommend?<br />
<br />
I'm using a FBSS as haste, is there any better haste that's easy to obtain?<br />
<br />
Second, when I do obtain agro...I can't really take a beating<br />
<br />
javascript:view_profile(787267); (magelo)<br />
<br />
What do you suggest I do?  I plan on leveling, at least until 60 (then either 65 or AA, has yet to be decided).</div></div><hr />

These normally go for under 1k on emarr these days (although I paid 38k for it just before the price dropped :mad: )<br />
<br />
I generally don't have a problem holding agro in xp groups with the GSoT.  Of course, sometimes you have to teach casters to adjust since we don't have snap agro like knights do - but that's an issue regardless of weapons since warriors rely so much on procs for agro.<br />
<br />
Based on some posts I've seen here I think the Soulscream belt is an obtainable haste upgrade for you...but I already have CoCW so I haven't really investigated the belt.  By the way, if you can save 20 or 30k, the CoCW has dropped in price significantly and has 36% haste.  Another haste option is ldon.  I can't remember the camp, but I think one of them has a 36% haste item you can buy for about 1150 points.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like I'll be spending more time at the Mistmoore camp than expected.  Already up to 180 points there, by the time I get to 60 I should have enough for it I guess.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys - and I bought a GSoT for 250pp, but my 2hb is at about 30 (I was lazy, had the character for almost 3 years now and still haven't maxed anything but 1hb, 1hs and almost piercing  :confused: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd look into the soulscream belt if I were you.  It is by far the easiest to obtain of the 30%+ haste items.  At 55 with a slower, cleric, and some more DPS you should be able to camp the room where it drops effectively.  I got mine there after camping for about 3 hours, been back numerous times to help guildies with obtaining one and its never taken more then 4 or 5 hours to see one drop.  That sure beats the hell out of 75 hours at MM to be able to afford the haste augment AND then the item you would need to augment it on.  For a few hours of trouble the soulscream belt would last you easily until you're past 60 or until you have the chance to upgrade it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep - Soulscream belt is awesome.  Definitely make an effort to pick one up.  There's a belt in Droga that is comparable, but I think the Soulscream belt is a little easier to get.<br />
<br />
But speaking of Droga, you might be interested in getting the Copper Hammer of Striking or the Sword of the Bloodsworn.  I switched my Frostbringer to a CHoS and the agro difference was considerable. <br />
<br />
-Edit- Noticed your Primary is lacking a proc.  Since agro is an issue, I'd highly recommend a proc'ing weapon in both your primary and secondary if you stay with a dual-wield setup (though your GSoT may fix this for you).<br />
<br />
As for armor, I see a few spots that could stand some improvement.  Fierce Heraldric armor will upgrade many of your spots once you can afford it (noticed you were RZ).  If you find a couple of cheap FH bracers, it'll be a big improvement over your current bracers (your weakest spot in my opinion).  <br />
<br />
Next, I'd look at a better back armor.  FH cloaks are rare as heck on my server.  My 55 warrior is using a Crinose Cape of the Werewolf - very nice for the HP, and seems to be extremely affordable in the bazaar (depending on server of course).  <br />
<br />
Might want to take a look at some new legs too.  I purchased some Steel Wrapped Leggings for a very reasonable price, and they are a nice intermediate set.<br />
<br />
Feel free to check out my magelo for some other possible ideas - though most of my stuff is FH now.</div></div><hr />
