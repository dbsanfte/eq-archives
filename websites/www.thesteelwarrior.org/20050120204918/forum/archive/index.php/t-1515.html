Some of what he said does make sense, but was also a bit silly, thought i'd see what peoepl around here thought?<br />
<br />
afaik, i myself have never known of a guilds MT that was an ogre /shrug<br />
<br />
I will be MT in my guild and am iksar, I feel confident i will do fine when the time comes, but to each their own i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think by the time they had a full time MT that was an ogre ( he played 24/7/365 and his brother ( ub3r_shammy ) PL'ed the living hell out of him ) they were just about through with ToVN.<br />
<br />
i guess having an ogga MT makes things easiest with the non stunnability idea plus they'd be the first char's that could max stats before getting to the really uber type gear.<br />

/shrug.</div></div><hr />

But, I would change to a RZ halfling or something, rather then a dwarf again.</div></div><hr />

Im at the point now where my stats are capping with raid buffs and its made me really happy to be a half elf.  Sure when I was level 55 in cobalt and a treeweave I used to drool over ogre stamina and almost rerolled at one point, but if I was an ogre I'd now have no stat advantage, an XP penalty and like every ogre and troll in my guild my nick name would be fat ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
pretty much that was why i chose a wood elf; nice RP options.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason why I would go assling, or something (read gnome)... is that I can't really play large races for a while (think the highest I ever got one was 16 hehe), and because dwarves can't warship RZ- which would (and still will) have made my warrior's career so much easier.<br />
<br />
/shrug Gnomes would be fun too :)</div></div><hr />

When I join my guild way back before Kunark, our tank line up consisted of nothing but ogres and trolls, with one half-elf and me.  I think if you're concentrated at all in the end-game eventually, race doesn't matter.  I do have to say that I think halfling is an excellent race to start with, on par with advantages that ogres/trolls/iksar have, that scales all the way to 65 - levels up fast, good faction most everywhere initially, small size to fit everywhere, and sneak/hide are extremely handy to have...I never have to worry about finding a merchant I can sell to, and it's nice to have for exploring.</div></div><hr />

The bottom line is that chicks dig fatties. Hence ogres, with all that raw sexual charisma, are the master race. QED</div></div><hr />
