<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Future Plans for October\November, 2003<br />
Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game.  Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are.  Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time.<br />
Development on the following projects continues.  We appreciate your patience as we work out the details.<br />
Class Balance<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
Shields and blocking<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.  We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.  We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.<br />

Under Review 01/27/2003<br />
- We're reviewing the tanking ability of the various melee and hybrid classes to be sure each class is competitively balanced with the others. The main factors we're considering are the ability to take damage, deal damage, and the additional abilities of each class. The goal with this review is to find any issues where melee classes are not &quot;bringing enough to the party&quot; when comparing their package of abilities. We're paying particular attention to the avoidance-focused classes such as the monk, to be sure things end up where they should. <br />
- Shields and blocking. We're reviewing the impact of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We'd like increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We're working on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ever hear of the analogy of the carrot and the horse?  You know, where you have the carrot hanging from a pole that you hold out over the back of the horse to out in front of its face just out of reach?  The horse, seeing the carrot takes a step towards it.  Since you're riding on the wagon the horse is pulling, you and your pole go a step forward as well, keeping the carrot just out of reach of the horse.  Another step, then another, and so on.<br />

Ever have days you think someone is treating you like a horse?</div></div><hr />

Aslo, looking for more info. A link to the introduction of diciplines, /shield, and Enraging Blow items would be sweet. And maybe SOE's explaination on what the heck Furious Bash is supposed to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AvatarofWar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why do i get owned by a Main Tank Shadow Knight or Paladin ? Is it me playing cr@ppy or is it SOE gave them complete control over mobs. HMM, i hit attack button and its still flashing. My kick is being mashed repeatedly and so is taunt and disarm. Nope they still own me. Paladin holds aggro when the shaman casts Slow or a CH is cast or a Big nuke and any other caster spells. Shadow, well he just snares and taps more often if needed. Me, oh i just stand there , &quot; your target is out of range&quot;. Oh no, turn around . Paladin , cast stun or root. Shadow cast snare or lifetap. Me turning , oh there he is over there, no wait hes moved to someone else , oh wait hes moved again. Im never gonna regain aggro. Too bad theres not a pally or SK around to save everyone, obviously my ability to own is based off my lousy gear and I have been found wanting. You wait here and I&quot;ll pull, we don't want some non-aggro holding multi-mob pulling war doing a real tanks job. Oh and your meager weapons, the SK and Pally have the same, only they can keep the mob in front of them while using it. BaH, /q</div></div><hr />
