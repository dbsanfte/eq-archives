he's basically the stereotypical bnet kiddie we all feared to see in WoW. he's not mean, I'll give him that. if he wants warrior inf0z he can still read the board. if he wants to participate in discussion he can do it elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Fuck, I finally had to put someone on aggressive ignore..where he's on ignore in the panel and I refused to even look at any threads that he's posted in ever.<br />

Do the administrators do that?  Seeing that just made me jealous, being an 11A in the 101st.  Got my PL time in Iraq, sadly when we go back I will be in the S3 shop. :(</div></div><hr />

Mods hooked it up for me.  You O2?<br />
<br />
I transitioned to the USAF as SF awhile back but I got my start with 3/325 and 1/508 ABCT.  Hehee...had enough getting shot at huh?  Hehee.  I got kind of numb to it after a bit.  Somalia was bad same with Haiti.  Iraq was same shit different day.  Its ok, you got that CIB its all good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-18-2005, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get used to the gunfire.  You here it so much that you get to the point that you do not even want to report it anymore.  I have my moments I will not forget, some hilarious, some pretty serious.  <br />
<br />
I am an O3 now, was just promted recently.  I was an infantry line PL when the 101st crossed the border into Iraq the first time.  About half way through, I was trensferred to be an anit-armor PL with 4 gun trucks and couple cargos.  The funny was I never learned a thing about anti-armor while over there, because at that point our missions were different due to our mobility.  Its a great experience I will never forget.  I would be lieing if I said i was thrilled about going back, as I would have been out of the Army in October, but I can at least hope I can bring my experience with me to the S3 shop and help my battalion out over there.  I admit I will hate not being the man on the ground, but such is life.<br />
<br />
edit: oh and I am in 1/502d IN regt &quot;First Strke&quot;, the &quot;The Black Hearts of Death&quot; as the local in Karbala called our regiment.</div></div><hr />

we're running outta things to bitch about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not sure you actually &quot;get used to the gunfire&quot; but you definately get to where its of minimal concern.  Unless rounds are kicking up dirt around me/mine I concentrate on putting steel on target.  I reached a plateau where I was numb to the violence/gunfire/fear/craziness...you do what you have to and move on to the next engagement.<br />
<br />
/shrug   <br />
<br />
Biggest thing...dont forget the troops going through the hell on the ground while youre safe in the rear.  You know the kind of guys I mean.  You avoid that pit-fall and you'll be fine.  Grats on Capt.  GL, and watch your ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  11A...hehee, looks good.</div></div><hr />
