I've used eq-companion before, and seem to have problems with logs remaining when opening a new logfile, so I really wasn't happy with it at all. Just wondering if companion is the program to use and I was doing something wrong, or if there's a better program that people are using and have less problems with.</div></div><hr />

The person who makes it visits this site and may be able to help with your problem, or might have somewhere on his site to help.<br />
Another good parser is Yalp, but I don't know the website =\</div></div><hr />

Yalp  seems to work flawlessly every time.  Its a little less user friendly though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello, Doobi. I'm the author of EQ Companion.<br />
<br />
I did not quite understand what kind of problem you had with logs remaining open. Could you give some more details for the problem. Maybe it's just a question of using EQ Companion differently.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Yalp is an awesome parser as well. You should definitely give it a try if EQ Companion does not work for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem I'm having. deals with previously loaded logs. Meaning... If i upload eqlog_doobi_42 and review his parse, everything is just fine. everything's in it's proper area of EQ_companion etc. But the log stays in the parser when I select another log to view. Meaning if I try to load eqlog_soandso_42, I get a culmenation of the two files.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
Tried to re-download eq_companion. When starting it, I get the message &quot;msflxgrd.ocx or one of its dependencies not correctly registered&quot;, Shouldn't be this hard, maybe it's too early in the morning for me to be messing with this :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When downloading EQ_Companion, download the installer first and install that, then download the executable and overwrite the executable that you have now. The installer places the correct registry entries which will clear up the second problem<br />
<br />
As to the first problem. It doesn't take long to load the program... just close it and reopen it... I don't think it was written to remove the first log before opening the new one. This may be so that you can rename an older log of a character and then open that one WITH your current one to get the whole shebang. The creator could tell you more about that, I am sure.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Spelling &gt; Me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ Companion</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Donnel is correct, EQ Companion purposely leaves the old fights in when you open a new log file. The reason for this is that you can open multiple log files and use the 'combine fights' feature to combine many fights agains the same mob to get more accurate average DPS readings.<br />
<br />
I have, however, added a new menu option to the upcoming 0.8 version which clears all the fights if you want to start from scratch so you do not have to quit and restart the program. 0.8 is not released yet, though...<br />
<br />
I'm curious, though. Why would you want to clear the old fights? Is it because you are looking at the stats in the 'Stats' page and when you open multiple log files, the stats are all messed up? If this is the reason, you really should not bother with those stats. To get better stats, just select all the fights and combine them. You will get a lot more accurate stats that way. Even better yet, combine fights that are against comparable mobs to get even more accurate stats.<br />
<br />
Donnel is correct on the other problem as well (thanks!). If you run the installer program, it will install all the required Visual Basic componentd, like this MS Flex Grid control that it was complaining about. The installer installs an older version (0.6), so you should download the ~200kb ZIP file for 0.71 as well and extract that on top of the one the installer installed executable and you should be good to go with the latest version.</div></div><hr />

Won't get a chance to test it out till tonight, so crossing my fingers till then. The 8.0 version sounds great as well, looking forward to that getting completed!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help ;)</div></div><hr />
