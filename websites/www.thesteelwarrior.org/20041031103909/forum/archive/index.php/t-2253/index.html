Interesting weapon, looks like one that would be fun to play with.  Possible that the proc is good aggro, would have to be tested (some poisons give a lot, some give little, no way of knowing with testing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For 12k I couldn't pass it up, gonna go test it out, will post results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">bookmark http://lucy.fnord.net/ too :D it's rather handy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just played around with it for an hour 2boxing with my shammy and I can say confidently Great Sword of the Bloodsworn &gt;&gt; Sword of the Bloodsworn and Anklesmasher, my current aggro combo.<br />
The snap aggro like all 2handers is much better than duel wielding so I can slow immediately with shammy and grab aggro with 1 taunt, and with an early proc can cast Bane of Nife (1600dmg dot) with shammy and still maintain aggro if he's out of melee range.  If he's in melee range he would grab aggro 1/2 the time but 1-2 taunts took aggro back np.<br />
Still have to try it out in a full group but I'm very impressed so far :)  <br />
Only downside is the proc being a dot, although short duration (5 ticks) dot's can wreak havoc when you have a chanter mezzing.<br />
The upside to this over Sword of the Bloodsworn, or any stun proccer, is the dot proc on this doesn't break root.<br />
As for the sword graphic, it looks like a Silver Swiftblade with runes down the middle of the blade.. or a very wide Velium Claidmore, not too bad imo.  The proc however has no graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats<br />
Althought one question why not get a Windblade or GSoT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had a Windblade for awhile now and aggro with it is pretty shaky, lot's of ping-ponging and when I hit /def it just plain sucks due to lack of a proc.  I'll definately hold onto it as my DPS weapon and for when I 2box (my shammy seems to maintain his aggro just fine, go figure ;) )<br />
As far as GSoT, they're down to about 2k on Vaz, but my 2hb skill is awful, and the GSoT well... looks awful ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">GSoT may look awful, but damn, it owns that sword easy... on all levels but looks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cily, you've used both GSoT and GSotBS?  Or just assuming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I love Lucy.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sloanbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Where did this come from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got a GSoT the other day, used it for the first time last night.  You are right, it does look sort of lame, but with stats and aggro production like that, it could look like a giant pink willy and I'd still wield it.  :p<br />
Has anyone actually compared the aggro on this new blade to a GSoT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am assuming.<br />
<br />
Tho, lets see... better ratio on GSoT (more damage, less delay... cant argue there)<br />
<br />
A stun proc on GSoT .. one of the best agro producers in the game today.<br />
<br />
No DoT on GSoT for those oh so lovely times DoTs can be the suck.<br />
<br />
I cannot say wether or not the 9 poison counters is great agro or not, but I am willing to be educated. It is still a DoT tho, and if I can avoid DoTs, I will.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, every time my GSoT interupts a gate or CH it is quite satisfying.<br />
<br />
So, in after thought I will retract the &quot;owns&quot; part. But I am still convinced it beats it, and it is dirt cheap.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its 1hs cousin is even better<br />
Fast Weapon,great stats<br />
<br />
Proc is a 75dd + Stun<br />
<br />
Both drop in the revamped droga/or nurga,cant remember which.Not gonna list stats,its on my Magelo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Largic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Both drop off Earth Seer Gamolk in Droga</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have the 1hs version too but PoP ripostes hurt, and from my limited experiance with the 2hs version the proc on it is more aggro than the 1hs, plus a big hit gets immediate aggro on a pull much more often than duel wield.<br />
I'll have to try a GSoT one of these days to compare, just hate the thought of training 2hb.  The proc looks the same as the 1hs sword though, both 0 second stuns so wouldn't the procs be the same amount of aggro?</div></div><hr />
