<br />
I would greatly appreciate it if you would explain to me the logic behind how you guys added endurance to excisting items.<br />
<br />
I get the impression that pure melee items  have been ignored in this process. Items such as Blade of Carnage, Bloodfrenzy, Helmet of Ralloz zek, to name a few,  have absolutely no endurance on it.  If you would be so kind as to explain to us why that is, or make it known to us if it is planned to add endurance to those items and more pure melee items that lack it.<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that endurance to a pure meele as mana is to a hybrid and I dont see many higher end hybrid only items out there without mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not a dev, but my guess is the response would make reference to the vast number of items in the game and the fact that nobody's complaining that if only they had a little more endurance they'd be happy, so they spend their time dealing with more important issues.</div></div><hr />

I also remember a lot of legitmate complaints that +HP/+Mana items benifitted hybrid classes more than their melee counterparts.  When the simple *if HP and Mana both present, add Endurance equal to Mana* patching was done, I took that to be a quick, simple (and effective) redress of that.  Write a short script for the database, let it run, and yer done - and the filtered items could still be tweaked afterwards if need be.  Items that didn't have a pre-existing HP/Mana statistic combo would need a more specific (and item by item) examination, as there is no ready rule of thumb that could be applied.  It may never happen.<br />
<br />
Tho it'll be good to see Endurance on Melee items similar to seeing Mana on caster items, I agree with Qest that it's not likely to be top of the priority list atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep in mind that there are hundreds of thousands of items in the EQ database. They are not going in and adding END to items manually 1 item at a time. They are running some sort of query on the DB and having some script decide what gets END. Now they are tuning up the items as people give /feedback.</div></div><hr />

However, adding +END to these items still does not equal the power increase of mana on the higher end items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Consider this a feedback then....since it seems not to work in game.<br />
<br />
I hardly think I am the only one who has done a feedback and bugreport on that endurance is not present on higher end warrior only items and other class specific pure melee items.  <br />
<br />
I would be happy if a developer gave me an answer on if they plan to update the endurance system to suit the needs of the classes that rely on it or not.<br />
<br />
It would at least be a start.<br />
<br />
This change should be based on balance, not conveinience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The list of items you posted are all items that are slight upgrades for me.  I am not Sol Ro flagged.  People like you and me do rarely run out of endurance.  It's really only a problem if a Time+ warrior was having the same problem a lot.<br />
<br />
If nobody ever ran out of endurance, why have the bar at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I´m out of endurance all the time, it really depends on how you use your discs, righto?<br />
<br />
/incite followed by /furious followed by /mightystrike or /fellstike plus a couple of incites while dps disc is active leaves me crap endurance to spare and if pulls are chained and a lot of work in camp I´m out of endurance soon.  And I dont like sitting down medding.<br />
<br />
I have actually run out of endurance while just inciting when i think about it.<br />
<br />
Oh well bottom line is endurance SHOULD be on pure all pure melee items, no ifs buts or crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In the case of HoRZ and Bloodfrenzy maybe its because these items are already somewhat overpowered for what it takes to get them.<br />
<br />
- Bloodfrenzy, best warrior one hander until time, and still a very nice offhander to pair with DBotW.  Obtainable with 2-3 groups off a mob that requires no keys to get to.<br />
<br />
- HoRZ, 55AC a Velious loot with only 1 compareable helm pre Elementals (Helmet of shadow - 5 less AC for 25hps) and tradeable with no recommended level.<br />
<br />
- BoC is absolutely godly for Velious aswell with no comparable weapons until Ssra and the previously mentioned also over powered weapon.<br />
<br />
Endurance has been added to some warrior only items - Puresteel mantle for example had endurance added since the 1st lots of endurance got patched in.  Either its an item they will add endurance on when they get the feedback or they have had feedback and considered these items powerful enough without it.<br />
<br />
Admittedly I have a good pool of endurance to call on, but on Xeg a couple of nights back I tanked for a good 50mins using evasive every time it was up and fired off incite about 10 times and had enough endurance left to fire off furious then fellstrike at the end to finish it.  The only times endurance pool has ever been a limiting factor for me is when soloing and using Healing will + discs as often as available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I've read, sitting and standing END regen is the same.  The only thing that affects END regen is whether you are fighting (and, perhaps, whether you are running).<br />
<br />
That's what I've read, I haven't tested it personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well Bloodfrenzy drop rate is absurd for one and you actually have to use your head in that fight.<br />
Great helm of true visions drops off a way easier mob then HoRZ and is almost as good.<br />
BoC is far from overpowered concidering the kill, can you say Enride Icestorm?  GBoS?  That mob has been done by someone 4 boxing or something like that, even less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mooot point imo.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't thinking that it did, just that the *first* place a dev might have looked to add Endurance on items would be the ones we complained loudest about - the *knightemization* family of +HP/+Mana items.  It's how I saw the quickest fix that was almost *braind dead* and maintained the balance of the affected items.   I still hold that it was effective, even tho it may not have been perfect.<br />
<br />
For my gameplay, the +Mana and +Endurance benefits are pretty close tho.  +Mana is a boon, but to the house druid it's Mana conservation and regeneration waaay before more +Mana.  Being able to chain a lot of spells together is a good thing, but once you've burned off 1000 outta 6000 Mana points, you're just a 5000 point *can cast a spell* class.  And yer gonna haveta med longer to get FM again.<br />
<br />
Chaining discs is not an *every pull* moment, but the longer the chain you can pull off at a burst, the more powerful a moment there is.  I've made bad pulls into good pulls with a little luck and some /disc chains, and that doesn't come around so frequently that I am constantly OOE or near to it.<br />
<br />
+100 Mana may be more effectively powerful than +100 Endurance, but to my thinking the balance is near enough that I'm satisfied.  But I still think they did it that way cuz they were pretty sure that if sump'n had +90HP and +60Mana, then +60Endurance was a pretty safe bet - and that process could be automated and out the door quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In the last patch, END was added on some Meele only items (no mana), just check the Range quested items from PoHate.<br />
<br />
But also, adding MANA to the Fabled Exe Axe to use a cheap script to add END (That's my guess) was kinda lazy :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had thought they were eventually going to get around to adding endurance to pure melee (especially war only) type gear as they got around to it.... eventually.<br />

<br />
With the shear number of items to put endurance on they are doing a systematic approach to it for the time being. I'm sure that more items will start seeing it after the dust settles and they have had sufficient testing and feedback.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should look into a less ... unique ... way of using your combat abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/shrug..<br />
<br />
When I exp I like to make use of all the added dps my discs can povide and usually pop em as soon as the pop unless there is a hard mob inc soon, named or etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats the way i do it, I'm not telling you how to use your discs so I would appreciate it if you showed me the same respect.</div></div><hr />
