<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You know, I really love my job. I get to sit here all day long, read these message boards and think about EQ and the problems with the game. Sitting and thinking about the game and how it works gives a much clearer perspective than when we are playing and all the frustrations that we fight with...<br />
<br />
First off, let me discuss Aggro, one subject near and dear to every warrior...<br />
<br />
Aggro - Aggro was a great idea, it is a wonderful tool for the computer AI to use to determine its tactics. Unfortunately, the AI's and the use of Aggro in the equation have been implemented poorly. This has led to the MT- CH rotation tactic. Just about every class in EQ has outstanding Aggro-generating and disipating abilities. EXCEPT for ONE, the warrior. Warriors have the poorest Aggro Generation, and NO Dissipation ability at all. <br />
<br />
Look at all other class, Stuns, Snares, Slows, Roots, Mezs, Pacifies, Harmonies, Gate, Evac, SoW, Escape, Jolt, Pets, Concussion, and I am sure I have missed a few... All these are excellent ways to either completely lose aggro or mitigate its effects... The only ability Warriors get is Taunt, and melee/ranged attack. Mostly warriors do not want to lose aggro, so having just an aggro generation ability would be fine. However, other classes have Taunt, and as we all know Taunt is a horrid skill.<br />
<br />
What is so bad about Taunt you Ask? <br />
<br />
Well first off the failure rate is horrible. The failure when taunting a GREEN mob has been determined to be AT LEAST 40%. This has been parsed much and great logs have been taken of this. This means that a TRIVIAL skill check is 50% failure, so for RED mobs how great is the difference? It has been estimated it fails close to 60% on red mobs or higher. Again this is all estimation, why is that? Because not only is taunt unreliable, there is NO CONFIRMATION at all that Taunt works or doesnt work. Taunt Confirmation to many is a huge point. I would like to know when Taunt fails and when it succeeds, it allows me to perform better and react faster. <br />
<br />
So Taunt fails a lot and there is no indication, seems bad enough... then you look at a few more quirks of the skill. First, what happens when you try to cast a spell on a target out of range? Why well it says out of range, and thats it... you can keep trying and trying.. no worry, no delay. Now TAUNT and mobs out of range? Well you just lost any skill use for 6 seconds. You must now wait for that skill to reset. Spells all get inst-refresh on range and also faster refresh on fizzles.. Taunt gets no such consideration. There are spells and abilities that decrease the casting times and such of spells, taunt gets no such ability. Taunt refreshes at 6 seconds at level 1 and refreshes at 6 seconds at level 65, no matter your skill level, nor your level. It never gets better. <br />
<br />
So how far away do you have to be to taunt a mob? Well it is definately closer than max melee range. I have been in melee, swinging weapons hitting the mob, and I have been too far away to taunt the mob. No other skill/ability/spell requires this type of closeness to work.<br />
<br />
So whats wrong with taunt? Poor Failure rate, No Confirmation rate, Unchanging refresh timer, extreme short range. Fixing this would lead to a huge improvement, for starters.<br />
<br />
So taunt is broken for warriors, how bad can the rest be?<br />
<br />
Spell aggro is also messed up. Resisted Spells generate as much if not more aggro than a spell that lands for full. Spells Mobs are immune to, also generate enormous aggro. If a mob is immune, there is no reason for it to generate HUGE aggro. It makes no good sense. Have it generate as much aggro as a poke for 1 damage. No more is needed. The current situation is silly. If a mob resists a spell, make the aggro HALF of normal. There is no need for the crazy extra aggro on resisted spells.<br />
<br />
So now we have looked at the AGGRO...<br />
<br />
What else is there concerning class balance?<br />
<br />
Correct aggro and there may not need to be done much about most class balance. It wouldnt make everyone happy but could make the situation a lot more tolerable.<br />
<br />
Beyond Aggro, there are four general areas to look at.<br />
<br />
Survivability - AC, HP's<br />
Damage Dealt - melee, ranged, dd spells, dots<br />
Buffing abilty - hps. ac. stats<br />
Utility - haste, sow, gating, resurection<br />
<br />
What needs to be done is a comprehensive overview of each of the 5 areas and balance them out to some extent. Since most of our discusions deal with Knights... Lets just look at them and warriors in comparison..<br />
<br />
Lets arange classes in order from 0-15 <br />
0 being no ability 15 being the best...<br />
<br />
here is my short list... Rank ever class by these 5 categories and see what you get.<br />
<br />
