<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No way, 15hps does not equal the 7AC lost. Dodge modifier won't even be noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go with Cloak of Combustion.  7ac for 15hp might not be the best trade, but the dodge mod can't hurt and it has a ton more resists.  However, if you already have one or the other, not worth switching if you have to pay points for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait till you're in time and get FCG or really wait and get quarm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not worth it. Dodge mods have been shown to have a pretty small impact, and if you already have the cloak of icy shadows just keep it. I know I use it for a second buff slot clicky to avoid dispells, as well as the extra ds/cha. I'll take all of that over 5% dodge and 15hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i finally went and got the loyalist sheild of honor , it may havr low hp in cmparison but its 50 ac very useful and can be auged</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What is small ? smaller that 7 AC ? 5% dodge might be a small mitigation increase, but 7 AC is not what I would call a big upgrade either. In fact are there any parses around of dodge / riposte / parry mod somewhere ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the cloak of icy shadows and certainly wouldnt loot the cloak of combustion as an upgrade, especially not if you've already spent LDoN points augmenting it.<br />
<br />
If you have neither and are trying to choose between them then maybe the dodge modifier would sway you, but personally I'd rather take the Icy Shadows cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I saw a parse of 8 % dodge producing around 1 or 2 percent more dodges.<br />
<br />
The 7 AC (more like 8 or 9 when AGI included unless you are max AGI) is much more important than the 15 HP.  Every tradeoff you make for hp adds up.  If you have several items and can trade them in and out as you upgrade, your goal is to have the max AC you can get in blocks of 50 AC.  So if you are sitting at 1699 with max AC gear, trade out several items to remain 1650 or higher.  But I personally don't want to always be checking my AC every time I upgrade, so I go for the best AC and HP I can get on my gear.  Standard rule most people follow: 1 raw AC = 5 raw HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks to me like it's 17 lost AC not 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was thinking the same Retna.  17 AC isn't small.  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm guessing he's gonna put an AC aug in it, which is why he says 7 AC.  <br />
<br />
Personally I would never spend DKP on an upgrade that is so small you have to ask on the boards if it is actually a better item.  Save em up and get something that is a real upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Keep the icy shadows. Give the combustion cloak to a druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">there are cloaks all over the planes for some reason - one in air, 2 in fire, 3 in earth. he can prob take it pretty soon, but its a wash as to whats better, i wouldnt even bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pahtoonya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The upgrade is more a lateral uprgade than a real 'upgrade' as it were.  I'd leave it to someone who could use the caster type effect on it, personally. The Icy will hold you over just fine I'd say up until you're ready to snag an FCG or better in Time. -_~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wait til Time. I think every mob has at least 1 cloak drop.</div></div><hr />

CHA got nerfed a patch or two ago...  And I'm glad I wasn't the only person who noticed it, everyone thoguht i was crazy 'cuz it wasn't in lucy it couldn't possibly exist!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah... It made me cry when I just found out. Why remove the cha? It just didn't really matter, but made me happy.</div></div><hr />
