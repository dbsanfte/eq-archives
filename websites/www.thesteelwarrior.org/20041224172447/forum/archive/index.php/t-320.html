<br />
I remember reading a post a while back of a warrior who soloed a dragon in WW (i think).  Did a search but I couldn't remember enough details to find it.  What i do remember is that he, for obvious reasons, managed to kill the dragon by using a wide varity of procs.  <br />
<br />
So what I am asking now is what do you guys think is needed for a warrior to solo in PoP.  Obviously not named Giants in PoS but something average lvl 60+ warriors, who can't get into PoV exp groups because they aren't 64+ knights, can get there hands on to solo in the tier 1 planes.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about all the usefull spells that are used against these mobs and tried to make a list of procs/effects a warrior would have to have to solo.<br />
<br />
Snare<br />
Slow<br />
Fear<br />
Debuffs (atk and ac primarly)<br />
Root (maybe)<br />
Some way to heal signifigantly during a fight (if there is one)<br />
<br />
Obviously the warrior is on his own for haste, the eye patch of plunder would be nice to stack up haste but that camp is awfull.  Maybe just buy a haste off a KEI chanter and go solo?<br />
<br />
Just wondering what gear you guys would bring, what gear you would bring if you couldnt' get your hands on that first pick, and which buffs you would get before you went to solo (long lasting so you dont' have to return after every kill)<br />
<br />
Ill come up with ideas as i look around alla's when i am LFG, but as long as i am thinking about it maybe you guys can help me out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty much a trunch of doom, snare whip/anklesmasher, and fungi-type tunic would be tops in your bag..after that i guess lots of potions.<br />
<br />
it kinda leaves the question a bit vague when you mention 60+ average warrior + PoP. methinks you'd be better off trying to solo in older world ( kunark/velious ) zones than up in pop considering I used to have a 62 Warr in full SS+ToVN goodies/Epics/trunch/snare whip/obsidian axe sitting about 1230+ AC and 4K hit points and couldn't even begin to solo in PoP.<br />
Luclin though was a different story. Velious was almost a challenge, and  Kunark was a downright free-for-all.<br />
I guess with enough AA's it's possible, but the average warrior inclusion is too vague to make a definate comment on. How do you describe Average?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend high AC/hp/melee stat buffs if you are crazy enough to try and solo. ( I have tried it, I can pick off ltblue rats, phear my leet solo warrior skills~ :p )<br />
<br />
Use two-handed weapons to maximize DPS and lower mob damage output. Mob damage output is what will kill you so you need to get rid of as much as possible in any way shape or form. Also DPS is quite frankly what kills mobs so the more of that the better.<br />
<br />
Go lightly on the procs: the less you try and use, the less of a grip RNG has over your life. I normally go with two proc weapons ( ToD+Snare whip )<br />
<br />
Potions should help you solo allot ( DS some healing/regen and I think a haste one are out there ) but they add up in PP costs over time, something that is scarce in tier one of PoP. So get an 8th ring or better and an eye patch of plunder if you can.<br />
<br />
Bandages: You will become one with the mummies if you do not have a click heal BP or you will hate soloing even more.<br />
<br />
Soloing is hard.</div></div><hr />
