<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i think the movie industry is dying....or totally dry on new ideas. in the last 10 years, i've been bombarded with countless movies that are jsut remakes of sit-coms from the 60s 70s and 80s. the ones that come to mind are brady bunch, scooby doo, lost in space, planet of the apes, shaft, disney sequels to *every* movie they've ever made. wtf is cinderilla 2, didn't it end &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot; not to mention every stephen king novel, and for that matter, any book on the new york times, best seller list. also, movies about superheros. i can understand X-men did good, but suddenly, damn near every other super hero got a movie. and war movies, not to discredit windtalkers, hart's war, capt cornilles mandoline, peral harbor, the thin red line, pianist, the last castle, black hawk down, antwone fisher, and the like, but all these movies spawned after the incredible popularity of saving privite ryan, and were released about 2-4 years after, a few more recently. i saw one good drama/war epic/action movie, dont cheapen it by watering down the market. then there was the big break for rappers and pop singers to bust out into the big screen. i'll admit that will smith and snoop dogg can act, but that's not an open invitation for every ass munch with a platnum album to tell me a story about life in the ghetto. and gettign back to sequels, did we really have to be subjected to 2 more mymmy movies, let alone 1 totally devoted to &quot;the rock&quot;, he a good wrestler, but in a world where arnold can run for gov. i guess it's not suprising to see people that cant act landing movie deals. do we reeally need sequels to movies that we popular almost 20 years ago, just let freddy kurger die. terminator 3?!?!?! it's that just the exact same movie as T2 only 10 years later? special edition movies, give me a damn break, every movie that you owned on VHS is now in a snazzy, limited, extended, directors cut, avialible for a limited time, behind the scenes, sneak peak, with visually enhanced, full surround sound, in 14 languages (2 you've didnt know existed), and actor/suporting actor/director/producer/camra guy/special effects artist/aminator commentary, special edition.<br />

i think i'm out of steam. enjoy the movie.</div></div><hr />

That's just me though. Best part, aside from the obligatory bare chested woman shot at the beginning, is when I fell asleep. I was dead wrong on there being two ending though. I never was one for all the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street flicks when I was a kid though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tsunan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Alien I'm psyched about.  That is a damn good movie to be released for a Halloween special.  I really hope they haven't touched it up at all.<br />
<br />
Texas Chainsaw I'm not too big on, the original was great because it was so original.<br />
<br />
Matrix was a nice suprise, hoping the third one does it right.  LOTR has been entertaining, but it's not original at all.<br />
<br />
Movies that really gave me the WOW effect in recent memory:<br />
Cube:  Low budget Sci-fi really entertaining.<br />
Sixth Sense: Fully blown away by that one.<br />
Session 9: Low budget horror/thriller.  This one is just creepy.<br />
Pirates of the Carribean: One of the best times spent in a movie theatre in a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LOTR not Original .... HOW MORE ORIGINAL CAN YOU GET.<br />
<br />
Lest i remind you LOTR was the story that actually started the fantasy movement.  It has sold more copies than every book in existance than one, and that is the Bible (thanks Giddeons).  And has probably been read by more people, you buy LOTR to read it, you buy the bible to stick on your bookshelf to make it look like you have some thread of worldly religion.  How many of you actually read the bible the way you do a book.<br />
<br />
LOTR has never been made movie because we never had the technology to film it.  And now that we do, and now thats its being done in such a thorough way, people put it down saying its &quot;Not Original&quot;.  Where do you fucking get off on that at.  <br />
<br />
LOTR started the fantasy movement.  Every fantasy movie you have ever seen had its roots in LOTR, inspired by it in some way.  I dont mean to put into this catagory King Arther movies, or Greek myths and legends, because those arnt fantasy, those are cultural mythology, which is far far different.<br />
<br />
LOTR is the most original story ever created.  And as such can not be in any way shape or form be considered un-original.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LOTR has been entertaining, but it's not original at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Hobbit was published in 1937 and The Lord of the Rings trilogy was published in 1954. The Silmarillion, which was the follow up to those books, came out when I was a kid in the late 70's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LotR did start the modern fantasy movement but it borrows a lot of elements from other stories. Gandalf the Grey/Gandalf the White is a pretty clear allegory for Jesus's death and ressurection, for example.<br />
<br />
With that being said, LotR still kicks much ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>thaumasite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">and even tolkein took his ideas from popular norse, germanic and celtic myth and folklore.<br />
<br />
Read Beowulf for a start but the list is endless. <br />
<br />
what Tolkein did so well was take existing ideas, develop &amp; expand them, repackage them and deliver them in such a compelling way that it captured peoples imagination.  Much like the romanticised classics such as le morte d'arthur became so popular, even though highly historically inacurate.<br />
<br />
Original? well in a way yes....  Influential?  almost certainly one of the most influential works of fiction ever written (unless you count the bible or the koran and that depends on your beliefs...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bractos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">TCM  is my favorite horror so I am a little biased  towards having a hard time understanding why they would remake a movie that is already a classic.<br />
<br />
One of the producers for the film said when the movie was in its early start  that 'they were going to make it more cerebral and not with all the gore'.    Anyone who has ever seem the origional TCM really has to wonder if this retard had.      This statement really has me thinking this movie might just be a real turkey. <br />
<br />
I will admit the previews give me hope though and maybe they fired this moron before the film actually entered production.<br />
<br />
I agree with the guy above though,  I think the film industry is really searching for material and are remaking TCM because it was such an awesome film that if it had come out today would have made 100 mil.   Especially when you see other Low budget horrors like 28 days later making a killing.   <br />
<br />
There have been so many wretched horror movies released in the last 10 years that have still made tons of money, it should be obvious that film audiences are primed for an actual good one.  <br />
<br />
Ill definitely be seeing it :)</div></div><hr />
