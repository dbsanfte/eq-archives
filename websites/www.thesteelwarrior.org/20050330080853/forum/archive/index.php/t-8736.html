<br />
Sadly, I'm not sure what you'll be able to handle in terms of 1-groupable mobs for providing upgrades.  You could try PoE and killing what you see available but I really don't know what level of success you will have.  Get into KT and farm up some Ikkinz items and augs for more concrete results in the meantime would be my advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than the Plankton Laced Greatsword for the /furious disc, I'd say that there really isn't any upgrades for you.  From earth you can get an Illusion stone though &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Air is traditionally a raid zone more than grouping zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The earring/ring PH guy that I have camped is after second table you work along the left wall and up the stairs and keep those 2 platforms clear of mobs.<br />
<br />
The bad part is those mobs hit like hammers in terms of tanking them.  With a spot healer or an early CH you should be fine tho.  <br />
<br />
However, given the rarity you'd probably be better single grouping every GoD area for the nice toys it has to offer.</div></div><hr />

In Plane of Earth, there are multiple spawnable named mobs that can easily be taken down by a single group of non-elemental equipped characters, even though they con red. They include A Korascian Warlord, The Living Earth, A Prismatic Basilisk and more. These mobs are spawned by triggering traps all though the zone (a good map of these traps can be found here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7110) <br />
When the traps are triggered, either the named or their place holder will spawn. <br />
<br />
The itmes that drop are very nice, including Whip of the Earthcaller (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22980), Earthtoned Band  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=10249) and Cloak of Earthen Twine (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=15827\).<br />
<br />
On my server at least, these actually frequently rot  :(  due to them being so common to pop and so easily killed by one group. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
