<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolfewynde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I retired my warrior a year or so ago for a beastlord, but now I want to start playing my warrior again some, but I am really out of date on gear for warriors!<br />
Here is my magelo - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=91661 <br />
I have 40k to spend getting him up to scratch, any advice would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1st, Replace the snow chipper with a weapon that will give you a bit more agro, either sword of the bloodsworn or copperhammer of striking would be the best way to go.  If your budget stretchs far enough you can replace the frost bringer too but you shouldnt need to.  An alternative would be to get a Great Staff of Thunder.<br />
<br />
2nd, Haste - I'd get a soulscream belt, or try to camp one if you can in Veksar.  Spiked Seahorse belt is a decent alternative to this, or maybe runed bolster belt.<br />
<br />
The rest of your gear isnt in too bad shape.  The only slots that need attention really are ears, legs, bp and 1 wrist.<br />
<br />
- replace the bracer of defense and legs with Full Mithrill (bracer 25ac 30hps, legs 40ac 40hps) <br />
<br />
- look for any 2 earrings with more than 50hps each, theres plenty to choose from these days, Mozzie earrings and Bloodmetal earrings of engagement are getting cheaper.<br />
<br />
- Barbed ringmail isnt great, but it isnt too bad either and I think you'd get more bang for buck upgrading other slots than buying an expensive BP upgrade.  With whatever pennies you have left have a look for something like an architech's bejeweled chest plate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Weapons: CHoS, Sotbs, greatstaff of thunder<br />
Bp: anything with over 30 ac and 50hp in sta or hp, thurg bp MQ, myrmidon MQ<br />
Earrings: bloodmetal would be nice for you, if you cant get get somethings with ac and try for 40hp+<br />
Legs: Cobalt, Kylong shinguards<br />
Waist: Soulscream belt, enchanter sash of wonder, anything with 31% haste or more<br />
Back: Cloak of greater pernicity would be a good upgrade or a crinose cape of the werewolf<br />
Shoulders: Mantle of distraction, bonespur mantle, some other ones with good sta and hp together<br />
Wrist: bracelet of fortitude or quickness<br />
Neck: amulet of mummy wrapping is a good one<br />
<br />
The myrmidon gear will last you for awhile.<br />
EDIT: well i guess i was beat on this post and i repeated some things</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolfewynde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice guys :)<br />
Ok, so far I bought a mosquito earring, heavy rubicite BP, amulet of mummy wrappings and a faydark thunderbolt bow, and were given steel wrapped leggings, I have 13k left.<br />
I have a spare cloak of crystalline waters I can give him, but that has no hp on it so should I use that or just save up and get the soulscream belt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your weapons are priority #1.  I'd pass you up for a group in a heartbeat for anything outside of Tier1 PoP with those weapons. <br />
<br />
Spend the few hundred plat on a GSoT, today.  Log on, go to the bazaar, and buy the cheapest GSoT for sale there, before you do anything else. No joking.  You can upgrade to CHoS/SoBS (if it's an upgrade or not is debateable) down the road, but really, there is zero excuse to be using those weapons past 55.</div></div><hr />
