<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavhok</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This patch, the new endurance bar and discipline system will be going live.  The extra warrior mitigation and provoke line will be in there as well.  As you may have seen on the monk board, we're holding off on the opening system for now.  We'd like to get more time to test and tune those skills and the system.<br />
<br />
We've made some more changes to the disciplines.  Here is how they now stand:<br />
<br />
Timer 1<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Evasive - Level 52.  3 minute duration, 7.8 minute refresh.  Increases avoidance and decreases to-hit.<br />
Defensive - Level 55.  3 minute duration, 10.5 minute refresh.  Decreases damage taken and damage given.<br />
Stonewall - Level 65.  3 minute duration, 10.5 minute refresh.  Decreases damage taken and reduces movement rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timer 2<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Furious - Level 56.  2 tick duration, 40 minute refresh.  Riposte every hit.<br />
Fellstrike - Level 58.  5 tick duration, 25 minute refresh.  Increases damage per hit with minimum of 4x base damage.<br />
Fortitude - Level 59.  2 tick duration, 40 minute refresh.  Avoid all melee attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timer 3<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Charge - Level 53.  5 tick duration, 25 minute refresh.  Improve hit rate on melee attacks to 100%.<br />
Mighty Strike - Level 54.  5 tick duration, 25 minute refresh.  All attacks will critically hit.<br />
Precision - Level 57.  1 minute duration, 30 minute refresh.  Increases accuracy of all melee attacks.<br />
Aggressive - Level 60.  1 minute duration, 30 minute refresh.  Increases damage done on all melee attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timer 4<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Resistant - Level 30.  5 minute duration, 30 minute reuse.  Increases all resists up to 20.<br />
Fearless - Level 40.  1 minute duration, 30 minute reuse.  Gives immunity to all fear effects.<br />
Spirit of Rage - Level 61.  2 tick duration, 30 minute reuse.  Substantially increases the amount of aggro you generate against NPCs.<br />
Healing Will - Level 63.  1 minute duration, 5 minute reuse.  Increases regeneration substantially.  Cannot be used while in combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The combination of the increase in duration of the short, high-damage disciplines, the decrease in duration of Aggressive and Precision, and the removal of the negative aspects of the latter two brings the potential damage increase for warrior disciplines to where we want it for now.  It's obviously a mixed bag for some, but the separate timers should allow much more use of disciplines than before.<br />
<br />
We may make further changes to the disciplines and timers based on feedback for the next patch, but this is what will be going in on Thursday morning.</div></div><hr />

  Does this mean these disciplines no longer have a negative component?<br />
<br />
  Krag - One tick is 6 seconds, so 5 ticks is 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a side note.. /blush.. I should know this, but I don't, simply cuz I never thought to use/try it.. but how does furious work against a mob's enrage ?  Or does it not riposte ripostes, and merely ripostes &quot;original&quot; attacks ?</div></div><hr />

Looks like it it does: <br />
<br />
the decrease in duration of Aggressive and Precision, and the removal of the negative aspects of the latter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me charge will be better than Aggressive in all cases?  I think we hit something like around 55% of the time, so that's almost double DPS for 5 ticks.  That means Aggressive/Precision has to be at close to 50% DPS for 1 minute, which I don't think they are based on spdat info, and certainly the max hit with aggressive isn't 50% more than max hit without aggressive.  <br />
<br />
But of course, there's also going berserk and use mightystrike.</div></div><hr />

Fellstrike - 5 tick duration (35 seconds?) Is this right?  <br />
<br />
6sec per tic x5 + the remaining seconds of the tic youre in so 30-35sec I'm pretty sure</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moze Emdoyne</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For example 1k for a rogue, 1500 for a monk and 2k for a warrior but the warrior heal better be able to be used while running or with attack on or it is still fucking useless.<br />
 <br />
:BLINK:<br />
<br />
I dunno...Im quite happy with a 1k no-attack heal... Matter of fact I can see quite a few uses for it..  IF your smart with it...  Is much much better than having that 500hp swill that we started out with.<br />
<br />
Hell it can be argued that we shouldnt even HAVE the discipline at all...  Ill take it because honestly I highly doubt we are going to get much more than this.  About the only thing that I could see is to take the no-movement no-attack restrictions off and slap on a VERY long reuse time.<br />
<br />
One thing I dont much like is...<br />
<br />
Spirit of Rage - Level 61. 2 tick duration, 30 minute reuse. Substantially increases the amount of aggro you generate against NPCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
THIRTY minutes for a TWO tick discipline?!?! That seems well...excessive.  This better generate a HUGE amount of aggro :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Furious used to spam up the screen (and freeze for a few seconds) with 100's of hits riposting back and forth but now your hits just connect even if the mob is enraged while using furious if I remember correctly, been a long time since I tried it.<br />
<br />
Healing will is pretty cool imo, considering I'm not a healer in any way, shape or form.</div></div><hr />

I once posted that with the 100HP/click Warlords BP it only took me about 100 clicks to heal to full. Now it will only take 90!! Yay!!!<br />
<br />
This is good, but I'd like them to concider a HoT that slowed us by 99% and healed 4000HP's in 1 minute or whatever. I'm not looking for something that can be exploited, just something that will cutdown those BP right clicks.<br />

Imo you can add and tweak old and new disciplines all you want but the question remains... What has been done or IS being done to address the issue of aggro-lock (for want of a better term) for warriors?...<br />

<br />
Now the MT has to ask himself:<br />
-Do I want more aggro?<br />
-Do I want higher resists?<br />
-Do I want to avoid fears?<br />
<br />
If the MT (as most would) wants more aggro, then they loose the benefit of higher resists or fear immunity.<br />

Second, Taunt seems to be working more often, on Test. Third, Provoke + Taunt == massive aggro.<br />
<br />
I still wish we got a disc that made our weapons proc every attack for a tick or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still wish we got a disc that made our weapons proc every attack for a tick or two.  I know Rogues get something like that.  Weapon Affinity I believe it's called, increases chance to proc for 18 seconds (not guaranteed every attack tho).  Warriors really only needed the upgraded chance to proc because of the dependance on agro weapons...with Provoke, it shouldn't be as bad (I hope).<br />
<br />
I'm happy the duration on Healing Will was increased, and that the 5 minute re-use was kept.  It always looked to me as if it was a downtime-decreaser with the short-re-use.  Although I forsee a future AA increasing the amount healed per tick to 150 or even 200 perhaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing Will looks to me something like after a mob dies in XP groups when you're at say 80% so it's not quite enough for a CH but a waste to use any other heal, you pop it and get whatever HPs back you can before the next mob comes in.  And if your puller sucks, you might even get the one minute duration (and I've seen that happen quite a bit actually).  Consider nothing else important is on that timer why not pop it in between pulls?  <br />
<br />
Also you can probably use it after you zoned out from a train, or better yet have a dot and you're dying.  100/tick probably won't save you from anything seriously but it's better than sitting down and hope you won't die.  If this disc actually uses up timers for something useful, maybe there's a reason to complain, but as far as I can tell none of the discs on the same timer does anything remotely useful for 99% of the situation you might find yourself in.  So what if you only get 2 ticks before you go back to combat?  It's still 200 HP.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just thought of another great use, after you get rezzed, pop healing will on yourself and begin looting.  Depending on lag you might even get a free 1000 heal before you're done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, rollback eating my old post.<br />
<br />
Anyway, forget healing will. If I wanted hps that badly I did what any self respecting melee did and busted out the bandages to bind my wounds. Only casters and their twinks sit down. :p<br />
<br />
The thing that really needs to be looked at here is why the cutback of the long duration offensive discs? Changing those decreases warriors already low stack ability in raiding and grouping situations. Admittedly, being a gimp monk without FD mend or stone stance isn't exactly something to drool for, but it is still much better than being a non-tanking warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but does this mean you can use Fellstrike and mightystrike at the same time now ??<br />
<br />
<br />

if so .. HA ! time for revenge on those slay undead crits !! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't use them at same time, only one at any one time.<br />
<br />
However you can throw them one after another, they last 30 seconds each.<br />
<br />
Mmmm...30 seconds of critical hits/crippling blows...<br />

<br />
Paladin: I can do crits for up to 8k on undead...randomly<br />

Warrior:  Yeah?  Check this out...&lt;activates Mighty Strike&gt;<br />
<br />
Paladin goes LD from spam.<br />
<br />
Warrior: &lt;/flexes&gt; Next!<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
On another note, it seems the buff slots for the disciplines have been assigned &quot;Short buff -1&quot;<br />
<br />
Normal bard songs have &quot;Short buff 1&quot;, which leads me to believe that the disciplines take up the last slot (whereas bard songs fill up the first slots in order) in the Bard song box instead of having their own box.<br />
<br />
Although, this sounds eerily familiar...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you can use different discs at the same time, even if they are on different timers. You're only allowed to have 1 disc running at any given time; if you try using 2 at once, only the second one will take affect, although you will still pay the endurance cost for both the first (overwritten) and second disc.<br />
<br />
What this allows you to do, however, is this:<br />
<br />
/disc Spirit of Rage at the beginning of a boss fight, for 2 ticks.<br />
/disc Furious for 2 ticks, until the cheal chain and positioning is set.<br />
/disc defensive/stonewall for 3 minutes of a boss fight.<br />
/disc charge to finish off the boss and hope for the killing shot.<br />
<br />
This of course assumes that you have enough endurance to use 4 discs in about 4 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) Stonewall (or defensive).   <br />

<br />
Am I reading something wrong here?  That would Rock!!<br />

Seems like it! But werent there something with an endurance bar or that idea was never completed ? But if it excist, I doubt you could do that, perhaps Furious would take almost all of your endurance and you wouldnt have enough for defensive or stonewall...<br />
<br />
Perhaps I am wrong though :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And what's the difference between Infalliable and Fortitude?  Other than one apparently truly blows, and the other is not partially useful?  <br />
<br />
By Lucy:  Fortitude basically makes you melee immune for 2 ticks...Infalliable is instant, no ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're part of the new opening system that wasn't actually put in (click on raw data, there's entries for NPC Error, Defensive opening, Skill opening, etc...if it has a 1, it's used from that opening).  BTW, both those two rely on NPC Error openings.<br />
<br />
Other than that, one increases AC by 60 for 12 seconds, the other makes the mob's next attack unable to hit you.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Edit:  If you were talking about the difference between Infallible and Fortitude Discipline, not the skill Fortitude, then the difference is that the Fortitude Discipline can be activated whenever you have the endurance and the timer is ready, whereas Infallible needs an opening which hasn't been implemented yet (supposedly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggressive - Level 60. 1 minute duration, 30 minute refresh. Increases damage done on all melee attacks.<br />
<br />
Ouch, aggressive nerfed from 3 min duration to 1 min duration AND lowered from 33% to 30% increase.. :/<br />
<br />
This was the only offensive disc ever worth using, and popping that on PoTime bosses could with some luck have you enter the top 20 guildwide DPS(imo not overpowering).<br />
<br />
The extra 3 ticks on fellstrike wont be able to make up for the loss of 2 minutes of aggressive disc.<br />
<br />
So I think &quot;the mixed bag&quot; comment is pretty much on the mark:<br />
<br />
We gain some defensive stuff; mitigation, provoke-line, and unlinking of disc that will allow us to use ripo/dodge disc.<br />
<br />
On the other hand we lose alot of potential damage output on the 3-5 min duration encounters(which includes pretty much ALL PoTime gods).<br />
<br />
I think a more fair solution would have been to lower the duration of aggressive only just enough so that damage of aggressive pre-patch == damage of aggressive+fellstrike post-patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
overall warriors will put out more damage on raids because of the unlinked discs and removal of the negative side effects of aggressive and precision and the other tweaks. i have never used an offensive disc in potime(or any disc other than defensive/evasive) because i couldnt risk not having def up. now i can use an offensive disc whenever and not worry about it, i could even use aggressive while tanking after defensive has run out and not kill myself in the process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If devs see us running around acting like casters and doing too much damage and they adjust end cost so say two /disc's eats the bar then we can't go chaining disc's in a melee version of full burn.<br />
<br />
Time will tell, all in all I like what I see so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either Fortitude (melee immunity for 2 ticks), or Furious, (riposte all melee, and in turn not take any melee damage).<br />
<br />
This would work good in XP groups for when shit hits the fan and the cleric is a little late on his heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
healing will and focused will are on timer 2. spirit of rage is on timer 3.<br />
<br />
healing will doesnt stack with regen spells. use healing will and your regen spells fade. cast regen spells and healing will fades.<br />
<br />
mightystrike does nothing at all that i can tell. others have said other discs do nothing for them.<br />

disc hotkey buttons can pop back up after you zone even though they havent recycled yet.</div></div><hr />

I put a shadowknight to shame fooling around in fire.  Toggle  Spirit of rage immediatly followed by provoke and melee.   <br />
<br />
The main problem is just that (im pretty sure) you can't use spirit of rage and defensive at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Edit: But Fellstrike is actually on the same timer as all the other offensive discs. Yet another UI bug.  And Healing Will is on Same timer as Resistant/Fearless.</div></div><hr />

Used aggressive in a boss fight and went to click fellstrike after enrage and was blacked out.<br />
<br />
Also, a note on endurance costs:  tanking a PoAir avatar with defensive and mashing incite every time it refreshed left me with 1/2 bubble of endurance at the end of the fight.  It was perhaps a 4 minute fight? not really sure.<br />
<br />
Also, a note about taunt success messages: on the same PoAir avatar, AEtaunt &quot;failed.&quot;  I would not have thought this possible, but it explains why PoAir bosses seem to always ignore AEtaunt.  :P</div></div><hr />

I could care less about the removal of the extra damage you take.  Put that back if you want too.  Aggressive is our highest level offensive disc and it's useless now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liked the idea in principle of the opening sequence of:<br />
<br />
1. Incite<br />
2. Spirit of the rage<br />
3. Def/evasive<br />
<br />
In practice though on heavy hitting boss mobs SoR for 2 ticks means death...thats too long w/o some mitigation (unless there is some trick I can't think of).<br />
<br />
Also, I just can't bring myself to trust stonewall.  Someone please post here if they have warm fuzzies about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewall is the perfect disc for mobs that are perma-rooted.  Two in the cod high priest ring, the mini-emp type SSRA fight (high priest guy?), and perhaps some more that don't spring to mind.<br />
<br />
I have used it in a tight LDON hallway also where there was a big pull.  AETaunt, Furious (time to get them mezzed and controlled), then Stonewall (to kill faster and can move between them as it is a tight space).<br />
<br />
Discs are incredibly useful now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If its not perma rooted, its not cornered, mobility is required..<br />
Or if ye just plain dont feel comfortable with it, dont use it.<br />
<br />
Defensive and mobility is just as fine.<br />
The DPS and aggro gain are very minimal.<br />
<br />
(But for soloing its the shiznit)</div></div><hr />
