PD3?<br />
lr5 or ID5<br />
after that it is whatever does it for you but above AA makes warrior do their job much better which is to tank. With those you can tank pretty damn well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I had it to do all over, defensive oriented.<br />
<br />
For Planes of Power:<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Level to 65<br />
Metabolism 3 (no shit)<br />
ND3<br />
Area Taunt<br />
CS3<br />
ID5<br />
CA3<br />

For Luclin, swap CA3 and LR5 with CS3 and ID 5 so that you do avoidance before mitigation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd toss stawart endurance in there, tho perhaps at the end.  Reducing the stuns helps hold aggro, control mob positioning, and maintaining situational awareness.  Unless you play an ogre that is, in which case it's still decent, but more so for pulling (because it's all aspect instead of front only).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so you guys are saying i should level right up to 65 nonstop THEN AA? i was planning on AA'ing at 60 because alot of raiding guild who are 60+ require you to have AET and other AA's BEFORE you join. so should i straight grind to 65 then AA or take a break at 60 and AA a bit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what to advise now that the level range for blue con's has been expanded and more PoP zones have been opened up, but here is what I would have said before the last patch:<br />
<br />
When you get to level 60 stop and assess your postion.<br />
<br />
If you have a regular grouping crowd, lots of friends levelling up with you or are in a guild who you group with regularly then level up to 65.  If your gear is good and your HPs are hitting the 4k mark then sure, level up to 65.<br />
<br />
However if you rely on pickup groups and are sitting in the 3k-3.5k hp range then stop and AA because in tier 2 PoP and above (cos back then you wouldnt want to XP anywhere else past 60) you'll have alot of trouble getting groups when you are competing against level 65 warriors and knights for the tank spot and get to be known as a lightweight tank who cant keep mobs off the casters and cant tank the mob unslowed long enough to build up agro for the slower and healer to do their thing without pulling the mob off them.  So if you're in this boat get level 60 then work on getting ND3 to get your HPs up a little.  Once you have your HPs up asses it again and maybe AET and some other defensive AAs or choose to level up to 65 before switching back to AA.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse now XP in sub Tier 2 PoP prolly doesnt blow as much for the 60+ crowd so maybe it is worth levelling up before you get the AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No AA will make you any more desirable to a guild than being 65.  I will take a 65 warrior with no AA over a 60 warrior with 300 AA any day of the week to tank for me on a raid.  Levels are more important than any other variable in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely encourage you to level to 65 first.  No question in my mind that if your goal is lvl 65 and X aa's you are going to get there faster by getting 65 first and then aa'ing than taking a break from leveling to aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lvl is more important, but sometime shortly after 51 get RUN3...then get to 65.<br />

Its saved me more times than ND3 has ;)<br />
