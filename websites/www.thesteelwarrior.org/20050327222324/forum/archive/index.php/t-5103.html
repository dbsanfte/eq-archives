<br />
As the subject said I recently hit level 61.  I have been working a very odd schedule lately and my &quot;prime&quot; times to play have been greatly diminshed.  I almost always play in PoP experience groups or do LDON adventures.<br />
<br />
However because of the new schedule I have often times been forced to duo with my brother's shaman, who is level 62.<br />
<br />
Can you guys and gals help me with a decent spot for exp if I have to duo.  I try to get on and grind exp in between my lousy schedule.  PoJ seems to have gone LB for me without crowd control.  PoD is a nightmare for adds and the PoN mobs have to many HP for me to duo I think.<br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance for the help and what a great tool this is for the Everquest community.<br />

<br />
Grinding through 61 in PoD is somewhat painful but you can do it.<br />
I suspect it will take you about 10-12 hours of exp to get through.<br />
<br />
At least the mobs aren't as hard. I would suggest you go to the Courtyards by the castle. You should have 0 adds if you just proximity pull when the mobs are split up.<br />
<br />
I started doing PoV at level 61, and it was pretty quick. I am just not sure how well you will do with just a shaman and warrior. Both from a single pull aspect and difficulty of mobs.<br />
<br />
I think I would definitely stick to PoD at the castle in either LCY or RCY. You get the whole place to yourself, can med with no adds, and you will never run out of mobs with just 2 people.<br />
<br />
Mobs do run though, so you have to figure that out. Can always root if need be or let shaman finish with dots or bracer perhaps while you get another mob. Just fight em nice and high up on the wall, since they run down.<br />
<br />
Btw, once you are 62, you really should try and get into BoT groups or HoH/PoV. That will give you the biggest bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
But heck, there was a guy on Drinal who did CT until he hit 65. Once he tried PoP for the first time, he almost fell over at the exp LOLOL.<br />
