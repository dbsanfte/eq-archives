<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Principle interests taken from Raaj's poll: <br />
Improve Taunt, upgrade HP/AC/Mitigation/Avoidance, Aggro DoT, Disciplines, +Hate, New Skills, Itemization, Specialisation.<br />
<br />
Each interest fits under 3 Main Categories:<br />
<br />
Skills - Disciplines - Warrior Advancement<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Explanation of Each Category <br />
<br />
Skills - Add New Damage/Hate, Defensive or Utility type skills<br />
                 - Upgrade Old Skills (Kick, Taunt, Disarm etc.. )<br />
                 - Make a New Skill system (skills that take account of stamina, stats etc...)<br />
                 - Advance the warrior's damage/defensive capability through new passive skills.<br />
<br />
Disciplines - Add New Disciplines at certain levels, or in the form of &quot;quests&quot;.<br />
                        - Upgrade the Old Disciplines, changing duration and reuse times.<br />
                        - Upgrade the Discipline Mechanics, changing way timers are linked etc...<br />
                        - Add new forms of Disciplines like Auras or Stances etc...<br />
<br />
Advancement - Heighten the reward Warriors get from Items. (hp/ac bonuses, ways to use mana etc...)<br />
                           - Upgrade the equipment with Melee Focuses, Effects or New sorts of Effects etc....<br />
                           - Make new Items Warriors get through quests and drops.<br />
                           - Advance the Damage Tables.<br />
                           - Upgrade the Warrior's Status(Mitigation, HP, AC, STA etc...)<br />
                           - Bring in New caps to skills (Taunt, Kick, Parry etc...) as well as Specialisations.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is what we will do:<br />
<br />
Post your ideas that concern each of these categories, and ONLY your ideas. Don't start discussions here, start new threads in the War Room if you want to do so.<br />
I will be taking every idea that fits one of the 3 categories, and list them in evidence under the category in question. <br />
The lists will be links to the posts and threads that have details/discussions on it.<br />
At this stage, it doesnt matter if people agree or not with ideas. If you don't agree with any ideas in a certain Category, then don't vote for that Category in the futur poll :)<br />
<br />
During a few weeks, everyone will have time to read the ideas that concern each of the three Categories. This way, everyone has a pretty good idea of what the Category stands for.<br />
<br />
Once enough days have passed, I will make a poll, and everyone will then choose ONE Category.<br />
The Category with the highest vote, will become the center of interest.<br />
<br />
Once we got our Center of Interest (possibly make a new Board specially for whatever that interest will be),<br />
we can start the deep discussons, spring out new ideas, ditch unacceptable ones and try to avoid the unavoidable flames ;).<br />
We'll work that big mass of muddy ideas together, polish them out a bit, and sculpt something we'll all be proud of.<br />
Then we just need to submit our piece of art to the Devs, with a whole community backing up the idea, they'll hopefully listen.<br />
I would also suggest to submit the idea to a couple of other communites, and see what they think of it.<br />
<br />
So for now:<br />
post ideas, detailed or not. Bearing in mind that there will be no discussions about it on this thread.<br />
I would suggest that you make a New Topic in the War Room about your idea, and then just post a link to it on this thread.<br />
It would keep things clean ;)<br />
<br />
If you feel there's a General Idea that's missing under one of the categories, you can always say so....<br />
but it really doesn't matter. Everyone hopefully knows what each Category means, with the general ideas I posted.<br />
Now all that matters are specific ideas that fit under each Category.<br />
So put on your Thinking Caps, and get to work :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or complaints about the switch from the old post to the new. (Your idea got lost, a Category is missing from old etc...)<br />
PM me or make a new post about it please :). Don't post it here.<br />
<br />
And as for the Utility Category that was on the old post, and that isnt here.<br />
I figured Utility comes from either Disciplines or Skills or Items... which are all already Categories. So no need of a 4th :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just to throw out another vague idea:<br />
<br />
No tank in the game can lower agro.  SKs can shed their agro but that skill isn't useful to an Enchanter who is getting pounded on.<br />
<br />
All of the mitigation in the world doesn't matter if you can't make the monster to attacking the wrong target.  How about given Warriors a chance to attack the problem from the other end of the agro list?  Target the Enchanter and activate a skill to immediately lower their agro.  If nothing else make their agro lower than your agro.  That is just as good as a super Taunt.</div></div><hr />

A possible new disc.. Unnamed.. but.. Double your speed.. but half your damage (More hits.. hopefully more agro), and 1/2 the damage done to you.. for 30 seconds.. But since it has a long useage time.. it would have a root drawback, in which when used you are unable to move until the disc ends.. <br />
<br />
*shrugs* thats my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uira Tawhaki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oooh.. I like the idea of Warrior only offensive skill specializations..<br />
<br />
You could get upto 50 in all of them but only one could go 51+<br />
  Taunt, Kick, Bash, Disarm.<br />
<br />
Possibly Parry, Dodge and Ripostle but then these wouldn't ever go above 50 (the passive ones you can't choose not to click while making sure taunt goes over 50).<br />
<br />
Successful specialization check would decrease the reuse time by 10%. <br />
<br />
<br />
Focus Weapons could include the ability &quot;Hastened Taunt I, II and III&quot; which would give -5%, -10% or -15% reuse delays to taunt.  Perhaps some really rare items out there (think a quest of the same magnitude of 8th Shawl) could give -20%. This would stack with specialization.<br />
<br />
A second Focus effect could be hastened shielding. Would decrease the reuse time of /shield by 15% (to 2 mins 33 secs). This would be appropriate for many of the armor slots, hands in particular and perhaps some weapons as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Skill modifying weapons could include +2%, +3%, +5%, +10% and +15% taunt. They already have these for parry and dodge. Why not taunt?<br />
<br />
Maybe some shoulders with +2% to +15% bash for large warriors and some boots with +2% to +15% kick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like caster focuses, these would stack with AA abilities, buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: in order to actually help with class balancing this gear should be WAR only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like that.. &quot;Know Thy Enemy.&quot; It would be a box and a skill just like Track. It would give you the hate list and the amount of aggro each person has on it as well as a color-coding showing classes.<br />
<br />
Perhaps other melee/tanks would get this too (I would hope not since warriors and monks are, in theory, the ones who study their enemies while hybrids study magic) but if so the warrior version would be to the knight version as the ranger version of track is to druid...<br />
<br />
The knights wouldn't get the color coding or the exact amount of hate and warriors/monks would have the option of filtering whereas knights/beastlords would not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nunzio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm only posting about what I see at level 65.  I'm sure we are all having problems, but with the AA's available to people at Lvl 65 and the gear in VT and in the Elemental Planes, my life as a MT / MA has become a nightmare at times.  DWing Enraging Blow weapons with SK hate buff, Ferine Avatar and making pissed of faces at my monitor here at home still leave me standing in a corner with dead peeps all around me at times.  <br />
<br />
This is my first post to this forum, so I hope I am putting this in the right place: <br />
<br />
Warrior DPS is a joke.  We need this increased, but I don't think that is going to help a lot.  We will never be able to out damage a monk or a rogue, so DPS is only a small part of the answer.<br />
<br />
Make it an AA skill or something, I don't care, but allow me to use Defensive without decreasing my DPS.  What idiot thought this was a good idea?<br />
<br />
Break warrior disciplines up into Offensive and Defensive and allow us to use one of each at the same time.<br />
<br />
If Sony is going to give Pallies and SK's defensive gear nearly equal to ours, give us 2 handed weapons equal to theirs.   So many awesome pally and SK only weapons are in the game right now it's a joke.  Elemental planes for the most part is a 2 hander tanking world, give us a chance for crying out loud.  Oh, and make them Warrior Only so I don't have to compete with Pallies and SK's who think every 2 hander that drops belongs to them.<br />
<br />
And as for the mobs that mem blur themselves in EP's, I sure would like a way for us to grab fast aggro.  I hate it when they forget who they are supposed to be mad at and think it's the next cleric who lands a CH.  This I know is a pipe dream, but an ogah can dream, can't he?<br />
<br />
Anyway, nice talking to you warriors.  We are the warriors, if dying bothered us, we'd have played a druid.<br />

<br />
This would be incredibly useful for melees who choose to solo, they'd finally be able to rely on procs (slow, snare, bandages etc...) <br />
<br />
It'd also really help out the raid/group types to maximize their contribution (warrior auto-procs EB on first hit of an incoming mob, rogue/monks can insta-swap primal weapons, etc)<br />
<br />
2. Innate, over-the-cap, stackable haste. For the sake of this post we'll call it &quot;Deftness&quot;. 3 levels, 10% haste each. <br />
<br />
3. Itemization includes effects that modify this new haste. Example: &quot;Mrylokar's Vengeance&quot; could be a Rogue-only effect that multiplies your &quot;deftness&quot; by 1.5. So a Rogue with 41% haste item, SoV, Rizlona's, deftness3 and MV would be at 275% of their unhasted attack speed. (as opposed to 230% which is the current cap w/ max haste and rizlona's)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't have the time to polish this up much, but wanted to get them posted - maybe spark some more ideas here on the board.<br />
<br />
For most of the ideas below I tried to flesh out thier scope a bit, and most will feel a little overpowered (on the premise it is better to have warriors get something more powerful up front and scale it back later - wouldn't that be a treat).<br />
<br />
Improve /shield to make it more usable.  Group effect, longer base duration, greater range.  Allow AA's to decrease extra damage from 75% to 50%.  Allow shield to work with /disc - maybe with evasive &amp; defensive have the /shield damage ignore the /disc?<br />
<br />
Change nature of Disarm.  Have effect (in addition to usual weapon drop) of a slow at (Disarm skill+Level)/10%, for a duration of the refresh of Disarm.  I.e. if you succeed with every disarm attempt a warrior could keep a mob 26.5% slowed indefinately.  Maybe change the calculation to allow up to 35-50% slow with Disarm.  Give this effect an appropriate aggro effect - even if the mob is already slowed.  Allow it to work against mobs that are normally unslowable.  Increase success rate of Disarm to approximately that of taunt, bearing in mind different cap levels.  Maybe increase the Disarm cap?<br />
<br />
Taunt - decrease the penalty for trying to taunt mobs higher level than you.  I.e. make all mobs 65+ the same sucess rate for taunt for a 65 warrior.<br />
<br />
Add more Taunt and Disarm bonus effect items, or increase their caps to 252.<br />
<br />
Allow us to augment &quot;favorite&quot; items with Taunt and Disarm bonuses (i.e Epic, elemental/planar armor, PoP charm, certian quest items (Dozekar, Veracity earring, etc.).<br />
<br />
Give us (warriors) shields that have at least as much taunt as a decent off hand weapon (CHSD, Red Epic, etc.) - the trade off should be DPS vs protection, not Aggro vs protection, because every warrior worth their salt will choose aggro.<br />
<br />
/discs - keep the 60 and under disciplines.  Add these disciplines:<br />
<br />
61: Protective - combo avoidance, mitigation and defensive skill boost (dodge, parry, riposte) that lasts a minimum of 5 minutes, but stays on indefinately after that.  Can be either canceled or another /disc can be used after 5 minutes.  Significant DPS loss, but no decrease in procs (that's where the aggro comes from).  Also add some base regen? Resists?  Group Fear check bonus?  Perhaps require a 1-5 minute &quot;down time&quot; after cancelling  before next /disc can be used?<br />
<br />
63: Berserker - Combo offensive disc - increased crit rate, increased base damage, increased hit rate, small &quot;bardsong&quot; self haste (10-25% - stacks with worn and spell haste, breaks haste cap), offensive skill boost (double/triple attack, dual attack, flurry, ingenuity, etc.), raw ATK boost?  Significant (total?) loss of defensive skills, avoidance, mitigation.  Same duration requirements of Protective.  Alternate name:   Makemelikemonkey.<br />
<br />
65:  Make Protective level 65, and have a lesser version at level 61.<br />
<br />
20: Speed of the Coward - Spirit of Cheetah speed buff - gets faster the more damage you take after being triggered, and does not drop when you get hit, only if you attack.  Can only be triggered when the warrior is below 50% health.  At level 30 it becomes a group effect.  At level 46, AoE.  Increase AoE range at 55, 60, 65.  Warrior using this ability has a title of &quot;Coward&quot; or &quot;Yellow-Bellied&quot; for 504 minutes (7 game days), character log time, also max faction anywhere is kindly (who wants to be allied with a coward?)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just some ideas I came up with.  Let the flamage begin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Speed of the CowardHahaha :D<br />
<br />
Speaking with a relative level 30 mindset - If I'm taking that much damage and I'm headin' for the zone, as far as I'm concerned, anyone behind me is the rear guard. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gazarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Aggro fix<br />
-Voice of Thule self buff (12% aggro to all hits), need to stack with actual Voice of Thule line ( instead of putting that buff on potime BP that only a very small fraction of warrior will have access to)<br />
-Terror of Thule self buff for aggro lock, usuable once per mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
Utility outside of main tank for raid and xp group<br />
-( Master body guard ) take /shield a step further, designate a target and you will automatically protect that person when they take dmg and it will cut down the dmg of the target taken by more than 50% while lowering their aggro.<br />
-( Burst dmg ) give us jousting skill to make high 2h piercing dmg on a horse, will be useful on specific boss fights for those warrior that are not main tanking.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see the aggro from warriors' slam/kick raised significantly: misses should be near the aggro of a resisted (or immune) stun and hits near the aggro of a succesful stun.  And I'd like them on separate timers. I think this would be doable, it's innate, and it scales from level 1-65. <br />
Oh, and separate the timers for monks with dragon punch/tail rake and flying kick while they're at it.</div></div><hr />

Not useful for every situation, of course, but dual weild should be an acceptable option for DPS I think, and one could swing to taunters and still get acceptable *ouching*.  And I enjoy dual weilding more ;).<br />
<br />
I'm a fan of boosting warrior DPS some overall, too.  We're pure melee ... that should count for more than taking it on the chin.<br />
<br />
Another idea I've seen here, and I like it ... melee abilities via a &quot;spell bar&quot;, based off stamina and with usage implemented similarly to spells ... long/short reuse times, and some &quot;greying out&quot; the whole bar for a while.  I'd have a lotta fun with that :D.  Gets easier to tell the gimps from the heroes, that way.<br />
<br />
Of course, unlocking the /disc timers gives that, too.  Wouldn't hurt to add some more /discs tho!  I'd do quests to &quot;learn&quot; them, why not?<br />
<br />
I love my GSoT, and I like to shop for toys ... but I'd hate to see more fixes via drops.<br />
<br />
That being said, (also off the monk boards I think) ... t'would be nice to have a pure melee innate &quot;mana to hp&quot;.   on items.  200 mana on all my gear = 200hp.   Mystic Energy Conversion, or something.</div></div><hr />

I thought about the second one while replying to another thread, Maelissa had the idea of the extra aggro from crits. I'll repeat my thoughts here.<br />
<br />
This might seem to infringe on rogue territory, but I don't think so. Having a real penalty for turning your back on a warrior (above the mobs inability to dodge/riposte/parry, etc.) is one way to represent our role as a tank. Note that the extra aggro from crits would kick in and so it is not something that would really be a dps boost as the mob would feel the pain and turn back to the warrior. If the additional dps is a concern in terms of warriors being able to use it just for the additional dps and not gain aggro from it, then this ability could be just something that say doubles the hate from your attacks when attacking from behind.<br />
<br />
You turn it on, indicating that you are going for the soft spots that cause a lot of pain, rather than just doing damage in attacking from behind, to get its attention, and the mob focusing on someone else allows you to be that precise with your attacks.<br />
<br />
I never saw taunt as what its name implies. It might work that way for relatively dumb mobs, but an opponent that's supposed to be highly intelligent, whether some low level caster in a lvl 20 zone or a boss mob, is not going to say, &quot;Oh, I better kill the warrior first because he insulted my parentage!&quot; One part of a tank's ability to hold aggro is supposed to represent his/her ability to be a physical barrier between the mob and whoever he wants to kill at that moment. The other part is that the warrior convinces the mob that he/she is the most dangerous threat. The mob would not turn its back on someone wearing a lot of steel with lots of sharp pointy things to stick in it, for that would be a bad idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Garudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Few points that could make a warriors life easier <br />
First of all why do all really good war weps either have a ridiculous low drop rate i.e. Bloodfrenzy or BoW and to make it even worse most good taunters are not war only but we have to compete for it gainst knights for 2hs weps like BoW and with rangers for every good 1hs 1hb (hint sony why is BoC usueable by all 1hs classes ?) <br />
Second thought in original eq knights had lower dps due to lower skills and no dual wield etc. to make up for the spells they get. Now like every second pop mob drops pal sk only weps wich in fact raise their dps higher then most warriors even without any spells but plain melee. Should really either raise skill caps or simply move warriors to new dmg tables as our dps are next to non existant.<br />
Next point is ok we get ae taunt (wich is somehow only of limited use in ele planes /shrug) but 20 mins reuse is a joke and even with aa spent in hastened instigation u can lower it to a reuse of 16 mins wich is still way to long to make it useful in any given situation cause u can get aggro fast at start but with caster dmg or dps of other melee classes ull loose it as fast again even with BoW or 2EB combo<br />
Raise stun cap on bash kick higher cause atm its a useless skill on any raid situation without any stun aggro on boss mobs<br />
Introduce some focus effects on warrior only gear ( and perhaps introduce such stuff in the high lvls ?) that gives us bonus to dps and or taunt<br />
And to end it all nerf all hybrids they way too powerful atm</div></div><hr />

WHat the above does is help warriors attain aggro better, and keep it better.   I don't know about you but often times, I can get aggro right back for a few seconds....but the mob just turns right back around cause teh SK or the Shammy has the bejeesus DOT'ed out of the mob, and is jsut putting out too much damage for the hate generated by MY damage to keep his atention on me.

<br />
An innate mana/brain stat conversion ability.  Call it whatever.  Anyway, the idea is that the mana pool of every caster in a group increases by 50% of the mana on a warrior's gear.  Also for ever 50 points of combined Int and Wis on a warrior's gear (+30 wis and +20 int for example) the mana regen of every caster goes up by 1.<br />
<br />
Advantages - <br />
Brings utility to a group.  Additional mana and possibly FT always makes casters happy, thus we gain in atrractiveness.<br />
Fixes crappy itemization.  All the mana and int/wis we have been toting around might actually be useful now.<br />
Inherent scalability.  At low levels, the 50% mana is neglibile and won't unbalance lower level groups.  As a warrior progresses, they add more to their group.  In the 60s, a Velious/low PoP warrior will likely give a group a couple hundred mana and maybe FT1.  A Ele/Time warrior could give a group 1k mana and FT 4 or 5.  Not game breaking but certainly attractive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, a new or revised Rampage.  Change the old or add a new AA which allows PCs to Rampage like a mob does.  A chance for a full extra round of attacks on a nearby mob.  There must be a switch on this to turn the ability off and on.</div></div><hr />

I feel that as far as AC and HPs go we are right on the money.  What we need is to return to the the Warrior thier rightful advantage...Warriors should be 2 tiers above the Knights and rangers on the damage table.  Seems like alot but it would put warriors about even with warrior mobs thier same level...higher damage equals more aggro...then our taunt would be just right.  It never made sense to me that we dont do much more than a Knight in armed combat when thats all we have.  Knights and Rangers still have good damage and thier spells and can pull way better than a warrior...maybe have the damage tables based on level so damage goes up as you gain levels...Start classes at basically the same but in long run warrior gains better damage output keeps aggro and becomes useful to groups again not just raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Re-use timer 60 seconds at level 65.  Alternative (or in addition) is to consume stamina and/or mana.<br />

Its not aggro lock, but its not the BS we have now. ( make it every 45 seconds for a refresh and i 100% agree , keep taunt as well and being the only one to do so with the new ability .<br />
<br />
also have a idea for a new disc , basicly a combination for 18 seconds increasing damage with the previous hit and resetting after a miss with your primary weapons . Give it to classes that stand toe to toe with mobs  . 30 min reuse time , doesn't stack with other disc's .<br />
<br />
( and by actually thinking out the entire process warriors with the same buffs as the others should come out ahead do to a higher natural atk and to the fact with low dly weapons would make it add up faster and restart damage faster as well  . Example would be , normal hit 90 , 75 , 80 , 120 miss 100 125 . The actualy damage would be 90 165 245 365 reset 100 225 ect till disc is expired .

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">OK, tell me what you think of this idea. One of our biggest complaints as a class is the fact that we are so dependent on groups for utility, heal and buffs, right? And usually, to overcome a lot of this, pure melee has to spend time or plat to get items with spell-like abilities.<br />
<br />
So why not improve pure melee utility he same way caster classes improve their utility in PoP. What if warriors, rogues and monks were able to turn in parchments to their guild leaders in PoK and get no drop utility casting items with charges that can only be used by Rogues, Monks and Warriors? Something like spell gems with a fixed number of charges, that cast spells like Improved Invisibility, Invisibility to Undead, self buffs similar to Paladin self buffs like haste and Aura of the Crusader (but call it Aura of the Stalwart and give it a health regeneration instead of mana regeration, and it would stack like Brells and SV) and maybe even a heal over time similar to Supernal Elixer. Basically, spells that have utility for self use only (cannot be cast on others), not offensive use. If you turn in an Ethereal Parchment, you would get an item with 20 charges. If you turn in a Spectral Parchment, you get an item with 40 charges. Once all the charges are used, the item goes poof, just like potions.<br />
<br />
SOE could just about introduce this feature in a patch, and allow for a limited test. If it is overpowering, then all they have to do is retract the item at the source. Due to the fact that the item has charges, it will be used up eventually. What think you of this idea?</div></div><hr />

Class AA, Cost: 9pts<br />
<br />
Gives the Warrior a rangeable battle taunt.  Effect is simply instant 500 hate with a 200 maximum range.  Refresh: 1 minute.<br />
<br />
It would be the equivalent of yelling out obscenities and insults at somebody on the battlefield, provoking them to attack you.  As experienced veterans of thousands of battles, don't you think we should be able to piss off some orc verbally without having to be standing on his toes?<br />
<br />
<br />
What it would give us:<br />
<br />
1) It would allow us to chain mobs effectively off pullers (pullers shouldn't be generating more than 500 hate except in unusual circumstances) or pull ourselves without having to have a bow equipped all the time (which most time-equipped tanks don't anymore) or use a charged clicky.<br />
<br />
They only put 1 bow in the PoP glory zone, and that's going to be going to Rangers first.  Not many Warriors even want the time bow, given the stats and effects you can get on the other ranged items there (especially pestillence shock).  Even non-time tanks are presented with a huge array of quality range slot items, only a small percentage of them bows.  Unless you can afford an elemental bow, you're most often going to be looking at sacrificing archery for a range upgrade.  Even with an ele bow, you're constantly passing up HP and AC upgrades to keep your range aggro.<br />
<br />
It's plain stupid to have to swap to a bow (which is extremely awkward under the conditions you have to do it, especially with the laggy nature of the UI) or to use gimmicky clickies (snare pods/puppet strings/forlorn totems/bladestoppers/forlorn scepters/golem wands anyone?) just to aggro a mob at range.  Heck, they just made the clicky option impossible to rely on with the recharge nerf.<br />
<br />
2) It would give us the equivalent of a hate proc (though slightly weaker than EB or Anger 3) at the start of a fight or when taunt fails us at a bad time, without having to wait for the flakey RNG to kick in and proc.  The refresh time would be high enough that you can't just chain the ability to lock aggro, and low enough that you can have the ability at your disposal at reasonable intervals for pulling xp or reclaiming aggro from a wizzy with an unfortunate crit.<br />
<br />
<br />
While it would be tempting to ask for a ranged version of AET, guaranteeing #1 on the hate list from 100 feet away, I think that would be too much.</div></div><hr />

These type of improvements wouldnt be direct, but would be improvements through interdependance of classes.<br />
<br />
Also, instead of necessarily just focusing on +mana pool items beocming +hps, why not look at mana regen?<br />
<br />
Mana Regen could become attack for pure melees.  1 mana regen = 5 attack.  if worn still counts toward worn cap, but would give buffs like KEI-VQ line, and SD line a more uniform appeal<br />
to all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Here are some rough ideas for AA skills that I have been thinking of.<br />
<br />
1. INNATE HASTE AA (Archetype AA, passive, cost 2/4/6)<br />
Adds 5% innate haste per level.  This haste would stack with any other haste in the game up to the normal haste cap if it actually exists.<br />
<br />
2. CHARM RESISTANCE AA (Archetype AA, passive, cost 2/4/6)<br />
Makes the player more resistant to being charmed by 5, 10, and 25 percent.<br />
<br />
3. HATE SHIELD AA (Class AA,  passive, cost 3/6/9)<br />
Adds 10, 25, and 50 unresistable hate to mob every time it strikes you.  This would allow a warrior to tank multiple mobs much easier.  It would also help build up hate on pulls before the slower slows the mob.  Warrior only.<br />
<br />
4. BASH OF THULE AA (Class AA, activated, cost 9)<br />
Allows the next bash to add 250 unresistable hate.  Shield must be equiped.  Refresh time 1 minute.  Modified appropriately by shields with furious bash effect.  Warrior only.<br />
<br />
5. IMPROVED DEFENSIVE AA (Class AA, passive, cost 9)<br />
Allows defensive warrior to do 75 percent of normal (non-defensive) damage while defensive discipline is in effect.  Would also add 10 percent mitigation any time they are equiping a shield while defensive.  Warrior only.<br />
<br />
6. CHARM IMMUNITY AA (Class AA, passive, cost 9)<br />
Makes the warrior totally immune to being charmed.  Pre-requisite must train 3 levels in Charm Resistence AA.  Warrior only.<br />
<br />
7. EXTENDED DEFENSIVE AA (PoP Ability AA, passive, cost 5/10/15)<br />
Extends defensive duration by 1 minute per level.  Pre-requisite must train 1 level in Improved Defensive AA and be level 65.  Warrior only.<br />
<br />
8. HASTENED DEFENSIVE AA (PoP Ability AA, passive, cost 5/10/15)<br />
Reduces refresh time on defensive by 1 minute per level.  Pre-requisite must train 1 level in Improved Defensive AA and be level 65.  Warrior only.<br />
<br />
9. IMPROVED STUN KICK/BASH AA (PoP Ability AA, passive, cost 15)<br />
Adds a 5% chance for kicks, bashes and slams to proc Planar Stun.  Pre-requisite must train 1 level in Bash of Thule AA and be level 65.  Warrior only.<br />
<br />
10. CONCENTRATED STRIKE AA (PoP Ability AA, activated, cost 25)<br />
The next melee hit you land on your target will land for 2 times normal damage and will cause your target such pain that it will be immobilized (rooted in place) for 15 seconds.  This effect will be unresistable unless the target is immune to changes in run speed.  Refresh time 7 minutes.  This AA will also work in conjunction with the Rampage AA, affecting all targets that you hit.  Pre-requisite must train 1 level in Rampage AA and be level 65.  Warrior only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Tettsuo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">This was posted in Monkly-Business and the Safehouse, so I said to myself... what the heck.   Here's my ideas for pure melee class balance.<br />
<br />
I believe the downfall of the pure melee is due entirely to melee not being able to do anything but melee. The pure melee are too static and one dimensional to survive in a system that rewards those that are multifaceted. Every other class in EQ has been given things that add dimension to the class via spells in each expansion. Aside from pure melee, the only other one dimensional class are Wizards (who is truly the top DPS class in EQ). Unless we are given a power boost comparable to Rangers and Wizards, we are doomed to remain second class citizens in EQ.<br />
<br />
The below Bard-like spells are loosely based on an idea from Furor, that he called Stances. The idea is to put these temporary buffs in the Bard buff window, to avoid adding more buffs to an already cluttered buff bar. They will be accessed like discs but will not interfere with disc usage.<br />
<br />
For Monks, Chants. 3 tick Melee &quot;songs&quot; that only affect the group. Multiple Chants from different Monks stack. Effects increase when Monk is sitting.<br />
<br />
Chant of Concentration - mana regen<br />
Chant of Guiddance - AC and regen boost<br />
Chant of Swift Action - Overhaste (will not stack with Bard overhaste)<br />
Chant of Peaceful Dreams - Aggro reduction<br />
Chant of Victory - Attack boost<br />
<br />
For Warriors, it would be called Roars. 3 tick, non-twistable &quot;songs&quot; that affect self, group and target.<br />
<br />
Roar of Power - Stat boost<br />
Roar of Aggression - Adds aggro effect on weapon<br />
Roar of Imtimidation - Cripple effect on the mob<br />
Roar of the Tactician - Increase chance of scoring critical attacks for both spells and melee.<br />
Roar of Zek - Direct aggro (chance of failure)<br />
<br />
For Rogues, it would be called Whispers. 3 tick, non-twistable &quot;songs&quot; that affect self, group and target.<br />
<br />
Whisper of Stealth - Group hide and see invis<br />
Whisper of Deadly Skill - Increase proc rate<br />
Whisper of Dark Magics - Increase power of poisons (will also affect spells)<br />
Whisper of Distraction - Lowers resist of mobs<br />
Whisper of Poisonous Words - Adds poison to entire group's weapons<br />
<br />
Just to add... you cannot start another spell, until the buff initial spell has faded.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some of you will simply refuse to thing outside of the box when it comes to balance. That's the same kind of thinking that has kept Monks (and all pure melee) in the same state we're in now. SoE has been extremely reluctant in increasing melee power, and with good reason. Trivializing all content pre-PoP even more would make the game too easy for new players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>skjalnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Idea for change to discipline mechanics:<br />
<br />
Do away with discipline timers and durations completely.<br />
<br />
The timers/durations would be replaced with a given pool of &quot;inner resolve&quot; (call it what you will), that works similar to the mana bar. Total amount of &quot;inner resolve&quot; can increase with level, or potentially through AA specialization.<br />
<br />
The pool does not regenerate itself at a given rate, as with mana, etc. It is replenished to max every X gameday cycles.<br />
<br />
Disciplines themselves operate as an on/off toggle, rather than fire-and-forget. While activated, the discipline consumes &quot;inner resolve&quot; available within the pool. Once depleted, any active discipline is terminated, and no others can be activated until the pool is refilled.<br />
<br />
Disciplines consume the pool at varying rates, dependent on how powerful they are. For example, it would take 15 minutes for Defensive to exhaust the pool, but Furious would use it all up after 20 seconds. <br />
<br />
To prevent abuse: If a discipline is toggled on longer than the &quot;recommended duration&quot;, rate of resolve consumption is tripled/quadrupled/whatever.<br />
<br />
Make /shield consume &quot;inner resolve&quot; as well, but at a rate much lower than discipline. (Or perhaps the further away you are from a /shielded person, the more resolve it takes to maintain /shield...)<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Hopefully not too bogus an idea. :)</div></div><hr />

weapon speciality,,,,like the caster specilsations...pick a weapon class and as your skill raises ( max 200) you get more dmg and atk and less dly..other weapon classes cap at 100 skill but can be raised by aa points to 200,<br />
<br />
an innate skill to get the best out of hp buffs,,,warriors get 1.5X the benfit of hp buffs and rogues and monks get 1.25X<br />
<br />
reduce all discs to 15 mins or less re use time...to have a 9 second disc and not to be able to use another for an hour is a joke.<br />
<br />
fix critical hits,,,i hate crits that are less than your average damage and stop crit slams and kicks,,,you hit for 250.. you hit for 235.... you critical hit for 30 it sucks.<br />
<br />
weapon mastery   an aa skill that lets warriors use any weapon for any class with the execption of other epics,,,we are supposed to be the master of arms and armour so let us use all.<br />

we need basic class skills to improve us,,,not balancing via equipmet..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Elerion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Posted this in a discussion on my guild boards, but wanted to lob it over and see what you guys think of it as well:<br />
<br />
Balancing tanks is extremely hard. They are just as unwanted in multiples in a group as enchanters and clerics, yet, there are three classes that fill the role as &quot;tank&quot; instead of just one in the other parts of the &quot;trinity&quot; (tank, cleric, enchanter, for the non-old-schoolers). This has been rectified some by making druids and sometimes shamans able to do the cleric's job, and bards and sometimes shamans able to do the enchanters job, but there is still more competition for the tank position.<br />
<br />
Warriors today are no doubt underpowered. I will gladly turn down a 65/0 warrior in favor of a 60 knight for a LDoN, and will take a 65/0 knight over the 65/100 war for PoP xp. Yet, I have been along long enough to remember when paladins and sk's were nearly useless as tanks. In the old days, I as an enchanter tanked better than a paladin, using my color stuns. No joke. <br />
<br />
If we buff warriors too much, knights will very quickly go back to being a third rate option. If we buff warriors too little, they will remain subuptimal as they are now.<br />
<br />
What is important when discussing tank balance, is to be clear on what we actually want. Do we want warriors to be the superior tank in every situation like they used to? Warriors might, but most of us don't. I honestly think it is fine the way it is now, that knights are preferred for xp groups, but warriors are preferred for raid kills. Although of course, that has to be with equal characters, not the way it is now that I prefer a knight five levels lower for some things. Warriors are still by far the preferred raid tank, but paladins and sks have been catching up big because they get as much hp from gear as warriors do, and the innate warriors bonuses drown in the huge amount of raw hp gear. The percentile difference between warriors and knight hp today is ridiculously low.<br />
<br />
What I want to see:<br />
<br />
1. Warriors need a way to build aggro FAST. With a good Paladin or SK tank (or even ranger:)) I can start casting slow before the mob gets to the group, and never get aggro. The cleric will save nearly a whole CH on this, more than making up for the lower hp. She also won't be forced to patch heal me, drawing even more mana. Warriors have to get better at this, although they should probably never be quite as good as knights. Being able to slow before 10 seconds have passed would be cool though.<br />
Suggestion: A 2 minute timer, 5 second duration discipline that turns the warrior bash skill into an auto-hit, 1 second planar stun, 500 (random number, might be completely wrong) aggro bash. Will reintroduce the shield to the game, which would be cool. It would also require skill in the form of ghetto bashing and timing to make sure you hit. Things that reward player skill = good.<br />
<br />
2. Warriors need a SLIGHT improvement in keeping aggro once they have it. This is far less critical than point 1, as most well geared warriors are good enough here imo, as long as the other players in the group know their job. Poorly geared warriors don't have much here though.<br />
Suggestion: The hate shield sounds interesting, particularly in combination with the above skill. This will let poorly geared, probably less skilled warriors use both skills and gain the benefits, without having to do semiadvanced tricks like ghettobashing. I want the hate shield to be less efficient than for instance a BoC/RZtW sword combo though, as warriors with strong aggro weapons do well enough here already, and we want to avoid turning all those weapons into useless junk. Point 4 below MAY remove the need for this improvement.<br />
EDIT: The &quot;hate shield&quot; was an idea from the guild thread (and probably here) where the warrior would get an aggro bonus for each time the mob hit him, much like a damage shield except with aggro instead. This would only apply if the warrior was holding a shield.<br />
<br />
3. Warriors need a bit more hp. The difference between warriors and knights here has shrunk quite considerably. We don't want to give them too much of an advantage either, but a small boost is indeed needed.<br />
Suggestion: No idea. Probably a certain percentage additional increase to the raw hp recieved from items. This requires LOADS of testing and rebalancing though. And if warriors get a 20pct increase that gets lowered to 10pct a week later because it was overpowered, you know they will be screaming NERF!<br />
<br />
4. Warriors need a bit more damage. They are currently outdamaged by knights, which seems just unfair, seeing as knights are better at utility. It didn't use to be like this.<br />
Suggestion: The last few years, two handers have nearly catched up to dual wield in efficiency. Both itemization and the damage bonus changes are the cause of this. I think a simple change exists that may be enough, and almost guaranteed won't be too much, so it can be implemented in the next patch without much to worry about: Apply the damage bonus to the offhand as well. This will help bring dual wield closer to it's former glory, helping the struggling rogues and monks (and non-archery rangers) as well. This is in my opinion the first, riskfree step towards pure melee balancing. After this hopefully gets implemented, we can take another look at warrior damage and see how it stacks up to knights.<br />
<br />
5. Reduce stun aggro slightly. It is just insane. I love it as an enchanter, but it has to be downtuned a bit to bring it more in line with SK aggro.<br />
<br />
Hopefully some combination of the above will bring us to a world where:<br />
- Warriors tank raid encounters significantly better than knights. Heck, I don't mind if they are a must-have class for the main boss. Knights can be offtanks.<br />
- Knights are slightly more wanted as maintank for xp groups than warriors, but a warrior superior in level and equipment will be more wanted than the inferior knight.<br />
- Warriors deal slightly more damage than knights, making them attractive in multiples. Knights will still be at about the same level of attractiveness because of their utility.<br />
- Paladins and SKs are two sides of the same coin, equally useful but still different.<br />
- Ghettobashing is back ;)<br />
<br />
P.S. Ghettobashing, for the new unaware players, is a technique where you switch in a shield in your offhand to bash, then quickly switch your weapon back in. It was frequently used by small race tanks of all levels before kick all but replaced bash from level 55+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Afferon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">First they need to fix Taunt to go off most of the time if not every time you use it. And fix it so ti does more than just move us to the top of the hate list. <br />
Then as someone else already said Summon. If they put summon in with Taunt for warriors over 50 (same as mobs in game) we would be able to jerk the mob right back to us when they turn on a casters. Now somesay that summon would be abused. Not if done right. First make it a low area of summoning like in a group (someone in chat the other night had already come up with a way to abuse it by sending in a rogue to target and assist summon and mob01 is with you so it would have to be a very low radius that it worked in.  Put a lvl cap on it just like taunt. you will only be able to summon mobs that are so many lvls above you this would fix the high end encounters where a warrior could not summon a lvl 70ish mob. <br />
They need to make the refresh resonable as to summon multiple times if a Nuker gets out of hand maybe able to summon on every three taunts or something. This could be a reality becuase it is already in game used by NPC and warrior type NPC at that. And when summoed make it produce a very large amount of hate Tunare knows I hate it when I am summoned.</div></div><hr />

AA True defense trades defensive/evasive for 25% mitigation boost that is permanent.<br />
<br />
Basically the sky is the limit on utility as long as you trade something for it.  By using hp as warriors mana massive utility could be given warriors without many complaints and I think it would be fun for war to have lots of choices to make.  You prolly not gonna get all of above but you can see what you could get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Klomck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">at the risk of flames ill try to post again :) :) <br />
IMO the aggro that knights can generate already nurfs much of the game content. people can unload almost at will as the knights cast their low lvl spells for aggro. <br />
a partial fix, imo, at least for the aggro issue, would be to remove the aggro component (progressively) from spells the mob should consider trivial. with knights having to use their new, high lvl (high mana) spells for aggro, the trade-off between quick kills with downtime and steady pulls would return. <br />
<br />
this doesnt begin to address DPS, hps, or dmg mitigation, i know... <br />
<br />
would people consider this a &quot;knight nerf&quot;? or a bug fix? <br />
<br />
the way i see it, a sub-deity-like (64th lvl mob) creature wouldnt really find the guy behind him casting a weak fear spell that has nearly ZERO chance of doing anything to him cause to turn his back to Billy-Badass-warrior who is hitting him twice as much, and just looks too damn cool to not be the main problem. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Big problem with that Klomck, most of the more easily attainable warrior aggro weapons (those that don't require a raid to get) rely on stun procs and the like to grab aggro.  Unless you exempt procs from the change to spell aggro, this makes all of those weapons useless on high end mobs.  The pure hate procs would still work, but they're tougher to get.</div></div><hr />

Sure we already get that skill as an AA but it should be innate.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Edit: (more ideas)<br />
<br />
Another idea would be to give warriors some new skills, trainable at level 60.<br />
<br />
Weapons Mastery - Gives the warrior total control over his weapons, yielding more accuracy and more damage by directly adds to ATK.<br />
<br />
Armor Mastery - Gives the warrior total control over the armor that he uses, yielding more durability by directly adding to AC.<br />
<br />
Battle Mastery - Gives the warrior more ability to dodge, reposte, and parry incoming attacks.<br />
<br />
It has been said that the Skills that we have been given are &quot;hard coded&quot; and no new skills can be added. How about if we change the Sense Heading skill (Since they already removed its use) into one of the above skills. <br />

<br />
Taunt skill 1-200<br />
Each skill point increases the chance to put the taunter at the top of the agro list by .5%, so by 200 skill there is a 100% chance the skill will work as it does now.<br />
<br />
Taunt skill 150-250<br />
Each skill point of taunt will add +2 points of hate per success OR FAILURE.<br />
<br />
Taunt skill 200-250<br />
Each point of taunt skill will increase the range of the taunt skill by 2 (going off the same range scale as bows and other ranged weapons)<br />
<br />
The cap for warriors should be 200 at level 50, 225 at level 60 and 250 at level 65. How it scales between these levels should be rough linear. The cap for other classes should be around 200, thus knights get some benefit of an improved taunt skill in melee combat, but gain no improvement in ranged agro generation, where, lets face it, they need little improvment.<br />
<br />
@The issue of hitpoints verses knights mainly comes into play towards the end game with elemental and time itemisation. Suggestion, adding (for warriors only) perhaps 1 per stamina point at level 65.<br />
<br />
@Also suggest adding a new aa, Advance physical enchancement to the PoP abilities. This would increase the attribues increased by Physical enchancement by a further 5% (HP, mitigation, avoidance). Cost is 9 points and (obviously) physical enhancement is a prerequisite. (WArrior only)<br />
<br />
@The idea of giving hp in return for mana in gear is a common one, I think it owuld be best done in combination with the previous 2 points so something like 1hp per 5 mana on gear.<br />
<br />
@Add an activated AA ability that reduces damage in return for an increase. Perhaps a ranked system. First rank reduces damage by 5% but hits add the agro that would be generated by the original damage +5%, progressions would be 5%, 10%, 15%, cost would be 3, 6, 9 points.<br />
<br />
@Nerfing Knights isn't the answer to the problem. This merely serves to punish groups who can't find warriors or small guilds who use a class other than a warrior for MT. A while back Druids and Shamen were given limited complete heals, this was a boon for almost everyone, as it meant that a group didn't have to rely on a cleric for the main healer, true clerics were better is a lot of ways, they could rez, and buff hp higher and now they can add partial melee runes to tanks. Thats the way warriors should be balanced. So that a groups best option maybe a warrior in a straight xp group, or perhaps a paladin if they want gorup heals or a shadowknight if they want FD splitting, but not so that a group or raid should be impossible without a member of a certian class. No class should hold a monopoly on any role ever,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Angelcrusha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Ok, so procs are basically our lifeblood, and our crutch. To gain/maintain agro, we almost fully rely on our weapon's to proc. So, why not give the warrior a bonus in this area. I know certain weapons have bonuses and deficiencies in this area, so why can't a class be given these bonuses? <br />
<br />
Basically, I propose that the &quot;masters of all weapons&quot; be proven to be that by giving warriors an innate ability to proc on their weapons more often. Say, a 10-20% improvement, or even an AA that gives us that ability. This would advance us in the hate list by quite a bit, especially if we're wielding EB type weapons. <br />
<br />
Just my suggestion...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">1. Clear HP / Mitigation advantage over knights<br />
<br />
Let's say, warriors get like 500 natural extra HP over a similar equiped pally at lvl 60 (without counting any buffs), those 500 HP would add up to the existing HP advantage warriors already have over paladins... Let's say this current advantage is like 400 hp... 400 + 500 = 900. 900 HP is for sure not going to fix anything but that would actually be noticeable. Let's say warriors get some natural mitigation boost too, like 10% - 15% more better tanking than the actual pally or SK... That too would be actually noticeable. That would boost warriors by a good chunk and make them the really best tank again - attention, I'm not talking here about knight aggro lock. They got it, they keep it, no problem with me. In exchange we get a real noticeable advantage in tanking and keep our real noticeably worse aggro control. Everything has to be tweaked of course, maybe 15% more avoidance and 900hp more than actually is way too much, but a real advantage in those 2 domains has to exist. Maybe the same system as for the AC could be implemented - for instance 100hp on a BP would effectively give 100hp to a hybrid class but 130 to a warrior and 115 to a rogue and a monk.<br />
<br />
2. Itemization<br />
<br />
I'm against the idea of letting the pure melee convert mana on items to hp. All the items with mana on them are clearly designed for hybrids. The problem is not that there is too many hybrid items... The problem is that there is not enough good pure melee items ! This has to be fixed. Why the f... isn't there any warrior / monk / rogue only armor in LDoN ??? Royal attendant armor is certainly nice... but it is for hybrids... WHY ISN'T IT THERE A WAR ONLY armor suit, with stats like str, sta, dex and agi and a shitload of AC, HP and resists ??? screw mana, wisdom and int... we don't need that ! Why aren't there war / monk / rogue only weapons ??? Honestly, not only I blame that but I just don't understand that. The only reason I can think about is that SoE really hates pure melee... Anyway this itemization problem has to be fixed, and by a logical and simple way, without lame tricks.<br />
<br />
3. Versatility<br />
<br />
Remains the problem of the spell book. Some paladins like to say &quot;it's worth crap anyways&quot;... I respectfully disagree, it's worth a lot, so let's talk about balancing it. Let's say warrior's discs get revamped, or replaced by something like &quot;combat styles&quot; that in fact already exist - defensive / aggressive. Let's say we get rid of all the timers on those discs, or make them dependant on the stamina bar, like it has been already said. The warrior can trigger the defensive combat style by just hitting the &quot;defensive&quot; button and stays in defensive mode until he clicks it off or stamina bar goes down, same thing for offensive combat style, and so on. No timers. I already can hear a crowd of knights scream &quot;OVERPOWERING !!!&quot;. Nah, that's far from overpowering. Don't forget that while using defensive, the warrior does only like 50% at best of this normal DPS. Don't forget too that when using aggressive, the warrior eats at least twice the regular damage. This way the warrior could choose what combat style to use depending on situation, and not have to spare that damn /disc defensive thingy for &quot;shit hits the fan&quot; situations. This would add some versatility to the class, and perhaps some fun. The switch time between changing combat styles shouldnt be instant tho, to prevent abusive switching, but it shouldnt be too long. Perhaps 10 seconds or so. Something would be needed to be done for the rogues and the monks too, or the warrior would step on their domain with his new offensive abilities.<br />
<br />
4. Combat system and tactics<br />
<br />
An another very useful improvement could be the ability to taunt and attack multiple mobs at once. This can already be done with AET and Rampage, but it is not reliable enough to become a viable long term combat strategy, the refresh time on both AET and Rampage is way too long (let's be honest : the actual Rampage is a joke). A possible improvement would be to give to warriors some form of lesser AET that would not be a AA and have a chance of failure. Let's say warriors would get it at lvl 51. It would have the same reliability that the current taunt has but would work in a small radius around the warrior. So, if a silly caster nukes a mob that is not actually being attacked by the warrior but just stays on him because the warrior used successfully his &quot;lesser&quot; AE taunt, there is still a chance the mob would immediately jump the caster. On the other side, after some firmly established aggro, casters could use AE spells on the mobs around the warrior, they couldnt chain cast AE like mad but still could use them with care. Well you get the picture I hope. With that new skill, having a warrior would be a real option in a group without mezzer. Example - bad pull occurs, warrior &quot;lesser&quot; AET 4 mobs, uses an improved Rampage and switches to defensive combat style... here's your CC. The drawback would be that with 4 mobs pounding on the warrior, the cleric better be awake, and the eventual backup healer too. Plus that would require some skill (timing, positioning...) and provide actually some fun. Refresh time on Rampage could be lowered to a point where it would actually become really useful - maybe a refresh time of 10 seconds, so the warrior could AE taunt all the mobs around and give a round of attacks to all of them to keep them focused on him; to not overpower too much warrior's DPS, the total amount of damage could be shared between all the targets (if normal hit is 100, and there are 3 mobs around, each gets hit for 35 or something like). Riposte, dodge and parry would keep working as they actually do.<br />
<br />
5. Bonuses<br />
<br />
And, in addition to the mentioned above, &quot;they&quot; could also add some cool tricks to all pure melee classes, including warriors of course. Those would not be major upgrades but some little things of the type of /shield. They could be an upgraded kick, a real bash (more damage / more chance to stun and for a longer period of time), so using a shield would actually be a viable option. Plus there should be a chance of totally block a hit when using a shield (that would benefit to the knights as well). Critical hits should be fixed (a crit shouldnt be lower than a regular hit imo). And maybe a couple of &quot;special&quot; triggered attacks, in the line of what someone here suggested (focused attacks that could have an effect... great idea IMO). Bind wound cap could be raised for all melees to something around 150hp / bandage with max skill (80hp presently), that would give them some decent solo abilities, and let them at least be of some use on downtimes. Some emergency skill or utility, like a direct HP transfer to a party member usable once an hour or so would be cool too. Or maybe a &quot;super /shield&quot; working on all the party members in a certain radius around the warrior and allowing him to take aggro and 100% of the inflicted damage with an additional 50% cost, usable once an hour. In certain situations, this could give the evacer the time needed to finish casting the evac spell for instance. Or let the mezzer perfom one or two extra mezzes. Or let the cleric / pally cast one or two group heals.<br />
<br />
All the ideas I've submitted would need of course serious tweaking and testing, but if only the half of that was ever implemented, I'd be happy. What's your opinion ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Hulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Just had another idea, since warriors are supposed to be masters of all weapons why are there no warrior specific weapons? We should have an arsenal of war only weapons because a lot could be done with weapons. A bola for instance could snare a mob while 3 bolas entwined around a mobs legs could root it. A bola with a long cord pinning a mobs arms to its torso should slow it until it works itself free. Different cord lengths could affect mobs differently. By adding a few weapons and some underlying leather armor our utility in groups along with our ac/hp gap could be fixed. I really do not wish to see the &quot;hybridization&quot; of warriors and believe most of our utility/agro/ac and hp issues can be resolved through weapons and gear that only warriors have access to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Lionk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Here is a copy of what I sent in :<br />
<br />
Good afternoon,<br />
<br />
I am compelled to write due to my frustration of the Warrior's lack of aggro, and the perceived continued decline of the best tank class in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
****/rant on****<br />
I have been playing for over 2 years now and the Warrior is my main character. I have about 112 days played on him, and have felt the need to create alts to further enjoy the game to get away from being too frustrated with my warrior.<br />
<br />
I have seen the improvements to the other classes over the years, and as far as tanks go, I am very pleased with the work done with the Paladins and Shadowknights. I think they are where they should be now.<br />
<br />
However, as a Warrior, I have seen little change or improvements on Warriors as a whole.<br />
<br />
Now as I progress further towards the highest part of the game, I see Warriors, Paladins, and Shadowknights sharing the same armor for the most part, with the exception of cultural. However even with Cultural, they are very close in AC or HP. I say close meaning 5 to 10 AC and 10 to 50 HP per item.<br />
<br />
I have no clue about how the code/database rules on hitpoints, armor class, damage avoidance/mitigation effect each tank class. However the meekly higher warrior items seem irrelevant when mobs are hitting them for 500 to 1500 a whack and Paladins and Shadowknights equally leveled and equipped have 50 to 500 hitpoints less than the Warrior. Most importantly, what good is the higher AC/HP damage avoidance/mitigation for the Warrior class when you can not get aggro or keep aggro in an encounter?<br />
<br />
Sure, I can grind out 150 AAs at about an hour to an hour and a half per AA to help increase this as a level 65 Warrior, but what about the poor pre 60 warriors who are prohibited to obtain these AAs until they are post 60 or 63 in some cases for the better AAs?<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.&quot;<br />
****/rant off****<br />
<br />
<br />
As a professional IT Consultant, I realize the items issue is probably to save on costs at the development level, database size, traffic etc. Therefore my Warrior class recommendations are as followed for aggro and class improvements:<br />
1.) Recode Taunt to work a lot more often, did I mention a lot more often? This would be based on lvl of PC/NPC and skill. As a 65 Warrior with maxed Taunt skill, I do not feel I should have to hit Taunt 5 times then have to hit Area Taunt and still not get aggro aggro off my group's Shaman. Paladins and SKs get instant aggro lock with a quick spell( I like this and do not think that should change, I would just like to see equality in the ability to generate aggro for Warriors).<br />
<br />
2.) Provide more aggro weapons for Warriors only with higher hate generation that is easier to obtain for mid to upper levels.<br />
<br />
3.) Improve Warrior damage avoidance and mitigation from lvl 1 to 65. This would increase obviously with lvls, agility and stamina, and higher AC bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let me know what are the plans, and time frames to make the following statements a reality once again?<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Having read so many threads over time and given a lot of thought to it...<br />
<br />
Making Warriors distinct from Knights in there tanking ability:<br />
<br />
Increase HP passively through increasing our HP/Level and/or HP/Stamina so that a distinct difference exists between us and Knights.<br />
Ensure that there is a distinct difference between Warrior mitigation AND avoidance and that of the Knights. A knight should take enough more damage than a warrior that it is an issue for an exp group working at their &quot;high end&quot; that there is a choice to be made.<br />
<br />
If Sony were not prepared to go that far then I would go for a change to aggro on top of whatever half way change made to the above.<br />
<br />
Either add a second raw aggro component to taunt for warriors on a separate chance to succeed or add a second taunt skill purely for warriors that generates raw hate.<br />
<br />
Ideally I would like to see our taunt left alone if at all possible. I LIKE the challenge of holding aggro. Similarly I would not like to see mana usage for warriors. It would just mean more items with mana on that the knights can benefit from. Make the coders make genuine warrior items. If the knights want to wear those 200ac pants let them get no wis/int and mana from them.<br />
<br />
Finally untie the defensive disciplines - all 4 of them - from the offensive ones with a small timer between switching from one type to the other, maybe 1 minute. Most of our discs go to waste as it stands. The only times I use offensive discs now are when I KNOW I won't need my defensive ones. Hell I used up fellstrike for some added dps when we were behind on a slaughter mission in LDoN the other night then 2 minutes later found myself tanking 5 mobs with just a shaman to heal me.<br />
<br />
There are other changes I think should be made but they are not issues exclusive to warriors. Mainly they involve AA's that seem a waste, such as Warcry. I won't touch it with a bargepole til I have maxed out all resists and charisma (around 420 aa's for me as things stand) but if it were cheaper or more effective I would buy it right off. Same could be said for the class bind wound skill - a HUGE waste of points. But as I said all classes have this problem and it is something that I see as being an across the board fix to AA's at some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Blobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Hm, iam playing from the beginning of EQ. And i really like him.<br />
<br />
I dont want to have instant aggro. When iam tanking a Boss Mob i want to have the feeling, that i play good. I engange in the right moment and will hit my AE-Taunt exaclty when its needed. I dont overaggro when iam second on MT list and so on. You all killed Bossmobs without an upgrade and it worked. <br />
<br />
A Pali tanked Quarm. Why not? In the Eq manual never stood a war is the only class to tank a bossmob.<br />
<br />
I like to have Hybrids instant aggro and a Warrior for aggro overtime. Iam a Maintank, not Mainassist.<br />
<br />
I like to see:<br />
<br />
Give Taunt Bonus to lower level Warriors and some more aggro Weapons. As a Raidwarrior in Elemental Planes i dont have an aggro Problem, but the exp Warrior in a smaller Guild has it.<br />
<br />
I dont want more and more Hps. It would imbalance the game. Perhaps give 6 Stamina instead of 4 after 255.<br />
<br />
I more like to see a side effect on Enraging Blow or better Anger. It shouldent just make aggro, it should have a DD, Stun, Lifetap, Root, Snare or something like that. Hybrids have less Hp but can upgrade em self with nice Rune or Lifetap Augments which give em in the end more or same Hps. We only get a stupid aggro increase.<br />
<br />
Seperate defensive and offensive Discis.<br />
<br />
I like the endurance/mana Abilities people talk about. <br />
<br />
Give Warriors a real Migration. <br />
A 105 Damage blow hits Wars only for 100, we will no longer get max hits from front/standing.<br />
<br />
Slightly more DPS for pure melee Classes. (EB proc is a DD with 700 aggro, Anger a Lifetap with 600 aggro perhaps)<br />
<br />
Change this snare clickers. I want to have one without charges but then it should be like a mod rot, you can use it once a minute or so.<br />
<br />
I really hope they give us warriors only a few new things, i dont want to have trivial aggro or more DPS than other Classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Zhenobia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Here are my ideas... my apologies if they have already been better stated previously.<br />
____________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Skills <br />
-Taunt.  Upgrade so that a warrior can hold aggro<br />
-Disarm.  Upgrade so that once a MOB is disarmed it doesn't hit as hard as it did when armed.<br />
-Kick.  Shouldn't max out so quick on certain races.<br />
-Shield.  Needs to last longer, several minutes as apposed to several seconds.<br />
-New passive skills.  Lets have a few goals to look forward to throughout the 30's, 40's and 50's.  <br />
-New active skills.  What about Warcry? <br />
<br />
Disciplines<br />
Not sure if this counts as a discipline... but not sure where else to put it:<br />
Allow warrior HP to regenerate quicker while mounted, and also allow Warrior to bind wound while mounted.  <br />
This would be balanced, since at present casters can regen mana faster while mounted, and cast spells while mounted.  <br />
At present mounts have few benefits for warriors other than enabling them to run slightly faster without sow<br />
<br />
<br />
Advancement<br />
- Definateltely upgrade available equipment with Melee Focuses and Effects<br />
- Make new Items Warriors get through quests and drops.<br />
- Advance the Damage Tables.<br />
- Upgrade the Warrior's Status(Mitigation, HP, AC, STA etc...)<br />
- Bring in New caps to skills (Taunt, Kick, Parry etc...) as well as Specializations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">ok how about this? since pallys have snap agro with their stuns why dont you create AA's for warriors only that start at 51 for a class ability called lets say &quot; Enraging Stun&quot; which works like this.... goes from ES 1 to 5 each time you gain a lvl of ES it goes up 20% (also the refresh rate for kick bash, slam should be brought down to 2 sec)  lets say ES1 is 20% of chance of a 5 sec stun landing to x-mob (using kick, bash or slam) and ES1 if landed would be also generating 100 hate. now if you have ES5 that would give you 100% of 5 sec stun landing and it generates 500 hate as well. That IMO would solve snap agro probelms and make warriors once again king of Tanks.<br />
<br />
Now since we are such heavy melee . dmg mitigation should be increased ALOT, for instance.... Combat stability instead of the meager increases it gives warriors should go to 10,  20 and 30% dmg mitigation increase across the boards for warriors. and on disc the only one that should be fixed IMO is defensive.... instead increase its usage to 5 min but keep its refresh time and change it to where we dont get our dmg cut in half yet we still recieve 50% less dmg for the duration.  Honestly we should actually be able to do alot of dmg facing a mob because ..... we are taking the punshiment from the mob. PoP and up encounters demand that warriors have dps for agro issues and quite frankly i wanna be able to kick some ass and take some names and not just be a &quot;meat shield&quot; <br />
<br />
Lastly to correct the issue of HP- AC difference between Warriors, and Pally's Sk i think Planar Endurance should be changed for a warrior only which give us a total of 25% overall boost in base hp and base AC after ND3<br />
<br />
i dont wanna address  the taunt button because quite frankly it sucks and you would have to rewrite taunt for alot of classes to get it to work rite and it wont be an issue once warriors can aquire snap agro like mentioned above<br />
<br />
pls give me your comments and let me knowwhat you think of my proposal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>AGRYMCBASH</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">wow, you guys all got great ideas. i hope the powers that be are reading these. <br />
Something that really irritates me is pet aggro - if im tanking next to a pet and wanna pull a mob out of a corner or off a wall or something, im getting hit, i should not have to duel a pet for the chance to drag the mob where i want him. <br />
my idea is i think pretty simple, add a tad bit more hate to beg, slam, kick and disarm. let aggro from the focus person be increased in a linear fashion, with an appropriate decay over time. this would keep aggro for the one tanking a bit better. now obviously should the value decay below the hate value of a snare, dot, slow, debuff etc, the tank could lose his aggro and have to chase after said mob. thats where the additive values of the taunt, slam/kick, disarm and beg would allow the tank to regain aggro in very shourt order, since the added value of these 4 operations would be greater than the hate value of the spell cast. maybe im simplistic, but this idea doesnt sound very hard to implement, and could be a resolution to the problem of warriors and taunt. <br />
the idea of special attacks and paying close attention in order to take advantage of the openings as they are presented really interests me. but make them a challenge - 2 seconds is a long time, 10 seconds? jeez what are you afk? and as far as keys go, hmmm.. talk about looking for a reason to gripe. <br />
what really pains me is the idea that a ranger could tank a mob on the elemental level, that is just wrong... unless he was chain runed and had a crew of clerics CH-ing, that should not be allowed by the games mechanics. A pally or an SK should be able to, but come on, a ranger is like a rogue - DIEING to avoid catching aggro., it seems to me that these higher level encounters need some attention, since taking anything away from any classes would cause considerable anguish. <br />

They say there will drop booklets with skills to larn in.<br />
Will Sony once again suck up to ubarguilds and make all good skill only available in PoTime? Or will they, this time at least, remeber that 95% of their playerbase is not in an Ubarguild?<br />
Cause being stuck with useless skills as I am not raiding in PoTime would make me quit my warrior<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">i dont care about agro. i dont care about dps. i would be happy with one thing. <br />
<br />
give us 25 percent improved damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
why? 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1) we all know the only reason sony introduced non-stunable non-snarable types of mobs was because casters picked up on the idea that tanks are nothing more than manna sponges and that all caster groups are more logical. all you need to do is snare and kite right?<br />
<br />
well in the old days melee used to actually have a purpose other than holding agro. it used to actually be a way of getting experience. it isnt anymore at the high levels. it needs to be brought back.<br />
<br />
2) why shouldnt warriors mitigate 25 percent more than palladins? palladins get manna! rangers get manna! (ok give rogues and monks mitigation too that makes sense. but its not fair they get manna AND can tank as well as a class with no manna. the whole concept is grossly unbalanced.  did i mention that clerics have a heal 20 percent more manna efficient than their nearest competitor? did i mention that wizards get a nuke 20 percent better than their nearest competitor? shouldnt a class with no manna get 20 percent better mitigation?<br />
<br />
screw the agro. we arent agro machines thats a caster's unfortunate problem. let palladins be the agro king among tanks but let the warrior be the mitigation king. give us 25 percent mitigation. then we will be balanced.<br />
<br />
then groups will have a choice. they can be lazy and take a pally and nuke till they drop but have to do 25 percent more heals. or they can take a warrior and deal with it but enjoy the (finally) viable tanking against higher level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Beatn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">IMO, there are 2, and only 2 major areas that need be looked at. #1, and most important I think, is agro.  For the love of god, warriors need to be able to take agro better!  #2 is mitigation.  We're warriors, let us kick ass.  Ya Ya I know we already do :D  But I want to kick more ass!  I know this is not a new concept, been talked about for how many years now?  Ehh well, lets just see what they have in store for us in the near future.</div></div><hr />

Join me and together we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Traask</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Since we've been listened too thus far, I'd like to share my thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) Innate Melee ability against inferior foes (Greens) - I'd like to see a massive increase in damage against these foes.<br />
<br />
2) Convert +Mana Items to +AC and +HP items, but at a 50% convertion penalty<br />
<br />
I dont know about the hate list, but I REALLY would like to know who the mob has at the top of his list. Its not like I cant find out by turning on combat spam... but it would be really nice to see &lt;Player_being_owned&gt; under the mob name<br />
<br />
And yes... a visible emote for taunts would be great... Traask Taunts a Crystalline Golem. Be even nicer if they put in about 20 random taunts &quot;Traask questions a Crystalline Golems Parents Marital Status&quot; &quot;Traask points at a Crystalline golems manhood, and guffaws&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">1) I agree.  It would certainly allow warriors some of the flexibility of every other class in terms of being able to move through areas filled with vastly inferior foes.  Heck, I'd even be happy if aggro/assist radius could be further lowered for very green mobs with respect to a high level warrior based on the difference in levels.<br />
<br />
2) I doubt they'd do this, although I'd certainly be happy if they did.  The unbalancing bit would be that most warriors would instantly jump up in tanking ability by a significant margin.  I'd be less surprised to see a new AA with the ability to convert various percentages of mana into a useful stat (hps?  ac?), with more levels of this ability granting a better conversion rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Kalamurv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">I'd like to see a cap put on the number of taunt fails in row, say 5 fails then next taunt is no fail regardless, frustrating failing 20+ times in a row =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>OldMerc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I think we are good as we are.   Why are we stuck in class envy.   I can't read two posts in a row here without hereing junk about the hybrids as usual.   imho we should be talking about either stacking tanks in groups or talking about balanceing melees and hybrids to the solo-ing caster classes.   We fight over the scraps and never see thanks giveing feasts that are in perpetual motions.    I've yet to see a average group with a warrior or sk or pal tank able to grind like a average druid or wiz or necro or ench.<br />
<br />
IMHO all classes should grind roughy the same amount of exp as any other class should be able to do.   imho  solo-ists should actualy grind slower then groups because working in a group takes more skill/time then solo-ing pound per pound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">you wanna know who's on the top of the hate list?<br />
<br />
target the mob and /assist, you'll find out quick enough.<br />
<br />
while you you got him targeted, slap a /shield on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">That is a good way to find out who's going to be beaten.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is a good way to get that mob targetted again, though.  Here's an example of when this would be valuable: Puller brings 2 or more mobs back, all of the same/similar look and name... chanter sets about locking down the adds while you go to work tanking up the first mob... you notice you're not taking damage and assist the mob... you now have the enchanter targetted (and sure, drop a shield on him)... now, at this point I would generally have to wait to see which mob was swinging and use the mouse to target him manually, as the chanter probably *doesn't* have the main mob targetted.<br />
<br />
For situations like that (which are pretty common in grind groups) I'd love to be able to tell who the mob is beating on.<br />
<br />
Or, as a refinement to that idea, be able to make a hotkey that shields the person who the mob is currently beating on, so long as it isn't yourself of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>JAFFO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">As a cleric I am of course conserned about the ability of my tank to prevent the mobs from beating the fuck out of me :) Which I think I have found a solution to that, while at the same time adding utility to warrior class.<br />
<br />
1. Warrior /shield like ability allows the warrior to use a disc like abilty that. Which will place a buff in the short duration buff box on the tgted cleric or another class. <br />
2. What this buff would do is transfer all hate generated from the tgted PC to the warrior.<br />
<br />
  Think about it, warrior_01 /shield buffs the cleric, on inc shaman slows and gets agro the cleric begins to cast SR on shaman, the warrior is thus gaining the hate from those heals. The NPC AE's the group the cleric cast's group heals thus the warrior gets that hate. After a few fast heals and groups heals ontop of the warrior taunting and stuff, he would have enough hate generated that i don't think a wizzard could draw agro from him.<br />
<br />
  Another use would be to add this buff to the group wizzard, on inc the shaman slows and the wizzard cast's his largerest nuke, warrior gains the hate from the nuke thus preventing shaman from ever drawing agro, from that point on the wizzard could go nuke happy all the time adding hate to the warrior :)<br />
<br />
  Since this buff could be added to any PC, it would offer alot of utility to the warrior class, on a raid have X warriors = to X chain clerics each warrior adding the  buff to a different cleric, the MT buffing the cleric assigined to first heals to prevent the MOB from agroing onto clerics before the warrior has solid agro. This would be one disc that would add alot of utility to warriors, at the same time it would fix the issue you all had conserning raid stacking since you would want the same number of warriors as you have clerics. :) <br />
<br />
   P.S. Just a suggestion. I understand that thier are flaws and the possibility of this being overpowered but i am sure yo all could take this and fix it to the correct level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Poosha, there's a hotkey to switch between your current and previous target. Check your options window for what it's bound to - I have remapped mine to tab and don't recall the default. So when I have assisted the mob to find who it is currently beating on, I just press tab and get the mob as target again.<br />
<br />
As for the shield refinement, I have created a hotkey reading <br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
So to shield my targets target, I just press shield hotkey followed by tab and I've shielded some poor schmuck and is back to beating on the mob usually losing no combat rounds.</div></div><hr />

I've been told at best, Taunt is 50/50 pass/fail... if that is so, then why the heck do we bother with getting a 250+ taunt?<br />
<br />
I'm tired of failing up to 5 taunts in a row... then being told i suck at tanking when half my group dies.<br />

<br />
Rally Cry or something, where you would then be the focus of the groups agro for 10 seconds or so. Naturally the mob in question, according to it's intelligence of course, would want to take out the leader of the Rally.<br />
<br />
or just individuals<br />
<br />
/rally (roguename)<br />
<br />
for 10 seconds whatever aggro the rogue generated i would add to my own.<br />

Perhaps just make it a % chance to work, or have it on a 15min refresh.<br />
Would be nice for those times when you get really low HP, and can't decide whether to hit furious or wait for the heal thats about to land, would also add dps &amp; taunt.</div></div><hr />

We are warriors after all, the very essence of melee.<br />
<br />
Also make some of these weapons we share with Palidorks and Shadowknights, warrior only.<br />
<br />
warrior equipment overlaps sooo much with palidorks, no wonder they get upset.<br />
