If you have a sec, could you go over how you guys do Tallon?  We've given 3 good attempts at the RZtW script but just can't get past fake Tallon.  Some choob either over agro's and gets him into the main raid and we all go down like a house of fallen cards or the Knight cornering up the hall dies and Tallon comes and eats the clerics before the SA take over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the way we do him, is to have a knight corner him in the hall, get the clerics close to him, but behind a pillar so they are shielded from his AE.  once assist is called, max melee or bows with pets being chain cast.<br />
<br />
when we killed him last night, our knight was killed before he was half dead, but our MA jumped in with AE taunt and brought it under control for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We do TZ the same way we do cursed.  Warrior tanks him and everyone else stands far back and plinks at him with arrows and stuff :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">get the clerics close to him, but behind a pillar so they are shielded from his AE. <br />
<br />
Walls in tactics dont shield ae - the reason you clerics arent getting hit is because the ae is targeted &amp; has range 30ft from the target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We use two tanks to share agro (thanks to his agro debuff).  The rest of the raid ranged attacks him/nukes him.  Over agro is fun =)  Though we did have to restart the script once b/c of over agro.<br />
<br />
Grats on the RZ kill!  I still think thats a fun encounter.  Also, I'm pretty convinced that BoW's are a myth =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm pretty convinced that BoW's are a myth =)<br />
<br />
<br />
We've killed RZ twice and both times he dropped a BoW and gorget<br />
/shrug I guess that's the least RZ could give us with as much XP he got kicking our asses before we finally killed em for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Walls in tactics dont shield ae - the reason you clerics arent getting hit is because the ae is targeted &amp; has range 30ft from the target.<br />
<br />
i did not know that.  then again, im not the one making the decisions on where to place people, i just fall in line and plink with my arrows until they are gone, then max melee him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you don't want to range fight TZ from RZ script, a knight to tank will hold aggro via spells due to the slow.  Have all melee fight at max melee as if it's an AE rampage mob.  Everyone needs to control their aggro, otherwise he turns and nails a good chunk of the raid with the 3k DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">except for RZtW i think VZ is the hardest part of that event, our pullers never seem to get VZ either without his guards or without him leash snapping, alot of splitting mobs = alot of death<br />
<br />
RZ event is already wearing out and weve only tried rz 3 times, 70% then 30% then 6%. god i want him dead and for him to drop 10 BoWs so we dont have to do him again for a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh it was always terrible when we placed our clerics near the MA because there's a little lag spike when the script starts and if you have them too close they can eat the AE in the beginning.  I really think the best place for them is to stand almost way back by the stairs, utilizing the range on SR(240 with ER4)   The whole raid basically stands back there by the stairs at first till the knight is able to lock it well then move the raid in to work TZ into the corner.<br />
<br />
Did RZ a few times in the past week after a few months of not doing him.  The melee box on him seems so small now but the AE ramp range has been adjusted to accomadate it.  Lately we've been trying to figure out ways to corner tank stuff, what illusions will fit and such as we have ogres as our main tanks.  Seems usually NDT unshrunked works well but our MA couldn't get RZ to corner right.  Oh well though, just turn him and pinned him with his side/somewhat of his back still sticking out so it worked fine.  Triple shunk ogre doesn't seem to work anymore neither does a shrunk NDT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I liked the Vallon Zek fight. I was not the MT but me and some other people got to pretend to be MT's hehe. Plus thats when i get my first planar wepon/gear. Have yet to try RZ and such. We are working our way to the big badasses. Have taken most of the lower raids.<br />
   Grats on kill tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We have killed RZTW I think 5 times now. Seen 2 BoW's. Both off the same kill  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As a note, he drops a BoW like 20% of the time as I recall. There was a thread in the Overlord's Sanctuary about it a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">3 for 3 on BoWs, he's been nice to us than it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Axercis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Could someone share your method of handling adds during RZtW fight? We have had 1 success RZtW kill under our belt but our recent attempts were ruined by pit adds. On our success run we had full raid, but normally we have 60 in raid tops. Our latest attempt we got RZtW to 30% but all of our kiters died by then and we got swarmed by adds. We are mostly equipped with Ssrae, VT, &amp; ornate gears. More people in raid for higher dps output'd be the simple solution but I am looking for a more reliable method to handle adds. We usually have a kite group made with bard, knights, and ranger/druid. Once RZtW is pulled to raid kiters'd start running circles in same direction. Since adds now run at bard speed, out running them with SoE isn't possible. Next time we'll probably have kite team wait outside until RZtW gets pulled, then have bard play longest duration run speed song before kite team zones back in to kite adds. Hopefully that will buy us additional minute or so to finish RZtW. If anyone has a reliable method of handling adds, I'd love to learn about it. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Qanadil Soulblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">use FOE instead of SOE because it is 5% faster.  The rest is pretty much luck =/.  Maybe having more kiters might help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't understand why people are so afraid to kill the adds as they spawn. Keep healing your tank on RZ, use your pets and all the rest of the raid on the adds, once all 4 waves are dead, plow RZ, easy win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Use a knight to tank on Tallon.  Use health of target's target to see who steals aggro and deduct 10 dkp every time they do it.  Or at least make sure that everyone understands that TZ isn't a fight to rush on.  Tell everybody to be careful, be conservative, and don't pull aggro on pain of death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Fulorian, are you saying that a maximum of 4 waves will spawn, no matter how long RZTW lives?  This is news to me, when did this change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sounds like he's thinking of time RZ, not the tactics one. Time RZ adds are a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lilrik77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well we killed RZTW 2 times now first time we got BoW and neck second time we got 2 pair of boots.<br />
 The way we do it is we have a shaman Tank TZ chain casting slow. We have a Pally as ST on him. Anyay Shaman calls attack on for 20secs attack off for 10secs first couple of times we did the event we had a few people die on TZ now we have the same 3 or 4 people that dont listen and use Max meele and get eaten by the ae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We had all the kiters sit outside until it's time to engage, then rush with selos about 10 seconds after we engage... helped a lot it seems.<br />
<br />
We're 3 BoW outta 4 kills, so he been nice to us :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vardisk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">haha.. just wait till your officers decide to make your guild farm him for BoWs. We've killed him 16 times now cause of it... Gotten 7 BoWs, too bad only 4 are still in the guild =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">With the new collision changes, rangers are now an AWESOME dps addition to downing the warlord.  Yes, you can plink him to death in that corner now.  My guild is blessed with a ten ranger minigun crew, all with high attendance, and they simply lore the living FUCK out of Rztw with their Trueshot disc.  On top of the 9-10 charmed pets we had (druids can charm the boars or something), he was dead not a few seconds after the second waved spawned.  The first wave didn't even spawn until he was at 60%.  <br />
<br />
Heh, we even cleaned the adds out of the pit while we were at it.  =)<br />
<br />
Dropped a Blade of War and Collar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">And like 5 of those bow's were within the first 4 or 5 kills, vard =P Yes farming him is a bish!<br />
<br />
Only advice I can give ya is lots of pets (charmed) and full dps off the bat to take him down... Unless youre killing waves as they spawn, if more than like 2 waves spawn you're pretty much toast unless you get lucky.  For Tallon, what everyone else said, have 2 knights on him and everyone else ranged fight. It'll be a long fight but it's really easy if no one pulls aggro.</div></div><hr />

Its been a pretty long time since they made RZTW have a maximum of 4 waves of adds, and there was a firestorm on the 'gimping' of RZ immediately after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Can anyone else verify that there are only 4 waves of adds?<br />

I could swear we saw 6 waves in February.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">i cant verify as the 4th wave always got us on all of our failures</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Vardisk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Thought waves of adds were timed.... Longer you took, more waves you got. Like, if you survived long enough, you could get 50 waves of adds (then shakerpage them omfg har)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">1 BoW for 3 kills.  <br />
<br />
As for TZ, we have a pallie tank him, all other melee at max range (as mentioned above, we fight like he's an AE Rampager) and like Brutal said aggro-control is a must. Have heard of some guilds trying to time the AE but people there said it was a cluster so we don't bother with it. There is always 1-2 people that get too close or the odd nuker that over does it, but we had something like 3 deaths on TZ on the last 3 runs.</div></div><hr />
