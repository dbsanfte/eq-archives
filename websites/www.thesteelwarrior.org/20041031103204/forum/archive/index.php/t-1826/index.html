<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stryiderxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, been having problems keeping agrro lately off the ranjas and pallys, currently lvl 52, have a jade mace in prim and a defiance in sec, thinking bout dropping the defiance for a offhand that will generate more aggro. question is what should i go with? that is in the range of 9k. bbot, ven axe, and snowchipper are the only ones i know of. any help would be appreiciated. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buy a Frostbringer.<br />
 Frosty main and BBoT off. Problem solved</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gravdiger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I Must agree on the Frostbringer, very nice Weapon, it helped my Agro Holding alot when I bout it<br />
<br />
I used <br />
<br />
Barnacle Covered Axe (+100 to Hate)<br />
<br />
Frostbringer <br />
<br />
Combo and did pretty good with agro, up tioll getting epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would grab a Frostbringer as fast as possible.  The proc is very good aggro and 12/22 is respectable DPS as well.  I would also consider something with a better ratio and/or proc for offhand.  BBoT is a good aggro proc, light on DPS but warriors usually are without insane raid weapons.<br />
<br />
Heck, in offhand, club of the ice ocean should be better DPS than jade mace, better ratio and proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For agro I currently use FB main hand and BCA off.. works like a charm about 99% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a similar situation and have heard all the talk about the Frosty.  I don't have that much trouble holding aggro yet, but I anticipate it soon...and with no proccers its gonna get worse.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions as to a better main/offhand combo?  I don't want to part with both weaps if possible (Falchion of Storms/Primary, Swiftblade of Zek/Secondary) but want to prepare for upcoming aggro needs.<br />
<br />
I have been looking at a Wavecrasher for a while now and thought the slow proc might be a nice taunt...but wanted to get the opinions of the many.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 When I had one paired with my Frosty I tested it alot. Frosty Proc = sometimes mobs turned to you, Ykesha Proc = most of the time the mob turned to you.  Very similar price range, and if you have a deity ( Cazic or RZ ) you can get the deity version which is 12/21. I sold my frostbringer after a few weeks and bought another smithed-yak. <br />
<br />
They served me well until I got to 61/62 and got my current weapon.<br />
<br />
Just another option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Judin,<br />
I wouldn't switch untill you actually have trouble taunting.  Those are both very nice weapons for DPS and should last you a while.</div></div><hr />

The smithed versions are similar in cost to a Frosty?  I am Rallos Zek so that would be  a nice one there!  (12/21).  Anyone know the exact names of the smithed ones?  If they aren't too expensive I may have to try one out :)<br />
<br />
Macnair, you're advice is probably best.  I don't seem to have any trouble right now and I've spent too much already!  I guess I'll just keep my options open but go with what I have now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice guys!</div></div><hr />

 Effect: Snare<br />
 <br />
Type: Random <br />
<br />
<br />
This was a wonderful weapon until I replaced it...<br />
<br />
Allakhazam gives it a price tag of 30K - but it's really not too dificult a weapon the get... Drops off one of the named Sarnaks in the Library in Chardok (on the way to Royals)<br />
<br />
Blade of strategy is what I replaced this with in offhand...<br />
<br />
Snare can't really hold a candle to Hate procing weapons and EB weapons, but until then, this is a nice aggro weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not as if you're getting picky, or anything. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks again for the info, its great to get advice directly from other tanks...instead of...say...know-it-all Gnome Necro's!  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klomck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used frostbringer/club of the ice ocean from lvl 50 till epic... aggro generation cant be beat for that price, imo. club procs like mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not all procs are equal, fwiw. Club is a pure damage proc, basically you're getting extra agro from the extra dps, but that's it. Frosty is a debuff proc, so you're getting lots of agro there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Klomck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Didnt mean to imply that it did. the frosty turns the mobs almost every time. the club proc just looks really cool =)</div></div><hr />
