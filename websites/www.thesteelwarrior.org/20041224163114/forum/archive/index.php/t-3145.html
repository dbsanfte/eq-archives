The types augments I want are hit points Armor Class and Enraging Blow type stuff for weapon procs.  From vendors I can see a +40 hp aug in East Commons I will definately use but it is limited to only a few gear types (Head arm chest legs feet).  In Butcherblock there is a +10 AC aug I can use on various slots that won't take a the 40 hp HP aug.  For the type 4 weapon augs I think the rage III aug from Everfrost looks like a nice addition to my BoW.  There are several augments that drop in adventures for hp and different resists so there are lots of choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the 10ac from Mistmoor for back, shoulders, neck and face or you could get the 20 hp/mana ones from guk to fill all the spots you cant put a 40.<br />
<br />
As for the EB you'll have to settle with Anger 3 from the dungeon out of Everfrost.<br />
<br />
still have'nt seen any signs of type 8 augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am guessing that these drop on raids and group only with a time flagged person (or majority of people time flagged) present.  Of course, it could be that they take some rediculous amount like 50k adventure points to buy and thats why people have not seen them yet.   Its all speculation for me since I am not time flagged but based on Sony's patterns, it wouldn't surprise me if the effort involved getting type 8 augs was totally disproportionate to the value gained from them.<br />
<br />
Personally I am not impressed with the fact that all my equipment has slot type 1 or 4 and a lot of the good augs are type 2, 3, 5 etc.  Sony screwed up doing this because most people don't want to totally replace all of their gear with LDoN stuff in order to use these other slots and waste all the time they spent getting the stuff in the first place.</div></div><hr />

If you wanna add anger to a BoW, save your points.  Its being 1h only is a typo and hopefully will be corrected next patch.</div></div><hr />
