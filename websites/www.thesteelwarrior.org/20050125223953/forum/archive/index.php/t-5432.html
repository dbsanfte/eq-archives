<br />
i'm looking at 2 shields atm, one which i can get now in baz and another which i can get in a few levels in BoT<br />
<br />
Stormrider Carapace with furious bash 4 and sweet stats/hp/ac<br />
and<br />
Zek Crested Buckler with furious bash 2 and decent stats/hp/ac<br />
<br />
<br />
from a straight aggro perspective, will the zek crested buckler help me hold aggro any better than what i have?  i'm not lacking really in the aggro dept, but more never hurts.<br />
<br />
i've heard different things concerning the stormrider carapace and aggro, just curious if anyone here actually uses a shield in daily grind or if they just swap it out when defensive runs out on heavy hitters.  thanks</div></div><hr />

Your current set up is way better than any set up with a shield. Once you can get a Stormrider Carapace, you can also get a GSot4W and a GBoS. Don't loot the shield until you are forced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only thing you could do is swap it in and out when bash pops and that a real pain in the ass</div></div><hr />

<br />
don't ever loot one until it's about to rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wraq</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used the Zek and a CHoS just to check it out a few times. It would hold aggro at times but just wasn't reliable enough. I gave it to another warrior when we had a Stormrider drop. I have used the Stormrider twice on raids and it seemed to work ok but still not a set up I like atm and no way would I use it for any group situations I can think of unless it's a named that we might be just a little to underpowered for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can someone please explain to me why Lucy's description for Furious Bash (FB) shields, such at this one, http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27290 , is incorrect.  <br />
<br />
Unless I'm not reading that correctly, that seems to indicate that EB procs would increase by 50%, as well as slams, bashes, etc.<br />
<br />
If that was the case, then FB shields, combined with a EB procing 1H weapon, would be the snap agro kings for WAR, but all I continue to read on these boards is how awful FB shields are.  If the answer is DPS, I'm going to laugh my ass off, but I have a feeling that perhaps FB is broken???<br />
<br />
What am I missing?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FB only affects bashes.  Though it says spell hate, it doesn't do anything to spells.</div></div><hr />

So, Lucy is screwed up then?<br />
<br />
Wow--the ramifications of that are.....wow</div></div><hr />

The aggro seems pretty good so far for MT ing. I have lots of testing to do yet, but so far the shield really seems to help aggro doing elemental minis, etc.<br />

I usually switch out to my shield when defensive is out and stick with it throughout, till mob is dead...  So do all the other warriors in my guild..</div></div><hr />

Use my shield all the time..  I usually switch out to my shield when defensive is out and stick with it throughout, till mob is dead...  So do all the other warriors in my guild..  ummm ... why? Is there a single mob in the game that you really have a hard time tanking? I am really curious about this. Other than some experimenting our warriors did back in the day when 10k was unheard of, I don't remember ever seeing the shields come out unless it's a knight tanking. Seems like 2k AC and 11kish buffed HP is pretty much enough for anything you might run in to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More AC and More Hps is much greater than more DPS when MT'ing in my opinion..<br />
<br />
Plus the extra shielding mod on the sheild of strife is a Plus.<br />
<br />
But to clarify my statement, I never use the shield when xp'ing...</div></div><hr />
