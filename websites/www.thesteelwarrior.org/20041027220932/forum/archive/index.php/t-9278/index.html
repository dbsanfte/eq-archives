<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all, Id like to thank the regualr posters on this board for all the info.<br />
<br />
I started playing a lvl 30 warrior I hadnt played in 2 years about a month or so ago and she is now lvl 60.  I started doing LDoNs with her in order to get some augs to upgrade her gear - Ive actually enjoyed the adventures and I saved up 520pts from the BB camp. Everythings cool til now.<br />
<br />
Last night I bought the Anger 2 aug from the adventure merchant and went to put it in my CHoS- doesnt fit- I look at the aug ---- type 8--- hmm.... ok what will it fit in?   NOTHING     not a single one of my weapons will take a type 8 aug. WTF!! Its listed as Warrior only, recomended lvl of 60, weapon only, primary/secondary!!! and it still wont fit in anything I own. I was pissed off maddly clicking away tring to get it to fit into something. Nothing. Nada. Zip.<br />
<br />
I go to allahs and look - there are 6 1-handers upto PoP and including LDoN that have a type 8 slot! WTF how does this help me. I thouhgt these fricking things were suppossed to help a non raiding, small association of friends type character get some kind of helpful LOOT. What a fricking waste.<br />
<br />
Top it all off - while i was clickin on all my differnet weapons trying to get this thing to go into one I LEFT the CHoS in the birdbath by mistake and the dickhead standing next to me took it out of the birdbath and split with it. SO NO MORE CHoS either!!!!......<br />
<br />
Why, why are these 510pt augs sooooo restricted. If you can get the weapons that these augs fit in-----you wouldnt want the frick aug b/c you could get soo much better. <br />
<br />
WTF<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're not in Plane of Time +, all your weapon augs will be type 4.<br />
<br />
If you are, you have to use type 8.<br />
<br />
Retarded, yes, I know, but not much you can do about it.  Sell it back, chalk it up to experience I reckon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry to hear about your loss. The Anger 2 aug you want to buy is from Everfrost, not BB. You need to be very careful when buying your augs to make sure you are getting it for the right slot type. Sorry you had to find out the hard way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Durga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, i learning experience I guess. When you sell the augs back - what kind of return do you get --1/2 points back? <br />
<br />
thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you.<br />
<br />
70%, yeah sucks going from type 4/7 to type 8 or the other way around.  I have to do that with all my type 7 40hp augs, costs 350 to upgrade each basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Googlywoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You might be able to turn the slot 8 aug into the npc in sourth ro that use to take back augs before you could sell them back.  I heard you could hand him a type 4 aug and he would give you back a type 8 aug, and vise versa.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is how it works, but if you hail him he says something about fixing augs that don't fit, or something like that.<br />
<br />
I believe  Sony inlcuded this so folks who finaly get slot 8 stuff won't have to go grind out move adventures to replace augs like Anger  et al.<br />
<br />
Can't remember his name but he's the short little gnome in south ro wayfarer camp.<br />
<br />
If above info not true, does anyone know what that gnome does now that you can't hand back augs to him for full points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you noticed the guy's name and he's in a guild you might be able to find an officer in the guild (who is not fighting at the moment) and very very politely explain what happened. A fair percentage will basically laugh at you, but some guilds might not think that was a cool way for their members to get weapon upgrades.<br />
It's a long shot, but you never know.</div></div><hr />

I thought they removed that option when they introduced reusing augs.  If so damn I wish I knew before, anyone know if you can exchange your type 7 40's to type 8's this way?</div></div><hr />
