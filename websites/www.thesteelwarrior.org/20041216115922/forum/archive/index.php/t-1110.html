From what I hear our guild leader is scared to even try PoF lol... it's ok with me and a wizzy buddy of mine we will talk the guild into trying harder stuff.  Normally our MT is a 65 pally, but occasionally our 65 war comes on, ST is a 60 war or a 63 sk who trade between ST and TT.  I know we have atleast 2 60+ clerics and maybe 4 more in their 50's and atleast 3 60+ chanters.  Our guild leader won't go past Vindi, he's doesn't even wanna try Statute or AoW, so is there anywhere else we can go for raids other than Vindi and RC/DS.  It's really easy for us to get 3 or more groups of 50+ characters so any ideas would really help.  Also does anyone know of a good mob to practice our CH rotation on?  <br />
Thanks in advance, Akamek</div></div><hr />

Start farming HoT if you haven't, then start knocking off ST key dragons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your guild sounds pretty similar to ours, in size and in levels, in fact you probably have more clerics and more chanters at your typical raid.  We are usually limited to one or two clerics and at most two chanters.<br />
<br />
If you can do Vindi and Rumblecrush you should be able to do HoT with ease.  The keys to HoT are a FD puller and good resist gear.  And some kind of debuff in addition to tash (shaman or mage works for us).  The break in is really the hardest part of HoT, and the corpse run for wipes on the break in is easy.  <br />
<br />
With the forces you've listed you'd do fine in Fear, in fact Fear should be nearly trivial for you with three chanters over 60 and that many clerics.  Here's a couple of ideas for dealing with Fear.   First of all, do not be scared of wiping.  Almost every guild does its first time in Fear.  The key is disciplined tactics (run in invis, turn left, go to the wall .. if you get aggro die, don't train the raid and get a loc before you die), and then basically just wearing down the mobs.  Even if you wipe, if you kill a few the first time in, there are that many fewer for you to kill the next time (the respawn rate is very slow, I think it's measured in several hours, someone correct me if I am wrong please), and if you wipe a second time there are that many fewer for your third time in.<br />
<br />
It's also a lot easier to do Fear after another guild has broken the zone in.  The bigger guilds are only there for specific things .. Cazic, the golems, an epic piece .. and they won't clear the whole zone, but they will need to clear the zone in.  Figure out when they have just gone in, then you go in afterwards (like I said, the respawn on the mobs is loooong), and you can figure out the zone for yourselves.  Be ready for multiple adds, that's life in Fear, but with three good chanters you'll handle them easily.  <br />
<br />
You could also do Air, it's kind of fun the first time, although it can be a multi-day type of raid, and everyone has to camp up there.  (You have to follow the progression from island to island, there's no going backwards to a previous island, and the only way out is to jump off.  And CoH doesn't work, so the only way to join the raid in progress is to get a port up, get killed, and have a necro summon your corpse.  Have a necro bring a full stack of coffins.)  Hint:  best way to stay safe in Air is to camp a cleric on whatever island you are on, so if you wipe there's a cleric there to rezz everyone.  Otherwise corpse runs in Air can be kind of a mess.  If you are going to do Air, it's best to read up on it in advance.  <br />
<br />
You could also try the new Hate, the zone in in Hate is now safe so it's a little easier to get started up there.  In fact, you'd find the mobs in the part of the zone near the zone in trivially easy.  It gets a good bit harder as you move through the zone, though.  There are some nice new quests up there.  <br />
<br />
You could do Grieg's and handle some of the mini-bosses there.  Servitor of Luclin has some nice drops.  Getting to Servitor will be deadly boring, because the mobs will be mostly light blue to your higher level characters, but the Servitor fight could be an interesting one for you.  <br />
<br />
If your clerics aren't epic yet there's always the royal area in Chardok.  <br />
<br />
Try to catch VS up and get there FiF.  Your wizzie friend could get a very nice staff, and it's the hardest part of the wizzie epic.  Again, don't be afraid to wipe, if VS gets off a few lucky procs in a row that fight can suck.  We've done VS a few times, and it's not unheard of to wipe once or twice before you succeed.  Again, camping a cleric ahead of time, or if it's going bad, can be the difference between a 10 minute or 2 hour corpse run.<br />
<br />
Trak?  That's another interesting fight because he serially punts the person with the highest aggro to a place past a locked door, so you can't get back in to the fight (and besides, he ports you to the middle of the mushrooms, who immediately take exception to your presence).  <br />
<br />
You may have done some of this stuff already.  Hell, if you can handle Vindi, you should be past some of this stuff already.  There's probably a lot of things you could do, if your guild just buffs up its courage a little bit and tries.</div></div><hr />
