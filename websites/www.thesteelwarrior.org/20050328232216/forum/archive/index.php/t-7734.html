<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we tried the virgin trial tonight in HoH. We had more than enough force to win easily, I believe, but had never done it before.  We did our research, headed down there, watched invises fail like crazy and people encounter a see invis mob with the whole raid spread out all over the place... bunch of people died... lots of frustration... but anyway...<br />
<br />
we finally got set up in the basement.  We buffed up.  We finally got all ready to go after much more frustration.  Then the zone started lagging like mad, spells quit working, etc.  Thanks Sony!  The zone ultimately crashed.  We came back.  About 15 people didn't bother coming back.  We got set up again.  We got ready to engage.  We started.  <br />
<br />
2 groups kited Crazed in rooms 2 and 3, the maiden rooms.  Our main group killed in the first room where the event is triggered.  When we killed our last crazed, we stood around a short while thinking a named was supposed to pop.  Nothing happened so we ran to relieve room 2.  We killed crazed there and while we did it, a named popped in room 1.  Now it get strange.  I think we left one crazed alive by mistake in room 2 as we moved out of the room.  However, it was mezzed.  The mezzer said they still had it mezzed when suddenly we got the message that we had failed.  We asked room 3 what happened.  They said nothing, they were still kiting around the outside of the room, nothing had gotten to their maiden.  <br />
<br />
So what the hell happened?  We had a named in room 1 with no one in there.  We had a mezzed crazed in room 2.  We had crazed being kited around room 3 on the outside walls of the room.  Failed.  WTF?<br />
<br />
Is there some secret order this must be done in that we're missing?  Did we fail to save the little known invisible maiden in room 1, and since a mob popped in there with no players in there, we fail?  I'm confused.<br />
<br />
What ticked me about this raid was the stupid zone crashing.  No, but what ticked me more was that normally if we fail a raid, we talk about what went wrong afterward and figure out what adjustments to make.  This time we just freaking don't know.  Everything seemed fine except that the named in room 1 took an awful long time to spawn after we'd killed the last crazed in there.  After a horrible time getting organized and a zone crash, an inexplicable failure was NOT what we needed.  Gimme a mob to kill.<br />
<br />
Any idea?<br />
<br />
*just wants to kill the damn mobs, not jump through stupid buggy, lagging script hoops*<br />
<br />
p.s. I know some like to split the raid into 3 groups and kill all but the last crazed in each room, then systematically finish off each room.  But as far as I know you don't HAVE to do it that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not an informed source on the script, but i believe the named should be killed before heading to the next room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tunk</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like the named popping late in room 1 caused your demise. If there was no one to agro him, he woulda just killed the virgin. game over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 01:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the nature of the event, it's a good idea to always leave someone in each room, even when you think you're done with it - and especially if the named hasn't shown up.<br />
<br />
If you get people drawing aggro near the doorways, you can easily lose track of the crazed and end up with some in the wrong room.  This is a recipe for confusion as named pop unexpectedly in rooms you are not watching.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But there was no maiden in room 1.  So the named being up there with no one in the room shouldn't have mattered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haladan</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We put groups in all 3 rooms. Have one kiter assigned in each.  Have one mob kited while the rest is killed.  The everyone, xcept the kiters, move from room to room and killing the last crazed and named.  Named in the first room have spawned early more than once(before all the crazd in room was killed).  Never failed yet iirc.  No clue why you failed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We never moved from room to room.  We have the kiters bring their mobs in to the first room, mainly because of nameds who pop late.<br />
<br />
Have your kiters in rooms 2 and 3, set up in the trigger room and clear the mobs.  Once the trigger room is clear, have some knights or enchanters or somebody capable of peeling mobs off bring them to the first room, rinse and repeat.  Keep kiters in each room even after they clear in the event that the named spawns late.<br />
<br />
Your demise was, as previously noted, due to the named spawning in the room and nobody aggroing him.  The virgins are invisible for some reason, but that is undoubtedly what caused the failure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one in room 1 doesnt appear anymore, but will cause you to fail regardless.<br />
<br />
What happened to you is that when you triggered the event one or more of the guys from room 1 mixed in with room 2.  You have to count and if you dont have 6 in room 1 you need to leave a tank / healer in the middle of room 1 while you clear room 2 hoping to get the right one to trigger named in room 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If any mob in this encounter goes &quot; untouched &quot; persay or doesn't have aggro on anyone, within 10 seconds you fail it. We've done this with about 15 people as our lowest now, one kiter in each room. kill all to the end, kill each named, then to the next room do this until your raid is in the final room and has killed that named, then back into the first room for flag. Not confusing at all, just need to make sure that there is aggro on all mobs.</div></div><hr />

in regards to what went wrong.... ahhhmm.... errrr<br />
well you see the birds and the bees...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is at least one crazed mob which should pop in room 1 that is popping in room 2 instead.  After you kill the mobs in room 1, send a tagger to room 2, and look for the mob that is different.  I don't remember their exact names, but you need to find the messed up mob and pull it to room 1.  When you kill it, then the room 1 boss will pop in room 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">06-28-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all, it worked fine the next time.  We've saved the stupid virgins a couple times now, got them drunk, and well..... nm.  The villager trial was very similar and easy.  Then last night was a smaller attendance night like Sunday usually is for us, we joined forces with another guild that was a bit down in numbers, and took out Rydda Dar on our first try.  Woot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we have always done this  was to kill all the mobs in each room but one. Going frome room one down to 3. Once in 3 you spawn named kill and then move to room 2 spawn named kill. move to room 1 where you spawn the final named and kill it. Then your in the room already for the guy to hail. We have yet to fail.  I think this works great because then your kiters dont have to kite as long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Acturian</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the nomads are indeed social, and 1 kiter getting low hp agro will cause mobs to run to his room and chase after him. We had to deal with random popping bosses once becasue of that, wasn't pretty.</div></div><hr />
