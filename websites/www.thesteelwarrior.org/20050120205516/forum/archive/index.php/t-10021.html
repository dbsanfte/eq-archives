If possible id appreciate it if a Mod was willing to sticky this thread for a couple of weeks while information is gathered <br />
<br />
Thankyou to everyone who takes a moment to read this. The reason for my post today is simple. Ive been playing Everquest since beta3 and have seen a lot of changes in the game, some good, some bad, some great and some downright awful. However, like everyone here no doubt, I am still playing the game and enjoying myself. <br />
<br />
It has become apparent however in recent months, with the introduction of WoW and Everquest2 etc that the player base of ALL servers has gone from a state of slow decline to a rapid decline. As an example: 4 Months ago you could zone into the Bazaar on Cazic Thule and struggle to get a free trader spot. Now it is rare that the number of traders gets even close to 300 and usually sits around the 250 mark. <br />
This indicates to me that we have lost(as im sure is the case on most servers) nearly 50% of our playerbase in the last 6 months. <br />
<br />
What this means to us as committed players... Less choice of guild, less ability to raid, huge wait times LFG to find a group, no new faces or friends... the list goes on. <br />
If you consider that these problems alone will encourage yet more people to leave Everquest further increasing the problem. <br />
<br />
SOE's and Verants solution to overcrowding was server splits. Now its time to look at server merges. By combining servers the player base will go back to successful levels. Guilds can continue to thrive, players wont be sat around for hours hoping to find the group that just isnt going to happen. And most importantly I think, they'll be an influx of new people. New friends to make. New people to group with, talk with and have fun with. The thing that made Everquest great at the start. <br />
<br />
I will be posting this petition on as many sites as I can get access to. If you agree with me and would like to support this effort other than just posting your name etc, please feel free to cut and paste this into any other EQ related site that I havent visited. I will collect the results in a few weeks time and ensure they goto as many people at SOE as possible. <br />
<br />
The text of the petition is below. <br />

If you wish to sign this petition, please add a reply under this post along with your Character Name, Class, Level, Server name and guild (if you wish) <br />
<br />
After considering the continued decline in numbers on ALL Everquest servers, we the undersigned request that Server Merges are strongly considered as a way of revitalising the game for its committed player base. We feel that Server Merges will give the chance for Everquest players to meet new people and make new friends and in addition allow players, guilds and continued game play to flourish rather than continue with its current decline. <br />
