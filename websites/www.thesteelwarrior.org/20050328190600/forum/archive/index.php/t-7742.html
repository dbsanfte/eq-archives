Look at lucy, they don't stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm that is interesting that they're in the same slot, although on lucy worn Haste and Visions of Grandeur both use slot 1 also, and those do stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it's more accurate to say the worn haste &quot;used&quot; to be the same slot, since they moved it from being a spell to just part of the description you can't see that anymore.  But definately makes it a possiblity that VoT might not stack, would be really nice if one of the SoE devs that lurk here could say a definite yes or no.  Failing that it might be worth trying to parse out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dairen</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Devs have replied before on this topic. IIRC they said its like focus effects and only the highest mod takes effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at lucy, they don't stack.<br />
Lucy's not the best indication for item / buff stacking. Before they readjusted all the +attack items in the game, ragefire gauntlets had the effect: Firefist(Worn). This stacked with my Grim Aura - The two spells don't stack. <br />
Focus effects, FYI, also stack like haste: Blessing of Reverence stacks with Spell Haste items. The wizard cold Nuke buff, whatever of E`ci stacks with Anger of E`ci. There's no reason to suppose Voice / Worn Hate don't stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the reason that I initially started wondering is that EoA = 15% and VoT = 12%, plus the fact that I've seen posts saying they didn't notice VoT helping after they had their bp (Timmock in this thread):<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6918&amp;highlight=echo+anger<br />
<br />
That's also the only thread that I could find that says anything about devs talking about it, but they just said that you don't hafta activate it, not whether it stacks with VoT or not.  Gonna keep on looking though to see if there's something I've missed.</div></div><hr />

From experience, i can with a decent amount of assurance say they do not stack.<br />
I've tried with and w/o VoT and i notice 0 difference in the 2 set ups. To this end, my guilds sk's never even mem VoT anymore.</div></div><hr />

Your SKs bless your name. Stack or not, VoT sucks to be casting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we have a Dev here i have a small question ....<br />
<br />
How exactly do bard haste stack ?<br />
Common knowledge is : 1 bard Overhaste, 1 haste item , 1 haste buff.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4872&amp;source=Live 30% Haste (V3 Haste Slot2)<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3714 (V3 haste Slot 1)<br />
<br />
The 1st one is a bard song overhaste.<br />
The 2nd is a self only overhaste (which thus should put you over the cap).<br />
<br />
Do we get Cap + 5% Self + 30% Bard Bonus or just Cap + 30% Bard Bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : Phantron got Cazic Touch pushed to 32k , but i still think it was worth it seeing<br />
the kind of feedback we are getting from the Devs. Thx !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZajeerSOE</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overhaste takes only the highest amount. So the earring from Quarm is only worth using when a bard isn't around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the value of my question hasn't been fully evaluated, so I will expand my point of view.<br />
We have a discipline on our utility timer that nobody use which is called 'Sirit of Rage' and which increase our aggr modifier by 50% . Even if it looks great, nobody use it because this would prevent us in using one of our defencive disciplines.<br />
But with this last patch has epeared &quot;defencive immune MOB&quot;. For now they are very limited and are not full raid encounters so it isn't so dramatic. But with the new expansion on progress, we could find someday a &quot;defencive immune raid encounter&quot;. If this happens, we can either<br />
1. not being able to face him and get a off tank role until then.<br />
2. being able to face him without a defensive discipline, and then trying to &quot;do something that would help with our disciplines&quot;. For now we use 'Agressive' in order to increase our DPs and thus help the group to fire down the &quot;bad guy&quot;. But in a raid situation, the agressive discipline won't bring to much compared to number of &quot;DPS class&quot; already present in the &quot;burn him down&quot; role.<br />
So my point is to use this 'spirit of rage' discipline if the situation uber apears. We would indeed help the whole raid very much if we can give to the DPS classes a 50%  more marging for them to do their job at max.<br />
But this is still hypothetic (this kid of encounter has still to appear), theoric (the 50% DPS increase will have to be managed), and under the assumption that our hate discipline stacks with all the other kid of hate modifier (worn, spell,...).<br />
<br />
this is why I asked, &quot;where does our hate discipline (spirit of rage) slide between all the current hate modifiers in the stacking issue?&quot;<br />

<br />
no worn effect will ever block or take precedence over a spell effect.  and vice versa.<br />
<br />
and speaking as an SK, even though they stack, you aren't gonna get me to cast it, cause 1) the difference is fairly minor, 2) warrior aggro is more than sufficient at my level of play to begin with, and lastly, and most importantly, 3) the spell has a 10 minute recast and I don't have enough spell gems to take up with such junk<br />
<br />
only time I ever even think about it is when we used to backflag stuff in water, cause holding aggro while swimming around and being beat on is hard, and the small boost from VoT may actually help</div></div><hr />

I actually stopped memming it two nights ago. There's really only two people left that ask me for it and I'm not going to yank up a spell slot on the chance that they may be tanking.<br />

OMG, you mean knights actually DO use all 8 of their spell slots?  The way some Knights are talking, their spells arent worth having and are just fluff...<br />
