<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emeralde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone!  I checked several pages of this section and other sites in hopes that there would be a listing of Insta-click Items. I didn't see any an my eyes were starting to go buggy on me. <br />
<br />
I have one so far. The Spyglass which is tinkered and really inexpensive.  Just wanted to see what else was out there that I could buy with in reason.  The Amulet of Necropotency was really cool but eep.. way out of my budget.   I kind of passed over the Invis ones because in combat, those do no good really.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to some good info :D <br />
<br />
Thanx <br />
Em</div></div><hr />

Solo campable. So it would be free, but for time. I would also suggest that its worth your time to do the Coldain Hero Ring Quest. The lvl 8 version has an insta on it. 9th is even sweeter (though I have to work on that myself).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bracer of the Hidden.  See invis, so it doesn't drop in battle.  Seen it for around 3K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wanted to add that the best kinds of junk-buff right clickies (IMO) are the ones that don't require you target yourself. This enables you to not lose dps/agro (whatever your job is atm) while you fire up the junk buff.<br />
<br />
I also enjoy items that don't alter your playing much (spyglass is cheap, but I hate that zoomed in effect :-/).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Emeralde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you all and thanks Choppin for linking that thread. <br />
<br />
Good stuff good stuff :D</div></div><hr />
