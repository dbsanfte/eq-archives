Doesn't bother me until/unless I die but I don't think it's an unreasonable request, particularly if they are cutting it fine.</div></div><hr />

No it's not unreasonable.  I shouldn't have to blow 400 mana on a patch heal that lands 0.00004 seconds before the CH does.  <br />
<br />
The only reason I could think of a Cleric not wanting to do that is because he/she thinks that everyone can see the cast message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nope, couldn't see cast, and yep I died cause the dumb ass missed one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Turn your filters on so you can see when people in your group are casting.  If you dont trust your cleric why group with them?<br />
<br />
I don't think its unreasonable to ask, but I don't think its something you should expect.  If your play style requires CH messages from the cleric for whatever reason then communicate that with them (in a non dick waving manner) and if you explain why then both sides should be happy.<br />
<br />
Personally I prefer to trust whoever is healing me to do it right and feel more comfortable with clerics who choose not to have messages as  then I wont be thinking &quot;oooh he left that a little late, wonder if its gonna land&quot;.  Ofcourse if you're boxing a backup healer then your situation is gonna be different, but you need to communicate that with your cleric rather than just expect them to do things your way or else.<br />
<br />
Internet penis measuring leading to lack of communication is the main reason message boards, chat rooms and pickup groups suck these days :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I always want my clerics to have a CH message. One of my RL friends is a cleric, and I've barely ever died with him healing me. When he was playing off a fresh reinstall though, and his message was gone, I got on his case anyways. <br />
<br />
Reasons: I never have others casting messages on, it's too much extra spam. If I'm moving around, I need to know how close I should be to the cleric. If I'm DCing a cleric, I need to know when I should patch heal/duck out of a heal. I need to know if I should pop off an emergency disc, or at least defensive. <br />
<br />
  Any cleric that gets bitchy about a message, ESPECIALLY one that kills you has some serious problems. Just politely ask for a heal in group every time you get ~ 40%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Turn your filters on so you can see when people in your group are casting. If you dont trust your cleric why group with them? <br />
<br />
Eoden, you're a good guy, but this is fucked up on many levels.<br />
<br />
First off, you think I have time to read XXXXX begins to cast a spell?  First of all, not many people want that much spam going by in any chat box, second of all, even if I did have spells on, there's no telling that RandomCleric Begins to cast a spell means that he's casting a CH.  It could be another nuke, it could be a buff refresh, it could be Mark of Karn or whatever.  <br />
<br />
On top of that fact, when I'm 2 boxing, I don't read any chat other than anything that comes along in group, guild or my channels.  I don't have time to watch damage spam or spell cast messages or anything, i'm just trying to keep the group rolling.  When i'm sitting at 1khp I need to know if there's a CH on the way or if I gotta toss in a Tnarg to keep my ass standing   It's not a matter of trust..shit happens, people lag, maybe a mob spawned that I didn't see and fuckin nailed the cleric and he's trying to deal with that and doesn't have a chance to channel a 10 second heal on me.  It's all about keeping people standing, it's not an internet penis thing.  Toss one line in your CH hotkey and then I know, and everyone else in the group knows that there hasn't been a heal started, for whatever reason, and they can do something about that instead of going &quot;Well, he's the healer, It wasn't my job.&quot;  Fuckin bullshit.  If you can heal, it's your job to keep people alive.  And furthermore, it's your job to communicate that fact with the other people in your group so I don't see<br />
<br />
You have been completely healed.  YOu have been healed for 7109 points of damage<br />
You have been infused by the force of nature.<br />
<br />
which ends up being wasted mana, and wasted time.  One line in a hotkey to avoid wasting mana, or wasting time rezzing the tank because &quot;I thought you had it&quot; is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't think it's unreasonable, but remember it goes both ways.  I remember a while back people were complaining about clerics not giving ch messages, but then refused to use an inc message.  Just remember that when you ask for it =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Inc message is so vanillia EQ.<br />
<br />
Casters don't have the book anymore.  What they need an incoming message for?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that tank just brought a mob back..is that the pull or what?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For the very same reason you want a CH message. To keep updated as to the status of whats going on.<br />
<br />
<br />
It goes both ways ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For easy stuff like LDoN-Easy and BoT, I don't bother to spam the group with &quot;CH -- Tank&quot; every minute or so - unless we're talking 5+ mobs in camp. First of all, cause any unnecessary spam bugs the hell out of me, and second, there's a whole lot more tools available than just CH. What if I want to DvA/EE? SL (it does 4k with focus/AA, and it's not like mana is finite anymore in easy xp groups)? Redemption? I'm not going to make a hotkey &quot;Tank is going to be healed soon, druid fuck off&quot;, because by not calling CH when I don't need to, the other priests in the group learn to not waste mana healing. <br />
<br />
For harder stuff, I have my CH hotkey, redemption just gets a &quot;Ciae tells the group, 'uberheal inc'&quot;, and for point heals I use hail.<br />
<br />
That said, there's a lot of bad clerics out there. Lots of people that don't know me presume I'm one of them because I don't have a guild tag. I can understand a tank not trusting the cleric right away because of that, so no, it's not unreasonable. If I was asked to in a LDoN or whatever I would (for a while); it's not like pressing 4 instead of Alt+4 is any more difficult. Just don't expect a CH key *every* time, cause there's a lot of other ways to heal than CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For the very same reason you want a CH message. To keep updated as to the status of whats going on. <br />
<br />
Okay, if I have spell emotes off, I might not know when a heal is coming.<br />
<br />
Where the fuck exactly does your head need to be placed in order to not see that the puller has left camp and is returning with a mob?<br />
<br />
It's a nice try at an analogy, but they're seriously 2 seperate things.  Maybe time to stop cybering and actually look at the game if you can't tell when there's a mob in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bikamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't see them as two seperate things Haass.  I see both as courtesy, but *shrugs* I can also see how it might be taken as spam.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I'm pulling, I'll call incoming, particularly with multiple mobs, just so the group can be forewarned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I usually hit my INC key a moment BEFORE actually tagging the mob. It isn't very often that someone says &quot;/g OMG wait pop in camp&quot; or something but it's happened. An INC key is also useful in dungeons, or anywhere else that you can't see the pulling until the mob is in your lap. Is it necessary? Nah, but it is useful for keeping the clerics on their toes when they're cybering their moms and what-not.<br />
<br />
As for CH messages, I personally feel a lot more comfortable with them as opposed to without. Granted, I've grouped with some VERY capable clerics that didn't have any heal messages whatsoever and felt totally at peace, but I have my furious and defensive hotkeys close at hand at all times for a reason - Good healer or bad, I trust them about as far as I can throw them. (I'm not implying that I trust gnomes or dwarves more than any other - maybe less so actually) Maybe it's just me, but I don't use spell effects, I'm not often looking at the healer, and I can't assure myself that &quot;Soandso begins to cast a spell&quot; means that I'm going to be healed in time. I like to know if there's a quick patch heal coming or if I'm going to be waiting 10 seconds. I feel that I can judge my own HP and the velocity of its plummeting more accurately than another person can, and I'm always prepared to take my own measures to keep myself alive. On a side note: since the unhooking of the disciplines, my deaths have become much more rare than they used to be. It could partly be attributed to the fact that furious/fortitude never really even came to mind before, but nevertheless - I die less now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Only people who really bitch about no heal messages are backup healers and those with no faith in their own skills.<br />
<br />
 And clerics who toss the CH at 40 = good clerics. Bad clerics are the ones who toss the CH at 25. :D <br />
<br />
 Clerics who throw CH at 50 play WAYYY too much on their druid.<br />
<br />
 And yes, this all applies to groups, because in raids no one bitches about INC spam or heal spam either. :D</div></div><hr />

Playing a Cleric now and I don't always have the CH message because I get tired of the spam.<br />
<br />
You can ask sure, but if you think ask=will happen then you're off.<br />
<br />
If you are not dead then it doesn't matter does it?<br />
<br />
A message can be fine sure but then it's just a courtesy call for you because the information you need is already available. If you choose to ignore that, then that's not my problem.<br />
When I played my warrior, I didn't have a problem with not haveing a CH message in groupsay because I did look for the &quot;cleric starts casting&quot; and that was enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">And clerics who toss the CH at 40 = good clerics <br />
<br />
I've run into way too many clerics who think this is a good thing to do...<br />
<br />
A 'Good' cleric knows the difference between <br />
A&gt; a slowed mob <br />
B&gt; an unslowed mob<br />
C&gt; several of  A's<br />
D&gt; Several of B's <br />
E&gt; a happy mix of all of the above.<br />
<br />
A 'Bad' Cleric thinks CH's should be cast at 40 and ignores anything else but the 40% sign.<br />
<br />
Casting CH on me at 40% when I've got 3+ unslowed hard hitters on me is a waste of mana...  easyer to click yer rezz stick.<br />
After you ran yer naked ass back to the carnage scene ofcourse.<br />
<br />
A CH msg ? Yes if I am /w unfamiliar clerics. Yes if I am on a raid. Not needed if I'm xp'ing /w the usual suspects. As a matter of fact , i rarely look at my hp bar when xp'ing, I just place full trust in my cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">With my Cleric I do use a Complete Heal hotkey, that way I'm fairly sure the others don't waste mana on healing the tank, and the tank will try to stay in range - If the group asks me not to use it, sure, fine with me.<br />
<br />
Other spells I just cast with no messages and stuffs - except - Divine Barrier / Divine Aura ... if I'm in a situation where I need either one, I'll be damned if the others shouldn't know, especially if there's a secondary healer who might save the day.<br />
<br />
Again, with 2 healers in a group, I will sometimes use a hotkey for Supernal Remedy on pulls with multiples so the other healer know whom I'm keeping alive. And besides, my Supernal Remedy hotkey also makes sure I'm standing and stuffs .... I call it my *twitch* key. heh .... *twitch* ... saves the 'chanter 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, you won't hear a peep from my Cleric spell wise.<br />
<br />
<br />
*peep* :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask a cleric to use a CH key if you're uncomfortable with them.  There are many other spells a cleric can and will use though, so make sure to send them a tell when you ask.  Other times, you just have to trust that the cleric has got you.<br />
<br />
It's not unusual for my cleric to cast at 50 sometimes.  I know the point in which a new cleric enters a group is the hardest time because, unless the cleric has grouped with that tank there, they don't know when they should CH or whatever based on the rate the mob does damage slowed and unslowed...it takes a short bit to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>JAFFO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As a main cleric i dont think your request for a msg is wrong,in fact if you feel uncomfortable or untrusting of your current cleric then you should exspect and demand a msg. My standard way of operating is simple, if i am in a group with unknown people i will use heal MSG's for CH-SL-SR-EE-WoR-DvA and Bestow divine aura, and DA / DB if i use them. I will use these MSG's until i feel that the tank has developed a sense of trust in me as a cleric, once i think that has happened i will ask the group if they mind if i cut the group spam and drop the MSG's 99% of the time by the time i ask this they have enough trust in me to no care, for by this point the tank has already stopped even looking at their HP bar, and if they still want the MSG's after i ask if i can drop them i dont take it personnel i just continue to use them.<br />
<br />
  And on the topic of multiple mobs i use DvA as my first heal followed by CR, the reason for this is simple, it will greatly reduce the chance of me drawing agro on INC. thus giving the tank time to establish agro, makes thier job alot easier when they dont have to run all over hell to get agro due to a caster gaining agro, alot of times that 10-15 seconds is enough time when i use DvA, CR, and then follow up with the appriate heal for the situation.  <br />
<br />
  Not sure if the opion of a simple cleric matters to you all, but i just wanted to give my side of the situation, and yes i realize these are very simple senerio's, but i didnt want to write a novel to discuss healing strats when it isnt required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">When I'm on my SK, I do like seeing incoming heal messages, of all kinds: Due to the nature of my regular group, I am my own backup healer, and I need to know if I need to attempt to get a TOI off in order to stave off that last hit, if the cleric is deep in her cheal, or if she's aborting for an SR. <br />
<br />
Since I like it like this, I try to give my tanks the same courtesy, since all three tanks have at least one way to deal with a cheal that's going to be a second or so late. <br />
<br />
As for timing, I try to watch the general incoming rate as a percentage, and aim to land cheals at around 10-20%. It gives me a little slop room, but since my cleric is a whopping 62 with a slightly smaller than I'd like mana pool, I have to prize effecency over other things with my heals. That, and cheals for 6000+ warm the cockles of my heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I call incoming in case it is a caster and the necro wants to group share its mana or chanter wants it mezzed and parked.</div></div><hr />

 And clerics who toss the CH at 40 = good clerics. Bad clerics are the ones who toss the CH at 25. :D <br />
<br />
Bah, what fun is CH at 40?  I usually play my own cleric, and I land 7500 CHs on myself at least a couple times a night (with 8300ish total hps with just virt and focus).  Haven't let myself die in a long time.  Of course being able to see the CH bar as the tank I can time things a lot closer than a regular cleric could.  I have purple-clubbed myself 3 times, but it's pretty dang hard to do in PoP.  <br />
<br />
I always congratulate other clerics when they land a 7k+ heal on me.  Nothing more exciting than having a CH hit you with less than half a bubble of red in your bar on a mob that hits for 700.<br />
<br />
As far as heal messages go, I do like to see them as a tank.  I don't use an INC message, I think it's more fun if the group is suprised when I show up with 7 mobs :)  but if somebody asks me to I will make one no problem.  My cleric has /g messages for all of his heals, but it's mainly because I don't generally look at his screen, so I want some feedback on the warrior screen so I know I am healing the right person.  If people don't like the spam they can just put the cleric on ignore.  He doesn't say anything except &quot;XX Heal on %t&quot; anyhow :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I like Inc messages because we do multiple mobs at a time in LDON.<br />
<br />
I like to stay on mine until the new one is close enough to assist off puller and incite.<br />
<br />
People who dont do it can risk having the Cleric toss a cheal right as it is getting into camp, which sucks to try and undo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jinaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Requesting that the cleric add a message to their CH key is not solely about getting that warm and fuzzy that &quot;Yes, I am doing my job correctly&quot; about the cleric. It is all about working together. If I see &quot;Soandso begins casting a spell&quot;, is that a CH for me? Or a quick heal for the chanter who is also getting beat down? <br />
<br />
Warriors have tools that are used in specific situations. Warriors are not mind readers. I prefer to know that the cleric decided I am to get the next heal, so that I can make an informed decision whether to use AT to get the mob that is beating the slower off them. I also prefer to know that the cleric felt comfortable enough that they can take the time to quick heal the chanter, then start a heal on me. There is a ton of information streaming across my screen, and decisions have to be made as to the best course of action to take based on that info. A CH message helps me make those. &quot;Soandso begins to cast a spell&quot; tells me just about nil.<br />
<br />
If you ALWAYS have a single mob, and it ALWAYS beating on you, then I suppose the CH message is fairly uninformative at that point. But, is that always the case? Hmm, I think not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Maftiti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I like clerics to have CHeal messages not only for my ease of mind, but for their bennefit also.  Sometimes you fat finger, or don't hit the F# keys hard enough.  Sometimes close enough attention is just not given to the target bar.  I've seen it happen many times, and have done it myself on occasion.<br />
<br />
Cleric_01 tells the group, &quot;Complete Healing &lt;insert anyone but person who actually need the heal here&gt; in 10 seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
Ten seconds is a long time to waste casting CHeal on someone who doesn't need to be healed.  The message comming accross the screen may just be the thing that pulls the head out of the ass so they can duck out, patch heal, and get the CHeal off like it needs to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And on the subject of pulling messages, I prefer those too. Because frankly I don't spend 100% of my eq time staring at the moniter. I watch TV, play my guitar, maybe play some PS2. A pulling message just gives me a head up, rather then &quot;OH, hello random_mob_001&quot;</div></div><hr />

Too many clerics I know are into that aspect of the game. I guess it can get boring healing and all.<br />

Regarding INC messages in general ... the monk in me won't let me NOT press the damn button. It's a programmed response. I think &quot;INC Comedy Central&quot; when I change the damn channel on my TV.<br />

<br />
Because of the spam issues, I do keep my message simple. Just INC %T, INC %T and a friend, INC %T and two friends, INC LOTS.<br />

All those cutesy INC messages get tiresome after about the second or third hour straight of pulling.</div></div><hr />

Personally I like to shrink / illusion assling and look up at the human monk chick's arse.<br />
<br />
From the posts above, it looks like warriors who 2 box healers make up the majority of those who *really* want to see that CH message, theres also a bunch who like it as a comfort thing. <br />
<br />
Cool, as a shaman / backup healer you feel the need to see a CH Message, as a warrior who doesn't box a backup healer I don't, maybe if this was a post on the shaman board then every reply would be in support of CH messages. <br />
<br />
Im just not big on spam, the ones I hate the most are slowers who do the whole -<br />
&quot;attempting to slow xyz&quot;<br />
&quot;slow resisted on xyz&quot;<br />
&quot;attempting to slow xyz&quot;<br />
&quot;xyz is now slower than your granma&quot;<br />
Much like I prefer to watch for the cleric's casting message I also watch for the &quot;yawns&quot;, &quot;slows down&quot; or &quot;loses its fighting edge&quot; message.<br />
<br />
As for pull messages, my groups can count themselves lucky if they get a &quot;/g 2&quot; or &quot;/g lots&quot;.  Single pulls shouldnt need a message cos they should be expected.  What are healers doing in groups otherwise? <br />

Yeah, I just noticed that too.  As a warrior there's not a whole helluva lot you can do if the CH is going to be late anyway (Fortitude once every 45 minutes and that's about it), so I can see why there would be no point for a warrior to care.  But from a group standpoint, when there is often my shaman, my buddy's druid, and our cleric all in the same group, all of having heals memmed, it's a convenience issue to know who's healing who and who we don't have to blow 400 or 500 mana on a patch on.<br />
<br />
Im just not big on spam, the ones I hate the most are slowers who do the whole -<br />
&quot;attempting to slow xyz&quot;<br />
&quot;slow resisted on xyz&quot;<br />
&quot;attempting to slow xyz&quot;<br />
&quot;xyz is now slower than your granma&quot;<br />
Much like I prefer to watch for the cleric's casting message I also watch for the &quot;yawns&quot;, &quot;slows down&quot; or &quot;loses its fighting edge&quot; message.<br />
<br />
Those are bad, but what really torques me is when you get the fuckin noobs that have the &quot;Assisting Haass&quot; hotkeys.  Good job, you figured out how to make a hotkey, now what the fuck is the point of telling me that you're assisting me?  Trust me, I do not gain any additional comfort from that fact.  I'm not sitting there waiting with my knuckles white from gripping my desk and then let out a sigh when I see that the fuckin beastlord is assisting me.<br />
<br />
There's a definite difference between spam and useful information tho.  I don't care that you're trying to slow something, or trying to snare something..I'm assuming you're doing your job. Let me know if you can't get it slowed/snared, etc.  Hotkeys like<br />
<br />
/g CH on Haass<br />
<br />
are plenty.  That's all ya need, that's all I ask for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In group, we like the messages as it lets us know 1) the cleric has not faaked yet and 2) the druid can nuke so more.  It takes out a bit of the guessing game for the entire group as to whether someone else needs to toss a heal or if the cleric will do it.  <br />
<br />
Another thing about messages, it lets folks cancel out of a heal as needed so you are not wasting mana.  It really helps when we are raiding and have an entire group of team 2-box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I am Warrior/Puller, I always have an inc message, followed by amount of mobs inc.  I normally call the amount of mobs inc for next pull while we are killing the current pull.  This I find can be useful for classes that *may* want to swap out some spells, extra stuns for a healer mob etc.<br />
<br />
I do two box, and we have been in fights with a pull of two, and a third has joined us but nobody calls it.  Calling adds is also (imo) something alot players should get in the habit of doing.<br />
<br />
With the assist attack message, I only do this when we get a big pull.  I have found big pulls go abit easier with a little bit more communication (not to mention faith) with others.<br />

I never call Slows but, as I think its reasonable for party members to assume that I am trying to slow the mob.<br />

If people nag about me healing late (i aim at the heal landing at 15 - 25%) then i let them die once<br />
<br />
Then i tell them &quot;this was too late&quot;<br />
<br />
Next time, i heal em at 50%.<br />
<br />
Then i tell em &quot;this was too early&quot;<br />
<br />
Then i continue healing at 15-25%<br />
<br />
And btw, i always have the mob targeted, so when the mob is at 2% health, i hold my heal untill after it's dead (lands after it's dead). Even if the tank goes down to 1%.<br />
<br />
I rarely let people die, so i hate people nagging about my healing techniques.<br />

<br />
I once grouped with a warrior and my heal was a bit late. The group went 'omg' 'shite' etc, but he kept tanking. Then my heal landed at .5% and i sent him a tell with sorry. His reply was:<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
me: &quot;i healed you at 0%&quot;<br />
&quot;Look, I don't care, I don't even have my hp bar displayed in my ui. I get a cleric to heal me, and I don't need spam or a hp bar to do my thing, and you don't need me nagging.&quot;<br />

inc message isnt important in all situations but when the fighting is intense i couldnt even imagine not making one. add to that .. after the inc message a warning should be given if any adds are inc as well. and adds should be called by the first person aware of them (not always the puller).  it is not spam. it is one of THE messages we cut out spam so that we can see.<br />

a breaking mez button is helpful too. sometimes a groupmate isnt even aware there is a mezzed mob about.<br />

Exp groups (especially pickup) are a different story, i usually use messages for the 4 memmed single target heals in case we get multiples, so backup healer (if there is one) knows who i am healing.<br />

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I don't care about cheal messages.  I don't panic or jump the gun, I simply have faith in the Cleric/Druid/Shaman until i die once.  Then we discuss.  You get the benefit of the doubt that you are good until you prove otherwise if I do not know you.  If they are good enough to purple club me ten times in an adven, more friggenpower to em, but if I die, we are going to change the S.O.P. RIGHT NOW.<br />
<br />
Only pet peeve about healers is when they don't cap me off right before the mob I am on dies.  When it is dead, im off to find some new stuff to kill and dont want to do it at 50 percent or even 60 percent health but I will do that rather than wait 8 more secs for that cheal to hit.  At least gimmea HoT immediately and ill regen it while im pullin.<br />
<br />
I also don't call a target when im fighting unless there are multiple mobs AWAKE in camp.  Enchanters think you are a friggen genius if you simply kill them in the order they mezzed them and if you see &quot;Target has been awakened by Buun&quot; well, there is your damn target call, hit /assist buun and STFU...<br />
<br />
Hmm, anything else?<br />
<br />
Oh Yeah.  Medders if you see a mob die and know there are some mezzed ones in camp guess what happens next? I am gonna taunt and break the mez !  So, if you are sitting there medding (this is mainly for the encs/sham who prob slowed and tashed it while mez so they are just under me on the hate list) you have a decent shot at getting whacked at least once.  Good taunt puts me on top of hate list and as soon as mez is broke your sitting aggro pops you just above me.  Not really a big deal but friggen annoying.</div></div><hr />

Turn your filters on so you can see when people in your group are casting.  If you dont trust your cleric why group with them?<br />
<br />
I don't think its unreasonable to ask, but I don't think its something you should expect.  <br />
<br />
Umm just because you can see 'Suckasscleric begins casting a spell' doesn't mean you can see what spell they're casting.  Ten seconds is forever in eq, I think a melee has better things to do than sit and scroll around trying to figure out how many seconds ago they saw the cast message and then try to figure out if they're about to die or not.<br />
<br />
When I box my cleric CH damn sure isn't the only spell I cast, for that matter heals aren't the only things I cast.  So saying look for the casting messages is a bit umm stupid?  If a cleric is too damn lazy to take 5 seconds to make a cheal hotkey, especially when asked to, then I'd prefer to just box the cleric myself rather than waste my time on some lazyass that's probably playing PS2 at the same time anyway.</div></div><hr />

Adds are good :) More fun to heal.<br />

A druid in that case should focus on all the low hp chars while the cleric takes the tank + slowers.<br />

Low hp chars are usually the dps chars, so if they die, not really a problem.<br />

If the tank or the slower dies, you do have a problem.<br />

In any situation where it's appropriate for a warrior to pull, the mobs are so gimp that I don't care whether they call inc or not.<br />
<br />
If you're facing something tough, where you need a real puller, then yeah, I need that puller to tell me what's coming and, more importantly, HOW MANY monsters are coming.  I also need to know whether there's a named or something that would affect how I heal.  But in truth, if that's the case, then the warrior isn't pulling anyway; if you're stretching your group's abilities, warrior isn't a class which is well suited to be the puller.<br />
<br />
I do generally expect pickup group warriors to call their targets if there are several monsters in camp, but I can live with it if they don't.<br />
<br />
In terms of me calling my heals:  I've got pages full of CH hotkeys for raids, and three CH hotkeys I use for groups.<br />
<br />
The first hotkey is for groups which contain a secondary healer.  That calls the CH in groupchat, since it's information which several people in the group need to know.<br />
<br />
The second hotkey is for groups I don't know where I'm the only healer.  Under those circumstances, I call the CH in /ttell rather than in /g; it stops your tank from getting nervous without spamming everyone else.<br />
<br />
The third hotkey is for when everyone in the group knows me.  I don't call heals under those circumstances.<br />
<br />
I also use that third hotkey when I encounter a tank with an ego.  Tell me how to play my class, and you'll definitely be guessing about when the heals are coming... a bit of unnecessary worry and stress is good for egotists.  :)</div></div><hr />

While you may think this, this is not a standard rule for everyone.  Everyone does not think the same way, and thus, while you're not using your CH message on the tank, the druid sees that the tank is close to death and also wastes mana on him without his CH message, and then everyone else dies.<br />

Once in a while the benefits of communication are present even when  I'm grouped with players I know well and trust completely.<br />
Lately I've been grouping quite a bit with two very good players, a cleric and a shaman (In fact, I'd say their only consistent tactical error is to group with a warrior who isn't as good as they are, heh). The cleric always has an &quot;inc heal&quot; message up. The other day I was tanking a couple of mobs and hadn't seen the heal message for a while. Glance at my hp bar: 9%.  My exact thought was, &quot;That's unusual.&quot; Glance again: 3%, still no heal message. Shaman patch heal lands just as cleric says &quot;F.... I'm bugged.&quot; Shaman takes over healing, we tidy up the mobs, cleric logs and returns unbugged, all is well.<br />
The point is that the shaman knew to start casting heal on me because he *didn't* see the cleric's message. Everybody trusts the cleric so much that if it were her practice not to use messages, the shaman might not have had time to heal me. Would dying have ruined my day? Naw. But I don't look forward to dying, either, and I certainly don't look forward to multiple deaths and group wipes. Do people get bugged a lot? Naw. But why should the unusual get you killed when it's so easy to stay alive?<br />
Different players also have different styles, and in the large majority of cases there will be more than one way of dealing with a mob or set of mobs. I've learned a lot by watching the messages I get from players who I know excel at their class.<br />
This is just my experience so far, though--I'm not in the high-end game yet, and like many aspects of the game, appropriate action in one phase of the game may be unnecessary and even tiresome at another level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I always want a CH message.<br />
<br />
Group chat is for critical communication. The warrior is the center of the group. Period, no debate. The player holding the mob is the center of the groups attention.<br />
<br />
It's not unreasonable to ask for any message that you need to keep things going in the group. I would bet that the cleric didn't know how to put an automated message with the cast and was probably e-bayed. <br />
<br />
Now, if you are in a group that you play with every day, same 6 people, you probably don't need the messages. You have worked  out your ways of communication. But even then, I see good clerics and druids putting out the CH message.<br />
<br />
With my play partner of 2 years now, she still gives me a CH message. Because if she doesn't, I know I need to do something else. Maybe she's lagged and I need to pop a disc to give her a little more time to heal me.<br />
<br />
When you get into that situation, I tihnk the best thing to do is call HOLD. And say.. ok, for us to continue I need you to do this (whatever communication it is you need) or the adventure is over.  And if you get crap back, tell everyone it's over and get the group out.  Worst case, they all argue with you, take up for whoever else.. then you pop that gate potion in your pack and leave. 350pp spent for your self-respect is worth it.<br />

The cleric should be on thier toes, on INC i will cast Supernal Elixir on the tank at 500 HP's a tick for 6 ticks (SCRM and EE4) this allows me freedom even on hard hitters, so once mob is in range i do MoK / MoR, then i will watch slower and root any adds that may need to be locked down, after this i can then once again focus back on the tank and easly land CHeal in enough time to ensure they live.<br />

    I will agree with this if you are grouping with people you have never played with before.  But i usually tell the druids / shamans to not even worry about heals unless i tell them to watch someone in the event of a over pull, but even then it is very rare for me to need any assistance, divine arb, CR, and group heals any cleric that trys to play to thier full potential shouldnt require another priest to waste mana on having to help me do my job. The shaman / druid can use thier mana alot more effectivly by using it to add DPS and improve the overall group effectivness.  I am a cleric regardless of what method i use my DPS will almost always lower than any other class can add.  If the group i am in is pulling so slowly that i have mana to nuke or focus on meleeing with out concern for the health of the group, then we will have an issue for the puller is slacking and needs to fucking pick up the pace. The puller so be doing everything in their power to stress me. <br />
   In guild groups it is a running joke, the monk / bard or who ever will pull multiple mobs to the point of a constant INC train in the effeort to get me to go LOM or stress, even in  PoEarth or fire this has yet to be a problem, i do realize that alot of clerics would rather melee and nuke or what ever, but i chose a cleric and have played one for over 4yrs as my main and that entire time i knew i was a healer first, and i fill insulted if i need a backup, or if the warrior needs to /act a defence disc.  The very few times my tank has been forced to go defensive i have taken it as a personel insult toward my skill in playing my main char, if the warrior is forced to /shield anyone but me i take it as a personel insult. If anyone in my group dies i take it as a personel insult, and they get divine rezzed while i am trying to the best of my abilities to apoligize for my apparent error.<br />
   Sorry for the long post, but a suggestion for those in a group to where half wants the ch msg and the other half dosent. It is a method i use in that situation instead of doing /g Cheal %T i will do /em is chealing %T, this will emote a msg to allow those that want it to see it while also keeping it from adding to group spam, i also do this when raiding since local msg wont lag, and as we all sometimes chat channels will have a 1-2 second delay when it is bad. So by emoteing a cheal msg it allows the clerics to see it when heal channel lags, it also allows the tanks to see what is going on, while that isnt required for the MT rampage tank, i have found that when i am on spot heal / hot rezz duty the off tanks find it comforting to see the msg's (use them for light - elixirs also) and know that they are being watched, while at the same time not spaming /gu , /g, or /rs with unwanted spam.</div></div><hr />

There's something called communication ya know.<br />
<br />
Exactly, I have yet to see a raid/xp group/adv fail yet because the Healer had a heal message.  I can't say the same when they didn't.<br />
<br />
And I can't say I ever met a player who disbanded, camped or refused to group with me for having a Heal message.  Its one tiny little message thats all.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've done hours upon hours of exping with a druid in the group without even using a healing message, and our heals never overlapped.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have the opposite experience, I have grouped with heaps of different druids sometimes I have the problem sometimes I don't.<br />
<br />
When the shit hits the fan, only one thing will save the day COMMUNICATION not this jedi mind reading stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
i do realize that alot of clerics would rather melee and nuke or what ever, but i chose a cleric and have played one for over 4yrs as my main and that entire time i knew i was a healer first, and i fill insulted if i need a backup, or if the warrior needs to /act a defence disc. The very few times my tank has been forced to go defensive i have taken it as a personel insult toward my skill in playing my main char, if the warrior is forced to /shield anyone but me i take it as a personel insult. If anyone in my group dies i take it as a personel insult, and they get divine rezzed while i am trying to the best of my abilities to apoligize for my apparent error.<br />
<br />
<br />
I respect that you do deeply care about your performance as a Cleric but...<br />
<br />
Alot of Clerics don't just play Healer, we can do alot more and still heal.  When a player dies in many cases its the GROUPS problem, not always your divine responsibility.<br />
<br />
A Warrior can not be an effective Main Tank without the support of the rest of the group/raid.  A Cleric that has the support of the rest of the group, will be a better Cleric.<br />
<br />
Being Main Healer does not have to be an individual effort, it is at the end of the day a Team Effort.<br />
<br />
Well those are my thoughts anyways =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Caelidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Personally I hate heal messages of any kind, in fact I hate all hotkey spam, even slows.  I'm always watching to the slows down/yawns message anyway.  Even if there was heal mess, not alot it would do me if the healer was late, accept for a furious once in a great while.   I never even look at my hp while tanking, I never realize that I even died till after I'm already dead.  Its not my job to keep me standing, its my job to keep the beating on me thats it.  I let the healer worry about my hp.   As for spot healers getting nervous and wasting mana on a spot that wasn't needed because no message...So what? they waste some mana for a bit, doesn't ever slow down the groups any, and the spot healer learns pretty quick that he/she doesn't need to.  And so the CH didn't make it in time, big deal...rez, rebuff, and restart the killing.  The exp loss is so minimal it really doesn't matter that much anymore.</div></div><hr />

You are definitely full of crap, it is a big deal when I die, I'm tired of crappy Cleric players. Do hard adventures much? Doesn't sound like it, every bit of mana is precious, if its no big deal, give us all day to do the adventures. The timer is there to force people to use some skill in the game. No magelo, no guild, no name, two posts, you are full of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Clerics messing up is a big deal because it encourages incompentence if ignored.<br />
<br />
And then you might get killed during some time where it DOES matter whether you lived or not.<br />
<br />
Also the additional hassle of putting up with an incompentent player isn't worth it, from both and xp and a playing point of view.  Let's suppose for a moment I am a stupidly overpowered SK or Paladin.  I can't imagine I'll actually enjoy hitting Cease or Fear every 5 seconds to ensure my group's incompentence won't get themselves killed.  Why should I be the one paying attention while the rest of my group gets to do dumb things?  I have grouped with Knights quite a bit and I have never seen one chain cast aggro spell just for the hell of it.  Most of them are quite content to just sit back and let the warrior tank so they can autoattack and only grab aggro if it's absolutely needed.<br />
<br />
The same goes with Warriors.  If you as a cleric makes me work harder than I need to, I'm going to avoid grouping with you next time.  The person that has to pay more attention in a group is essentially contributing more to the group, and if someone is going to force me work harder than I ought to, I am not going to waste my time babysitting the group just so other people can be lazy/stupid.</div></div><hr />
