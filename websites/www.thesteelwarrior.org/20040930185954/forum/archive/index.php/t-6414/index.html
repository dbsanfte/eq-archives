<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets be seriously for a moment and talk about the real problem.<br />
<br />
The problem with defensiv is, that it get more and more powerfull as stronger the mobs get because you can avoid more and more damage. We agree with this or?<br />
<br />
The problem is that every other tool the other classes have dont get more and more usefull as stronger the mobs get. A heal for 1200 hps will heal on a mob which hit for 1200 for 1200 and on a mob which hit for 2400 for 1200. Technical the heals get less usefull because it only heal 50% now where bevor it healed 100%. They get stunnimmun, rootimmun etc. We agree with this?<br />
<br />
Now we all agree that it create a larger and larger gap between the classes because defensiv like disciplines get more and more powerfull as stronger the mobs get and the other classes (special knights) dont get this upgrade and directly or indirectly get weaker and weaker as stronger the mob get because ther utility is less and less usefull.<br />
<br />
This can only lead to that defensiv like disciplines get nerfed and so not avoid a % of damage and avoid a fix number like 500less damage so they dont get more and more powerfull as stronger the mobs get or have to live to give knights a clone version so they can scale up in power when the mobs get stronger. To increase our utitlity will only create the problem that we create other problems. Give Paladins double heals to grow in power like warriors and the healer classes will go rampage because we step on there foots etc. If you look at the problem you will see that one of this two things will happen because you can not let one class grow in power and make the other less and less usefull and keep them balanced. This dont work. <br />
<br />
Well it is up to you guys now what you like more. To get defensiv nerfed or to share it with knights. They will soon find out the same and then they will make the decision for you. If you tell them what you like more you can make the decision berhaps for them.<br />

<br />
&quot;You have 2 choice. Get Defensiv nerfed or let knights have defensiv!&quot;<br />
<br />
hah, forget a few letters?<br />
<br />
sure you can have &quot;Defensiv&quot; what ever that is.<br />
<br />
&quot;We agree with this or?&quot;<br />
<br />
slow down speedy, you cant get banned for retardation untill after you post, you can clean it up a little right?<br />
<br />
first of all, understand what you want, it does not avoid damage, avoiding it would be to take none at all, it reduces damage, second of all it comes with a damage penalty<br />
<br />
stun immune? root immune? you dont know how to play your class, there are group heals, and weapon proc's you can fall back on, also some stun spells still give aggro because they have a damage, or knock back(or both) componenet, in most of those cases, you get full aggro to, also do you not think those dont effect warriors? CHoS and SoTB are 2 of the most used items ATM, both are stun+damage and knock back.<br />
<br />
&quot;ther utility is less and less usefull.&quot;<br />
<br />
depends if you wana ignore all of you benefical spells, your not a rogue, dont think all of your power comes from being on the offensive, there is an attack line and a defensive line you know.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can only lead to that defensiv like disciplines get nerfed and so not avoid a % of damage and avoid a fix number like 500less damage&quot;<br />
<br />
those super mobs you piss and moan about also have what is called a minimum hit, it breaks thru defensive, the mob may hit for 1200 on average and have a minimum hit of 900, even with defensive we can no longer cut our damage intake in half.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it is up to you guys now what you like more. To get defensiv nerfed or to share it with knights. They will soon find out the same and then they will make the decision for you. If you tell them what you like more you can make the decision berhaps for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
nice ending statment, for a fucking moron.<br />
<br />
it has already been &quot;narfed&quot; by minimum hits, and it wont get fucked with again because they just added defensive version 2 that replaced our DPS loss with a snare component, defensive has been in the game as long as raiding, go read some more propaganda of whiny knights.<br />
<br />
here is my closing, anything we can tank for a group now days, you prolly can to, there is about a 1% or less section of mobs you can not including GoD, and most people dont use that expantion, grow up, get over it, you have your powers we have ours, go fill your nitch and stop trying to fuck ours, or better yet become a model tank, the rule of thumb, the warrior <br />

The problem (at least for you) is that Knights aren't Warriors with Spellbooks. They are primarily melee that are equally acceptable to tank in normal experiance groups, can add tank/off tank in raids, and after obtaining end expansion equipment can MT many mobs that have become trivial as the expansion aged.<br />
<br />
I realize that being Warriors with Spellbooks for several expansions has confused some Knights. The &quot;-1 DI&quot; change and 500 HP's for 60 AA should have eliminated that confusion.<br />
<br />
Compare your Magelo and mine. Now say after me, &quot;Knights are not and should not be Warriors with Spellbooks.&quot;<br />

<br />
I would suggest that some mobs could be given defensive discipline mitigation so that defensive discs would be less effective against that particular problematic mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you in some position to KNOW that? If so what where and what proof can you offer to substantiate your claim?<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that to balance out Warriors Vs Knights the Warriors HAVE to have some tangible advantage and this is /disc defensive. Knights have many tricks up their sleeves which are not available to Warriors so if you think that defensive is overpowered which the majority of EQ players don't then what should they get?<br />
<br />
The simple fact is raid content has been tuned with Warrior defensive in mind and a CH chain firmly attached to the warrior to keep him going.<br />
<br />
I doubt the warriors would mind overly much if defensive was nerfed if you gave them your undeniable utility provided by spellbooks, advantageous drop tables and LoH/HT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hey doom, you forgot beastlords back when there was the pet full heal bug :)<br />
<br />
anyhow this ten year old assling with worse dislexya(sp?) than myself thinks that if we email and feedback sony saying we would rather share it than have it nerfed, it will make them think we advocate a change in favor of his class that his class doesnt need  to function in a group, his lance isnt compensation enough for his lack of a brain and small penis size<br />

To the first part Yeah you seen how long the Lance of the Flame Knight is?  Damn thing nearly touches the ground when i am on my horse!  That alone should be able to keep the mob from hitting me for atleast 15 seconds!<br />

They already did that, it's called the Act of Valor AA.  You can guess how many Paladins got that, it took the devs a while to figure out that it was crashing zones when it was used.<br />

the best paladin in EQ has succefully tanked the entry level mobs somethin like 2 out of 17 times ( not exactly sure i dont remeber the exact numbers but it was somethin like that ) I dont think there should be a mob that a Knight CAN'T tank i'm not saying they should be able to tank as well as warriors but come on they should be able to tank anything with just more difficulty.</div></div><hr />

I cant speak for the high end but at my level of gameplay...Paladins out dmg me and can grab aggro with a mouse click.<br />
<br />
I guess im just lucky,  i group all the time with wonderful Paladin that realizes she is a &quot;Hybrid&quot; and therefore realizes she has the ability to bring a little of alot to the table.  Most of the other paladins ive come across on the boards and in game just want to be Warriors without giving up the benifits of a Paladin instead of being Paladins.   We never invite other paladins into our group because we both hate them equally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Uhm.. With what kind of set up, exactly, are you being out damaged by a paladin? Real differentiation between melee output abilities, given identical weapons, begins in the mid-50s, and while knight weapons tend to be a notch above equivalent warrior weapons, by the time you hit 60, they don't entirely bridge the gap that hitting the mob 5-10% less creates. While situational use of stuns and heals can really make things easier on the healer, they're not exactly DPS machines: If, post-60, you're still getting out damaged by the paladin, there's a gear gap. Granted, the warrior reliance on hate procs widens this, but if you've both got the same thing in your hands, the warrior will beat out the paladin for damage out. She's going to hit less often, and quite probably for less on average.<br />

I simply said that SHE can take aggro if she WANTED too.  The point being she realizes that i make the better choice for the tank in our encounters.  As for DPS its pretty much the same type of realization....Its my job to be the tank and therfore i use the best duel wield aggro weapons I can, often that means its not the best DPS.  SHe uses a Fabled Mithral 2hander.  True if I wanted too i could pull out my 2hander, beef up my DPS AA's and out damage her.  But in our current situation that would not make the most sense.<br />
<br />
Like I said we play what appears to be an entirely differnent game than most of the people involved in these Pally -vs- Warrior discussions.  Nothing wrong with that and I just need to learn to stay out of discussions I have no business taking part in. :)<br />

Arbosch, did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?<br />
<br />
You have 2 choices:<br />
1.  Give up your spellbook and get /disc defensive instead of it.<br />
<br />
2. Shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I think you pallies are forgetting defensive/stonewall are time limited discs with a no-use period.<br />
<br />
Any group requiring a defensive tank for trash/exp will be killing less than a dozen mobs per hour. More beneficial to go somewhere else where you don't need a defensive tank (ie: a paladin can tank). <br />
<br />
The only place defensive gets used is on raid bosses or high end nameds. Very few of those bosses die within 3 minutes. When defensive drops we can't use it again for 7 minutes or something. During that time (ie: most of the fight) we are fighting without defensive. Who would be more likely to survive without disc - a warrior or a paladin? If we die, who would you rather step in to tank - a new warrior with disc, or a new paladin with disc? In what possible raid boss situation would a paladin be preferable (in damage taking ability alone) to a warrior without making paladins preferable in all situations?<br />
<br />
The ONLY possible situations that giving paladins defensive would alter gameplay would be:<br />
1: single group stuff with a major boss at the end. A purely situational case which probably applies to half a dozen fights in the entire game at most.<br />
2: Raids with less than 3 warriors where tanking without defensive is completely impossible (ie: nowhere in the game)<br />
<br />
What you're asking for doesn't make ANY fundamental change to the game or the paladin class. You just want yet ANOTHER situational perk so you can compete equally with warriors in the last remaining part of the game where we surpass your tanking ability noticably.

As a quick example, we'll take my situation. My guild isn't exactly a heavy raiding guild. We're still a few kills from the elemental planes. In this, I have a relatively regular exp group. There's 5 of us, an SK, a monk, a ranger, a cleric, an enchanter. We've been hunting like this since Velks and Seb were the hardest dungeons in the game. GoD comes out, we say to ourselves, 'Great, Hard LDON was getting boring.'  We find Ferubi. Once we settle into the increased healing load, it gets boring real fast. So we venture into a trial sewer. It's hard. We add a druid. It gets a lot easier. Deceptively easier, as it turns out. We get to the boss, some big ass bug thingy. Events go something like this: Monk says, &quot;Inc!&quot; You cast darkness. You push /disc leechcurse. Bug makes first melee round. You have entered Everfrost. Your skin begins to glow with an unholy light. The monk made it 6 or so more seconds, what he had left on voiddance, and the ranger made it for, surprise surprise, 24 seconds. WTF? Thanks to this, if we want to advance, and we could, with a warrior tank, I have to not be part of the group that I've hunted with for longer than I care to remember. Thx!<br />

High-end GoD trials is where the major problem is since Time-geared knights get their asses one-rounded if they get unlucky on the RNG.  Two key words - content fix.

<br />
Four key words - So do nondefensive warriors.<br />
<br />
Since these fights usually last longer than 3 minutes, equally geared warriors will get one-rounded almost as often. If a quad DI&gt;17 will kill a paladin, a quad DI&gt;19 will kill the warrior. This is what's known as 'high end content'. Easier with a defensive warrior for the first 3 minutes? Sure. But anything that's possible with a warrior outside those 3 minutes of glory, is tougher, but still possible, with a slightly better geared knight. This is known as balance for all the other tricks paladins have, being HYBRIDS. There are a grand total of THREE of these type expeditions in the entire game, the Kod ones- 4 if you include Tipt.<br />
<br />
Noone seems to be complaining about cleric healing/res being required here strangely enough. Should druids get CH and 96% res too, so clerics aren't referred for boss healing?<br />
<br />
Enchanters? Gimme a good bard any day. Leave the enc bot outside for buffs and bring the superior puller who can also mez, and take more of a pasting if necessary, all while enhancing the abilities if every last person in the group.<br />
<br />
Holy trinity? Holy out-of-date fairytale more like.<br />
<br />
If me wanting to be able to push the edge of our advancement  <br />
<br />
Here's an idea...<br />
<br />
If you can't do it with your group, maybe it's BEYOND the edge of your advancement. Isn't that kinda the definition fo the term? Push the edge by increase your group power via members, gear, AA, tactics, or a combination of them all.</div></div><hr />

Defensive and its little brothers have created this problem: If it's hard for a /disc warrior, it's impossible for anyone else, if it's possible for anyone else, a /disc warrior effectively trivializes it if the mob does not outlast disc. It's a smaller problem now, but it's going to start popping up every damn time they increase the potency of a mob in the next expansion and the next. It's a problem to which there are only pyhrric solutions. And yes, I'm leveling my fucking warrior twink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just reading some of the above stuff. I don't believe it means that you need a warrior absolutely for these trials as atleast some knights are making it. I think there are just a lot of people trying to tank it with the minimal gear and AA's. I know I have seen a few that have been throwing fits over not being able to tank these mobs in GoD and they didn't even have LR5 much less even starting ID. For those individuals all I can think is get a clue. If you only work on the horsie, offensive and casting AA's what would you expect. I would expect to get my ass kicked just like any other caster. (Note: This is only for the ones missing their AA's)</div></div><hr />

Perhaps it's not that you need a warrior. Perhaps you need to consider your strategy and tactics in this particular fight and adjust them?<br />

Or, as others have suggested, it may be that you're still not quite ready for this fight.</div></div><hr />

I need about 3000 more unbuffed HP before I'll consider tanking that shit, and about 15000 more before I'm comfortable.<br />
<br />
However, the issue of the balance gap of defensive in a single group remains: No high damage, low HP mob which is a significant challenge to a defensive warrior can be tanked by anyone else in equivalent gear. No high damage mob which /can/ be tanked by someone else is not trivialized by defensive and evasive. This is bad. It creates stupid encounter design: Mobs must have horridly inflated HP totals to provide threat to the tank: Anyone else remember the hour long fights from Luclin? Else, they must be tuned to be tanked by only defensive warriors. This is as idiotic in a single group setting as forcing a guild to need 12+ clerics a raid in PoP was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">&quot;It creates stupid encounter design:&quot;<br />
<br />
Come on now. You're just noticing this?<br />
<br />
It's as bad a design as complete heal. And has been forcing bad encounter design onto  the dev team since Velious. Defensive was needed for those boss mobs back when they were cutting edge. Just as it's still needed to this day. I mean, didn't you pay attention to Luclin? I'm not being sarcastic here either. From Vindicator to Tormax to AoW to THO to Cursed to Emp to TVK to Terris Thule to Aerin'Dar to Mith Maar to Rallos Zek to Reparm to Fennin Ro to Hydrotha to Quarm ... Defensive is just part of how things got done. It shouldn't be a shocker that it's still very much a part of Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
It's EQ. It's the corner the devs painted themselves into.<br />
<br />
What are you gonna do about it now? The game's too far gone. And defensive is what it is. You'll eventually get better gear and be able to tank whatever it is you want to tank (though I still think you should keep trying, and maybe just think of a new tactics or a new way to approach the boss mob).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">I paid attention to Luclin. I bitched about this in other circles in Velious. Just because I accept that it's shitty and it's not gonna change doesn't mean I have to like it. I'd really like someone to pull a miracle out of their ass to fix it. <br />
<br />
Where I am, tactics don't help much: 4 x 1800 + 1x 1200 kick &gt; shaman/Paladinless HP. Vie brings it in range of my shaman buffed HP, but - at the end of a two hour crawl, I don't have shaman buffs unless I brought one with me, and he doesn't have the umph to be the second healer I require. I just get to be shit out of luck for choosing the wrong class before /disc existed.</div></div><hr />

No they dont, I've never had a GoD trial fight go longer then three minutes.<br />
<br />

<br />
Vie doesnt last long enough, (a few rounds at max) and clerics dont have time to recast it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">&quot;Vie doesnt last long enough, (a few rounds at max)&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah. See, maybe I read the post wrong. Here's what I was thinking ...<br />
<br />
I though the problem for Arathena in this particular boss mob fight was getting one rounded before the healing gets established.<br />
<br />
If that was the problem, I was suggesting using Vie, or changing strats early on, so that Ara has a chance to get established as a tank while the 2 healer chain gets up and running. So the short duration, I thought, wouldn't be a hindrance, because I thought that the problem was in establishing the tank.<br />
<br />
If I misread that, then I return to what everyone else suggested ... just wait until the gear is upgraded and go back at that fight better prepared.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
Its pretty clear that those that had it so good for so long (a.k.a Knights) are spoiled.   I mean i still dont see how requiring a Warrior for a FEW things is any different or worse than Requiring a Cleric for ALOT of things.  I don't care what level of gameplay your at but any Knight with a Cleric can progress alot further than I can with a Druid.   Don't see me crying for Clerics to be nerfed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">But with Knights tanking everything upto these few mobs it's a little harder to say defensive is a requirement now days for anything pre-GoD even though it makes things easier depending on what mob. Much less that it is killing the game when now only a few mobs make it almost necessary. Defensive is great for when things get rough but so are small heals, stuns, etc..</div></div><hr />

Just as soon as warriors are given just as many and as much of spell like abilities such as rez, heal, HP buff, stun, root, or pets, atk buffs, returning mana and HP to the group, lifetaps for themselves, aggro buffs, and the like. Give knights half as good of defensive, and warriors get half as many or half as good of spells.<br />

Your choice, Arbosch.</div></div><hr />
