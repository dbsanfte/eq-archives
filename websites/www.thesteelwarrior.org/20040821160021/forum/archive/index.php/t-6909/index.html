<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lykke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So... we got our new disc system (&quot;melee makeover I&quot;) and not that long ago they rolled out our &quot;melee make over II&quot;, what was the migration boost?<br />
<br />
Was we not supose to get &quot;glimts&quot; of mobs defensive failor at times with the makeover II? I think it was supose to be called: AN OPENING. Has anyone seen these opening's? My it's just me that have not been paying attention?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Openings were scrapped, a long time ago. Melee II has not happened yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Melee Part 2 came out a few months ago. They basically reviewed what they'd already done in Melee Part 1 and shortly thereafter, and claimed it collectively to be Melee Part 2, with vague promises of &quot;keeping an eye on things&quot; for the future.<br />
<br />
In reality, Melee Part 2 (of which openings were to be a big part) was scrapped, and (this isn't gonna endear me to the devs) they basically didn't have the balls to come out and say so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">regen? I hope that's a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">regen? I hope that's a joke.<br />
Yeah from what I hear it is. Its like +2 extra regen(at level 25). Thats not going to make newbie melee soloers able to do much more than they are today(if thats their goal).</div></div><hr />
