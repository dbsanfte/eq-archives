<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Current State of the Warrior from the perspective of an Enchanter <br />
<br />
I stopped playing my warrior at lvl 25, so I cannot speak AS a warrior, but being one of the classes that is perhaps as interested in how well the tanks do their jobs as the tanks themselves, I thought you might be interested in my perspective.<br />
<br />
In short... warriors have problems.  As a newly dinged 59 enchanter I cannot speak to the 'high end' game, I have never grouped with a warrior in even a single piece of elemental armor, nor a BoW.  I get to group with the 'mid range' warriors, the ones in Thurg gear, the ones in a few pieces of cultural if they're lucky and picked a diety.  I've rarely gotten to group with warriors with EB weapons, if I'm lucky they'll have some sort of proccing weapon but most of the time no dice.<br />
<br />
As of right now, if I am forming a group, or my opinion is asked, and am looking at tanks, if both a warrior and a paladin are LFG at the same time, I go with the paladin unless the paladin has a horrid reputation, then I'll look for an SK.  Not because I don't like warriors, because I do, many warriors are fun folks to group with, not because I have any 'angst' at warriors, but because a paladin or SK MT allows me to get the SAME reward in terms of XP/hour as a warrior with LESS risk in terms of aggro/death.  There are no concrete benefits to me as an enchanter with having a warrior MT over a hybrid.  The ONLY potential benefit is that a warrior is more experienced at the best ways to break mezzes than a paladin/SK is, but with a little coaching 99 percent of all hybrids can do even that better than a warrior.<br />
<br />
Now I hear people say 'but warriors have more HP, more AC, therefore they're better'  to which I say, I have less HP and AC than any tank, and its MY silk wearing buttcheeks that get the loving attention of the mob when I get aggro.  If I have to group with a warrior MT I am perfectly capable of altering the way I work and avoiding getting aggro, but why should I have to?  Why should I work at 60 percent to enable Joe_Warrior00 to hold aggro when Jim_Paladin00 or Billy_Shadowknight00 allow me to go 100 percent?  If I have a hybrid MT, I can concentrate completely on landing slows, tashs and nukes, and mezzing the rare adds.  With a warrior I need to load up my aggro related spells and my slow-refresh boon/tricksters in order to help the warrior keep and hold aggro and still operate at a good efficiency.  In short, a warrior as MT requires MORE effort in relation to the SAME reward.<br />
<br />
Color me lazy, if I can get 1 dollar of reward for 60 cents of effort, I'm going to be ALL over that in a heartbeat.  That's human nature, and the ONLY thing keeping some warriors as MTs is that there is still a perception among people who don't really pay that much attention that a warrior is required as MT.  I've had groups where we had both a warrior and a paladin in them, the group wanted the warrior to MT, but on the first fight the paladin immediately stole aggro and never lost it despite the best efforts of the warrior, supported with Boon/Tricksters and Horrifying Visage... so on the next pull the paladin was MT, because he decided he wanted to be.  After a while, the warrior sent me a tell upset over the entire situation, and I couldn't help but agree, that paladin got a group DESPITE not being expected to be MT, and still took that job over leaving the warrior who's ONLY realistic contribution to a group is to MT to sit there and play with his two handers, pretending to be useful.<br />
<br />
What needs to be done?  Warriors need SOMETHING to make the REWARD for having a warrior MT match the increased RISK and the increased EFFORT of having a warrior MT for the rest of the group. I don't care if this is increasing the DPS of the warrior, increasing mitigation for the warrior, increasing taunt for the warrior, or nerfing the bejeesus out of knights.  SOMETHING needs to be done about this, I already am seeing warriors spending hours on end LFG in zone after zone, I've seen lvl 60 warriors LFG in PoN/PoI for over an hour, while a 53 paladin walks in, shouts once, and gets a group immediately, and these warriors are from reputable guilds and are known to be good players... It is completely wrong for a 'pure' tank class, one whose ONLY selling point to their group is their ability to tank, to be LESS desirable to groups than any hybrid.  Hybrids get versatility at the expense of specialization, the specialists should always be better than the generalists AT THEIR SPECIALTY.<br />
<br />
I'm an enchanter, my only 'melee' characters now are a paladin twink, a SK twink and a monk twink, none are above 36.  I live and die by aggro control, I slow too soon, LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.  I tash too soon LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.  I nuke too hard LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.  I sit down too early LOADING... PLEASE WAIT.  Having a tank that can, by god, tank and hold aggro while tanking is CRITICAL for me to be able to do my job, NOTHING at all in a tank matters at all compared to that, because if the tank holds aggro, a cleric doesn't have to waste mana healing my robe-wearing buttcheeks at all.  Paladins and SKs can do this.  Warriors can not.  That is a problem, and that needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At lvl 65 you are in a whole new ball park, with gear and AA's what was hard before you got these things, now become easy.  With SCS3 an AA an ench at your lvl can get right now, you do not need a paladin to hold taunt for you, just this AA will allow you to slow without taking much of a beating if any.  Why should a warrior pay the price for you not getting the AA's you need to experience in pop.  A lvl 65 ench with the right AA's does not need to be healed to often from debuffing these days, only if a mez gets resisted more then once.</div></div><hr />

We do our job the best, it's just knights can hold agro better. We take damage the best, we just can't hold agro unless other people in the group know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
For instance, I was in a group in BoT (camping the earth named, he spawned- got him to 6% but the cleric had run oom) and I rarely had agro problems. I was pulling for a while then the rogue took over. I didn't have agro problems when the shaman slowed, he would get agro for a split second but then it would come back to me. The rogues would get agro once in a while, but again it would come back to me. All  it takes is smart people in your group and the warrior can hold agro.  Just that people are lazy and would rather have a knight tank because they have guarenteed agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really to single you out Binnamr, because this same kind of thing has been said by a couple of dozen people so it's nothing new.  But why exactly should people have to 'play smarter' if they don't wish to?  Why exactly should people have to 'play smarter' when it requires that they reduce their contribution to make it possible?  In short, why would people at this point in the game want to use a Warrior?  Where are the benefits to them that are measurable and observable?<br />
<br />
You say people are being lazy, I say people are seeing a choice between an escalator and the stairs, and taking the escalator.   Yes learning aggro control is important for things like raids.  However having to constantly exercise raid level aggro control is, for many people, incrediably tedious.   They want to play and participate at as close to their fullest potential as possible without serious concerns about seeing their bind point as a result.  Currently Knights allow this, Warriors don't.  So you may consider them lazy and less smart as players, but I imagine they see themselves in many cases as people just playing the game in the way that gives them the most satisfaction and greatest enjoyment.  You really can't say that's wrong.</div></div><hr />

Take your example...<br />
<br />
Make a Knight the MT...<br />
Have him slowed asap, mob never hits the slower..<br />
Everyone goes full Burn, maximize dps..<br />
Cleric doesnt run OOM, because all he has to do is heal the pally, not fast heals or group heals, and he can sit and med between heals because the pally will hold aggro...<br />
Instead of loosing at 6%.. <br />
You win...<br />
<br />
Why? because a knight maximizes the damage efficiency, and only SLIGHTLY decreases the healing efficiency, include LOH and his own heals and there is no loss of healing efficiency..<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats where the problem lies... sure we can tank, but we lower the effectiveness of everyone else when they must compensate for our inability to hold aggro as well as a knight.</div></div><hr />

NOTHING BEATS A WARRIOR TO STOP A TRAIN AND HELP THE ENCHANTER GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL<br />
<br />
That is the biggest reason to have a good warrior in a grp, not for single pulls, if any ench can not handle debuffing  a single mob, tell him to come back when he has the lvl and AA to handle pop.  In a very fast paced grp it is easy to get 3 plus more mobs at a time, from bad pathing over pull or even a resist to lull. All a warrior has to do is hit aoe taunt def disc, which gives the enchanter the TIME he needs to mez the adds.  In this type of grp, a weak ench does not have the tools to handle these type of situations, so the grp has to CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Friss, you're entitled to your opinion.  And it's nice to see at least one enchanter sees the value of a Warrior.  However, my perception, and the perception of many other players, is you are a distinct minority these days.  So as long as your opinion is not the majority opinion, Warriors are going to have trouble with finding groups.  The rest is really just smoke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Alaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Friss, how am I going to GET the AA's and levels to be at the level where it no longer matters if a warrior can't get instant snap aggro, hrmmm?  I *know* how to work with a warrior, when I am grouped with a warrior MT I do NOT usually get aggro, but that is because I am having to hang back, be more careful, watch my timing with greater care.  So we have an unslowed mob whalin' away on the warrior, necesitating an earlier CH and possible cleric aggro, so I can slow without needing to worry about getting beat on myself... if that paladin over there can tank the mob at 90 percent of the warriors efficiency, and I can get the mob slowed faster in consequence, the difference comes out in the wash.<br />
<br />
The warriors advantages of HP/AC, IE taking the beating, are not the end-all and be-all of tanking.  If the mob is hitting me instead of the warrior, I don't care if the warrior has 10 million hp and 1 million AC, I don't.  That's the problem, with a knight I *never* have to worry about mistiming a cast or casting to soon or in an indoor dungeon sitting to med too early, because the knight has aggro locked down tight.  With a warrior I *do* have to worry about that.<br />
<br />
So the question becomes, is the BENEFIT of having the warrior MT EQUAL to the BENEFIT of having a knight MT.  I respectfully submit that the answer is 'not right now in XP groups'.  Especially in Tier 1 planes (that I am restricting myself too on my own even with the opening of Tier 2, due to AA/Levels) there is NO drawback to having a knight as MT compared to a warrior, and the knight allows the rest of the group to generate more DPS, allows me to do my job with less stress, and things go smoother.  Thus the BENEFIT of a knight MTing is higher than the BENEFIT of a warrior MTing, when they should be equal net benefit to an XP group, 3 minutes of glory on a raid for one warrior doesn't translate at ALL to the XP setting.<br />
<br />
Do I think this is 'right' and 'good'?  Heck no, warriors NEED to be balanced vis-a-vis knights, they need to be AS attractive to the average XP group for the MT spot as a knight without needing to go through contortions and jump through hoops.  A warrior in bazaar bought gear should be EQUALLY effective and efficient a MT as a paladin in bazaar bought gear, not less, not more, equal.  Right now, the warrior is NOT equal.<br />
<br />
Do I have a solution?  Not really, I'm not a warrior, my highest tank class is my 36 SK, I'm not qualified to say 'this is THE ONE TRUE solution' to the problem.  I can SEE the problem, because I'm the one who gets to have to deal with the results of the problem.  My one proposed idea evidently has more holes than a brick of swiss cheese (the enrage idea I had in the Outhouse section)  *chuckles* <br />
<br />
And honestly, Friss, at my level I have yet to group with a warrior with AoE taunt, I'm feeling 'uber' when I'm in PoI factory doing golems or a PoD courtyard for crying out loud *grins impishly*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In the old days of seb you never teamed a low lvl ench with a low lvl warrior, since hybrids have been fix,  they can do a better job protecting a low lvl ench from single pull mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
erm no?.....<br />
<br />
you're talking about AE Taunt i imagine?<br />
<br />
sure, you ae taunt 5 mobs, get them hitting you...<br />
<br />
now what is 5 mobs hitting you going to demand? yes even with defensive...<br />
a heal... yep you will need to be healed!<br />
now what happens when you get healed?... the healer basically dies...<br />
<br />
<br />
Now what is a paladin going to do, when 5mobs come in?<br />
he has a few choices of aoe spells I believe.<br />
But if im wrong, his group heal is still enough to get the mobs on him.<br />
<br />
Yep,<br />
even for trains, Paladins rock more then us.<br />
Sorry to burst your bubble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This made me laugh....<br />
<br />
I love it when people espouse the glories and power of AoE Taunt, when they have never used it...<br />
<br />
Does anyone realize the LIMITED range of AoE Taunt?  <br />
<br />
And that AoE Taunt only does the exact same effect as a normal taunt but just to a few more mobs. It puts you at the top of every aggro list. BUT! since a warrior is only able to affect one mob at a time, well now he has to focus, as soon as whomever the person that used to be aggro'd on does ANYTHING the mob switches back to them. Actually, If the train is a result of a BAD pull, or if they are assist aggro'd then the actual LEVEL of hate that the AoE taunter has is very very small. Usually as soon as anyone does anything to the mob, it will turn to them.<br />
<br />
Taunt fails frequently, Taunt has very very short range, neither of these are corrected by AoE taunt. <br />
<br />
But probably the Largest flaw of taunt is the way it works. Sure it Will put you on top of the hate list. But unless you can maintain generating more hate than whomever you replaced as aggro target, you will just slip down the chart again. <br />
<br />
IMO, AoE taunt, should never have been an AA. It should have been a class skill a long time ago. and Long refresh is just silly.<br />
<br />
AoE Taunt is virtually useless, except giving us a second instant taunt effect to use when switching tanks on a mob, or when MT dies... If I could get the AA's back I would.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
AoE taunt has been, in my experience unfailing.  Only time when in range that a mob did not turn to me is low health frenzy agro.  Minor point, as most everything else you said is true, tho I disagree that AoE taunt is useless, I love my AOE taunt button.<br />
<br />
Earlier, Alaza said:<br />
<br />

<br />
One of my primary reasons to advocate lowering knight agro, instead of raising warrior agro, is pretty much exactly what you said there.  With the lower level of agro, you adjust, have to be carefull, and this takes a certain amount of skill.  There are enchanters(and shaman, and other classes) who simply put do not have this skill.  Do I want the game balanced to your level(as you sound skillfull), or to the level of those people lacking the skill to adjust.  It is my contention that warrior agro rewards skilled players(both skilled warriors, who hold onto agro beter, and regain it faster when they loose it, and other classes, who are required to manage their agro), and does not reward lower skill players.  Today a caster who does not have skill to manage agro can still be successfull, they just have to ensure they are grouped with knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ae Taunt is pretyy much guaranteed taunt. Does have a Z-Axis problem tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Maybe it was z-axis bug...<br />
<br />
Last Night I was MT for AGNARR raid.<br />
<br />
We ported into AGNARR area, started kiting Agnarr, Pulled Mini boss and adds.. killed min-adds and portals.. set up, ressed/etc..<br />
<br />
I am in position. <br />
<br />
Kiter gets order.. runs to my side.<br />
I hit taunt, Agnarr hits kiter.<br />
I hit AoE taunt, Agnarr hits kiter.<br />
I hit taunt, he turns to me...<br />
<br />
AoE taunt did not grab aggro from Agnarr.<br />
<br />
maybe it was the Z-axis, but I was under his skirt... he should have attacked me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You laugh, are you a enchanter, do you see the results of a good aoe taunt, no so keep it closed unless you have tried to CC after a warrior hits aoe taunt.<br />
<br />
I can handle any one mob in pop beating on me, which is the most that will happen if mez fails on my first cast of mez after a aoe taunt.  With any other grp, with 4 inc mobs, I will get 3 sometimes 4 mobs beating on me if mez fails to stick on the first cast.  The first 20 sec is very important if we win or loose,  which depend on how many mobs I can lock down in that time.  AOE taunt give the ench the 20 sec we need, and any warrior with aoe taunt can do that every time.<br />
<br />
A very well played paladin can also give me the 20 sec I need but since I been playing this game I have only found ONE well played paladin.  I only know one paladin that will have a assist key for the ench so he can none damage stun the mob the ench is try to mez, damage stun the other mob that is beating on the cleric, while he is holding agro on 2 or 3 other mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Friss you're not even playing the same game the majority of us are playing.  Your expectations of a Warrior are through the roof with regards to AAXP, gear, and so forth.  Sure, if you're always playing with one of the top 10% of Warriors in the game, you're probably seeing great stuff.  Most of us don't have that kind of AAXP nor that kind of gear and aren't likely to any time soon.  And so the other players, the ones who don't hang with the people you apparently do, see a Warrior with maybe some marginal advantages in HP/AC/avoidance skills and a Knight with a guaranteed ability to insure that the mob stays pretty much on target 90-100% of the time, and they go for the sure thing over the maybe.<br />
<br />
You don't agree.  Great.  You don't play every character in the game nor can you guarantee each of us a reasonably fair shot for a group each time we log on.  So what exactly is your point except you don't see any problems with Warriors?  Cause we got that already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Friss is semi-correct...<br />
<br />
No one can stop a train dead in it's tracks like a warrior.   No one dies faster afterwards than a cleric either.<br />
<br />
But then again, who's exping on trains?   I'd certainly be looking at your puller Friss if this is a common occurence.</div></div><hr />
