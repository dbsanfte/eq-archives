Sorry for not posting earlier. We've been busy with expansion issues since returning to work. We are still working on melee issues, though.<br />
<br />
The Phantom line is back on the merchants on Test and Beta. No changes have been made to it since the last update.<br />
<br />
We are in the process of adding +endurance to existing items. It will be about as prevalent as +mana is for hybrids.<br />
<br />
The opening system as it was on Test will probably not return. The goal was to make combat more interesting and add some reactiveness, but the attention required and randomness of it didn't do much to help with the class balance aspect. We'd rather use skills like the Phantom and Incite line, disciplines, and innate abilities to define and refine the class' role.<br />
<br />
One of the ideas brought up by some players that seemed solid was a way to make monks better at dealing melee damage from any angle. When a monk is fighting from the front, but not tanking, he wouldn't be riposted. When the NPC would have riposted, the monk will instead attack it. The result is that the monk would do about the same damage from the front as from the back and, as long as he wasn't tanking, wouldn't take any riposte damage. Any thoughts on this one? <br />
Hope this helps<br />

<br />
First, they unhooked disc's as a part of this also.  Getting your 3 min aggressive back would also include discs getting hooked back together so you couldn't use it in the first place unless you were real low on the tank line.<br />
<br />
Second, did you read the post?  It is GOOD NEWS.  They are replacing openings with skills we can use ON DEMAND, which is amazingly better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, getting a 3 min aggressive back would mean editing the spell data for discipline: aggressive  to be 3 minutes, and probably upping the end cost per tick so that burning a full 3 minute aggressive would make chaining other discs with it difficult.  It would make the disc an option to use rather than a waste of spell data.   The whole point of the changes was to make easily changed/updated/added-to abilities.  Check Lucy, our discs are in there now, becuase they work like spell effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, they are replacing it with incite.. oh wait.. we already got incite.. they are replacing it with the other on demand skill we have.. Taunt?   Oh wait... we don't have any other on-demand skills!<br />
<br />
un-nerf my overall disc dps would be great.  *IF* they put in some more useful opening moves great!  Maybe they'll have some that will make returning our disc dps to what it was unneccesary.<br />
<br />
Overall the changes have been good, but I still don't like having my dps nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The change in aggressive was part of the overall change to discs.  They decided under this system they don't think a 3 min aggressive is a good idea.  Thus it was changed.  I don't see them changing it back to 3 mins without doing other nerfs.  I would take this shorter aggressive any day over the old way.<br />
<br />
Oh wait... we don't have any other on-demand skills! <br />
<br />
Seriously, you need to learn how to read.  The entire point is that they are not putting the openings in, instead they are working on MORE on demand skills.  They aren't done with them yet, cause they are actually doing it good this time instead of just rushing it off the shelf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the new skills, whatever they are, are gonna be innate, like that monk riposte thing.<br />
<br />
I liked the Openings idea, at least, the fact that you could react in a fight other than pressing auto-attack, I never got to try it so I cant say it was good or bad *shrugs* but the idea overall, wasnt bad.<br />
But I really cant think of any on-demand skills they can add now, and which innates? Maybe some of the Developers can come here and tell us what are they thinking about warriors.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I suspected they might take this approach.  Though you guys had made some good points in defense of the new opening system, it always seemed like a cumbersome concept to me.<br />
<br />
Apparently the developers reached the same conclusion.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they'll &lt;insert personal thoughts on good way to do something&gt; ?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think adding a off hand dmg modifier would solve many of the issues with both dual wield and dps for many. On another note, yeah, I really like the idea of being in control of what abilities (read &quot;techniques&quot;) I use in a given situation. Scrapping the opening system, is a good thing, just get us our &quot;added dps and utility&quot; that you promised.<br />
<br />
Also, curious, just to play devils advocate... was trueshot or any other classes dps disc nerfed? or just aggressive? Just curious since ALL classes discs were unhooked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zhakran</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An ability I would personally LOVE, and I mean *love* to see, is one that was previously an opening move I believe, called Power Slam, or something equally WWF. <br />
<br />
Anyways, an ON DEMAND 4 second stun, works on creatures up to level 65. Either unresistable and has a end cost/reuse time, or resistable but with a resuse time comprable only to that of spells. Only works when you are in melee range, etc. <br />
<br />
This would be a tremendously helpful tool for a lot of situations. Stunning a mob randomly in the middle of a fight for no reason isn't particularly helpful, but being able to do it on a resisted slow to generate aggro/stop it from hurting slower, doing it as a mob starts to run, would be a huge asset, and something I know they were at least considering in the opening moves. <br />
<br />
More dps would be dandy, but I'm wary about anything that gives us too much dps, if we start to encroach on the damage of other classes like monks that are supposed to be better at that.</div></div><hr />

Indeed.  It's not difficult to comprehend single syllable words.<br />
<br />
Now that you're uberleet in EQ however, you might consider expending the small effort it would take to become uberleet as a human being.<br />

I'll keep 12 sec furious and fortitude discs over 3 min aggressive any day.  Once you've used Furious to get the mob into position then defensive, by the time defensive drops the fight wont last long enough to get the benefits from a 3 min disc.  Better to use fellstrike instead ;)<br />

ShaikYerbooty - why don't you just ask Haass out for a movie and a coffee if you want him so bad.  This has to be the 3rd thread I have read in a row where you've tried to hijack with this 'i don't like the way you talk to me' hippy shit.</div></div><hr />

Obviously the implementation was pretty whack, but I wouldn't mind having on-demand stuns, group based DPS boosters, short term roots and some of that other stuff they were talking about. I like what they did with the aggro effect, at any rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oh ya.. nobody knows :P<br />
<br />
<br />
So we still remain dps-nerfed in the meantime.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll reserve judgement on new abilities till we have new abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can read fine AND I actually understand what the changes they made are and how they work.   Changing a timer on an individual disc does NOT require them to scrap the entire system.  Matter of fact, they have changed the timers on these very discs during testing, and they never required them to revert back to the orginal system.....  the whole primary POINT of the disc change was to make them adjustable easily like spells.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes.. while some of the effects of opening moves were neat, the twitch-based opening system did suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uthuk</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DPS nerfed?<br />
<br />
I assume that the #6-7 down the tankline might have been nerfed since they can't use aggressive.<br />
<br />
For the majority of the warriors I can't think that all linked disc and 3 min aggressive is actually a DPS nerf. The new system is more of an DPS increase.<br />
<br />
Any warrior useing the old agressive in exp groups would have died if I was healing :)<br />
If he choose to take 40% extra damage just so he can add some more DPS would just die because I am not going to stretch my mana because my tank is a moron. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For raids warriors got a minor DPS upgrade because they generally couldn't use aggressive unless they were absolutely sure they wouldn't have to step up to tank a boss.<br />
<br />
For XP groups many warriors got a DPS nerf because their AC and defensive AAs provide so much mitigation that it's overkill.  If my cleric never drops below 90% mana why would he care if I take a bit more damage once in awhile to boost my DPS?  I used to pop aggressive every time it was available in an xp group.  Now I pop Fellstrike maybe once every hour or two depending on how fast we're pulling.  Any faster than that and I run out of endurance due to the drain of Incite.<br />
<br />
Hell, half of my xp comes from normal LDON missions where a ranger would work as main healer...  Believe me with 2k AC and a Rune 3 proc I'm not taking much damage.  Most clerics I group with spend more mana nuking than healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dead on.<br />
<br />
Also if you do have spare warriors that aren't likely to be in the MT chain it's a raid nerf on thier dps also.<br />
<br />
If the concern is chaining it with defensive/stonewall on a raid just make the end cost per tick high enough that a full 3 minute aggressive takes most of a full end bar on a fully-statted warrior.  <br />
<br />
That way, the warrior has the option of the old dps level with aggressive if that's either his contribution to the raid or if he's just xp grinding trivial stuff like LDON.<br />
<br />
Right now I can chain stonewall furious and fellstrike and only lose a tick or so tops at the end of the last disc.. when they add End to items and some end regen the only restriction is going to be the disc timers, even with incite.... so if they are going to scrap opening moves they are either going to add more attacks of some type or more discs that either use different timers or does something different.  Right now aggressive is a waste of 2cp since it shares timers with other better offensive discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karmuk</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about giving us 7.5 min re-use on aggressive then?  It's an endurance sucker so people would have to really assess tradeoffs, but if your a DPS tank being able to aggressive as often as a MT stonewalls would be cool.<br />
<br />
I always saw aggressive and defensive as implemented wrong.<br />
<br />
You have your normal balanced fighting style, you should be able to fight aggressively or defensively or normally all the time depending on circumstances.  Since agg and defen have built-in drawbacks it seemed that just getting to chose 1 of 3 possible fighting styles made the most sense.<br />
<br />
Keying them off endurance isn't bad, but we need faster re-use on aggressive or else why not use fellstrike all the time when you need burst DPS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurunt</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep it 1 min (and slightly nerfed)  but  a  short repop time and it becomes useful... an actual alternative to fellstrike... more overall dps, but not as much burst... better for grinds, but not as wanted for the one big fight....  and like Rogue 5 min discs if you chain it you end up running out of end often<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traask</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you want to bin the Openings system, and come up with something else for melee<br />
<br />
1) Make Disarm do something - its been in the game for 4 years and is still totally shite. Ok, so a lot of mobs don't have a weapon. But those that do and are successfully disarmed - should be a 5 second stun and/or big arse aggro.<br />
<br />
2) /Disc Superior for all pure melees - increased damage to Greens (+50%) and Light blues(+20%), half damage to Dark Blues and above. Maybe Take increased damage from all mobs. (sometimes, you just wanna get through the damn yard trash quicker, or find yourself in a green crowd situation alone.)<br />
<br />
3) I don't know how imbalancing it would end up being, but I'd love a Sprint disc too - 5 secs of increased movement rate (That stacks). Might help pure melees in PvP, as well as a get the hell out of dodge ability.<br />
<br />
I still think its a shame you can't take a page out of DAoCs styles and give us special attacks at a cost of endurance, and have successful chains leading to effects(Stun Chain, Snare Chain, DoT Chain) (That whole intellectual property thing is a bitch, I guess) I don't know... I guess its just me who wants to here the Ogre Warrior say.. &quot;Hold pulls a sec... out of Endurance&quot;</div></div><hr />

Like head butt would be a stun, armor break would be a cripple, target(arm) would be a slow, target(leg) would be a snare. All short duration ( like for the slow / snare 1-2 tics and 1-6 seconds for the stun. Maybe perminent for the cripple ).<br />
<br />
So... any idea how they are going to give us some utility or is that just washed down the drain?<br />
