My question is this, given that i'm using the cookie cutter CHoS and SoTB, is this worth picking up as either a main or offhand weapon until the time at which I can aquire something better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, if its a combo not for agro.  if your looking for agro dont take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">prolly worth picking up for the look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sassinak uses rotting fist and will say its nice for aggro, probably better than your combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Absolutely ZERO agro. <br />
And the DoT while fun, sucks bigtime (mez).<br />
<br />
Not worth it at all (exept as a toy or for the looks if it is free)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">pick one up. If you ever make it to PoTime, pick an ethereal destroyer. Dual wield them and watch ppl drooling over your unique looking weapon setup =x.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its very good for dps when youre not MT.<br />
<br />
with an anger/yak aug you could probably get by tanking xp groups with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hello Mez breaker  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I replaced CHSD with the Fist and it was definitely an aggro upgrade, although not a huge one; so it would be an upgrade from CHOS too.<br />
<br />
If you don't see weapons with aggro procs in your near future, then you could put anger 3 on this and it would be okay.  When I took it, my guild didn't touch Ssra or AOW and wasn't close to RZTW.  I would have taken any 16+1/19 or 17+1/20 weapon from Tier 3 and put Anger 3 on it at the time.  If you are in the same situation then maybe it's worth considering.  I consider it equivalent to Agnarr sword, Jiva sword, GRMK, or a fully aug'd LDON weapon.<br />
<br />
I know that this weapon violates all of the collective wisdom of this site, and yet I have managed to tank for my guild through elementals with it: LMM, RZTW, SolRo, Quavonis, Offossa just to name a few.  My feeling is that any weapon with a ratio near 1:1 is okay aggro when it has Anger 3 on it.  Naturally, better aggro weapons would be better, but so far my guild's bad luck with aggro weapons persists (zero BoW, zero SEWS, 2 months after reaching elementals), so we make do.<br />
<br />
The Fist outaggros the GBOS and the OSOW.  Bloodfrenzy outaggros it.  BOC beats it by a small margin.  Scourge is a DD + DOT + 4 disease counters, and it appears to produce aggro from all 3 of these components.  I would estimate its hate value at 250 points initially plus 24/tick for 21 ticks.  In 5 months I've had mez trouble maybe 5 times.  Generally, if I'm attacking a mob, then it's not a mez target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had  BBoE / BoC .And i got the fist because i wanted it for its looks (1st on the server).<br />
While using it, i was really disapointed.<br />
<br />
The DPS was good, but the agro was really crappastic.<br />
I clearly remember half procs going unnoticed in Valor/Tactics/BoT.<br />
Somethings which never happend with BBoE/BoC.<br />
<br />
Of course LDoN changes that, but its not &quot;an agro weapon&quot; by any means.<br />
Its a toy with a decent ratio and unique looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Diseased based dots aren't much aggro compared to poison based dots.  Any aggro you get from this weapon would be from the dps until you augment it with an anger proc.<br />
<br />
Ask any BST what they use for aggro when using DoTs and it'll always be a poison based spell.  I can chain cast plague with a warrior tanking and the mob won't even look at me.  1 cast of scorpion venom and it's all over me (on my bst alt).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i have to agree poison &gt; aggro than disease<br />
a necro can cast dark plague with no aggro problem, but if he lands blood of thule its very different</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use GBoS/Rotting Fist combo and I agree that the Fist on it's own isnt very good aggro. I did slap an Anger 2 aug on it though and it seems to do the job just fine.</div></div><hr />
