<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warhead42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I'm quite new to Everquest, been playing about 2 months now, and have managed to claw my way up to level 53, where I'm finding it EXTREMELY difficult to progress further.<br />
<br />
My magelo link is up to date and accurate (sadly).  I know that my equipment is sub-par, and I'm currently in the process of farming pp to purchase better gear from the bazaar.  My current farm location is HGs in RM, which yields about 350pp an hour (I can kill 4-6 of them before I have to stop and heal).<br />
<br />
I intend to purchase a CHoS (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010) (~8kpp) first, followed by two Valorium Rings of Gallantry (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17482) (~7kpp each).  After that, I really don't know what I want to do.<br />
<br />
I should probably start looking for EF LDoN groups so that I can at least get a couple of Anger II augs to help maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
Despite my sub-par equipment, I don't have TOO much trouble maintaining aggro in normal LDoNs when I'm near the average level in the group.  PoP groups (mainly PoI and PoN, I don't have problems in PoJ) are a different story, though.  Not only do I have trouble maintaining aggro against higher level mobs, but my low HP (even with virtue/focus/brells and a +STA buff, I barely clear 5k) eats the clerics mana quickly.<br />
<br />
Okay, time to wrap up the novel.  I'm hoping that some of you experienced warriors and players in general can help out a newer player in selecting some decent yet reasonably priced equipment to help me bump up my AC and HP.  Some assistance regarding pp farming locations that I can handle would also be appreciated.  I'll be thankful for any advice that could be tossed my way.  Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

If you can find someone who can make you some fierce heradic armor pieces if you can farm the parts that would big a big gain for you.  Some crafters will do the combine for a pretty cheap rate.  Find someone with as high of skill as possible since you usually lose the materials if they fail.<br />
<br />
There are some LDON normal drop pieces that are pretty cheap like the amulet of mummy wrappings thats better then you neck and some halfway decent shoulders forget the name of them.  Jagged inset or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Another farming place to consider is Crystal Caverns.<br />
<br />
Geonids are pretty favored, but slaughtering the orcs will give a few pp, velium weapons, and a few low end gems, plus usual runes and pages stuff.<br />
<br />
The kicker is the velium drops... can easily go into the dorf town down there and transfer velium to the shared bank, log over to bazaar mule, and empty it out when shared bank gets full.<br />
<br />
Rates on velium vary but still a decent way to make a few pp while sleepin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warhead42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DI:  I'll do some research as to what I need for the fierce heraldic stuff.  I've also been hemming and hawing about spending LDoN points in BB or NRo (only place I have points), but I've been holding off, hoping that something better would become available soon.<br />
<br />
Azaza:  I tried farming geonids in CC once.  I found it a semi-annoying (not overly difficult, but a lot of dead ends and the like) place to get to, and then accidentally zoned back into EW because I didn't know where exactly the zone line was.  I didn't think about whirling through the orcs for velium.  I'll give that a try.<br />
<br />
Thank you both for your quick responses to my questions.  I hope to put the advice into use shortly. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Should try animals in natimbi, velks, seb, then planes finally to get to level 65 asap - it will be much easier then for you to get ldons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The cultural armor is going to be your &quot;get me to 65&quot; option, alright.<br />
And yep the droga weapons and anger augments are good too.<br />
And if this is your main, you don't have all the plat you need to get all this stuff, heh.<br />
Farming and the bazaar will get you there eventually. But....<br />
<br />
If you want a break from farming and you have some friends, here are some possibilities for fighting for better armor than you have now. I'm not listing them in any particular order.<br />
1. Lower-level LDoN stuff. Even the 150-point stuff from BB would be an improvement and give you a couple of levels of breathing room. The drawbacks are that you won't use this armor for long, and you're spending LDoN time that could be going to augments/top end armor. The benefits are that you don't have to worry about the random number generator &amp; rare drops; you are fighting rather than farming; and that you can actually get enough points in a normal adventure at 53 so that you might be able to afford this armor.<br />
2. There are a couple of Cobalt drops in Karnor's Castle you might be able to fight for with a few friends: the boots (AC 25) drop off the Caller of Sathir in courtyard 1; and the gauntlets (AC 25) drop off Drolvarg captain, also fairly near the front of the zone. Drawbacks: your current haste is in your hands, it's hard to get a group to go to Karnor's nowadays, and the drops can be irritatingly rare.<br />
3. Thurgadin armor quests (Champion's armor, I think the easiest of the Velius quest armors to get, though it's not the best of them). You go to Kael with some friends, kill giants and keep your fingers crossed that the quest component drops. Drawbacks: drops are kinda rare, you have to have the right faction with the dwarves in Thurgadin (but that's not too hard to get--just whack giants), this is not the greatest armor in the world, and these guys are not hill giants--you do need some friends. But, the armor again would be an upgrade, and you'd get to fight for it, and sometimes you can actually convince people to go to Kael.<br />
4. Go to Crypt of nadox and hope for steel wrapped stuff to drop. All the usual drawbacks to hunting for your gear apply, and you will need friends, the more the merrier. But, go to Alla and search for &quot;steel wrapped&quot; for the stats.<br />
5. Go to Veksar with a group and hunt there. Be careful, methodical. Research the zone before you go. Feral Lord Gulok drops kylong shinguards and the rotting (rotted?) shopkeeper the soulscream belt. You can really use a shaman getting in and out, some mobs are casters, adds are easy to get. but all of these problems have solutions.<br />
<br />
I'd mention the draconic shoulders, but Caramaj did in an earlier post.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that doing these things will actually get you a suit of armor any faster than farming. But you have a puncher's chance of upgrades. Veksars is an interesting zone; it and Kael may provide the casters amongst your friends with some stuff they can use too (nadox may as well, I just never paid attention).<br />
<br />
In these places life would be easier if your friends were in their upper 50s rather than their upper 40s, and of course if they are good players, that's a plus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For someone whose main is their lvl 42 warrior (ie. will be poor for a while), til what level will these shoulders be adequate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Until either you are in a situation to upgrade where you can upgrade without much sacrifice, or you are max sta+12 sta(to replace the 12 you would lose) and just buy a hp only shoulder item.<br />
<br />
Or, more easily spoken as, 60+ easily, even 65 if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Level to 55 and buy a GSoT<br />
<br />
 :D <br />
<br />
If you're hurting for cash and looking to do extensive farming ... grind to lv 55 somewhere and buy this stick.  It's much better than wasting 8k on 1 weapon which by itself isnt nearly as good as the staff.  You need to buy lots of upgrades, so i'd concentrate on what will upgrade you the most for the the least (best bang for your buck).<br />
<br />
It's aggro is impressive and its dps is on par (and imo a little bit better) than the droga combo ... and you can buy it for under 200p if you keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
That said, looking at your magelo i would concentrate on a full set of fierce heraldic and a pair of valorium rings.  I would also look into buying a solstice pack.  That earing is quite the bargain for only 3-4k.<br />
<br />
For farming:<br />
<br />
Fungus grove is good xp and loot at your level (need a small group)<br />
Velks is a decent place for xp and coin<br />
Farming Hill giants in Rathe MTs is easy plat (although boring)<br />
<br />
ps- Full suit of Fierce heraldic and a GSoT will do more for your aggro, dps, ac, hps than anything else.  The Valorium rings are nice stat boosters, but i would work on a full set of FH before i threw cash away on the rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karnloft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Level to 55 and buy a GSoT<br />
<br />
Pardon the ignorance, but what's a GSoT?<br />
<br />
And can I solo the giants in Rathe at 42?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">soloing at 42 in RM is probably doable, though it wont be worth your time imo unless you have lots of twink regen items.<br />
<br />
GSoT = Greatstaff of thunder<br />
<br />
31/30 2hb with a planar stun proc ... 85hp and 10-15ac plus some stats.<br />
<br />
Its aggro is on par with CHoS + SoBS combo (costs 15-16k for the pair) and you can find it for 50-100pp on most servers.  The dps on the stick is slightly better imo at lv 65, though a lucky string of procs might tip the scales in favor of the droga combo.<br />
<br />
If money is an issue though, GSoT runs circles around any other weapons period.  You won't find more bang for your buck anywhere from any other item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Karnloft,<br />
the draconic (AC: +15 Str: +12 Sta: +12 Fire Resist: +6 Cold Resist: +6) is really pretty close to your cultural armor in that slot, so can last you until lvl 65 or close to it.<br />
It would be hard for you to do this quest at the moment (at lvl 42), though, unless you had some higher-level friends to help you out.<br />
For cultural armor ingrediants:<br />
