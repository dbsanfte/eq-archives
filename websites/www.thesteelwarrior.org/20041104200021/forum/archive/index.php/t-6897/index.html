<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know the answer to this question is flying all around the boards, but the more I seem to read about it, the more confused I get... So I was hoping to ask it here, by itself to see if you guys could help me understand it:<br />
<br />
If I have two weapons, one procs great agro, and the other procs ok agro...  yet the ok agro weap has a better delay (and ratio for that matter) which should I put in my primary?<br />
<br />
More specifically (this is probably just going to confuse me more, but I really want to understand how duel weilding works) will I get more procs out of my mainhand weap then out of my offhand weap?  <br />
I have heard it said that the proc rate is based on X procs per minute, and if you are hasted, or slowed, you will still proc around the same amount each minute.  And since you also proc when you miss, it seems as if it wouldn't matter which hand the good-proc weap is in...  But I'm not a hundred percent certain if this is true, and if it is, there still could be an innate proc reduction to offhand...  <br />
<br />
Anyway, really I just want to know the answer to the first question, and if you can, a little info in general about how duel weild works.  I hate being ignorant about anything that is important to my class... even if I'm still in my early 20's  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On average you get 2 procs per minute in your main hand and 1 proc per minute in your offhand.  This is with 305 dex and no WA.<br />
<br />
It has been shown that your dps aggro is also roughly half in your offhand, although your actual dps is about 66pct if you put something in your offhand (ie if you do 100dps with a weapon in your main hand, expect to do roughly 66dps with it in your offhand)<br />
<br />
Generally if you have a good hate proc'ing weapon you want that in your mainhand, although if the hate on the other weapon isn't too far below the proc weapon and it's dps is significantly higher then it might actually be better aggro to have it in your main hand instead of the proc weapon.  It would be a strange situation most likely though so you're probably safe sticking the proc aggro weapon in your mainhand.</div></div><hr />
