<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the helm drops in VT off DXV i beleive. hategiver is EXTREMELY rare. killed cursed 10ish times, had 4 bloodfrenzies drop, but weve gotten lucky on those. not gotten any renders. and theres no blackened acryla bastardsword, theres an acryla handled bastard sword off emp that we never got in like 4 or 5 kills, but as a warrior its a waste for you to get it really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Killed Cursed Cylce about 8 times ... never saw a blood frenzy.   Never saw a hategiver on about 9 XTC Kills.  Have saw 4 or 5 of the helms drop in about 15 clearings of VT though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just short of 20 XTC Kills, no Hategiver, 15 Cursed Kills, 1 Bloodfrenzy (and that was back when most of our Warriors had already BoW or SEWS). I've seen the Acrylia several times, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Random.  There's a hundred posts on bloodfrenzy/hategiver droprates. <br />
<br />
Cursed drops a weapon every kill, so you have a 1/6 chance of a bloodfrenzy per kill, but it's highly variable just like everything in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Are you maybe talking about Great Helm of True Vision that drops in SSRA off AR, Nelkin?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BoC is much more common than hategiver or bloodfrenzy.  in 20 kills of AOW you will probably get 10+ BoC, while in 20 kills of Cursed and XTC you will be lucky to get more than 1 hategivers and 2-3 bloodfrenzies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We killed cursed upwards of 30 or more times back when we were in ssra, got maybe 3 bloodfrenzies. XTC not as much, maybe 15-20 kills and 1 hategiver. Acrylia Handled Broadsword is relatively rare, but not as much, I would say maybe 1 every 5 emp kills or so, it's a good dps weapon for the level of content for a warrior, but youll hafta fight rangers and rogues and whatnot for 'em. As for Vyz`Dra's Render, it's been about as rare as bloodfrenzy for us, if not rarer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We killed Cursed and XTC about 30 times each and got 1 HG and 2 BF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We killed cursed I think 14 times. No bloodfrenzy. About 12 times on XTC and 1 hategiver.<br />
<br />
<br />
SSraa was not kind to my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Everyone knows that the correct answer is: 0% for those who want/need Ssra loot, 75% for those who will let it rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nelkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yes i meant helm of true vision not great helm of shadow......my bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We got 2 or 3 helms in probably 20 AL kills.<br />
<br />
Several BF, like 5 or 6 in prolly 20 kills.<br />
<br />
Render was our most dropped cursed weapon, must be 9 or 10 (yes as u can see we got very few other weapons, 1 fangs, 2 khalzashar, 2 goldenrod, 0 claws)<br />
<br />
1HG but we only did XTC about 4 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">30'ish CC kills, no bloodfrenzy  - 25'ish XTC kills and 1 hategiver. - great helm of true vision from AL drops 50% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">8 BF's in 29 kills.  I think we have been extremely lucky with drops.   Atleast I am content with mine :)<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned boc's being more common, just as a note... we have 15 boc's out of 24 kills.<br />
<br />
<br />
No hategivers seen, but we didn't spend much time killing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">6 Cursed Kills no BF<br />
5 XtC Kills 2 HG<br />
4 AoW Kills no BoC<br />
2 RZtW Kills no BoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Previous Guild:<br />
<br />
8 for 28(I think) BF's from Cursed.<br />
0 for 8 Hategivers.<br />
<br />
New Guild:<br />
<br />
Been 4 months or so since we have done RZTW. but 2 for 12 on BoW's. and the 2 bows dropped on the same kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was only on one raid to SSRA so far.<br />
We killed XTC and Hategiver dropped. I got it for the minimum bid of 2 Raidpoints because nobody else was there who could need it. Lucky me  :) <br />
We killed Cursed too, but no Bloodfrenzy dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">and if we are adding BoCs and BoWs to the list too, like 1 and 6 for BoCs, and 1 and 3 for BoWs. our luck is complete crap for BoCs but with about a 50% droprate on bloodfrenzies im happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">let's see.<br />
<br />
3 xtc, 0 h8giver <br />
5 vyzhdra, 0 bf<br />
5 rztw, 2 bow (both on kill #5)<br />
6 aow, we had... 5 bocs. we had 3 drop on 1 kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bloodfrenzy = 15 / 46<br />
Hategiver = 6 / 23<br />
Blade of Carnage = 8 / 10<br />
Helm of True Vision = 4 / 29<br />
Blade of War = 7 / 17<br />
<br />
This was a long time ago though heh, i think we got Bloodfrenzy's on like our first 5 kills in a row.</div></div><hr />
