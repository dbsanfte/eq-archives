<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gerili</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright first here is the scenerio.  <br />
<br />
52 warrior (deleveled from 53) twink sole purpose in life is naggy and vox.<br />
<br />
Currently 1aa<br />
<br />
I have tested him out a few times on dragons (mainly Lady Vox) and have noticed difficulty holding aggro during the fight.  My survivability factor is pretty well.  Dragon fear has been always resisted, and while I still suffer some damage on the aoe breath weapon it has been significantly reduced.  Am currently using the shrunken goblin skull earring so am able to maintain almost all of my buffs throughout the fight.  The problem I seem to have atm is holding aggro throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
I overall feel I am lacking in the dps department, particularly against lady vox who has a higher cold resist (resisting procs from both weapons).  Currently contemplating buying a fleshgrinder to replace my frostbringer.<br />
<br />
Before I invest 20-25k in a weapon for my twink was curious if anyone could take a peak at the equipment and possibly recommend some equipment that would be better to fill my needs.  Perhaps there are some cheaper methods out there to fulfill my overall needs.<br />

<br />
EDIT: though I have not used them several warriors rave about the Troll smithed yak's, I haven't found a Grand Master Troll smith on Xev yet though, so personally I can't say anything about them.</div></div><hr />

It procs a lot and should do well on Vox.  Might Want to keep your current weapons for Naggy though.</div></div><hr />
