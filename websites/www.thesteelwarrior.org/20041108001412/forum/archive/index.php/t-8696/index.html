I took a break from banking my 30 and went for my marshall title and flurry.  Finally, after 3 or 4 days of hard grinding, i hit the top level (raging flurry3).  I was skeptical at first as flurry was only going off once every other fight ... but right at the end level i'm now getting up 11-15 flurries per fight duel wielding depending on luck.<br />
<br />
It goes off quite a bit, and i imagine once i snag a BoWar it will help quite a bit with aggro and dps output.<br />
<br />
Now i just need ferocity 1-3 and PB 1-3 ... and the last 2 levels of TM.<br />
<br />
Flurry rox!!!!!11!!1!</div></div><hr />

You can proc during flurry, so Flurry is a proc of swings that you can additionally proc from, increasing total ppm (i think.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can proc on a flurry???<br />
<br />
&quot;up to 11-15 flurries per fight duel wielding depending on luck&quot;  Key words: &quot;up to&quot;  I generally average a flurry every 5-10 seconds, but i've had a few fights where it goes off practically every other round duel wield and other fights where it goes off once.  It's all subject to the RNG.   Point was, it sucked at the first and 2nd level, but went up drastically towards the end.  Another thing you have to consider is that i'm still duel wielding atm for my aggro, and i have noticed that you flurry more often with faster weapons than with, say, a slower 2hander.  I dont regret any of the 42 total aa it took me to buy them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Newb question incomming here:  It was stated that you can proc on a flurry ... can you proc more than once in any single round from the same weapon?  IE:  If i had an anger3 BoWar and i scored a hexa-hit (innate tripple + punishing blade + flurry) ... could i proc say multiple procs on that swing with luck?  Or does flurry just provide you with more opportunities to proc any given round?  The real reason i'm asking is for shakerpaging reasons.  More procs = more dmg = more dead mobs on rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've noticed that you could, i don't know if it was from the original hits or the hits that come from flurry, but I have noticed more procrate during flurries :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I believe it was stated in another thread that you can only proc once per round.<br />
<br />
But since your proc rate is less than 1 per round, the extra swings will still increase your likelihood of getting a proc on each round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds right.  Thanks sass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As far as I knew, you have a chance to proc each swing of your wep (even if you don't hit).  If this is true, then yes, you will increase your proc rate with flurry, and with punishing blade etc.etc.<br />
<br />
I have my proc messages in a seperate window with all damage turned on in it (for parsing) which means I really don't have any clue when I'm procing and when I'm not.  That spam is just way too fast in a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't think you are limited to 1 proc per round.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hmm proc rates i thought were based on time not number of swings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hmm proc rates i thought were based on time not number of swings?<br />
<br />
<br />
I may be wrong but this is my understanding:<br />
<br />
You have a set % chance to proc every single swing based on the delay of the weapon, placement of the weapon (offhand/primary), and the degree of swing altering buffs/items (ie: haste spell, song, item and/or slow effects).   Over time, the numbers work out so that you have the standard procs per minute being average.   So basically, it has nothing to do with time persay ... but more to do with the delay of weapon, dexterity, and speed altering stuffs ... all of which average out to a set rate over time.  This could account for why you get 20 procs in one fight and 2 in the next ... it is all random which averages out ... not based on a set time interval.<br />
<br />
What i dont know is this:  does number of successful swings enter into the equation?  Ie if youre getting more swings on average from the same weapon with the same speed modifiers, does it cause you to get more procs?  Or does the system work itself out so that you get the same procs no matter how much you are swinging.  My guess, and those that i've gathered so far lean towards the idea that getting aa's such as flurry, punishing blade, and ferocity increase your proc rates (even if only slightly) in the long run.<br />
<br />
I do not know the answer to this.   The other questions i had were:<br />
<br />
Can you proc on a flurry?<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Can you proc more than once in a round?  Ie: can you proc twice from a 2hander on a successful double/tripple/quad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bashiae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't have any logs to prove it at hand right now, but I can confirm that, as Brutal mentioned, I have proced twice in the same round on numerous occasions (with the same procs, not two different ones).<br />
<br />
As for the ability to proc from the extra swings added by a flurry, I cannot honestly say one way or the other.  I see no logical reason you can't proc from it, but I don't have any proof that would indicate it either increases or decreases your proc rate at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I thought it had been confirmed long ago that procs were per minute, not per swing.  That's why if you're slowed, you proc more times per swing so that the procs per minute equal out to the same.  So people wanting to AE earthshaker proc with rampage disc grab a big slow weapon and slow themselves to increase the likelihood of immediate procs.  <br />
<br />
Given that combat haste and slow apparently has no effect on procs per minute, I wouldn't expect flurry, PB, or ferocity to have an effect either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Regardless,<br />
<br />
Flurry, Ferocity, and PB make a HUGE difference in your aggro reliability.  It will slaughter you on riposte if you're Dual Weilding but for a 2hander it's insanely awesome.<br />
<br />
Using my ubar druav blade it is possible w/o taunt to pb, flurry and ferocity my way to the top of the aggro list (tauntless, no incite, etc just swings) vs a non- similar AA war.<br />
<br />
It's good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Can't riposte a flurry I thought.  Could just be npc flurry though I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">DW: 3 swings main hand, 2 off hand, and 2 from Flurry = 7 swings max in 1 round<br />
2her: 3 swings main hand, 1 from PB and 2 from Flurry = 6 swings max in 1 round<br />
<br />
will this 1 swing differance really &quot;slaughter you on riposte&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Your 2-hander has the same delay as your 1-handers?  If not, you'll have a lot more melee rounds in a given timespan dual-wielding than with a 2-hander.  I think that's where the big potential riposte dmg comes in, not the 1 extra attack per round.  (Although I guess maybe your point was that the AAs that add swings will scale the same for 1-handers vs 2-handers, in which case, nevermind. ;))<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't think there are that many mobs out there where it really makes much of a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">we all know that everyone has a set # of procs in a minute average, which is 2 in the mainhand with 305 dex, no aa or mods. no matter how much you're swinging, you're gonna average 2ppm. to stay at that 2ppm, your proc chance per swing has to go down if your # of swings in that time goes up. so if you're blazing away with some 1hers, your chance to proc per swing will be lower than your chance to proc per swing if you had a big beefy 2hs, but you will still average the same amount of procs over time.<br />
<br />
or the extra swings from flurry just dont count at all for procs and the procs you're seeing on those rounds are coming from the normal first few swings in the flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you're worried about ripostes, don't use 1handers.  Taking riposte damage from the Flurry AA is too infinately small to talk about.  Don't get me wrong, riposte damage can mess you up, but normally in a raid type setting, the CH will, or hopefully, have it covered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Crizpin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, as far as I can tell, from all the rampage data I have done, you can only proc once per round. This is assuming that rampage works the same as a normal attack round. You never proc more then once per rampage round on a single mob, no matter how many attacks you actually attempt on it. If you did proc every swing attempt, you would do more then 246 * # of mobs at max slow and WA 5. It would most likely average out to double this. And the data just doesn't support such a large swing (IE double the essential AE rampage damage) that this would produce. Of course like mentioned, this assumes that a rampage round is considered the same as a normal attack round, which from what I see it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Basthird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Proc once per round ?<br />
<br />
how come i sometime get 2 or even 3 proc a round ?<br />
<br />
<br />
ive seen it happen ever strike proced its very rare but it has happend<br />
<br />
<br />
as for FLurry ... its better using it with dual wield cause faster you hit more flurry you get but Flurry will cause more damage on 2hander :) any flurry owns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Your proc rate is COMPLETELY independant of the number of swings.... why else would you think you would want to be SLOWED when you you perform a &quot;shakerpage&quot; hehe... its based off number of opportunities per increment of time.... thus if I only have one opportunity for that time slot I am guaranteed a proc on that ooportunity... the more opportunities the less chance I will proc on any given opportunity... it still equates to the same number of procs per time increment....<br />
<br />
This works for a shakerpage since you basically get as close as you can to that &quot;one opportunty&quot;... and with rampage.. for sure yes.. you can proc way morew than once per round... now multiple procs per mob per round.. I dont know hehe.... but ther eis nothing like making the server work for 5-6 minutes to catch up with your DPS on a good page run....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't know about  bonus swings from Flurry, but you can certainly proc  more than once per round - I have proc'd numerous times on both swings of a Double Attack (with a regular old 2H, before I had any levels of Flurry).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hmm I've never procced more than once per round, I have procced off both hands at the same time however.

<br />
This is the basic idea kazzuk ... being slowed without haste item falls under the &quot;swing speed altering buff/item&quot; category.  What no one is certain is will swinging more times at &quot;x&quot; speed with &quot;y&quot; weapon increase proc rate/chance?  I'm curious if aa's and average number of swings per round is in the calculations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">What no one is certain is will swinging more times at &quot;x&quot; speed with &quot;y&quot; weapon increase proc rate/chance?<br />
<br />
<br />
i am quite certain that the faster you swing, the less % chance you have to proc on those swings, thus creating the average proc rate. <br />
<br />
if you get yourself a 100dly weapon, and somehow are able to swing it like it was a 20dly weapon, it would have the same chance to proc per swing as a regular 20dly weapon.<br />
<br />
i dont recall any time that i proced twice in the same round. and i notice that the people who are saying they have before are wielding 1h weapons, are you guys sure it wasnt just the seperate rounds for each of your hands lining up at the same time, or close to the same time, and having both weapons proc on those rounds? making it look like you proced twice in the same round?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Svan, I think you're missing the thrust of apolyon's question.  If you buy an AA that gives you 10% more swings per minute, do those bonus swings get cancelled out of the proc rate or not?  Most of us think that the 'bonus' AA swings represent bonus opportunities to proc, but I don't think it's been proven either way.<br />
<br />
Crizpin raised a different, and even more interesting, question.  I never noticed this, but it sounds like you can double-attack (and more) on each mob that you hit with rampage?  If that is true, then AA's that provide extra swings would increase your proc rate when rampaging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I thought you could only proc one per attack round, so having flurry wouldnt make you proc more because you have the same amount of attack rounds.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have less/no double attack and proc just as much as other class's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What no one is certain is will swinging more times at &quot;x&quot; speed with &quot;y&quot; weapon increase proc rate/chance?

<br />
Actually... your proc rate has ZERO to do with the numbers of swings.. I know it is hard but get the idea of the number of swings out of your head.. it is incorrect.  Your proc rate is actually encoded into the weapon itself.... MOST have no modifier and meet the 2 procs per minute at 65 with 305 dex average. (yes dexterity and skil, i.e. level also have an effect) Your proc rate is a function of time and time alone once the variables are filled in.... (of course you do have to actually swing at least once to even be able to proc... but it is not based of number of swings in any wave shape or form, this has been EXTENSIVELY parsed both here and on the old boards, we are talking multiple data sets greater than 12 hours!).<br />
<br />
Most of the parsing was done before lucy and magelo had detrmineed that one of the unknown fields they had been collecting data wise was in fact the proc rate modifier (they figured that out based on comparing their data with our parses) and was before Weapons Affinity was counted in... I believe with WA5 you can count on 20% more procs per minute but last I checked there were no super large data sets that proved this (unlike the average proc rate data set).<br />
<br />
Also.. another little known tidbit.. while you do have to swing in order to be eligable for a proc.. you dont actually have to hit the mob melee wise to proc  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well...actually..what has been proven:<br />
<br />
1. From parses: it was shown on the average that 2PPM at 305 dex.  This is a constant regardless of delay (it scales with weapon delay...so at higher delays you more likely to see a proc per swing but overall frequency of 2PP is constant).<br />
<br />
2. That there is a value of Lucys that dictates proc rate.  That only a select few number of weapons have a value that allows more than 2 PPM.<br />
<br />
3. That WA will increase your PPM to 4 with WA5.  That there is a bigger relative increase from WA3 to WA4 than any other WA level (see parse thread here somehwere).<br />
<br />
What has NOT been proven (yet stated here as a fact):<br />
<br />
1. No parse has been posted that compares PPM for someone with full Flurry/PB/Fero AA vs someone without. This would settle the extra attack issue.<br />
<br />
I strongly believe you are right in your assertion; that PPM shouldnt be impacted by extra attacks...however thats just a theory until proven by parses not a fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Crizpin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Probably the best way to prove it is simply this. Calculate what your proc per swing should be shakerpaging without slow. Don't use any haste though. So that would put you at a 70 delay with Earthshaker.  So, you should get approx 8.5 attack rounds a minute. (60/7). At 305 dex, with WA 5, the accepted value is what, 4 ppm? So, your proc rate should equal to about 47% (rounded up). Then, go to fire. Pull all of field one. Rampage. Here is the fun part, sorting through the data. Count the mobs you had, let's say you had 50. So with 50 mobs, at a 47% proc rate, you should proc 23.5 times (24 for rounding). Repeat this over a few days. You don't have to use PoFire, I just prefer it due to the fact you won't end up killing anything and skewing your results by missing procs. If you proc more then the 47% rate consistently, then you have your answer that multiple swings in one round in fact does raise your chance to proc. <br />
<br />
But I can tell you flat out, from all the rampage data I have done, it doesn't. You only proc once per combat round with a single hand. We already agree on how to calculate the percentage chance to proc on any weapon based on AA and dex and any innate weapon modifiers. We have been able to, because multiple attacks in one round on the same hand do not increase your chance to proc. if it did, those numbers would start skewing alot higher as double attack, triple attack, and flurry rates go up. But I have seen no evidence that this happens or logs proving it.  As I get the time, I will try to compile my logs that I have and make more. <br />

<br />
This should be extremely easy to test.  There are quite a few 400+ AA'd warriors around here, and quite a few brand new 65's.  There are also a lot of cheapo weapons in the bazaar that can be used to test.<br />
<br />
I'd volunteer, but I don't have Flurry 3-6, and I don't anticipate getting them for awhile yet...gotta finish up WA.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">if youre getting more swings on average from the same weapon with the same speed modifiers, does it cause you to get more procs? Or does the system work itself out so that you get the same procs no matter how much you are swinging. My guess, and those that i've gathered so far lean towards the idea that getting aa's such as flurry, punishing blade, and ferocity increase your proc rates (even if only slightly) in the long run.<br />
<br />
Given that combat haste and slow apparently has no effect on procs per minute, I wouldn't expect flurry, PB, or ferocity to have an effect either.<br />
<br />
I agree with the first post, and posted such a theory a long time ago. The simple reasoning is that it would be to expect too much for the server code to examine your AA's and work out your chance to proc per hit based on not only your weapon delay and haste but also your ranks of Ferocity, ranks of Flurry, ranks of Raging Flurry, ranks of Punishing Blade, whether you have Ambidexterity. It's not a lot to program a function for I know but it's still not something I believe would be taken into account. <br />
<br />
And it's not only those skills but the similar ones for all the other melee classes. It's much simpler and vastly less memory/processor/hard-disc intensive just to call the function with weapon delay and haste each attack round (plus your double attack skill and triple attack chance) and not with every other variable that affects your number of swings as well. <br />
<br />
It COULD be that the Flurry 'function' is called after this  and that you cannot therefore proc on a flurry and this could also be true of Punishing Blade  but it wouldn't be feasible to apply the same to Ambidexterity or Ferocity, unless it first works out the impact of every AA you have that can affect your number of swings per attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">PPM wouldn't be impacted by the number of swings you have, this is very simple to observe, and doesn't even require parsing.  Simply proc a weapon.  The proc check comes before any melee check, which means it can't check the number of swings you're getting to modifiy the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">But does the &quot;proc check&quot; happen once for the round, or once for each melee swing?  That is not so simple to observe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">3. That WA will increase your PPM to 4 with WA5. That there is a bigger relative increase from WA3 to WA4 than any other WA level (see parse thread here somehwere).<br />
<br />
From 2 PPM to 4?  No, WA5 is +50% to your base proc rate.  So it increases it at 305 dex to 3 PPM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">there is a proc thread with parse and peice of log in the library.<br />
what came from is that :<br />
<br />
1. even 10H parses can't find any improvement in PPM from DW to DW+Ambi get there is an improvement in the number of succesfull DW.<br />
2. log shown multiple times three proc in a combat round but always from three different proc.<br />
3. log shown multiple times the offhand procing in a combat round even if the offhand didn't swing !! (ie successful first proc check but unsucessfull DW check).<br />
<br />
4. what logs didn't show after multiple 10H sessions is two proc on the same swing.<br />
5. what logs didn't show after multiple 10H sessions is a single proc firing twice in the same combat round.<br />
<br />
6. it is assume that the proc rule is weapon &gt; aug &gt; buff (note that we don't know for innate proc (NPC) and disc proc (our new rune proc) they could be seen alike and being on top of the list but this is just an 'I assume ...' ).<br />
<br />
7. it as been reported (but not log shown) that you can proc even if you can hit your target because of the 'out of range' message.<br />
<br />
8. Flurry rate is highly variable but seams to be low on average and seams not to influance ppm that much.<br />
<br />
<br />
From this I suggest the procedure following (even if I don't like it that much) :<br />
 * the first and the last point tend to say that increasing the average swing number per round doesn't increase the proc rate.<br />
 * the ppm for each proc is calculated from DEX,WA, proc rate mod and wearing hand.<br />
 * the rpm (round per minute) is calculated from weapon delay and haste (remember that there are separated for each hand).<br />
 * the chance to proc per round is calculated for each proc from the numbers above.<br />
 * theese proc rates are fixed on our character file (only updated when changing gears, buff, ...).<br />
 * during the round, the procs check is made multiple time (as much as swing check ?). but after a successfull proc, the proc rate of this particular proc is set to zero untill the next round to prevent the same proc to fire more than once and thus help other to fire once.<br />
 * during the procs checking, the check is made from the first to the last untill one fires or we run out of proc. thus we have a proc order in ppm (ex: BoC+aug gives 1.99ppm + 1.95ppm after 10H parse and BBB+aug gives 2.66ppm + 1.89ppm) and we can't fire more than one proc per attempt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, this is not perfect, but it could explain theese strange logs...<br />
<br />
Note : a fully slowed warrior wearing a weighted axe should have less than two round per minute. so he can test the proc system more accurately if he make parses between AAs (WA, Flurry, Raging Flurry, Punishing Blade).</div></div><hr />
