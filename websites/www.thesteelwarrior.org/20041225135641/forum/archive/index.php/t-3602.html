These augs cost more then any other weapon augments<br />
<br />
Then why the hell cant they do damage as well? Do we have to sacrifice damage for a broken taunt skill? If these piece of crap patches for agro generation need to be used then they should at the very least just be that..... the addition of a agro increasing element to a weapon, not the replacement of.<br />
<br />
Knights can add 150 damage weapon procs to weapons and still generate a metric fuck ton of agro(marginalizing warriors even more in the damage department) while if we want to be optimal we need to add these asstastic procs to our weapons.<br />
<br />
HELLO WARRIORS DONT WANT TO PUT NON DAMAGE PROCS ON WEAPONS.<br />
<br />
This pisses me off to no end because these arnt like the EB weapons (which has been brough up millions of times befor for having no damage on there proc) which would usualy make up for there no damage proc with a decent ratio. These are 100% patches that we have to pay way to much for.<br />
<br />
The ykesha proc doesnt generate nearly the raw agro that the anger procs do or there would be no issue.<br />

<br />
Agro should be an inniate thing.  You do something anoying to a monster, that monster becomes mad and attempts to them to stop.<br />
<br />
Messing with procs is a bad crutch.  There are weapons out there that have great performance but need to be bagged if they aren't the MT for fear of drawing agro.  Then there are weapons out there that perform somewhat poorly but are used because they hold agro.<br />
<br />
Its a raw deal.  Warriors should push for inniate solution instead of relying on the proc crutch.</div></div><hr />

As long as its &quot;halfway decent&quot; i wont complain.<br />
<br />
They could add a 300DD proc for paladins<br />
Their DPS will still be lower than mine.<br />
<br />
They could add a ZERODD proc for SK.<br />
Their DPS will still be higher than mine (KEI included)<br />
<br />
We get a LOT more from Ykesha or Anger than the paladin<br />
Get from all those nifty 150DD procs.<br />
You realise that those uber 150DD are like 5 extra DPS ?<br />
<br />
Hello DUDE, WE DONT CARE ABOUT DPS, WE WANT AGRO <br />
(reroll a rogue if you get horny looking at DD150 procs)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While it would be nice to see a dd on the anger proc, I personally don't have a prob with switching weapons around a bit.  Bagging my aggro weapon for one with slightly more DPS (and a DPS proc) is something I do frequently in slow-moving XP groups as well as swapping out for avatar.</div></div><hr />
