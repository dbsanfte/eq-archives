<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Clobber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some advice concerning hot key set up. I am raiding currently and I am not a primary tank. More like gimp dps. Either way I took a bit of a break from eq and am just now getting reacquainted with GoD. <br />
What types of hotkeys should I have ie. what is a good /shield command for shielding anyone that happens to be in raid who has grabbed agro? <br />
If there are any other useful hotkeys used please Post em! <br />
<br />
Also what disc is the best to burn when DPS discs are called?<br />
What dps weapons should I try to aim saving dkp for in Time and in GoD? <br />
Note: I am not a main tank<br />
<br />
Anything I should know when tanking in KT? Exp groups. I have yet to try.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can provide!<br />
/salute  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I almost never use /shield unless duoing with my cleric and I get an add that starts beating on him. Even then I just type /shield vayn, no need for a hotkey.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike is nice for burst dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to use a combination of /assist and /shield.  What I found was that it too often gave me a person who really didn't need to be shielded, and left me with no opportunity to judge the value of shielding them.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I just type the first couple letters of people's names.  It takes me maybe 2 seconds to type &quot;/shi Arw&quot; for example.  If they don't survive that short delay, then shielding probably wouldn't have saved them anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Clobber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats a good tip Sassinak thanks.  So scratch the hotkey unless doing exp groups.  <br />
Any other suggestions as to any helpful hotkeys I should use on raids?<br />
<br />
Thanks Payn.  I do use fellstrike most of the time good to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The biggest key to harder GoD zones in xp groups is knowing what mobs are hasted.  Actually, you might as well assume everything is hasted, and certainly anything that's running fast (sow) will usually be hasted (though it is possible they got sow from a druid, not a shaman).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/rs heal me and heal me offtanking type stuff is good ...er well I'm a useless typer.I still use /assist mob /shield /assist %t thingy.In case you ever step up on a tank switch I used to use a macro for it.Something like:<br />
<br />
1)/disc furious(fortitude)<br />
2)/alt activate 110<br />
3)/rs AE taunt! I'm tanking %t HEAL ME!<br />
<br />
urse I had ae taunt up alone as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still use the /assist /shield key.  If somebody pulls the mob off the person you're shielding before it lands (another tank for example) it's no more wasted shielding the tank than it would be shielding an enchanter who no longer has aggro.  I use shield a lot personally.  Any time someone who's not supposed to be tanking stays on the target's target window for more than a second or two I hit my macro.<br />
<br />
Some other buttons that are great are the &quot;toggle last two targets&quot; and &quot;cycle through nearest NPCs&quot; buttons.  Both have tons of good uses once you start playing around with them.  I have them mapped to 'Q' and 'W' and use them all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I dont think Ive ever used the shield command.  Mostly Im pretty basic..I see the mob, shoot the mob, and start whomping the mess out of the mob..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use the shield key in xp groups, not even on my raid toolbar...for groups I typically set it up for the enchanter or shaman, if the slower is a beastlord, they can take a few hits, so then I set it to a healer.  I don't bother with assist mob, etc., because in a group if they are getting hit I want agro back fast, in which case I don't want to miss one round on the mob if I can help it.  If someone else gets agro, then I'll type out /shield name manually if it's not a melee class.<br />
<br />
My raid toolbar generally has (keys are not in order listed here):<br />
Main Assist (if I'm the MA, this is set to assist puller)<br />
Secondary Assist<br />
Call Assist (if I am not MA I change it to: Offtanking &lt;&lt; %t &gt;&gt; , please assist MA).<br />
Taunt (use if MA or to taunt mob while chanter mezs or re-charms)<br />
Kick (since I'm a short race)<br />
AET (regardless of tank order...I've had to use it on Bert when 4 tanks died).<br />
Range Attack (use if MA or if too many melee on a small target)  <br />
Rampage DMG (/rs I have RAMPAGE DAMAGE!!!)<br />
...I also have two open slots<br />
<br />
For my disciplines, I have incite, furious, fellstrike (this is generally the better offensive disc), defensive, fortitude, evasive, fearless and the flashy dps (forget name for some reason) which I only use when I want to spam some crits (flash) or I am low health and want the chance to stun the mob a lot from crippling blows.<br />
<br />
Oh...and I should mention I'm not elemental geared, so I can't say what tanks use in the 'big guilds'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shields pretty handy I'd use it on raids too.Although I usually have aggro back and try to shield myself when it fires hehe.I also have a lot of combat stuff hotkeyed next to my arrows keys that I till use for movement.IE<br />
1) cycle thru closest npcs = numpad 1.Need that for fast targeting<br />
2)taunt=delete..no lag ...faster...<br />
3)incite=insert<br />
4)[=defensive<br />
5)]=stonewall<br />
6)\=furious<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rawr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to use /shield all the time and had it set up like said before with /assist on first line, but since i have gotten AE taunt i just use that if i haven't gotten aggro back from a proc or a regular taunt.</div></div><hr />
