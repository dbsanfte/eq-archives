<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">devlok</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently running dial-up. When I started todays patch it said estimated time remaining of 11 hours. So far 6 hours later it still showing a 11 hour patch time. <br />
<br />
My question is there a way I wont need to re-patch on my other EQ dir? When I pre downloaded the LDoN I had tried to copy one folder into the one not downloaded. When I ran the patcher after, it started downloading the LDoN files. Not sure what else I can do to get the patch files and LDoN files into my other dir without having to go thru the DL's again. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm no too sure how the patcher works tho; maybe someone else can be of more help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... of 11 hours ... <br />
<br />
Heh, I started download going last night on a compressed 33k dialup connection ... initial time remaining said 65 hours.<br />
<br />
That dropped back to 45 then 36... when I got up this morning it had 24 hours to go.<br />
<br />
Just gonna go around to a friends when they've finished patching and copy the files.<br />
<br />
errr point was, you should just be able to copy the newly downloaded files across to your other dir ... if you know what they are &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

It really sucks I can't believe they would make anyone download an expansion for that insane amount of time.  Maybe they expect everyone to have DSL or Cable :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bought the LoY disc and I swear there was nothing on it.<br />
<br />
Still 3 hours of downloads when I got it with roadrunner and another  3 hours or so when I found out 3 months later you have to check a box to even activate it when I tried to go to Dulak.<br />
<br />
I want to know what they really put on those discs. :mad:</div></div><hr />
