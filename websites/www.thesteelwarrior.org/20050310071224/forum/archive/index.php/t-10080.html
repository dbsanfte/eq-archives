<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeaps, one of the strangest thing happened to me merely half an hour ago. Logged on to get a rez from PoFire (died from birds by multiple charm en route to tables camp) and was hoping to get some exp with some guildies already there. Suddenly, I got a tell from a level 70, &quot;You want to loot EP gloves?&quot;<br />
<br />
First thing on my mind was that, I have a 4 digit bank account, and there's no way I could have bought it. After some chatting, I found out that 7(!) people took out Pyronis and that the EP gloves was rotting. I offered a rune and some OOW gear and he said sure if no one made a better offer on the server channels. <br />
<br />
Lo and behold, no one offered, and I am now the proud owner of EP plate gloves  :D <br />
<br />
P.S. Can't update on Magelo yet, but when I can, you'll know this was one of the craziest trades ever heard of  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaiel_RN</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had that happen to me before only I was in ssra with my druid watching a japan guild take down the cursed cycle.  well they smoked him pretty easy and they did loot and left but the cursed corpses was still there.  I didn't go near the corpses till every one of them left the area(not wanting to though of ninjaing anything).  So once they all left ang I check the corpse and to my surprize I found a sword there.  I figured it was the pally/sk sword since it was crappy.  When I right clicked it and seen it was a Bloodfrenzy yes thats right a Bloodfrenzy.  I sent out a yell for help in guild chat and to my shock we had a twink in ssra checking things out for that nights raid.  So he ran down to the basement and locked the corpse for me and logged on to my warrior who was in the middle of bfe  and my druid friend ported me over to the TWS and ran me over to the grey and I made it down to the basement just intime to loot the bloodfrenzy.  I told the japan guild thanks for not deystoring the sword and they said np all there warriors had one.   I didn't have to fight anything,  spend any pp or dkp or trade a thing.</div></div><hr />
