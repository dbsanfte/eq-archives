I'm one yellow from Veteran and I intend to get it and Finish up ND, but i'm thinking, considering the current insufficiency of my gear in accordance with a lot of the people i have noticeds gear, that I should probably AA some more in the meantime. I'm guessing in BoT, considering that LDoN is hard to setup now because everyone is 66 and I doubt I can tank hards for the life of me. Oh and it's probably important for me to note that I don't have OoW. A lot of clerics I know ( that are to frickin uber for me to get groups with, go figure), have told me I should get my defensive AA's then progress. Now i'm thinking that if i AA for a while it will give my gear time to catch up. Hitting 70 doesn't really seem to take as much precedence as being able to actually TANK the stuff right now. What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

I think you answered your own question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vegalord65</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er. You can hit 70 without OoW. Can't you? I heard you could.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't hit 60 without Kunark<br />
<br />
Couldn't do AA's without Luclin.<br />
<br />
Couldn't get PoP AA's without PoP<br />
<br />
In other words, not likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a cleric in my group that forgot to put the code in for OoW. She had AA EXP at 0% and could not understand why she was not dinging 66 (was at 100% EXP in 65).<br />
<br />
In other words, you must have OoW to level past 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vegalord65</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. Lamness. I'll have OoW by the end of the week then. So, intro post question still stands. Should I AA and get my gear up to par ( as in like: at least 6k hp unbuffed), or level ( why do I suddenly feel stupid for asking this question?). Oh well, input would help either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spaztic</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobody really knows right now. <br />
<br />
Is AA faster at 70 for those without AA?<br />
<br />
Gonna be very rare for someone to be without any AA at 70 to really answer that question.  Im in the same delima as you and I'm undecided.  Probably gonna snag a few defensive AA at 65 then level on to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And can an AAless 66 tank places where XP is meaningful. LDoN hard XP is the pits at 66th (about 3% per). Can NC/WoS be tanked by someone taking 30% more damage than the usual 65th around here?<br />
<br />
I have a bad feeling I know what the answers are to those questions, and the up and comers are not going to be happy with the answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which zone?</div></div><hr />

Everywhere you would find mobs of the appropriate level.</div></div><hr />

So, taking info from another thread, that involves PoF tables, Kodtaz, etc.<br />
<br />
In this case would be unlikely for Vega to tank in anyway with his current number of aa's. Hell, I got pre-OoW defensive AA's done and I still think I'd get my ass kicked in at those places (assuming i had access).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say hold at 65, get your HP and Defensive AAs while you grind some LDoNs for gear and get the HPs (and experience) to tank something better. There will be warriors who disagree with me but my logic is if you can't tank in OoW, why level up to make most other zones trivial (unless you happen to be flagged for SolRo, PoF, or KT).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well actually I prefer oow xp. The 2 zones you mentioned are pretty mind-numbingly boring. You should try the sewers or catacombs off ruined city of dranik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vegalord. If you can't tank anything harder than BoT now, you probably should aa and gear up a while longer. You need to be able to xp in level 65ish zones, which means you need to be able to handle elemental planes, oow zones, or vxed/tipt.<br />
<br />
I've gotta figure you're going to take a pretty significant hit to your aa rate if you can't xp in anywhere better than BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vega, you need more AC before anything else.</div></div><hr />

It's practically a ghost town and exp is a lil better.</div></div><hr />
