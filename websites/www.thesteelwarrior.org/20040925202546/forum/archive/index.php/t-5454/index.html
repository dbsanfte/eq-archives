<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm having some trouble reading lucy.<br />
<br />
These are the codes for the &quot;Form of XXX&quot; series<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3855&amp;source=Live<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3856&amp;source=Live<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3854&amp;source=Live<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3857&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
While the &lt; Parameter confuses me a bit i am fairly positive<br />
i have gotten this correctly.<br />
<br />
For example : <br />
 1:  Stacking: Block new spell if slot 3 is effect 'All Resists' and &lt; 21 <br />
and<br />
 3:  Increase All Resists by 20 <br />
<br />
So one is +20 the other is &lt; 21 .... <br />
<br />
While the numbers indicate they should stack, the stacking line says they dont.<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=3857&amp;source=Live<br />
So i guess you can only have 1 form up.<br />
<br />
Now Quarm Ring :<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3631&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
My plans are to go for Bertox Mask (+180hp) and Quarm Ring (+45ac +15saves).<br />
<br />
While i am almost positive that RZ Ring &amp; Quarm ring wont stack<br />
(RZ = +54ac slot10 , Quarm = +45ac slot10, shouldnt work)<br />
And that &quot;Form of XXX&quot; will not stack among themselves.<br />
<br />
I am totally confused about the Quarm Ring.<br />
It adds AC like RZ ring, but is not in the Stacking line List<br />
<br />
Anyone have any experience with these 2 or know someone<br />
that has a combination of Quarm Ring + Form of XX ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quarm ring should stack with the other two effects (HP/regen) that it does not give.  However I don't know of this first hand.  I have Quarm ring but don't plan on getting either the Veil of Inferno or Belt of Tidal Energy.<br />
<br />
Assuming there's no error in stacking obviously all the form of XXX is supposed to block each other.  Originally the illusion part blocks each other (can't have 2 illusions) but Enchanter were projecting form of XXX on other people for free.  So that means if you have form of XXX up first you can't put Quarm ring next because Quarm ring has effect from form of XXX, but it should work the other way, i.e. Quarm ring first and then form of XXX (HP or regen) since form of XXX only blocks, not overwrites, effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Swobu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My GF has both Quarm ring and Bertie mask and they do stack if you put em on correct order: Ring first then mask. But since Eternal Ward only lasts 20 min and Form of Endurance lasts 36 min, she oftens only has Form of Endurance on - unless she is maintank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hydramada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Swobu is correct.  The quarm ring does stack with the bertox mask if you buff the ring first.   It is somewhat a pain in the ass to have the ring fade first but such is life in the world of Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just reapply before it fades eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">nm didn't read the above post carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Swobu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No you can't Chatja - that's the sucky part. If you got both effects on and ring is fading and you reclick, you get the &quot;Wont take hold&quot; msg. <br />
Every 20 min you have reapply both clickers - which mean it's a pain in the ass :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's a pain in the ass I'd like to have. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes sounds horrible :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, seems to matter which order you do them with on the form of rejuvenation also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The order matters because Quarm ring doesn't block other effects but the Form of XXX does.  Therefore you want Quarm ring on first, form of XXX second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">TZ's resist debuff AE also overwrites the Quarm ring effect, I found that out the hard way as my dumbass self had the effect at the bottom of my buffs...</div></div><hr />
