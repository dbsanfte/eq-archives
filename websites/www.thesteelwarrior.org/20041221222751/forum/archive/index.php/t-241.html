I'm only 53, but I already love it!  The enchie I was grouped with yesterday said I was doing dmg equal to some of the 60 warriors in her guild.  Only problem I have now is I maxed my 2hs for my lvl and really should switch out wpns to max the other skills...:( <br />
<br />
I can even solo a bit again.  (SG's in DSP were pretty easy solo...gonna try Solb next I think, or maybe Velks)<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get to 55 and a damage bonus (at least I think that's the next boost lvl)<br />
<br />
Anyway, been having so much fun with this wpn I had to post here...:D<br />

For a droppable 2hs, its arguably one of the best weapons for your bag.<br />
<br />
In PoV/PoS/BoT its almost essential using 2H weapons...ripostes vastly reduced, dmg output is HIGHER than DW (if anyone has parsed comparisons disputing this, I'd like to see them). I DW SBoZ and HoH which doesnt come close to the windy.<br />
<br />
I'm only 62 with zero offensive AA and invariably whether in a raid or xp group I pull agg with the thing -- not using taunt or kick. It simply lays down a beating. Nothing like hitting 500+ crits without using disc (hit a 929 with fellstrike too...NB IMO).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I use mine alla time in raids and as MT in xp groups.<br />

I won't dispute the Windblade. It's the best investment a warrior can make in the bazaar. For its price its DPS and aggro are money well spent.<br />
<br />
But, you know what?<br />
<br />
I'm happy with my lightsabers. They hold aggro just fine for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seru 52/40 against Windblad 50/44 is not nearly the same. (2 Dam Less 4 delay more )<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats nearly the same differnens as <br />
<br />
Windblade 50/44 against an 48/48 Weapon ( 2 Dam Less 4 delay more )<br />
<br />
For a weapon you can buy its a great one.<br />
<br />
But you will already find better ones in NToV and WToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The attraction of the Windblade is the ease of getting one. It's one of the great tradeable weapons, no doubt. It's available for anyone who can raise the funds to buy one and there's no shortage of them out there. Yes there are better weapons in NToV/WtoV/PoP etc but almost all of them are no drop.<br />
<br />
I've never owned a Windblade but I can certainly see the attraction of a 50/44 2-hander</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I said Almost Kilaara :) probably was a bit generous<br />
<br />
50/44 aint 52/40, you'll loose like what 10-15 % ? at most.<br />
<br />
For Warrior098 doing 90% dps on the Emp/Seru with<br />
an item that isnt too hard to find in the bazaar is a godly deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have one, use it, love it. Out-aggros my frosty/red blade any day of the week and twice on sundays. It's the first weapon I've owned since my Black Alloy Bastard Sword back in the 30s that can hold aggro through sheer DPS alone. No procs, no tricks, the damn thing just hits like a truck.<br />
<br />
Until I got my Greatstaff of Thunder, I never switched it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Emilia, dont forget that Windblade lacks a decent proc.<br />
Thats another major difference to seru or emperor 2hs<br />
I dont have one and I will never buy one, but more due to the fact that i never had reason to replace dualwielding to 2h and my guild can kill mobs who drop better (not to mention i am notoriously broke).<br />
I have been in groups with my cleric where the tank (sk, paladin or warrior) was using a windblade and the result varied quite a bit.<br />
In a low dps group (tank was highest level by quite a bit in relation to other melees) he had no trouble.<br />
In a low to mid 60s group where the 64 warrior was using a windblade the necro and druid were having trouble avoiding agro.<br />
Got so bad that the necro finally flamed the warrior in /ooc about how he was supposed to learn to keep agro.<br />
Of course you can find better in WToV/NToV/Sseru and Ssra but its all about RNG and luck.<br />
While knight 2h go for 4 dkp now, we only had a single Gaudralek out of NToV and one TSBS (Facesmashers went to our knights) and no Norgetal or other warrior usable 2h from cursed/HP/AL, emperor or seru yet (although we only killed seru and emperor once yet).</div></div><hr />

I agree that the Windblade's popularity comes from it's ease to get, but still, if you can - get a Greatstaff of Thunder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Caster lvl doesn't affect how much aggro they will generate.  I can understand if a meleer having aggo problem when the warrior was using the Windblade, or even shaman and ench with their tash and slow, but but a druid or necro?  What these guys don't know how to control their aggro?  It doesn't matter what level the druid and necro were, it was the spells they casted and when they casted that got them aggroed.  Instead of flaming the warrior, maybe the necro should look at himself first.  Beside, he can always FD, can't he?<br />
<br />
P.S.  It is rather lame to flame anyone in /ooc.  Often time it just show what an a$$ someone is for doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get tired of being called the 'smart guy' for educating fresh-out-of-KC dumb asses on aggro control.  I can't count the number of pallys I've pissed off cause they were chain-stunning through the whole fricken fight, and I 'had the nerve to try and tell *them* how to play the game.'<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sorry to jump off the topic there ... fwiw, when I can afford a windblade, I'll get one.  Unfortunately, the going rate has sky rocketed from 30K to 45-50k on my server.  Stonebladed axe gets me by atm though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, as an FYI, the WB is quite good at holding aggro. I never would have believed it until I used it in some xp groups and on raids. The stupid thing would occasionally pull agg off MT (who was DW CHSD and SBoL).<br />
<br />
Is it the best 2h weap in the game, no. Is it the best agg weap, no. Is it quite good for DPS and agg given its price range...YES.<br />
<br />
It pisses me off when I read posters talking smack over it being a POS just because their guild has long since moved out of NTOV, ST, and the likes.<br />
<br />
People tend to forget where they came from and get some buzz out of putting items and less fortunate ppl down. Fine to have an opinion, but you don't have to be jerky about it.<br />

<br />
For most casual guilds those items may as well not exist.  Windblade is about the best you're going to do in a casual guild.  I used one for quite awhile and loved it.  It was tough to hold aggro with it in some groups, but it holds aggro better than the fleshgrinder/frosty combo I had before it.<br />
<br />
It annoys me that the weapon selection from Ssra to PoP is so lacking.  With BoC/Blackout/Rocksmasher as my current combo the only weapon upgrades I see in my future are Bloodfrenzy/Hategiver if another ever drops and Blade of War when we eventually get to Rallos Zek.  The armor in VT is nice but there's no weapons there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya know its funny when I  read peeps say &quot;I pulled argo off the MT once with XXX&quot;.  There are times when anyone can and will pull argo from the MT but this DOES NOT mean the Windy is an argo weapon, the difference is HUGE from pulling argo from the MT once a fight to controlling argo the whole fight, dont confuse the two.<br />
<br />
    I use 3 different weapon sets for argo control, 1h epics, 2h epic and GSoT and none are uber weapons but I DONT have problems with Windy's taking argo.  Sure when the windy makes a few AWESOME hits they get argo but one hit on the taunt key or one proc and the mob is back home and this DOES NOT work the other way around.  I cant use the GSoT or epics against a windy MT,  one proc and he should get argo back fast but two its on me for the duration.<br />
<br />
   Yes I have owned and used a Windy and yes it is an AWESOME dps wespon but no its not a great argo weapon.  As the MT for my guild it was bagged most of the time by request of my shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a windblade, and it's bagged for the time being. This is not to say it's a bad weapon, oh no, it rawks, but it is very situational.<br />
<br />
These days, my warrior is basically a single group tank (I generally use a rogue for raids :rolleyes: ). In that situation, where keeping aggro in tier 1 planes and zones like Western Wastes, Kael, Umbral, Nadox, etc. is important, the windblade doesn't cut it. If I can get aggro early I can keep aggro okay with it, but in truth, it is much too slow for my tastes when it comes to the taunt/aggro factor. I do use it whenever I'm not the main tank, though, and my hits are impressive. :) <br />
<br />
What I've been using to keep aggro in 2HS (and boy, does it grab and keep aggro well) is a War Marshall's Bladed Staff (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25980).<br />
<br />
I'm debating sinking the plat in a great staff of thunder, but I'm not sure it's that much better than the War Marshall's, if at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;For most casual guilds those items may as well not exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not true.<br />
<br />
As the game gets older, TWO of those weapons get much more attainable.<br />
<br />
Blade of Carnage is tradable.<br />
<br />
Not worth the current price tag IMO, BUT ... it's certainly on the market and available to even the most casual of warriors.<br />
<br />
It's also two expansions and an extension old.<br />
<br />
As is Dain axe.<br />
<br />
In another expansion or two, AoW and the Dain will be quite the casual guild target. Almost like Kunark Dragons.<br />
<br />
Blackout may take longer to get mudflated, but that'll probably have more to do with Luclin drop rates than anything else.<br />
<br />
I won't dispute Windblade's power or usefulness. Platinum piece for platinum piece it's one of the best attainable weapons for anyone who can use it. The DPS is just that good.<br />
<br />
But just the existence of Windblade as a tradable DPS weapon on the LEVEL of ToV loots shows how dated some of the velious content is going to become in the future.<br />
<br />
In other words, all I'm really trying to say is, his weapons are nice, but even some casual guilds will be able to obtain them in the future.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanori</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess I'll add my 2cp...<br />
<br />
I wield a Widebladed Greatsword.  I tried out a friend's Windblade and wasn't blown away by it.  I could see a small increase in DPS, but I don't think it is worth the current 50k price on Druzzil.<br />
<br />
The WBGS -for me- is fast enough for my taste, while on raids.  If I am having aggro probs, I'll switch to a barnie axe and Tae Ew 1hander.  But in xp groups, I can hold aggro fine against other tanks wielding the Windblade, so long as they don't act like a retard and start taunting.  (Yes, i sunk my cash into wearable gear, and will be buying better proccing weapons later.)<br />
<br />
Sure...the windblade is a damn nice weapon.  But give the Widebladed Greatsword a try for 9kish, and you may think twice about spending 5x more than that for a moderate increase in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we have a different definition of &quot;casual.&quot;<br />
<br />
To me, a &quot;casual&quot; guild means Kael Arena/Manor, epic battles, old planes (minus PoA), etc.<br />
<br />
That is my guild. My guild is casual.<br />
<br />
In my eyes, and uber guild is one capable of killing Vindi. I know everyone who sees this will scoff and pound their chests about how THEIR guild killed him YEARS ago. My guild is finally starting to push for bigger raid targets, soon we are going to try Vindi, and when we kill him, in my eyes, we will be uber.<br />
<br />
I am hearing that the Dain Axe should be easy to get, well, he's uber.<br />
<br />
BoC? Too bad, AoW is uber.<br />
<br />
Velk? Too bad, he's uber.<br />
<br />
NToV? Nope, to uber.<br />
<br />
WToV? Ya, we might could do this ourselves, and that would be a pretty uber raid, especially if I got some very uber Myrmidon's armor.<br />
<br />
Just because you (whoever you are) are in a Teir 4 Guild doesn't mean everyone is. Just because most people you know are, doesn't mean everyone is. Face it, the changes that keep coming for the &lt;10 crowd are benefiting many stuggling new players (albeit it hurts them as well, getting to the 20+ to fast without learning the game) As much as people want more &quot;high-end&quot;content, there is still many more people who haven't even gotten there.<br />
<br />
To a few people, &quot;high-end&quot; is Teir 4+. To me, &quot;high-end&quot; is Vindicator. Hell, even if we got wiped, my guild even trying is a huge step towards my &quot;high-end&quot; content.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Erm, sorry about that. Just a little venting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has tried Vindi and failed.<br />
<br />
Then helped kill Vindi with another guild once.<br />
<br />
We do HoT.<br />
<br />
We are very casual guild.<br />
<br />
In one to two more expansions, power of even casual guilds will make Velious content a lot more trivial. The bar keeps getting raised, even for the casual players, with each new expansion.<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry is on par with a lot of high end loot. Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement makes a bold new step for earrings. Windblade is a ToV level weapon.<br />
<br />
All of these are commonly available (albeit expensive) items in the bazaar that are tradable.<br />
<br />
As more gear of THIS level of power becomes available, the ability of even casual guilds to handle the challenges of Velious gets easier.<br />
<br />
Just a fact of EQ there.</div></div><hr />
