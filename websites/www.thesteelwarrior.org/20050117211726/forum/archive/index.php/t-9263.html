<br />
He has like MASSIVE hp.. hits for 2k, rampage I think or flurry, does a AoE 1200 Knockback stun, NOT single target.  Add's repop if your dps is low in his area unless you pull him out someplace safer.  Its pretty much a straight up fight otherwise. 3 groups can do it just will take like 10 minutes to kill.  I think with like 25 or 26 it took my guild around 6 minutes.</div></div><hr />

we killed krekk, moved to room, and he was up again by time there, I think 30minutes or a hr.<br />
<br />
Either way, quick enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's in the far NE corner of the open area once you zone in.<br />
<br />
In terms of tactics, I would recommend clearing the entire large room he is in, doing your turn-in and engaging immediately.  Fail to clear his room and undoubtedly one of you will get thrown into another mob and chaos can ensue.  His stun I found to be negligable, it was the AE knockback and losing aggro from being OOR that was the most problematic for us.<br />

<br />
We wiped a few times before we got it right.  The 'aggro' version of Krekk doesn't seem to despawn until he's dead (he was up at least 2-3 hours for us).  As for getting the items back, no.  Once you give them to him, they are gone.  So its kinda vital that you have the force to win the encounter, or you are going to be SOL.<br />

<br />
With 525 svmagic, I resisted him plenty of times..but also got to play yoyo alot. I haven't parsed my log but I'd say somewhat over half of the yoyo bounce was resisted throughout the fight. He's got lots of hp, unless you have a ranger/nuker army.. I do not suggest range fights, it'll just be painful.<br />
Go in, fight toe to toe, loot your sword!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">10-11-2004, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does he dispell?  If not then DMF or SoE could help against the knockback.  Would it be wise to treat this fight as a range fight?   Keeping all that can be out of the range of the AE might be a good thing.<br />
<br />
From what I'm hearing so far sorta sound's like Tallon Zek minus the dispell's and the Shadow stepping.  Also, his room have any corners?  If he has corners, getting him cornered could help agaisnt the knock back.<br />
<br />
I am now ready to try this guy, but hate to go into it blind.<br />
<br />
Any information would be helpful.</div></div><hr />

I was goofing around in Dranik today and went to check Krekk.<br />
I am not done yet for the epic (still missing Bloodfields Part)...<br />
<br />
And he Saw inviz &amp; Cons was KOS .....<br />
<br />
Anyone know if this is normal ? <br />
I didnt remember any faction hits during the quest.<br />
And i havent heard of anyone failing it yet on my server (One done, I should be 2nd)<br />
<br />
Anyone actually cons him before getting to the last step ?</div></div><hr />

Had more problems getting everyone THERE than actually killing him as someone with Bard speed and invis aggro'd a named and never noticed it...named and about 6 or 7 mob's came into camp before we were all gathered.<br />
<br />
He is VERY doable with 3 to 4 groups.....depending on gear.  I would say we could take him with 20 or slightly less depending on What classes made up the raid.  <br />
<br />
The mob is ALL about resists, and clearing everything from the area, so if you have a bard, and can clear the area very quickly, your Golden.</div></div><hr />

He doesn't dispell, and DMF/SOE helps.  It's best to fight him away from that little tower or whatever it is nearby.  He had this tendancy to warp inside it.  I was waiting for the tank to get summoned inside and ported to the zone in.  Range fighting him is totally uneccesary.<br />
<br />
<br />
This fight reminds me of tanking Vyemm...like a yo-yo. Knockback...summon...knockback...summon. It's pretty fun overall. <br />
<br />
Lanys for the rogue epic is like that too.  She dispels though.   :( <br />

<br />
I'll double check the log when I get home, but Krekk's main AE seemed weak as hell, I believe it remained at 1250. Whirling Smash is a once off, scripted attack. Krekk has a metric ton of HP, though.<br />

<br />
Yellow con at 70 both versions, the kos non-agro triger, and the triggered one. You can see him kos, but he is holded until you give him the 3 items. Then, he starts to attack you.<br />
<br />
Hits max about 1900, normally about 800, rares max hit (15% shielding, 2500 ac)<br />
Rampages, normal rate, but dificult to fix them cause the first in rampage list will be the warrior who triger the event, and probably the next will be a healer, so keep the tank healers away from him. 2 clerics on tank, and a cleric or a druid can heal the rampage, depending who takes them.<br />
<br />
Hps: about 800k estimated based of fights in PoTime. My battle was about 8-9 mins with 22 ppl, time+ geared. Easy kill, no deads if u are advised (no parses of hps, just my estimation)<br />

Dead at first try, so no idea about if the encounter ends with a wipe.<br />

Good luck for u all with this mob )<br />

Edited: if u stand up quickly after a FD, dont loose agro. But just have about &gt;1 sec to do it. After a sec, the mob starts to hit anyone but you hehe</div></div><hr />

Had this happen to us last week. One of our warriors was being an impatient little gnome and didn't quite get enough help. We had done it before for another guildie with about 20 mostly EP people and it wasn't hard at all. <br />
<br />
This little gnome ended up with a few less people and had issues and failed. They weren't able to win the fight and gave up for the evening. <br />
<br />
A few days later he went back and tested and when he got back in range and hailed, Krekk came alive. Later that night, he went back again with a few groups and beat Krekk and got his epic.</div></div><hr />

I tried it last night and .. ehhem, failed due to a bizzilion pets pushing him WAY out of posistion. But anyhow...<br />
<br />
Today I ran back and hailed him, and viola... beat down ensued. So now I gotta get me about 4 groups of willing ogre beaters and go claim my prize =)<br />

It seems that he might have been revamped or something, but not too sure. He does hit like a fairly hard but the pain is his AE and keeping adds away from the raid. We ended up getting a few adds and that lead to some healers and key classes getting smoked. Now that I have a better understanding on how his AE works and a better idea on where to position Krekk and the raid, hopfully I can down him on the next encounter.</div></div><hr />
