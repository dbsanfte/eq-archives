<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's been awhile since I last posted, but I'm back and of course had to start an equipment upgrade thread  :p  So anyway, what should I be looking for to upgrade my Cloak of Greater Pernicity?  I have a +15 HP aug on it, not that that's any big whoop.  I'm really close to hitting 6K HP unbuffed, and I'm thinking that cloak is one of the next thing that needs to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, it probably would help if you gave a little bit more background on what kind of things you have access too, if your raid at at all, if you do, where and how far in progression etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since your guild seems to be abe to raid BoT Towers, you could give Cazic Thule in Fear a go. Cloak of the Fearsome, albeit lacking in resists, is a nice piece of Melee Gear, as is the Bile Etched Obsidian Choker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SoRZ cloak is an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's no option at all, Warriors can't equip it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN MM Cloack (12ac 80hp)<br />
LDoN Miragul Hard Cloack (16ac 90hp 36%)<br />
<br />
And if you want the best possible cloack before time &amp; have friends &amp; time :<br />
Katta Loyalist Shield of Honor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Cloak of Broken Enchantments from EF hard is a good choice to upgrade it.  Its got terrible ac but 90 hps and its free basically.  Good cloak for most of PoP, some better choices in VT but atleast it gets haste taken  care of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm gonna have to second the Loyalist Shield of Honor suggestion. Everything but Heratius/Veldanov can be done with a friend or two in one day. I camped the PH vampyre for the final piece, the ashes, 25-30 times, and never saw him. However, I did manage to buy the ashes at a reasonable price, so now my cloak has more AC than everything else except my BP =p <br />
<br />
And to anyone else who may be buying the ashes: The real ashes, off Veldanov, appear to be stackable, even though they are lore (The have a little '1' in the right corner of the icon). The other ashes, off Heratius, are not stackable, so don't buy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haha, my mistake. Sometimes it's hard not to think like a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDoN Mira cloak is a good choice, as was mentioned.  If you are a raiding guild in the planes, you also have a couple of options.  Mujaki (small event in PoN) drops like a 20ac 80hp cloak.  Terris Thule (PoNb) drops a nice cloak with 100hps and regen 2 (I think).  Um, I think Saryn drops a decent cloak, but I can't remember if its warrior wearable.  Then on to the EPs.  There is the leaf-jointed cloak that drops in Earth that is pretty hauss (dust ring).  I have the Drape of the Agile (drops in Fire, off one of the birdies I think).  In PoTime, there is a nice cloak that drops in phase 2 and another off one of the stone dudes in phase 3.  Those are all the cloaks that I know that drop and have seen drop.  All I really know is PoP.  I'm sure there are other nice once that drop in Velious, Luclin and GoD, but I have little experience in these areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I second the Loyalist Shield of Honor Suggestion I forgot about it but its very nice w/ its AC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You do realise she doesnt have EP access ? ....<br />
<br />
Btw Loyalist &gt;&gt;&gt; ALL EP cloacks<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait for RZ/Quarm cloack&quot; .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For raw hps, I would camp the Hard EF dungeons, cloak is ac 17, 90 hps and 36% haste iirc.  There is also a decent ring here which is 90hps, I have one in my magelo.  But, for all intents and purposes, I think the Loyalist is hard to beat with the extreme AC on it.  However, if you want an easier cloak (timewise) you may consider Paffa in CoD.  He drops a 12 AC, 85HP, 10 SV ALL cloak that is quite nice.<br />
<br />
I would also consider getting a group together and going to the Sewer trials.  The mask there that drops off of a named fly is insane for the difficulty and his common drop, stonemite carapace mask or something like that.<br />

And, WTF?  My network doesn't block The Steel Warrior but I can't see Magelos?  grrrr</div></div><hr />

Magelo is categorised under &quot;games&quot; while TSW isnt categorised in the proxy filtering software I run at work.</div></div><hr />
