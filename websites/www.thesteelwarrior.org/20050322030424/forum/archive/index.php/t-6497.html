<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sony is missing a big potential way to extend EQ content. Have a new zone, accessible from ALL servers designed solely for PvP. And then have a way to bet (like sports betting) on the outcome. Lets say “Furor vs. DeathWalkerX6” at 2 p.m. Sunday… Place yur bets. Or just enter an instanced pvp zone, set it up with a duel when you and yur opponent agree and then set the bet amount and its deducted from the losers bank and added to the winners bank automatically!<br />
<br />
You could have team pvp like Pro Football, or individual match ups like the do for wrestling. Have “seasons” like Pro Football or leagues of like 64 people fighting for league title.<br />
<br />
If you had some big name guilds fighting like Triton vs. FoH, you would have 1000’s of spectators who could bet on the matches. You could have the casino X 100 with something like this.<br />
<br />
A whole expansion could be done like this with different battle zones, even have a NPC where people wager on a battle between someone and an NPC. <br />
<br />
When you lose the pvp battle you just go back to yur server with say 1HP and no mana, but with all yur gear. <br />
<br />
Inventive zones like a “capture the flag” or Doom style action could be made. I mean most games are pvp.<br />
<br />
This will settle the tons of arguments “I can beat you easy” that go cross server all the time, AND most importantly provide a “goal” beyond killing the top content of the PvE part of the game. And rest assured with Betting and Trash Talk there will be a lot of excitement generated among the people that are “burned out” with the pve kill the same mob 1000 times aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
Just ask yourself a simple question, is more money spent on watching pro football games by buying tickets or spent betting on the games…. Heh.</div></div><hr />

But can't allow players to do trades such as armor and play.  People would just abuse this as a means to transfer plat and armor to other servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sam -- give it up.  Stop saying how incredible you are because your 6 players can beat 1 player.  I bet FurorX6 would easily beat your 6 and I bet he could easily have access to 6.  So give it up.  This whole post is about this one thing I bet.<br />

Or maybe lock the amount you can &quot;win&quot; from a spicific server per account.<br />

Is there that much of a difference in the value of PP bettween servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe when you are tired of killing X high end mob 1000 times, you can like.... socialize with other ppl, talk, make friends, roleplay with them, get drunk and shoot fireworks in Akanonn windmills, do drunken races thru Kelethin, go fish... I mean... there are countless of things to do other than... add an interserver arena for a &quot;Im better than you&quot; contest that will start on a board... which seems kinda pointless and undoable, because, well, that would require a new server for that , since all the players have to connect to the same point, it would be stupid to use your current server as a gateway to connect to another server....<br />
In conclusion, if you wanna PvP, you have servers dedicated to that, if you wanna play Doom, dust off your old diskettes and play it, dont mix EQ with a FPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. Because there isn't enough PP sinks in EQ, the older the server the more plat is in circulation. The more plat in circulation, the less it's worth. This is the same with old tradables as well.</div></div><hr />

Rather go play bass :D<br />
<br />
Btw, Fitemore's economical theory is correct :D There are many markets (servers), in which the value of play differs, it's like in any kind of basic trade operation, both good's value can change according to the amount of them in circulation (among other factors).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well they could just limit the amount you can win from a spicific server to stop cross server pp transfer by way of bets.<br />
<br />
Or they could just do bets by server... Say FoH vs. Triton, I can bet with anyone on SZ... should be enough people to supply bets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">04-03-2004, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's a great idea actually.  There would be a ton of interest I bet, and not just from the Zeks.  Sony could even set it up as a pp sink, with entrance fees being greater than the prize for winning.  I think it would also be pretty easy for Sony to set up a betting NPC.  Actually, the possibilities are pretty open.  Perhaps a ladder system, a la Starcraft, for individuals and teams.  Even for people who aren't usually interested in PvP, such as myself, I think it would be fun to do the occasional team event.  Especially if the zone or arena were instanced, and not just an open free for all that the bazaar arena is.  Good idea Sam.</div></div><hr />

Video games are not a sport. Video games are merely games that you play on a computer of other type unit.<br />

You are seeking some sort of justification for the time wasted... and there is none. EQ and other Video games are just a time sink, nothing more.<br />

If you get this kind of &quot;action&quot; on all servers, with arguments over betting on teams or people like you get arguments over which sports team is better just think of the greater interest that would be generated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a game to some a job to others. If you work for SONY its a job, not a time sink. Is Golf a time sink to Tiger Woods? Its his job. There is no reason that the most popular &quot;time sink&quot; in America if not the world should not be a job for some.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya FoH is old news I just pick them as they were once a power house. I guess TR vs. Triton or any of the other top guilds would be the big draw now days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The PvP servers used to be fun.  Now they have just degenerated into trash talk servers.  I am l33t, I pwn you, you suxxorz.  There has always been drama and the flame boards have always been an interesting read, but the in-game trash talk has become way too much.<br />
<br />
The BotB tournaments are and were a joke.  They were never real PvP situations.  Two toons or two groups in a tiny little arena isn't real EQ PvP.  Real EQ PvP is in big zones, big areas, with lots of terrain and obstacles and even mobs to deal with.  And also EQ PvP is more about gear than skill, especially in arena duels where you can't use the terrain and zones to your advantage.  There was a wizard who back in the day on TZ won the BotB when the max level was 60.  I kicked his ass regularly after the tourney with my level 53-54 wizard because he couldn't PvP for shit.  But he had gear and all his spells, so in an arena he could just stand there and outnuke other wizards.  No skill.<br />
<br />
I think it is a cool idea to have cross server PvP arenas.  But I don't think it is doable with the architecture they have for EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I also favor large zones, mountians, water, buildings and what not over little arenas. I mean they could even put in traps or like a metor storm where you have to doge random metors while pvping lol.... I mean the possibilities are endless. <br />
<br />
Sun is coming out with new servers designed for gameing I really dont think the day is that far away where technically you can just zone onto another server at will.<br />
<br />
No doubt whatsoever that gear is critical in pvp. Thats the whole idea. You pve to build up yur toon (like winning a race requires a faster car, a lot of winning is building the car), those with the best toons have a serious edge no doubt but thats the purpose of PvE. But large zones will also give skillfull pvpers a shot as well. Then again SONY can have some &quot;pick your toons&quot; area where you get a predefined toon or you and your oppenent get the exact same toon. This is just endless!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Shik. This seems to actually be a decent idea. Attacking Sam for being Sam isn't warrented here. The BotB had a HUGE amount of interest, and is still refered to even now. Something like this, if fairly bug free and implemented correctly could be great. Even if you didn't want to do the PvP, you could get together with other warriors from different servers and chat in person. I think there would be a pretty huge call for that, serverwide taverns with your actual character.</div></div><hr />

Yes there, it's called having sex for 12 hours and emerging at the top.... much more enjoyable.<br />

<br />
Honestly, listening to your description of ideal EQ, I have decided it's not for me.<br />

And about that X guild vs Y guild thing.... if you have more than 3 brain cells, you wouldnt pay to sit for hours and watch other ppl kill each other in front of your comp.... go out, get drunk, do whatever other more enjoyable thing. I mean, paying RL $ to be online and then spend all the time looking at how other ppl plays.... must be really fun, right?<br />
Turn on the TV and watch a box match, call your friends over and drink some beers, that sounds much better and sociable, but that's just my point of view, I play to have fun with my friends, not to compete to win the Best at EQ title of some sort... but I guess there is ppl for everything :)<br />
<br />
About servers, unless logic fails to me, even when like Sam said, the servers technology is getting better... this battle place has to be on a separate servers for everyone to connect to it, unless you want to use all the servers as gateways to connect to this new server... which really doesnt sound all that smart.</div></div><hr />

There are tons of people that like PvP (in the form of duels and whatnot) that wouldn't want to always be doing it. Something like this would allow an inbetween state, where people can take their normal character (or group or guild) and challenge others from other servers.<br />
<br />
 If they made a mini server, original EQ zones only perhaps, with no mobs at all that you could pay plat to temporarily transfer to and combat people from other servers... Well, I think it'd be huge. Lots of people would be interested in that, I think. No mobs = no worries about experience loss, no leveling, hunting named or factioning so there wouldn't be any character benefit. If SoE got really ambitious, they could hold events where they'd transfer people over for free for BotB tournaments and whatnot.<br />
<br />
  Dunno, still not something I'd be particularly interested in doing, but I can definitely see a niche for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is part of the problem, but there is more to it.  <br />
<br />
Some people also just like to PvP, all the time.  But the problem with that is if you just PvP you will always lose because you will be PvP'ing against someone else who has far superior gear due to the fact that they also raid a lot.  Gear &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Skill in EQ PvP.<br />
<br />
Some people also like to PvP most or all of the time, but they don't like to be trained or intentionally xp'd every time they encounter PvP.  Or they don't like to be corpse camped for hours on end if they happen to lose, preventing them from playing at all.  Or they don't like the trash talk that nearly everyone on the PvP servers engage in.<br />
<br />
Some people want to PvP all the time, but they can't stand the fact that they have to deal with invulnerable healers that are supposed to be on their *team*, and the fact that PvP teams servers have become 100% cross-teaming servers and there is no PvP teams left.  Many people started on the PvP teams servers for their teams, they enjoyed being evil, or they enjoyed being good, but now it's a clusterfvck.<br />
<br />
Some people just want honest, fair play, good PvP competition.  The problem is that in most games you have rules which make the game fair to play.  There used to be rules in EQ PvP, they used to enforce no training, no corpse camping, no bind rushing.  Now everyone trains, everyone cc's, everyone bind rushes.<br />

If all the people on the blue servers liked PvP as much as you then perhaps your idea would be more applicable but most of us hate PvP.<br />
<br />
I made a character once on Sulon Zek and as soon as I hit like level 8 or whatever you become atackable at, some level 65 ranger came and killed me over and over.  Thats just rediculous and I can't see how that could ever be considered fun.  It is basically the same scenario between two characters of different classes too.  How often is a level 65 warior going to beat a level 65 necro?  Not very often.  If the warrior likes dieing to dots and losing experience all the time I guess he would enjoy PvP but most people think its stupid the way it is set up in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">04-07-2004, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think most people love the odd match in the arena, especially if it's a friendly guild get together or something, where you know some dickhead won't come up and kill ya for the hell of it, just because he can.  What I think most people don't like about PvP are the morons that full-time PvP attracts.  As someone stated above, with an off/on switch such as instanced arenas, I think it would be relatively popular.  I enjoy messing around with friends in the arena, which I consider a different part of the game; yet I HATE PvP as such, when it's against other people... if that makes any sense.  I mean when it's with friends, it's more in fun and screwing around, even if both of us are trying to win.</div></div><hr />
