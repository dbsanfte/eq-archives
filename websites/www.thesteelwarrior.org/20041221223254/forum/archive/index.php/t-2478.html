Its rather low i was expecting something better.<br />

Its a toy nothing more. <br />

If it could go off with EB would be kickass :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't actually increase how often you proc at all.  All it does is gives you the chance to crit a straight dd proc.  At level 1 a crit adds 33%, level 2 is 66% and level 3 is double normal.  But if the spell can be partially resisted, then it still can be partially resisted.  An example would be, when I first bought Ingenuity my very first crit proc was for 2, on a 75pt dd proc =p.<br />
<br />
As Emilia said, the crit rate is very low.  It's basically a toy aa, but can be kinda fun, especially if you have a high damage dd proc (like the 750pt one from Time =p).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah they're right, I started spending my points in Ingenuity after i won a GBoS (179dd proc and 0.0 sec stun) since I was almost done with offensive AA's anyways.  The whole time i had Ing1, it never fired - went off a few times with Ing2.  Finally, when I got Ing3, it started going of on a somewhat regular basis.  So now, i may get a crit proc of 358 (i think thats right) once or twice a fight...or sometimes go 3-4 fights without it going off.<br />
It's neat to see yourself crit blast a mob and sometimes people will ooh and aah wondering how a warrior did that, but dont expect it to add any significant dps or agro, since it wont.  It's just a toy...albeit a really fun one. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure how often I actually crit a proc but the 179dd on CHoS and GBoS turns into 358dd on a crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have ingenuity 3 and I have never seen a critical proc for any other value than 1.33xbase for ingenuity 1, 1.66xbase for ingenuity 2, and 2.0xbase for ingenuity 3.  Perhaps this is just the weapons I am using but never have I seen a crtical blast for other than those values.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing is that someone mentioned 'it doesn't provide more aggro' ... well ... it may not be a huge boost, and isn't reliable because how rarely it goes off... but crit procs DO add more aggro than normal procs.  You can ask any wizard about this.  And I've noticed it in game as well.  <br />
<br />
That said, there are much more reliable and better ways of raising your aggro... but plenty of people have extra AAs...<br />
<br />
It doesn't work with damage shields.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree with that.  I don't know of one wizard who agrees with it.  Crits do nothing more for aggro, be it procs, nukes, or heals.  The aggro is the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so when a wizard crits for 5k, thats the same aggro as his normal 2.5k nuke?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it has to be.  Wizards complained when crits came out that an excessive crit could easily get them killed...in which case the AA could be a death trap instead of a DPS boost.<br />
<br />
Crits have the same aggro as normal nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">either you are saying that 1)aggro for casters has nothing to do from damage, 2) or aggro from a crit is a special case of burst aggro, where as the increased damae doesnt cause more aggro<br />
<br />
if 1 is the case, then chain casting a 100dmg nuke that takes 5secs to cast, is the same aggro from 3k nuke that takes 5secs to cast<br />
<br />
(i think my logic is sound...if aggro is caused by the amount of damage in a given amount of time, then crits would have to be a special case where the crit damage is ignored, and teh aggro is caused by the base damage.)<br />
<br />
case2 does make much more sense, and would be a nice logical idea...but who says this game is logical?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That at least seems the most logical to me, however we've seen many things in this game stray from logic before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well... not like AA are that tough to come by, and ours works on our innate spells as well, not just procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it takes a hybrid 18 points to reach what I beleive you get in 9<br />
<br />
Are you talking about ingenuity here?  It is 6 AA, Not 9.  ANd it costs the same for everyone.  (If you're not talking about ingenuity, then I don't know why it is in this post.)<br />
<br />
And you're wrong... you get the exact same thing in those 6 AA  (ingenuity 3) that we get... critical procs from weapons.  And you get the exact same crit rate and percent increase in damage.  Our Apples = Your Apples.<br />
<br />
The other 9 AA I think you are talking about (SCF3) is to get critical hits on spells that you cast.  Since we can't cast spells, it's kind of pointless to complain that we don't have to spend AAs to make them land for crits.  Your Oranges /= Our Oranges (because we don't have any oranges... just apples).</div></div><hr />

They get SCF, which effects both their casted nukes and weapon procs.  So, when considering just proc crits, it does cost less for us for the same effect.

<br />
I'm actually inclined to believe that each spell (talking about DD's here) generates a certain amount of aggro, be it critical, full, partial, or resist. <br />
<br />
I agree with Haass here.  I also think it applies to heals and somewhat to melee (depending on weapon, misses are less aggro, but I think hits are all the same aggro for that weapon).</div></div><hr />

Does Ingenuity also improve the procs from the LDoN Augments?<br />
More specificly Vampire Kiss and Force of Ykesha.<br />

I am considering BF/BoC both using Vampire Kiss and Ingenuity 3.<br />
Want to make sure it works before doing the investments. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, Haass is correct above. . .I've heard many casters say that aggro on a nuke is completely dependant on the particular spell, it doesn't matter how much damage it does.  Full resist, partial nuke, full nuke, or huge crit are all the same aggro.</div></div><hr />

&quot;slightly geeky?  Playing EQ at all is slightly geeky.  Posting about it on a message board is moderately geeky.  Writing your own perl scripts to parse your proc rate and then posting the DOS command lines to run your parser is full-on over-the-top alpha geek in his natural environment type of stuff (not that there's anything wrong with that).  :)<br />
