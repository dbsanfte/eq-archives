<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">koreddar</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering if getting the epic is worth it, and if auged EoE or JoS would be just as efficient at aggro as epic? I use DB and EoE(unauged) atm and hoping for a JoS soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Epic 1.5 is worth it for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1. 3% shielding, only other weapon with shielding is BBB.<br />
<br />
2. 45AC, making it the third highest AC 1H in game....and the highest AC offhander.<br />
<br />
3. 235HP, making it about #10 in hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Would EoE/JoS be just as effiecient aggro? Probably slightly better actually. Is the epic worth getting? You bet your ass.<br />
<br />
Oh, Oh, also the epic cuts 2 seconds off incite refresh....OMG WEEEEEEEEE</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, there's that too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I supppose it might be worth getting, but I was taking aggro from a warrior using Epic mainhand w/ 1 A3 and BF w/ 1 A3 offhand..... and I was using a BoC w/ 1 A3 and a GBoS w/ 1 A3 offhand.  Not saying that it's a bad weapon, I think he just needed to get the other A3 aug for it so he could put two on it, then it would have been good.  But yeah, the stats make it amazing.</div></div><hr />

It's worth it imo.<br />

The difference in one full proc mainhand is pretty huge.  With 2 anger3's in epic he would have plum run circles around you.</div></div><hr />

Yup, which is why I said:<br />
