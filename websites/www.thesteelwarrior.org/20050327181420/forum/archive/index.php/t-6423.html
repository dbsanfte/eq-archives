<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">macarser</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently a 58 Warrior on Maelin Starpyle and up until now have just followed the paces with the people that got me started in EQ, going on the raids they go on and grouping in zones they showed me.  It's time to step out of that, do some fun quests and just adventure out!<br />
<br />
I've tried to read as much as I can but although I've been playing for 2 years, I am new to the whole faction thing.  My question is are there any factions I should/shouldn't pay real attention to?  Here is my current list:<br />
<br />
Trying to maintain good:<br />
1) Coldain/Claws of Veeshan/Dain (I want to complete the Coldain ring quests)<br />
2) Venril Sathir (I want that Hammer!)<br />
3) Guards of Qeynos (I think it could be cool to complete the Qeynos Badge of Honor quests; are they worth it?)<br />
<br />
Not attempting to maintain good:<br />
1) Kromrif<br />
2) Kromzek<br />
<br />
Beyond these, there is nothing else I know to pay attention to; should there be something else I maintain good with, purposely destroy faction with, or don't ever need to worry about?<br />
<br />
Given Allakhazam's faction list, there are quite a few factions out there!  http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/factionlist.html</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep. Me too.  It only took one trip to Upper Guk to help a cleric friend of mine get the drop for clerical golden plate from there(back when the original class specific quest armor was still uber)  :) , and my faction has been hosed ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The009Feline</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, I think factions are a matter of personal choice. Especially with the velious factions. <br />
<br />
Personally, I am allied to Kael and I plan on getting the Warlord armor. Sure, it might not be as good as some of the high-end armor out there, but it's way better than Cobalt and according to the armor charts I've seen, for hitpoints and AC it's the best warrior gear available in Velious.<br />
<br />
So I had to kill some dwarves. *shrugs* I don't plan on getting a ring. <br />
<br />
Rather than openly dictating to newer players what they should be doing, offer a list of choices with the pros and cons.</div></div><hr />

You get lots of Named higher level faction hits during the cycle and you can trigger it over and over.<br />
<br />
I would also get Ally Chardok Faction. Lots of Fun quests in there.<br />

<br />
It looks like King Tormax and Dain Frostreaver IV are opposing factions; how do you keep them seperate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qaladar</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't.  Just have to be prepared to do a lot of faction work when you need to... and theres only a couple of reasons.<br />
<br />
Dain faction for 8th shawl quest (this is largely pointless for warriors so not really an issue).<br />
Dain faction for 10th ring<br />
<br />
Tormax faction to turnin both Yelinak and Dain heads for belt/gauntlets.  This is a good one to keep high, but then Tormax also drops some sweet melee gear.<br />
<br />
Yelinak faction to turnin Tormax head.  White dragonscale helmet is nice but if you are killing Tormax, this helmet is I think better for tanks.  This is mainly for casters... dragonscale boots are nice.<br />
<br />
Basically... you want to be on Tormax faction.  If your guild feels like doing a 10th ring, you need to switch. Also every time you off Tormax for his loot you may want to work it back up.</div></div><hr />
