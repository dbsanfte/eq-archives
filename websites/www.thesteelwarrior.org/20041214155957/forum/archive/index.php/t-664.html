It could be aligned to increase as skill increases.<br />
<br />
It doesn't nerf any other class, I certainly don't see it as being an 'unbalancing' fix, it simply tweaks an attack we all use (should be anyway) - it still has the chance to miss so its not guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Taunt would still have its place since it can flip a mob on success.<br />
<br />
Dunno, maybe its a dumb idea...I just see it as being a simple non-discipline non-aa solution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">'course that's an easy solution.  It's exactly why it will never been implemented either. :(<br />
<br />
Easy = bad to SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want to be able to add stun level aggro every 6 seconds for no cost? I'm as in favor of upgrading warrior aggro as the next guy, but that is better sustained aggro control than knights have at melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Struan_Xev</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real problem in all this is:<br />
<br />
This issue of taunt DEFINES the knight class. It gives them a purpose, it gives them the MASTER title at something.<br />
<br />
Rog &gt; Master of Damage, Scouting<br />
Wiz &gt; Master of Burst, Spell Damage<br />
Clr &gt; Master of Healing, HP buffing<br />
Shm &gt; Master of buffing, slowing<br />
Enc &gt; Master of Hasting, Mindbuffing, Crowd Control<br />
Monk &gt; Master unarmed fighting, pulling<br />
Magician &gt; Master of Pets, very good AE, nuking<br />
Ranger &gt; Master at ranged attacks, attk buffing<br />
Necro &gt; Well, they used to be masters at soloing..<br />
Druid &gt; Jack of All Trades<br />
<br />
Shadowknight &gt; Master taunter and offensive knight<br />
Paladin &gt; Master taunter and defensive knight<br />
<br />
Fixing taunt leaves Knights with nothing, but warriors will always be required for Raid Tanks (tho that might change given time)<br />
<br />
Warriors will NEVER be given easy aggro, it will always be dicey to ensure Knights have a spot to fill. We need to be the out and out better TANKS, soak damage, high HPs, better mitigation with the downside our aggro generation is dependant on the almight RNG.<br />
<br />
(From SoE perspective)</div></div><hr />

Tie it to skill so that it is not as sustainable as chain stuns. Hell, even if there was some hate modifier it could make a significant difference without being destabilizing.<br />
<br />
Again, I did say maybe it was a dumb idea ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash seems to add aggro nicely - but of course you lose aggro from losing your second weapon - I wonder what genius put that &quot;solution&quot; in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what SoE is doing is making one tank better for Raids and the other(s) better for groups. pallies still can tank in raids but groups are their strong point. warriors still tank in groups but raids are their strong point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pally near guaranteed aggro control is the unbalancing factor here. It allows casters to tash/slow/nuke/dot/etc non-stop with no consequences. The warrior's are not broken - the knights are. Only they are broken in such a way as to enable a pally MTd group to xp like mad so of course the pallies and casters don't want it 'fixed'.<br />
<br />
Casters *should* have to be careful about what/when they cast. They *should* need to learn and practice aggro managament. As long as knights can grab/hold aggro at such a low cost, the imbalance remains, no matter what changes may be made to  warriors.<br />
<br />
And btw, if warriors are supposed to be raid-tanks only, and not for xp group tanking, then they need a way to solo, since a pally (or an SK for that matter) is gonna win out with xp groups looking for an MT everytime in tier 2 and better. What we're gonna see is loads of 65 casters/pallies/SKs with tons of AA's, and warriors lagging badly in this regard.<br />
<br />
Also the pallies best-at-group, ok-at-raid and war best-at-raid, ok-at-group philosophy does not address the 'lazy caster' issue above that is the by product of the pally aggro imbalance.</div></div><hr />
