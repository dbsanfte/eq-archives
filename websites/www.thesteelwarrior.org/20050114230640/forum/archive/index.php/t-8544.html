P.S. For example i will go in with Furious AT and Dbotw + AHb once 12 seconds is up and i go defensive i put in shield then switch hotkeys so i can BASH   ;)</div></div><hr />

Your agro will suffer a lot.  Furious Bash is broken and does not work correctly.  You are much better off with the CHoS in your offhand.<br />

<br />
no, it is not broken and does work correctly, just not what we want ti to do and it isn't as strong or apperant as we would like it to be</div></div><hr />

A useful tactic on boss encounters but wasted in exp groups<br />
<br />
I'd make sure you have a native EB weap in main hand with anger 3 and wa3+ before you start equipping a shield for boss encounters though.<br />

<br />
As the previous poster stated; it is a poor design executed correctly.  FB needs to re-designed from the ground up to have any material value to the warrior community.</div></div><hr />

Which, sadly, doesnt appear to be on the horizon. :/<br />
<br />
To restate the best uses (that i know of):<br />
<br />
-When MT'ing bosses, after establishing solid aggro<br />
<br />
-When rampage tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FB does not affect Anger or EB type procs.  For warriors it only affects the bash swing itselfs hate.  Pretty ghey, especially when you read its description.  FB shields are great for:<br />
- ghetto bashing (only aggro use really)<br />
- post-defensive survival<br />
- offtanking<br />
- ramp tanking<br />
<br />
they suck right now for building any kind of aggro.  Shields are about survivablity not aggro =\</div></div><hr />

IE my agro is no better or worse. It is all largely dependant on whether my Bloodfrenzy procs or not, and it usually does.<br />
:)<br />
<br />
edit: It is better once your Bash skill is significant.<br />

<br />
That's what I do when I'm fighting a tough boss mob.  My primary is CHSD with anger 3 and WA3, secondary is SoTBS and anger 2...once I get a few procs I switch to the SC.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe it.  They aren't even in the same league.  <br />
<br />
SC is good for when agro is locked on you, or you are rampage tank.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe I sure do.  its all about getting a proc off.  Having a hate procing offhand only increases your chance to get that proc, doesnt garuntee chit.  On the other hand your Bash key is garunteed to pop back up for another swing in a few seconds.<br />
<br />
If a missed swing is no different aggro than a landed one, seems the same would follow on a bash swing.  The FB ups the amount of hate you get for the bash swing.  So its more &quot;relyable&quot; hate in that you can count on it being there when the buttons up versus counting on the RNG to roll you out a proc.  So after you land a taunt, you can follow it with a bash that you know for sure has more hate on it then a regular bash.<br />
<br />
Bashes do stun, although I've been told on these boards that bash/kick/slam stuns are different hate than magic based stuns (procs &amp; spells).  So how much (more) hate you get bash stunning versus magic stunning is unknown afaik.<br />
edit: It is better once your Bash skill is significant.<br />
ya know, hardly anyone ever mentions that when this discussion comes up.  I've got bash maxed and have tanked with my non-auged CHSD / SC and had no aggro issues.  My CHSD proc's a few times, I land a taunt (post debuff) and we're off to the races.<br />
<br />
However, I use dual wield for most mobs.  Its when Im getting chewed up alive that I fall back on my shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course 2 weapons with agro procs (BF/GBoS) is better than one and a shield (BF/SC), there is no way in the world the shield will make up for the agro of the GBoS. Of course you can hold agro with both set ups, but its really dependant on the group's  / other people's ability to control agro, and you can never really trust everyone to be doing their work flawlessly, you better try your best or what you think is best to generate agro and that's where the DW combo beats the Shield combo. Using a shield on boss encounters is a good idea like others mentioned tho. Right now, I wouldnt give away a second weapon for a shield (I mostly use 2h now, but nevertheless, I wouldnt).</div></div><hr />
