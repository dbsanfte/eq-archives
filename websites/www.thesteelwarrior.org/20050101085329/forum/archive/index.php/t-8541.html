<br />
I have a lvl 26 ogre warrior that I made long ago but havent been able to play him due to inactivity of my account. I also have a 65 druid which I can use to PL my Warrior. My question is since I have been away for so long, where is a good place to go and do some PL'ing?<br />
<br />
I know some will say not to PL and to enjoy the Warrior but I say &quot; hey I have the resources why not use them&quot;.<br />
<br />
I heard that Dalnir is a hot zone right now so was thinking of going there. Are there any other places I should try??<br />
<br />
Any info would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once War is around 35 - 40, take him to Lguk and have him pull a bunch of shit with DS on.  Swarm pulls will make his Def go up fast at that point, then when he's 43 he can group with your druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunt for greater XP rewards in the new Hot Spots.  Make your way to the following zones.<br />
<br />
60-65 Plane of Torment<br />
55-60 Chardok<br />
50-55 Grieg's End<br />
45-50 Nurga<br />
40-45 City of Mist<br />
35-40 Kaesora<br />
30-35 Dalnir<br />
25-30 Hollowshade Moor<br />
20-25 Runnyeye <br />
<br />
Those are the zones to do your pl'ing in, if that's your cup of tea.<br />
<br />
edit: from personal experience....a moderately equipped group of mid 50s will get awesome results in Grieg's End.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hot zones are ass IMO.  Just because a zone has a high ZEM or is a hotzone doesnt mean that the mobs will give you fast xp.  Many of the later expansion zones, especially LoY zones, have mobs with insane amounts of hps for their con.  No matter what xp you get per kill it will take you longer to level in those zones because the kills take so much longer.  The gnomes in sol a have very low hp, low damage output and there are almost unlimited amounts of them in the gnome castle.  I usually pull them 5-6 at a time and just DS tank them all down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same reason I recommend Upper Guk except it has the added benefit of the highest ZEM in the game including &quot;Hot Spot&quot; zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Upper Guk is massive XP.  It is only useful until level 29 or so, though.<br />
<br />
Coincidentally, this is the level at which the &quot;library&quot; area of Kaesora turns mostly yellow/white.  You probably can't do any better than Kaesora from 29-38, its XP was always very good, and now it's a hotspot too.<br />
<br />
Around level 40, you'll need to find a new zone.  City of Mist is probably the best choice currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hates</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">City of Mist is the best zone for PLing from about 30-45. Mobs have fairly low hp and hit for around 100-150 tops, named hit for 170.  Pulling trains in CoM is not hard either. From there I'd probably move to griegs end. Mobs hit for about the same as in CoM but have a bit more hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having soloed mobs in both zones I can say that the mobs in GE hit for about the same, but they have the avoidance/mitigation of SoL mobs. They take quite a bit longer to kill and have a considerable hit point difference. All are still DB at 65 in GE, but most are green to light blue in CoM. I'd go with the earliest expansion that offers blues+ on a consistant basis to keep the kills as fast as possible. Some good ones have already been mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteniteslayer</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks all for the info. I will post again with results..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteniteslayer</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here is my update.....<br />
<br />
When I started my experiment I was lvl 26.. I first went to guk and found it to be very lacking. Most mobs i fought were green. So off I went to kaeosora.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you, everything i fought was red to me at 26. I went in with 67 min left on my temp timer and in that 67 min I gained 2 1/2 lvls. After about 2 hrs in that great little place I gained 3 lvls and around 100 plat ( havent sold all goodies yet ).<br />
<br />
I plan to go back and milk that cash / xp cow till everything in there goes green. It is an awsome place to hunt ( helps with a 65 druid healing you ).<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the info....only question is where to go after there?????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll want to move deeper by level 35.  You may prefer to move to a new zone at that point, although Kaesora could sustain you past level 40.<br />
<br />
City of Mist at level 35 will be just like Kaesora was at level 26.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Better yet: dont power level whenever possible and actually play with groups (not like there are that many groups before level 55 anymore).  You are runing the risk of becoming one of the &quot;test tube&quot; warrs that hit level 60+ with no idea on how to play the class.  <br />
<br />
Note I say this not becuase I am not anti-power leveling but becuase I am stongly in favor of skilled warrs (also avoid 2 boxing for the same reason when you can).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dbol</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Groups are tough to find at lower levels, most just end up going the PL route.  Best thing is to put up the LFG tag while you're killing and try and get a few groups here and there.  IMO pling isn't the horrible thing it's made out to be if you do it correctly.  Take some time to smell the roses on the way up and try to get some dungeon groups going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mongrul</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been pling a warrior also... but mine is a 63 shaman that is doing the pling...<br />
I have been sitting in Stonebrunt getting 2 blues per kill from 20-30 so far. At 30 your getting 1 blue per kill and they have around 700-900 hp max.<br />
<br />
My set up... Shaman buffs up the warrior while grouped. Place the shaman on auto follow and then disband. The shaman will still follow the warrior around.. move to camp spot and kill along the way.<br />
park shaman...<br />
Shaman hot key 1 heal the warrior.<br />
Shaman hot key 2, /assist shaman's target,,, then /pet attack.<br />
<br />
Start pulling to the shaman, melee down and at 45% have the pet attack and finish off the mob. go get another and repeat.<br />
<br />
Once i got up in levels i started moving around as i was clearing out the area and pulls where gettign longer and longer... <br />
<br />
place shaman on auto follow and disband again.. move around the zone and killing anything that moves and is red... max hits where in the 100-125's for the mobs. at 30 i was hitting in the 40+ area <br />
<br />
since hitting 30 i have started groupping a 20 shaman in place of the shaman. So i buff up the warrior with the shaman then camp to the cleric.. group cleric and began the slaughter and the cleric and warrior are gaining levels at about the rate of one warrior level for 3 of the clerics levels...for the first 2-3 levels of the cleric...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I PL'ed my rogue to 50 in about 20 hours /played.<br />
<br />
1-9 i did a certain quest, used training points for skills.<br />
<br />
9-15 i did Paludal in an Area where there are ~15 mobs in a 10 second run, and fast respawn(don't know how to explain to get there, never seen i tcamped before though)<br />
<br />
15-35  Sol A- Goblins till 22, goblins have social aggro if you run past the mob that is fighting with the mob that you pulled.  *THE* most effective way to PL in my opinion.  Just get th next pull there before the last one runs, or be ready to root it.  When you hit 23, start working your way into gnomes.  I pull into a little cavern without any pops in it.  I believe this is by far the best experience around until 35.(although will try kaesora next character)<br />
<br />
35-50 City of Mist.  Went here at 35 pre-hot spot, slowed down at 43 or so.  When hotspot came along, exp jumped to another % per kill, and couldn't be happier.<br />
<br />
At 35, my friend's SK joined in the PLage, so exp got slower when he was around.  I am now 51, close to 52 by grouping with the SK in Nurga, looking for a better place to level.<br />
<br />
The key is low hp and fast pulls for greatest experience.  We tried some other places, just didn't cut it out compared to the places i listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whiteniteslayer</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you know last nite I tried doing the druid atk the mob thing when it was around 40% hp but got now xp for it.<br />
<br />
As for the grouping thing, I aleways put up my LFG tag when I log on. Only bite I got last nite was just as I was logging off. In addition to my 65 druid, I also have a 54 bst who I have used in many groups as a tank ( group thought my bst was a tank....boy where the wrong ) so I have a pretty good grasp of how to do it, but I do agree grouping would fine tune my abilities even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-19-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druid pet attacking at 40% only works if the other char doesnt have dmg shield on him. dmg shields don't count towards damage the tank does, it's just misc damage that is not calculated when it is determined who gets exp. if a warrior does 300 melee damage, the dmg shield does 300, and the sham pet does 400, sham gets exp, even though he attacked when the mob was at 40%</div></div><hr />

Spent the entire weekend in Kaesora with a few trips to CoM and Kael just to check things out. Went from lvl 30 to lvl 40 in under a day ( didnt play much on Sat and had 2 deaths ). Walked out with huge money ( well as huge as kaesora can give ), also got 2 drops ive never seen before - Tombcarver and Deathwatch sword.<br />
<br />
Now I think i'm off to Rathe to get some money or should I try somewhere else?</div></div><hr />

Rathe mountains i can garuntee you will be slow exp compared to what you have been grinding at, but decent money.<br />
<br />
CoM is decent money also(up to 4pp/mob with named also and goo's can drop gems) with great exp for the level</div></div><hr />

I took a 42 bard friend with me to CoM and got him a level in about an hour.  I was only using my then 55 Warrior and 55 cleric bot so that's a pretty poor PL setup.  I'd say head there for a few levels.  As a note, at 55 I gained about 2 blue while he gained a whole level.  Now that he's 43 I plan on hitting that with my 65 Cleric and Wizard for some AoE action :).</div></div><hr />

gah... I was stuck at lvl 55-63 for like 6 months.  Sure, I played 3 alts to lvl 50 in that time, but I can't imagine going 1 to 65 in two days play time.</div></div><hr />

Was in there for about 20 min when I got my ass handed to me by a mob that conned DB to my 65 druid. I had already used my evac aa ability so I couldnt use it to escape. Once the druid went down it didnt take long for the warrior to drop.<br />
<br />
I did make a good amount of xp before I died tho. I think it was 2% xp per kill. My only problem with howling stones is I dont know a good strat for the place as I have no previous experience in there. I tried to go up one of the stairs in the entrance/zone in but I just floated thru them and started to fall down to the lower lvl.<br />
<br />
Now am I supposed to go to the lower lvl or just try and pull mobs from lower area to zone in? I pulled 1 mob up before I was stupid and tried to take on the higher mob.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a link to a good strat or any helpful hints on fighting in HS?? I know I can fight there just dont know how to go about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-01-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a fun zone but certainly a bit different.  Here's an old map &amp; guide to HS (http://cloud.prohosting.com/~talone/Charasis.htm), from before the revamp, but still mostly accurate.<br />
<br />
Briefly: There are four wings (north/west/south/east, in that order) and a basement.  The four wings are locked, and the east stairs are illusionary.  Each wing contains the key for the next wing; the first key is dropped in the basement.  If you travel all four wings then you'll find items to make a permanent Master Key for all of the doors.  Portal pads in basement and first two wings take you back to zone in.  Last two wings' portal pads take you out of the zone.  Here's the progression:<br />
<br />
1. Drop to basement and kill bottomless feasters until you loot a &quot;tallow-marked candle&quot; (key to north wing). Use portal in center of basement to go back to zone in. Use candle to unlock north door.<br />
3. While killing in north wing, pick up ground spawn &quot;Sacrificial Robe Clasp&quot; (key to boss in north wing) and &quot;Dismembered Finger&quot; (part of the master key, loc = +331, +207)<br />
4. At end of north wing, kill &quot;Crypt Keeper&quot; and loot &quot;Sigil of the Calendar&quot; (key to west wing). Take portal back to zone in. Use sigil to unlock west wing.<br />
5. While killing in west wing, pick up ground spawn &quot;Skull engraved coin&quot; (key to boss in west wing) and &quot;Dismembered Thumb&quot; (second piece of the master key, loc = -143, +623)<br />
6. At end of west wing, kill &quot;Spectre Sepulcher&quot; and loot &quot;Broken Sacraficial Blade&quot; (key to south wing). Take portal back to zone in. Use blade to unlock south wing.<br />
7. While killing in south wing, pick up ground spawn &quot;Coin Depicting Innoruuk&quot; (key to boss in south wing) and &quot;Mutilated Forearm&quot; (3rd piece of master key, loc = -567, +152)<br />
8. At end of south wing, kill boss mob. Portal pad is zone out. BUT, there's a fake wall in the same room, which leads to a secret passage to the east wing. Head through secret passage to east wing.<br />
9. While killing in east wing, pick up ground spawn &quot;Blood Encrusted Glove&quot; (4th piece of master key, loc = +313, -567, combine other parts in glove to make &quot;Hand of Glory&quot; so you never have to pick up keys again).<br />
10. Kill Drusilla Sathir if up; zone out is behind her room.</div></div><hr />
