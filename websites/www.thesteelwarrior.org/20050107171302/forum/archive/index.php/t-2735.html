I am trying to think of great place to set up exp for me. Was wondering if anyone had any ideas. One thing to remember is I am 3 boxing on one machine. Alt tabbing thru all 3 instances back and fourth. I pretty much have everything hot keyed for ease. I would like a good place where I can get the most exp while playing. Also do you think CT would be a good place to try out or would I be asking for trouble? Any input would be greatful. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best places ive found was in veksar or in 1st teir PoP.<br />
<br />
Is your shaman or cleric inny worshipers?  if you dont have snare it limits where you hunt.  I also 3box war/cleric/sham and best place I've found was veksar.  Decent loot, no need for snare (cept gobbies) and decent exp.</div></div><hr />

This was long ago (before PoP), I'm sure there are better options out there now.</div></div><hr />

At your level i believe you would get great exp and decent cash 3boxing the level 60 wolf mobs in the maze in PoN.  Clr and Shm can gate out when done.  War can trigger the maze event and follow Thelin to get ported out when Thelin dies at the first wolf he encouters.<br />
<br />
Maze is all single pulls if you stick to the wolves on the right hand side.  If you see a bird mob, you are in the wrong side.  You need an FD puller or some form of CC to take on the mobs in the bird area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds pretty cool Hittem.  Do the wolves respawn?  or do you have leave and get ported into a new maze?  Do they run?  Would it be doable with just a 65 warrior/57 cleric?  and a ToD to slow?  Might have to try this tonight anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes wolves respawn.  I think timer is 12 minutes.  No they do not run.  Do not need snare.<br />
Drop twisted longbow, diamonds, raw diamonds, blue diamonds and peridots.  61-62 parch also drop.<br />
<br />
The birds are on some other screwy timer that i never bothered to figure out but its much longer than 12 min.<br />
<br />
Zone into PoN, levi to hedge.  Chat to Thelin to zone in<br />
<br />
Working from memory here, from Thelin run forward and take the first left.  Keep left and you will see a wolf.  I call him mob 1.  Kill him.  If you have a CC/FD crew, you can go farther in this direction and kill a bunch of mobs.  If not, then go back to Thelin.<br />
<br />
From Thelin, take the first right.  Then keep left – if you take second right you’ll wander around a bit but find nothing but dead ends.  If memory serves there is a big straitish section.  If you hunt around down there you’ll find three more wolf spawns within about a 1 minute run from each other.  <br />
<br />
I never found any other mobs down in this section. Probably with Clr/War duo just the 3 spawns will keep you busy in the 12 minute respawn window.  The mobs are not side by side so you have to run from camp to camp, but they are all single pulls unless someone has triggered the maze event in which case some of them are doubles of a mob with the same model but diff name.  This is quite rare that someone would leave the maze in this state but you should have a gate pot/mechanism that you use in this case.  The mob you want is A Nightstalker.  They all conned 60 to me although Allak lists them as 59-60.<br />
<br />
Move slowly and make a spaghetti map with LoY until you have the spawn locations memorized.  If you move too fast you might round a corner and get surprised.</div></div><hr />
