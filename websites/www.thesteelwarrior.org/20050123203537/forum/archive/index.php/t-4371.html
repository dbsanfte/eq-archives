ColdDMG:2, BaneDmg:Undead+1 <br />

How exactly are cold and undead damage bonuses applied?  Does the mob get a save? Are both applied against one mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say both apply, there is no save versus the bane damage, and there is a save versus the cold/fir/magic/poison/disease damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding, from back in the days when people were using Longsword of Eth. energy:<br />
<br />
Elemental damage is first checked to see if it's completely resisted or not (on each hit).  With Longsword of Eth. this was +5 magic damage, so MR was checked.  If the magic successfully landed, then it would add a random ammount to the weapon's damage value, a random value from 1 to 5, or zero to 5, I forget.  This resulted in the sword averaging like 1.5 extra damage to it's base damage value (from the +5).  This always seemed rather a stupid way to do it to me, but there you have it.  So to recap, it didn't add +5 to the damage, it added a random number 1 to 5 IF the resist check was made.<br />
<br />
So. . .my prediction is that on mobs that are not cold resistant, you'd average about +1 to the weapons base damage value.  The undead bane portion would be a separate additional ammount to undead.</div></div><hr />

It adds to the total damage after all other calculations. Bane damge is added to the weapons damage before any other calculations, provided you are fighting a mob of the proper type. i.e. a 13/20 weapon with Bane undead +2 is 15/20 vs undead, but a 13/20 weapon with +2 fire is just 13/20, with 0-2 damage added per hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bane dmg are added to the base dmg of a weapon, if the target type matches the bane dmg type.<br />
<br />
both of them are nothing related to the dmg bonus of the weapon. they are added directly to the base dmg of the weapon. <br />
- for example, if u assume PoFire mobs dont resist cold base dd at all, a 15 20 1hs with the augment u listed, will be working as a 17 20 1hs against the mobs, and working as a 18 20 1hs against horse, as they (additionally) are undeads.</div></div><hr />
