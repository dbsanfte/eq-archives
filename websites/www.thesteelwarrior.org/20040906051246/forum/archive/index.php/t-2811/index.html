<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Granting that this board is mainly for warrior balance and improvement (or bitching depending on the poster=) this may be a bit off base. And granted I shouldn't be trying to write anything intelligent at six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday. But....<br />
<br />
Future Plans for September, 2003<br />
Class Balance<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. Some options being considered are:<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />
Maybe a better solution to our own individual problems lies in coming up with ideas that would positively enhance warriors, monks, and rogues at the same time without shuffling the widened gap between we three and the hybrid/caster crowd further up the road. Given the fact that Sony has just now stated that they believe putting in solutions for the problem will be difficult, and I take that to read as Sony is either without a clue as to how to go about this or unwilling to make a large to the game out of fear of losing the all mighty dollar, I was curious what you all thought would be workable solutions in both the short term and long term for all three pure melee classes. <br />
<br />
From my own experience I've played warrior charactors extensively and both the rogue and monk classes enough to understand a fair amount of their foundations. Even though the other two classes differ in that they are largely offensive classes to our defensive they still share the same problems. One of those being our originally unqiue talents have been marginalized while hybrids and pure casters continue to grow in utility. Another that Sony sees is the large gap between melee and caster damage output. A few things I can think of at this early hour include...<br />
<br />
-Improving pure melee discs- They are relics of the Kunark Expansion and badly need improvement. Countless threads on this board and I'm sure the other class boards detail how the whole line of discs could be improved.<br />
<br />
-Changing the ways current spells work- Again this is something Sony mentions. Even though it would probably involve the dreaded nerf bat its probably in the best intrest of the game. Enchanter charm was insanely overpowered during the beginning of Planes of Power and was brought down in power. For instance could the spell lines such as harmony and lull need such a retuning to bring back the edge the monks and to a lesser extent the shadowknights had? <br />
<br />
-Introducing more mods and melee focuses- Furious Bash is rather unique as a melee focus effect, broken as it is most times. It would certainly help with damage if more items had unique and creative melee focus effects. It would also be a big boost if items more commonly had skill mods on them for our weapons skills. Rogues have backstab mod daggers but until PoP arrived those daggers were rare drops off the bosses in Ssra. Why not introduce or retrograde weapons with more one hand slashing or two hand bash mods? It could even go as far as to go to character development. Who hasn't heard the story about the warrior who has his one trusted enchanted weapon he can't part with?<br />
<br />
-Improve our epics- Lets beat a dead horse here. With Lost Dungeons some weapons and items will be modifiable. Why not apply that attitude towards weapons that people spent a long time questing and fighting for and give them back some life? Weapons with a delay of twenty are much more common now than they were in Kunark times for a warrior so they make the delay of twenty-four seem unattractive. Simply drop the delay down to twenty and spruce up the stats a bit. Hell the monk epic's effect is on ornate leather gloves and those can be bought in the bazaar now! And so what if other classes would whine about improving their epics. I'm a firm believer in the concept that we all worked hard on our epics and a part of us hated having to put them away in the bank to be able to keep up with the pace of the game. The single fact that people still do their epics when you could say that they aren't worth the time running around Kunark and Antonica for goes to show that people still feel that it is very much worth it.<br />
<br />
But really those ideas are nothing new. I'd love to here what unusual and unexpected ideas are out there. I wouldn't have thought about the DAoC/Furor hate dots myself and like the idea a lot. Stuff like that, the dynamic thinking, is what makes playing a game enjoyable. <br />
<br />
I'm going to go flop back into bed now. If any of this makes sense the next time I read it I'll truely be suprised =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Improving epics is hardly akin to class balance.  May as well complain that Crafted armor needs upgrading.  <br />
<br />
Epics were designed to battle Kunark mobs and lasted as far into Velious as yaks and mith 2handers lasted into Kunark.  They were upgraded, just like every other weapon or armor piece, by putting something better in the game.  Wear your lightsabers for screenshots, or get them if you think it would be cool, but don't go do a 3 year old quest in hopes of getting the end-all, be-all of weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was using the epics as an example of Sony's idea to improve melee through items -cough- band-aid -cough-. And I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the lightsabers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, look on the bright side.  Going back through the previous Future Plans, they have completed everything they said they would, except reitemization in PoP, Class Balance, and shields.  Rebalancing for pure melees must be just around the corner...<br />
<br />
I'm not holding my breath though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When they find time of course.  And since class balance doesn't happen in priority over releasing expansions, expect a couple of more expansions first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Absor makes me cry sometimes. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The answer is to propose both class-specific and general fixes. Really it's simple; 2 individual class fixes per class; 2 for warriors 2 monks 2 rogues. Then, 2 or 3 general melee fixes.<br />
<br />
1) Skillcaps. 10 point per level in every major skill-cap between 60 and 65. Maybe 2-5 per level for hybrids, depending on how many upgrades we get.<br />
<br />
2) Stances. Discs replace with stances. No limited duration, no re-use time. 3 stances for monks/rogues; Offensive, Defensive, Spellshield (not the actual spell, but reduced damage taken from spells rather than melee). Warriors get 2 stances; Offensive, Spellshield (assuming that as class-specific, warriors get the fucking disc defensive removed, and get some better innate mitigation; something like 15-20% to DI and DB). <br />
<br />
Class-specific upgrades, I only know the good warrior ones in my opinion:<br />
<br />
1) Agro fix. 2 parts. 1) Furor's DOT idea; can't find link atm. Basically, dot component; 350hated per tick. He proposed 150 damage/tick; (this is the level 65 version, he mentioned lower-level versions with lower damage/hate tick). I think this is a bit much in terms of the DPS since warriors already do enough at the high end. I'd say maybe 80 per tick, maybe even 60 since 10-15 becomes more negligeble in terms of DPS; but same agro. <br />
<br />
Other idea; they can stack. EB innate effect; 700hate, 40 second refresh. If this implemented, changed proc on current EB weapons to 200dd unresistable + 0.0 stun because the EB effect alone would become severely less useful, considering most of these are quite difficult to get, they would not longer be as prestigious. <br />
<br />
2) HP/Mitigation. Either 5% innate Natural Durability and innate 20% off DI and DB or 10% ND and 15% off DI and DB. in both cases, disc defensive gets removed. Disc evasive changed; 1 minute duration 15-20 reuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hm for warrior change the charm slot to something useful.<br />
<br />
Make the wooden figurine a part with an clickie effect ( 30 seconds refresh 1.5 second cast time ). That effect could grow with the number of flags you earn.<br />
<br />
The casttime is useful cause we do not have any form of channeling so you can't really use it in fights or on raids MTing. It would so only be usefull as a starter. 30 Seconds seem short enough to be useful in every fight at the beginning.<br />
<br />
Startstats are 150 DD 150 aggro with flag 1.<br />
ADD per Flag would be around 12 DD and 12 aggro. So someone with 4 Flags has a 186 DD with extra 186 aggro.<br />
Elementals would be 9 Flags = 246 DD and 246 aggo.<br />
For non flagged warrior Sony would have a chance to change some charms to stuff up to these 150 dd 150 aggro.<br />
<br />
Other stuff would be to place a weapon in the charm slot and have the weapon proc as a clickie with a 30 second refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One of the things that I feel is wrong about most of the ideas I seen posted here is that they take programming. Elsewhere Absor admitted one reason casters get frequently tuned is that it is easy to adjust a spell and it's effects.<br />
<br />
Either itemization or the new augmentation slot should be used to adjust the weapons that melee's actually use to be able to do the job and output decent DPS. Windblade for Knights and GSoT, CHoS, and SotB (if the DPS was simular to Windblade) for Warriors are steps in the right direction for mid level 50's. They need to follow through for level 60-65's.<br />
<br />
I don't want to see Knights unable to get groups and never be able to MT. But I do want to see Warriors return to being the prefered MT in most situations. I believe increasing the Knight's utility in groups by being able to cast short duration low mana cost single battle spells would do the job.<br />
<br />
Warriors need to be able to deliver aggro on demand just like Knights. Warrior aggro generation could be increased - Critical Hits or kicks could always stun. Or aggro when a stun doesn't stick needs to be eliminated. I personally don't believe Warriors should be able to achieve a near absolute lock on aggro and neither should Knights.<br />
<br />
Warriors need some way to acquire aggro at a distance. There are a few items that can help (funny how we always end up with prosthetic devices) but there is no practical way of recharging them. This needs to change. Allowing vendor recharge at a reasonable price for these items would help.<br />
<br />
I know SoE is trying hard to make all these classes fun to play as well without unbalancing the game. I believe finding a way for all melee to solo effectively when they can't find a group would help. When you log in, you want to play not sit around. Maybe upping DPS will accomplish this, I don't know.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Recharge would not really help.<br />
<br />
Man the number of charges on most Items are 10 or lower. So you can take that thing with 5 charges stun (2.5 second cast time ) and - cause its not lore - farm some of them until you have a full backpack. Then you have ... hm wow 50 stuns ( with 1 extra thing in bank ) until you have to say to your group. Sorry guys I have a date with my merchant for retuning my stun Items for aggro.<br />
<br />
Bleh.<br />
<br />
And they will not made Items with unlimited charges with agro clickies on - only by accident like the weapon with the unlimited clinging darkness instant cast. ( Was changed in 10 charges when I remember right )<br />
<br />
All they can make for raising the possibility of warrior to gain fast aggro is a part of programming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gazarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For aggro:<br />
<br />
I think a dot like ability would suck since on big raid some mob have their debuff/dot slot already filled, no need to have a warrior dot that won't stick cuz the buff slot are full.<br />
<br />
I just want innate ability to buff myself with a Terror and Voice of Thule type of buff, either from a piece of gear of various lvl, or AA or just plain innate ability given to warrior.<br />
<br />
Of course this &quot;warrior&quot; spell like ability should stack with current SK and chanter hate buff.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
As for giving us a special ability on raid and xp group to make us more useful, they should just take /shield a step further and make us much better body guard, 50% dmg to the target we protect is still not enough imo, we should have higher chance to die by protecting someone, but actually make it almost impossible for them to die.</div></div><hr />
