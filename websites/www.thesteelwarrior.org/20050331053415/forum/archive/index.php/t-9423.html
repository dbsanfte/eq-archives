I am waitting for over 2 months to get a drakblade but it never drops, well my guild is in Uqua now and maybe we will see a Fleshbiter soon. For you guys that have any of them of even both, can you pls tell me if it is ok to forget bout Darkblade and get Fleshbiter, I mean, is Fleshbiter a good aggro weapon like Darkblade?<br />
Thank you<br />

<br />
But if you want a good weapon and have given up on getting a DB go for it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I had this question earlier and I did a search.  It seems that people agree (and doing the numerical analisys, if you believe in that) that the Fleshbiter is good enough that if you've given up on DB you should grab it instead.  It seems to be pretty good if you're dying to get a new 1h agro machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nafun</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've had 6 DBotW in about 9 months of time, 1 fleshbiter in.. I think 5 barxts.  If you're desperate, go for the fb, but DB will eventually drop, you're doing time every week, but  you're going to do barxt a few times for flags, then a few times for backflags, and that's it.  It's entirely possible you'll never see a FB drop, because Uqua is not something you'll ever be farming for loot.  If you think you'll stop doing time before you get a DBotW, grab an FB if you see one, otherwise, I'd hold out, you don't want to get into a position where you spend points on a FB, then have to turn around and spend points on a DB a few weeks later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">issu</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not only barxt will drop FB, and the loots shared between Barxt and Golem are pretty less in contrast of RZ loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jobned</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i think that if you still farm plane of time there is a larger change of having a dbotw drop than a fleshbiter. Barxxt is realy only a reflag mob that should be attempted to do as rare as possible imo while farming time is something you do as often as possible. Both weapons are rare.<br />
<br />
When that is said, personally i waited 20 weeks for a darkblade to drop. I was 100 % ready to take a fleshbiter if it dropped, however then sudenly out of nowhere we got 2 x dbotw in a row and we didnt see a fleshbiter yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take either.  Darkblade is better aggro then a FB, bit there is nothin wrong with it.  BTW we've done Uqua I dunno how many times and we still fek haven't seen a FB =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">12 months of Time Farming.<br />
40ish RZ<br />
2 Darkblades (2 more dopped back to back during my break)<br />
<br />
5 Barxt<br />
6 Golems<br />
2 Fleshbiter<br />
<br />
I my guild we have : DB+EoE Flesh+JoS DB+EoE  DB+Demerix and to be honest i dont see any difference.<br />
I'm using Epic/JoS and i manage to draw agro (CE29 helps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xolerus</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, and I am not lying here, I dont have any problem getting aggro with my Bloddfrenzy + Epic, but BF lack some stats and I am really bored with some weapon that is like 3 expansions old.<br />
To tell you guys the truth I just didnt give up bout Darkblade its because FB looks like Elf Shoes and look damm ugly in an ogre.<br />
But tnks a lot for the info, I will stay waitting for DB =)<br />

However put it up against BBOB and it will hang with np agro wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just hang in there, it'll drop eventually.  BF + epic 1.5  agro is sufficient that it'll hold you until you get a dbow.</div></div><hr />

6 Killing on Baxrt/DC and no Fleshbiter.<br />
<br />
Both seem to be rare as hell. I would got with the one you get your hands on first, although I wanna get Darkblade before guild stops farming time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Drop rates are random enough that you erally never know if your gunna get another FB OR DBoTWL, if you have a lot of time ahead of you in time, and you think you'd have a good shot at DBOTWL, it might be a good idea to save for it..<br />
<br />
if your middle  or near end of time, and or you may not win DBoTWL if it drops, dont be affraid to snag a FB if it drops, its a lot better then most other weapons, and will more then suffice..</div></div><hr />

I think the last one dropped back in the first week of August.  On the other hand, We got a FB the second time we attempted the Golem in Ugua, which was yesterday.<br />
<br />
Can the FB drop from the Golem, Bartx and the Golem Barxt is with?<br />
<br />
Sorry I cant remember the names of the golems, Its been pretty late when we fought to them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we still havent had any DBoW drop in the last three weeks, that makes it over  three months w/o one.  The other guld that raids Time has not had one drop in their first month there.  I was wondering if it was broken, but it seems other servers have it drop.  Can RZ drop 2 tho?<br />

Red<br />
Never heard class specific weapons in time drop in doubles and not seen it for any class in 30+ time clearings.<br />
RZ can drop double loot but for us it was bp molds which we got doubles more than single dbows.<br />
We got 4 DBoW's so far (2 in the first 5 and 2 in the last 5 out of 34 RZ kills), but only 3 bard only weapons off inny and 2 (yes two) spears of fate off Saryrn.<br />
We have monk/bl heaven though, as 9 SoT and 9 Shinais dropped.<br />
So DBoW isnt rarer than other weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't mention that bard weapon.  It has dropped twice in a row now.  Now that I think about it, the other weapons are pretty rare tho.  Only one Hope bringer that I can recall.  Only 2 EoE.  About 4 VDD. (3ish month Period).<br />
<br />
I am Still waiting on a VDD.  I got so desperate I bought a BoC to upgrade my CHSD.<br />
