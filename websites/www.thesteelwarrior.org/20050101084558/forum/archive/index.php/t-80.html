<br />
Those should be fairly easy upgrades, but over all, you should work on getting your velious gear, depending on your guild's alignment of faction.<br />
<br />
Next step would be working on better haste, but you should be doing great.</div></div><hr />

Here's what i posted on another thread, but then realized that's not the question he asked ;)<br />
<br />

<br />
ok, it's a pain in the ass trying to show you the code without having actually convert it SO,<br />
<br />
1) Replace all the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; with &quot;[&quot; &quot;]&quot; respectively.<br />
<br />
2) Put in YOUR magelo # where I indicated in the code.<br />
<br />
3) Put in YOUR image path where I indicated above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megunna</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/me wishes gear like that existed when I was 45.<br />
<br />
/me notices you have Required Level 46 gear equipped.<br />
<br />
/shrug. At any rate, you're nowhere near maxing STA, so pick up a Vah Shir Claw Earring. The extra AC alone makes it worth it, 4 STA and 6 DEX just makes it (seemingly) obvious. Perhaps a Wolf Fang Earring for the other ear, as well (4AC 3STR 2STA). Or, even better, pick up the parts for an Earring of Solstice (All the parts needed for the unfailable combine are droppable, then just turn the result in to a guy in Fungus Grove).<br />
<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace will give ya another decent boost to STA and AC, short of that, gather a group up and try to get a Shaded Medallion from Maiden's Eye. 15 AC with nice resists, hard to beat as far as pure AC goes.<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes or Elysian Death Mask for face...though I would rate these at low priority.<br />
<br />
Bracelet of Fortitude, decent AC, great STA, and 6 to all resists...hard to beat.<br />
<br />
If you have the cash, RBG, upgraded haste, and you free up your hand slot for Vellious quest armor.<br />
<br />
Grab a few of these upgrades, then focus on leveling and getting faction and gems to MQ / Hunt in Kael for some Champs / Myrmidon's armor. The gems are easy enough to get or buy, and the MQ's are going for dirt cheap now days.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Err, just re-read your post and noticed the budget...with that said, the list above may still be helpful for a general path to take. As for what I believe would be the most efficient way to spend the money you have at the moment, buy the parts for the Earring of Solstice. Why? It's an earring that will last you a good long time. Long after most of the other things will have been replaced, you'll still be wearing that &quot;caster's earring&quot;. I'd save any extra cash for future upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, I'd just say level up and begin plane/kael raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I have the val ring and nightmare bow in my inventory,  less than half a level till I can use them, so I figured I might as well put them in there so you guys don't recommend I upgrade those slots as I would be doing that soon anyway.  And thanks for the info guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an Iksar War on Fennin, and have a complete understanding of where your coming from.  No Crusty, no Crafted, etc.  Bracelet of Fortitude is great, if you raid (lower levels) or group (higher) UP you have a good chance of running along it (Radir hunts are fun anyhow) and the Shadowheart is an awesome weapon stat wise.  Otherwise, one thing I did is choose the Rushing Wind Longbow over the Nightmare.  It has 8 stamina, and in the long run (till you hit max stats) thats more hp then the 25 on the nightmare.  Its comperable range and ratio, and for most warriors its only for pulling.  Next I did alot of Kael fighting, and it helped alot, still actually have my Thurg gaunts (I have shadowy assasins sash haste from UP) instead of SS.  When you get max ally with SS, the Draconic Pauld quest is the best you can do for the effort (on level 53-57 group can do it easy).  Not sure what else to suggest, if you want to take a gander at my gear, here it is:<br />
