<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get max hasted,  with a huge dex buff,  and yo uwould do some nice DPS,  not sure on aggro,  but since DD are about 1 aggro point per dmg point,  I'd say you'd be doing at least a lil aggro pre-proc,  and then just adding on top after it procs.   <br />
<br />
That doesn't factor in any critical dmg proc AA's,  so maybe with a few of them it would be VERY nice dmg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I picked one up last night. Pretty neat item. Didn't parse my dps and i was opposite a warrior with a BoW so aggro wasn't much of an issue really. I would draw aggro when the mob came into camp and i proced first swing, but then he would turn away after. the DD is nice but i never got a crit blast :mad: <br />
<br />
i don't think this would be a good aggro weapon but might be decent dps. being primary only kinda hurts and only 45hps, don't think i'll use it other than for fun really. Only augments you can put on it is type 1 which are stat gems and maybe the 10hp one.<br />
<br />
btw, it looks like a pink glowing fist with sparkles. &lt;3 my first particle weapon, hehe</div></div><hr />
