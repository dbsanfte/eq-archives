<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I got in a little over my head taking on a Hill Giant with my level 40 warrior.<br />
<br />
She's a tough little bitch.  I thought she could do it.  I guessed wrong.  I was running for the zone when this druid-dog comes bounding along to my rescue, casts heal on me, helps me take the fucker out.  <br />
<br />
That was cool.<br />
<br />
I turn around and raise my hand to salute the druid, say thanks and good journeys and all that stuff - when he climbs up onto his high horse and starts this rant about how I shouldn't oughta be fighting all by my lil' self!<br />
<br />
DON'T YOU WARRIORS UNDERSTAND YOU SHOULD BE PARTNERED UP WITH A HEALER?<br />
<br />
My hand sorta stopped midway to my head and I said WTF...?!?<br />
<br />
I mean, yeah, I like a good group every now and then, but first and foremost I like to SOLO my warrior bitch, without having to worry about ninja looters and 12-year-old whiney boys who think they're gonna prove their manhood by ordering my ass around.<br />
<br />
But this dumb dog is sitting there, tongue lolling out of his mouth, and has the audacity to say, &quot;You know,&quot; pant pant, &quot;you really oughta consider teaming up with a cleric,&quot; drool pant drool pant, howl.<br />
<br />
Like the thought had never occurred to me before!  OMG!  Me dumb warrior.  Me no think good.  Me not know how fight with cleric.  Me not know how group.<br />
<br />
If the bastard hadn't been 20 levels higher than me I'da dueled his ass right then and there.  Probably shoulda anyway, even though I woulda died.  It was a just cause dammit!<br />
<br />
I get so sick of this condescending &quot;you really oughta find a nice group, lil girl, don't you know soloing is daaaaaaangerous?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hey - DANGER IS MY LIFE, I thrive on it, live for it, sharpen my sword every night DREAMIN' of it... if I choose to fight a dumbass battle, then thats my choice, heal me thats fine - but don't fuckin' lecture me about what a dumbass I am....<br />
<br />
These druids have no honor.  They've gotten too soft and flabby using spells all the time, not developing their muscles, relying on us meat shields to tank it for them....<br />
<br />
And what's up with this M'Lady crap?  I'm a goddamn warrior.  I ain't wearing no dress.  Save that language for the High Elves with their pretty hair and embroidered-shmoidered finery.  I live by the sword, I ain't afraid of dying by it.<br />
<br />
If your heals come with a lecture and a &quot;lil girl&quot; then save 'em for someone who isn't afraid to die, cuz I'd rather trudge through all of Norrath naked looking for my corpse than listen to that schmaltzy crap.<br />

That they were telling you this because you are a warrior and not because you are a girl, 'cause warriors are like the 3rd worse class to pick for soloing you know.<br />
<br />
The motive was probably because he wanted as many giant spawns to himself as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prolly so, but I get the 'lil girl thing a lot too, and that gets OLD real quick.  No shit warriors suck for soloing, but damn it I LIKE soloing and I like my warrior and I don't need a lecture from some high-level-doggie every time I go hunting :)<br />

<br />
i tried HGs and there is no way to compete with those uppity droods who can track. ofcourse if it makes ya feel any better you can always kill a few druids and make the world a better place .THAT'S why i avoid the druid ring in east karana lol.<br />

I still like to try it when I get the itch. Mostly in Akheva now days. Wait till 65, his ass will still be there. Go arrow down the whole place and wipe em all. Had the same thing happen to me when I was 45ish so now I like to go back at 65 and just aggro the whole damn hill once in a while just to hear em all scream=)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the advise, Belwolf... will hike my lvl 40 on up there.  Don't think I'll kill any druids.... yet... though I may take out a treant just for shits and giggles.<br />

Lower hp, lower ac/mitigation, BS doesn't work from the front... I can't think of any class that is worse off than them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhenobia</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first character was a rougue, because I mistakenly thought EQ rougues would be like the rougues in Diablo... got her to 20-something before I got bored.  She died too easily.  I definately think warriors are superior to rougues.  Heck warriors are superior to EVERYTHING. :)<br />

Say &quot;thanks for the heal, bye&quot; and leave. Put him on ignore, if you want. Then you wouldn't even need to vent here :)<br />

<br />
But I made one BIG mistake...I did not turn on /anon  and man.....when a drood saw me there he came running up and started freaking the hell out. omfgz 65 war what are you doing here go away! ! ! omg omg omg and omgz! He started /ooc in zone omg 65 warrior up here killing all teh mobz!!!!<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, I basically told him to F'off and leave us be, or he might have some trouble finding *any* more HG's up =P.</div></div><hr />

BAHAHA let him. i always mention to the cleric it takes less mana to rez a ranja then keep it alive and if they don't believe me they will VERY shortly  /grin <br />
<br />
the best part is  that now that i am lvl 57 with firstaid 3 and IF he survives i patch him up to 100% and then tell him to watch a real tank at work /snicker 207 BW 82hp per banadae with an embalmers skinning knife:=) (great for posion traps in MM)</div></div><hr />

LOL Yeh.... the dumbass kept running off to pull things when our druid wasn't medded up yet... I had to keep saying over and over WAIT until he's FM, please... then he was trying to tell me when to use my BASH and when to use my Duel Wield...  tell you what, I bashed HIM.  Verbally.  Hauled his ass down to the ground told him to let me do the pulling cuz I'm the tank, he can be the Main Assist which means to STFU and ASSIST and stop being a back-seat-driving grandma.  Dumbass still didn't listen, he kept forgetting he was in a group and musta thought he was soloing, problem is he'd pull adds, which aggroed on us... *sheesh* if they wanna be warriors, then by all means, play a warrior!  Stop trying to turn your ranger/paladin/whatever hybrid into one.<br />

LOL I don't hate all druids, just obnoxious little arfy ones. :)  My fiance is a druid, he's OK, I'd fight with him any day... doesn't tell me what I can do with my sword, not ever.  He's respectful and supportive, the way a man should be :p <br />

<br />
&quot;...Bring appetite enough for thick, yak-milk yogurt, cheese and marmot meat hot from a dung-fired stove. Try fermented cow's or mare's milk. After a bowl or two, you'll be ready to invade Europe yourself.&quot;<br />
