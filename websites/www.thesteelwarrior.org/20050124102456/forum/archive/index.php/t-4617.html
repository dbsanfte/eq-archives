<br />
I have recently found this msg board and have got some great tips from the posts of others. I have now reached the point where I need some assistance myself, specifically where I should focus my next couple of upgrades. A couple of friends are going to help me camp the Soulscream Belt, but beyond that was hoping for some gear upgrade advise.<br />
<br />
My warrior is a Level 45 Dwarf worshiping Brell Serillis, so Fierce Heraldic is out and the Underfoot Plate seems to pale in comparison to Fierce. I have around 10k to spend, but farming HK Guards with my retired 61 Rogue can get me more, and am guildless(but have a few lvl 65 friends).<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Also the BOT 75 hp rings are cheap. You have enough weapons atm and they are pretty good. I would stick to armor atm if i were you.</div></div><hr />

Should be able to get both of those for around 12k total tops( based off low prices on karana)<br />
Would be a major AC and HP boost for the 10k range</div></div><hr />

<br />
the hands definitely got to go, so your gonna need either a back haste item or a belt item. probably a rbg is cheapest. theres some decent BP and boot drops out of ldon too. architects bejewelled breastplate and the steelskin boots, not sure if they are level restricted though.<br />
<br />
for neck pick up a clattering bone necklace, the hps and sta is good on that.</div></div><hr />
