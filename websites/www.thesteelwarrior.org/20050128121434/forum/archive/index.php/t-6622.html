<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kharse</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all-having a blast so far playing Kharse and gettimg my A** kicked again and again as my group manages to zone without a scratch... I'm sure it will get better after I hit 20 right?<br />
<br />
Anyway right now I'm using a 13/24 main and 9/19 offhand. (Or am I doing that backwards?) I really don't have any interest in using bunt or piercing (although I know they have better ratios etc) but I do want to start using 2hs. I have a 17/30 2hs to train with,but have been told at 20 I should get a bigger weapon.<br />
<br />
What delay is acceptable? (these days- when I was playing before the Mith 2hnder was the uber weapon). Is 30 -35 what Im looking for? Will something with a 40 delay be OK? 45? 50? I've seen a 40/40 (non magic) sword for 2k a couple of times and might be able to sell some some stuff to get one.<br />
<br />
Is this a good idea or is it OK to pick up a 50 or 60 delay weapon if the ratio's good? Or should I stay with the best dmg I can with a 30 or so delay?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any and all assistance  (and flames of ourse) you can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">04-10-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.....I would say for raising skills/training get a faster weapon (30-35 delay). As to not being concerned about blunt or piercing weapon... lemme just give you a scenario. You're at lvl 60 and this UBER weapon drops in a raid and it is awarded to you. It happens to be a 2HB...and your skill at 2HB is 6... and you will not be a happy warrior anymore. I would attempt to find fast reasonably priced weapons to keep them all capped (borrow them if you need to)... that way no matter what uber weapon drops you are prepared to wield it with mastery.<br />

<br />
The Reaver, from Kael Drakkel, is now tagged as magic. This change is over six months old.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it will get better after I hit 20 right?&quot;<br />
<br />
You're not even level 28. Which means ratio is all that matters for your weapons. At level 28 you get a damage bonus. Then delay becomes a small issue. HOWEVER, keep in mind that faster = better doesn't REALLY begin to matter until your damage bonus actually becomes substantial. This is usually in the 51 to 65 range of levels.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider about 2handers: Their damage bonus sucks ass until level 55 or so. Which means dual wielding, with the really good weaponry that's available today, remains probably the most viable DPS option for dual wield classes until level 55+<br />
<br />
That being said ... a Reaver would work just fine for you AT LEVEL 28. Before that, use an Ornate Greatblade or Nathsar Greatsword (the sword you currently have). Because your damage is capped till 20, and your damage bonus doesn't even begin till 28.<br />
<br />
Keep all your skills trained. <br />
<br />
Just remember ... the big hits and fancy crits are nice to look at, but good ole dependable dual wielding remains one of the most effective DPS options for monks/warriors through MOST of their levels.<br />
<br />
This changes at 60, with triple attack, and high damage bonuses, and RAID QUALITY WEAPONS. But you're nowhere near that level of play yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
28 or higher. below 28 the damage bonus on 2h weapons is horrible. at 28 it is ideal and goes up only slowly after that. so 28-30 delay is sort of ideal. two very popular weapons in this catagory are war marshal bladed and ... ummm ... (memory fails me) ..whats that blunt with the stun proc with 30 delay .. the really inexpensive one?<br />
<br />
but you are right .. if you get a weapon with a good ratio even though delay is big its still a good ratio right? most of them are overpriced though because people get kicks out of seeing the big damage numbers even if they are slow as molasses.<br />
<br />
you dont really need to keep all 5 skills maxed but  i do recommend at least putting SOME substantial work into most skills. the more trainer points you save the more you can allow a skill to lag. if you pick up a 1hb at level 65 and have a skill of 137 (like me which i mention in another post) and no trainer points to spend you will still get it maxed in a few days and NOBODY will even notice (sigh) because our dps is so pathetic anyway. i think they WOULD notice if your skill were at 6 though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the original poster isn't even level 20 yet, so has no damage bonus at all.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
BUT ... even if the person was level 65 ... keep this in mind:<br />
<br />
Fiery Staff of Zha is one of the highest damaging weapons in the game prior to plane of time. And it has a delay less than 28.<br />
<br />
And for warriors ... Ornate Greatblade is no slouch on the DPS either. It's delay is 23.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Max all yer skills, yer never know.  And catching up between 40 and 50 is a snap.  Being caught up by then is pretty easy, too.<br />
<br />
How many warriors were caught by surprise when the first GoT's fell and their 2HB was ... 4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;&lt;And for warriors ... Ornate Greatblade is no slouch on the DPS either. It's delay is 23.&gt;&gt;<br />
actually its a 35/23 with a damage bonus of 14 at level 65. war marshal is 31/28 with a damage bonus of 35. im not convinced the ornate is better dps. and we are comparing a rare no drop weapon to a common and cheap bazaar item.<br />
<br />
damage bonus at 65 for a delay 28 weapon is 35. damage bonus for a delay 27 weapon is 14. so i stand by my claim that for 2h dps you practically always want a delay of at least 28.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there are so many cheap 1hb &amp; 2hbs &amp; piercing weapons out there that are quite usable from 20-40 (ish) that I'd advise you to look into them eventually. Can't remember whether the weighty polearm ( 2hs, 29/34, AC +15, Agi +15, Fire +10, Hp 35) has a recommended level on it or not, but it's not bad and it is quite cheap.<br />
I'd put the fast weapon in your main hand, but if you're having no trouble with agro you might not have to worry about it.<br />
Ah, back in the day I kept up my 2hb with a Sarnak Battle Hammer (30/40, warrior only, I think) once I turned lvl 20. I'd look for a faster 2hb nowadays. Used to be able to hold aggro with SBH surprisingly well, though. Might be harder now that everyone else is using better weapons at an earlier level...but then, I didn't have the provoke line either.<br />
In a few levels you could get a free 1hb that's very close to your current mainhand: Goranga spiked club, 12/23, AC +5, STR +2 to practice with. It's mainhand only, no-drop and comes off mobs in Maiden's Eye right outside of the zone-in from Overthere. You can't kill the mobs that drop it yourself, but as I said, the club is no-drop and the people who hunt in ME have better weapons than that. Zone in, stay near zone line, and ask politely if anyone who is letting one rot will let you know. You can do this as soon as you can run through OT, but don't let anything in ME hit you, heh.<br />
At the moment, the Great Staff of Thunder and the Copper Hammer of Striking are pretty good arguments that you're going to eventually wish you'd practiced 2hb and 1hb. My main point here is that until you approach a DEX of 200, your proc rate on most weapons (if they proc at all for you as a low-level) will be too low for procs to be much of an aid in aggro. Weapon ratio &amp; speed are important. For almost no extra pp you could be using practice weapons in these areas that are about as good as what you're using now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a Reaver and also before i got that I used a Blackend Alloy 2HS is very light and did good DMG and was fast enough to get and keep my skill up. <br />
<br />
Take a look at my magelo for the toys I use some are level restricted some are not. If doing 2HB the Hate Staff was my primary weapon of choice in lower levels for DMG and because of DMG I kept aggro till I got the cookie cutter choice I have now with the CHoS and SoBS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;im not convinced the ornate is better dps.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am. It parses better.<br />
<br />
&quot;and we are comparing a rare no drop weapon to a common and cheap bazaar item.&quot;<br />
<br />
First of all ... the discussion became ludicrous the moment we started talking about damage bonus. Why? Because the person inquiring about this stuff ... DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A DAMAGE BONUS! He's NOT EVEN LEVEL 20 YET!<br />
<br />
But, to keep this train chugging along to its new destination ... We're comparing a very COMMONLY dropped no drop weapon to a cheap bazaar weapon. Ornate Greatblade drops a hell of a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;damage bonus at 65 for a delay 28 weapon is 35. damage bonus for a delay 27 weapon is 14. so i stand by my claim that for 2h dps you practically always want a delay of at least 28.&quot;<br />
<br />
Parse them and find out.<br />
<br />
Monks have more experience with this than warriors so I can understand the reluctance. But here's what monks look at:<br />
<br />
Mithril Shod Staff parses out close to Rune Etched Bamboo Bo. And MSS has a very low delay.<br />
<br />
Fiery Staff of Zha is the highest DPS a monk can get prior to plane of time. And it's delay is below 28.<br />
<br />
Even the Ironbound Quarterstaff (a tradable weapon) has a lower than 28 delay, but such a good ratio that it stacks up great against weapons in its &quot;tier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damage bonus is highly over-rated. It took monks over a year to let go of this long-standing myth. But Zha's pretty much broke those camels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage bonus is a funky sort of thing. Its biggest application is against the stupid high ac mobs common in Luclin: The higher the AC of a mob, the more valuable the damage bonus. Please tell me you remember fighting mobs like the Va'Dyn and getting huge strings of minimum hits. Also, the higher your attack, the more likely you are to hit along the upper parts of the weapon's potential damage roll. The lower your vengeance/buffage, and the higher the mob's AC, the more useful higher delay weapons are. The break point appears to be around 1250 atk on most POP/LDoN era mobs for low delay weapons, or so other SKs tell me: We don't hit this point without a fair bit of buffage. Break point on mobs on Luclin are -much- higher, and sooner or later, I'll bet we wind up choking on a Super-Va'Dyn in GoD. <br />
<br />
The big two hander revolution was late in Velious, then hammered into us with Luclin's enormous AC suckfests. Is it any wonder we advocate assured DPS, over potentially highly fluctuating weapons? Low delay weapons can have very high outputs, I agree. Most situations, the Ornate can, will, and should trash a WMBS. Just stay off the damn moon with it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I remember those days. Heh.<br />
<br />
&quot;The big two hander revolution was late in Velious, then hammered into us with Luclin's enormous AC suckfests. &quot;<br />
<br />
Very true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess If I'm going to try to make a point, I shouldn't dance around it: The better the rest of your gear, the less valuable damage bonus is for its own sake. By the time most warriors are capable of getting an Ornate Greatblade, it should work well for them. Your vengeance 'stacks the deck' for you. If you don't have any, you better start stacking the deck in other ways, primarily through damage bonus. <br />
<br />
Oh, and go go Reaver. Ugliest sword in the game. I miss watching our rogues pp it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it sucks if you get a nice weapon later on and you don't have the skill maxed.  No, it doesn't take THAT long to get the skill up at that point.  <br />
<br />
The sum total of all the time taken to get from 0 to 250 is way less at 65 than it would be coming up through.  So, the choice is to geek out and keep one of every time in your backpacks all the way thru and try to keep things current or to bite the bullet when you finally to get the nice drop and spend a couple of nights gimped out raising your skill.  <br />
<br />
Up to you really.  <br />
