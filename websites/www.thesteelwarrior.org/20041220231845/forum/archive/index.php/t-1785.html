<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Through the process of discovering hidden lore and dungeons in norrath, ancient documents have been found, containing the timeless knowledge from Masters long time forgotten.<br />
<br />
Any who may set hands on these documents, and find the courage to read their content, would suddenly be found with immense power, being the new masters of Ancient Skills.<br />
<br />
But beware, for the races of Norrath are no  longer as resistant as before. The incessant increase of weaponry power has dimished the combatant's own power.<br />
Much force is needed to channel these new skills, use them wisely... at your risk and peril.<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<br />
Scrolls scattered through norrath, as spells would be.<br />
Certain pretty common and easy to obtain,<br />
other extremely rare, and only the high end fighting would yield such pieces.<br />
<br />
<br />
What to do with such scrolls? head to your guildmaster, and give it to him.<br />
Congratulations, you now have one more skill added to your training list.<br />
<br />
Of course, you won't have to put any points into such a skill to use it. Being level 65 with no more skill points to spend would suck then ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Some skills may be a bit powerfull if the resuse condition was only Time. And it would suck to have to wait 50 minutes to reuse it, only because a shorter reuse would be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
So here's the idea.<br />
Certain Skills would cost you something... but not raw stamina... or hp...<br />
but..<br />
Stats. Sort of like Rez Effects.<br />
<br />
When you use a certain skill, a certain stat or two will be diminished, and gently regain full efficiency.<br />
<br />
Which is only normal.<br />
Using all your force to deliver an Earthquake or something, will logically have your Strength reduced.<br />
<br />
Having say 200 sta cost on a very nice skill would make you have to choose between risking such a loss for the gain the skill would give.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do these skills do?...<br />
Thats where the fun begins, coming up with a few ideas ;)<br />
<br />
Here's an example.. something i thought up for monks.<br />
<br />
Blur:<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Suddenly acquiring unnatural speed, the monks motions are blurred. You can no longer tell if it is one person or three attacking.<br />
<br />
The monk is duplicated into 3 for a short period of time.<br />
In other words, the monk creates 2 pets that are his exact replicate, doing the same damage he would.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine the monk fighting deep in one of the new Dungeons of Norrath, and suddenly finding such a scroll.<br />
Going mad of joy, anticipating the end of the event, to be TLed back to his guildmaster, and finally acquire a skill he's been longing for!<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
For Warriors: (a couple ideas)<br />
----<br />
<br />
Tremor:::<br />
<br />
Pounding the floor with furious might, you create a ondulation in the floor around you, causing nearby foes to be swiped off their feet.<br />
<br />
Effect: aoe Feign Death with stun.<br />
Cost: 100 Str<br />
<br />
Basically, this would just be a aoe stun, helps to gain aggro, and also give time to the enchanter or slower.<br />
The Feign Death part is just a little bonus... having fun seeing the adds around suddenly fall to the floor and a second later, get back up :p<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Blow to the Head:::<br />
<br />
A precise hit on a foes head making him forget all recent happenings.<br />
<br />
1hb must be equipped in primary.<br />
<br />
Effect: single target Mem Blur<br />
Cost: 50 str<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Acrobatics:::<br />
<br />
The Warrior may become extremely agile in avoiding others.<br />
<br />
Effect: The warrior will no longer have a collision check with other players and npcs. Allowing them to walk right through them.<br />
Cost: 100 Dex<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Reachout:::<br />
<br />
The Warrior has mastered the art of prolonging his attacks.<br />
<br />
Effect: Warrior's range of attack is doubled, including the range of Taunt and Kick.<br />
Cost: 100 Agi<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Warlord's Call:::<br />
<br />
The Warrior's encouraging call sends a chill down all his compagnon's spine.<br />
<br />
Effect: Group haste 25%, stackable with all other haste, exceeds haste cap.<br />
Duration: 2minutes<br />
Cost: 100 stamina<br />
--------<br />
<br />
<br />
The exact speed of Stat recovery can be discussed. Like 5 a tick.<br />
<br />
Giving certain skills a minimal time limit is also possible, considering the effects...<br />
like certain spells have a refresh time.<br />
<br />
<br />
All these skills would be like the old times.<br />
Meaning it's either innate, and trained at the guildmaster.<br />
Or it's a trigger skill, and you get to choose from them by right clicking the skill boxes.<br />
Like kick, taunt and disarm.<br />
<br />
So far I only gave ideas of triggered skills, and not innate ones :p<br />
Because innate ones can easily be unbalancing, and need to be thought up more carefully ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blow to the Head<br />
<br />
yeah change that name thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caeden</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it, some of them are a little out there, but its different, I like it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how some of them are a bit &quot;out there&quot; though :p<br />
<br />
Norrath is populated with tons of people that can make ice comets fall from the sky, turn you into wolves, wake your corpse, summon armor out of thin air....<br />
but it would be &quot;out there&quot; to have masters of combat do more then kick? :p<br />
<br />
<br />
And Dobbo, names are not suppose to be taken into consideration. I am not going to spend 1 hour trying to come up with a name, i throw in the first thing on my mind. <br />
On these boards it's the ideas that are needed, and it's the ideas that should be discussed.<br />
If you want to discuss the naming of skills, find yourself another thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does that mean my hair would stand up? 'Cause you all know that would look rad...<br />
<br />
Admit it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does that mean my hair would stand up? 'Cause you all know that would look rad... <br />

<br />
1hb must be equipped in primary.<br />
<br />
Effect: single target Mem Blur<br />
Cost: 50 str<br />
<br />
Why would we want to mem blur a mob wouldnt that just wipe the hate list and make us start over? not picking just asking.<br />
Otherwise neat ideas. instead of resuse times, were talking about stat refresh time, use em til your STA is at zero or below use cost and wait for them to refill, who would want thier AGI at zero big AC ouch! <br />
Could work theres balance in them thar ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an idea among others,<br />
what it would be used for would be figured by the warriors themselves.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd just use it on inc in an exp group.<br />
Have everyone tash, slow, dot etc.. everything you can do on the mob while inc.<br />
When he's in, wham, Blow to the head and pick him up as if nothing was done to it.</div></div><hr />
