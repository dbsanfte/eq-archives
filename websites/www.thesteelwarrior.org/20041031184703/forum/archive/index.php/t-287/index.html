<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SOLB window. or LGUK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might be able to find a group up in DS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ahnaksunamun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Then again, depending on gear, ya might be able to solo in DSP  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lguk was always my favorite place to level, and there were drops that were actually upgrades for me. Solb is good also, but im not sure how well you will do at 33 in SolB. You could do Cougers in Iceclad, they will be blue until ~39. Eastern Wastes, Dawnshroud would also work. Most of the populated kunark zones are boring and there is nothing interesting ever going on there. Nurga and Droga were always fun though. Dalnirs was also very fun, and barely anyone ever in the zone latly. You have so many choices for exp in your 30s, you could even do HHK if you wanted to. Just have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SOLB window is fine beard don't mess with me i know where you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">your gonna have your ass handed to you at sol B window camp (that's the kobolds on the first right in naggy's lair, right?).<br />
<br />
your a warrior...go find a group, learn to be social, live with it, love it.<br />
<br />
if you want to solo go play a different class that can, SK, Shaman, Necro, Druid, etc...<br />
<br />
not trying to be rude, it just came out that way...<br />
<br />
if you want to solo, your experience will be better playing a class designed for it rather then one that is aimed at being dependant upon groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">can the starter of the thread link the magelo. then we could see whats more possible and stuff. I'm guessing klua is correct. first time i tried was 39 and was succesful but that was when my gear was crafted stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frawdo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Marus Seru til 34-35, then DSP shrooms (near the Santus Seru zoneline) til 39.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can do zels in DSP post 35, too, but the wolves are a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />
