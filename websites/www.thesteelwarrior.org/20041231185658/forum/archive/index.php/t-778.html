<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We ran around North last night as fast as we posibly could, taking out Iki, Eashen, Aaryonar, Flurry's, Fesh, Dagarn, Lady Mirenilla, Lord Koi'Doken, Lord Kreizenn all before the patch.  We then sat and stared at Lord Vyemm for the 100,000th time and decided to try to build a strat for this guy.  We spent about an hour running around his lair trying to find a safe spot for clerics but couldnt find a thing.  Read about a ledge on Northwest corner, still nothing...everything was in his AE.  Anyone care to share their experience with this encounter?  Im so tired of passing hm up every time we venture through north.  Lady Nev is no prob for us, and most say Vyemm is easier than her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we do him is... have Vyemm agro'd by a ranger with snare or something and have him face the back of the lair or the ledge. Run everybody in to the ledge or back of the lair. Setup a BLAST heal chain on the MT. Just have at it. I'm pretty sure he can be slowed or at least disease slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes he is disease slowable...that i am sure of.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah... not annoying.  Just fun :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We always have a bard in our MT group along with 1-2 other tanks. It's just a good idea in general :). DS and resists are always nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best part about having a bard in your group as MT is you can go third person and watch all the other people doing their pinball impression.   Flying bears are something that defies explanation.  They need to be seen first hand.<br />
<br />
As for real advice, im sure you have read this before but NEVER get vyemms head facing towards the lava or even the entrance wall to lair.  He can still call glass off the front wall and land you in the lava.  Shot counts.  Arrange your force in an arc furthest away from any possibility of vyemm launching you in the drink and hes cake.</div></div><hr />

MT simply keeps him facing wall, everyone (READ everyone) attacks from the front so you only get blownback into the wall.<br />
<br />
Almost guaranteed, someone will go for a lava swim so just have yer mages ready to CoH.<br />
<br />
The biggest PITA is the 'whurl till you hurl' IMO...i just found it annoying<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karthunk</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a poster said just have someone snare him a few time to keep aggression on him. After that happens you can run people anywhere in his room and he will not attack them, unless it's the person who snared him. Just keep in mind that aggression does decay over time, so it would be best that the ranger/druid refresh the cast every once in a while.<br />
<br />
I would turn him so he would be facing the very back wall when I MT'd him. We would setup all the healers along the back wall. All the nukers and melee would stay on his side, NEVER let ayone get behind him if you face him towards the back wall. As someone already said just blast heal, do not try a CH chain. He should not take longer then 2 - 3 mins to kill so mana should not really be a problem even with chain heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bractos</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild did him for the first time last night.  Is a very fun fight,  vyemm hits for 1200 post defensive so you will burn a lot of mana trying to keep a MT alive if you do not do a tank rotation.  Grummus slow does land and is helpful,  but he still hits and reposts enough to burn your mana out if you are a guild that actually is in Ntov to get the upgrades and dont have the DPS to put him down too quickly.<br />
<br />
Rotating tanks is easy enough on him as his knockback gives you a nice window of opportunity to do so,  just call the switch after an AE and your gtg.   Just make sure to call out a warning to the healers when the MT is at the 30 second mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
A bard Playing AE magic resist will definitely help out and give you some resists to the KB so that you can keep pouring on the DPS.  The only problem we had was having our healers get stacked up in the back after a KB and be stuck and out of heal range,  but we had every offhealer assisting to keep the MT alive with quick heals so we were able to not have any slip ups.<br />
<br />
Took us about 9 min with 34 people  and 2 flawless tank switches.   This is an extremely good training fight for getting your guild used to doing tank switches and handling mobs with Knockback attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorus</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took him down on our 1st attempt a couple nights ago, We tried 2 clerics CHing me and 2 others throwing supernal remedies.  Worked pretty well for about 80% of the fight.  Though every once in a while I'd take an unexpected quad when I was low on health and DI would save my ass....4 times total.  It was pretty stressfull considering I was also boxing those 2 CH clerics =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most important thing to note,DO NOT position people where walls intersect into corners.If the people hanging out in an area like this get KBed they will all funnel into the corner and stack on each other...<br />
<br />
Ever zoned into pok from the nexus and found yourself stuck amongst 5 people who afked while zoning? Same thing .<br />
<br />
When those people stacked and stuck happen to be your healing team your fucked.<br />
<br />
When you stand up top of his lair with the ramp slighty to your right you want to have yourself straight across on the opposite wall,You want your Melee to be down below you right to the left of where the ramp opens up into his lair.And your Healers/nukers of to the left of the melee along Vyemms side.<br />
<br />
When He KB's you,and he will he will turn immediately to the melee,since they are directly to the left of the ramp opening,they will just hi the wall their backs are against when KBed,your casters are still alongside Vyemm and as such are not being hit by the KB.If you are lucky he will have summoned you back to him just as you land from the KB,Take a couple steps backwards to turn him bout face away from the melee and continue tanking....<br />
<br />
If you can,Tank switch.Even with the slow he can put out some decent DPS on you,and if casters get caught in the AE you may go a little longer without a heal than you would normally like=P Defensive is a bonus in a fight like Vyemm....<br />
<br />
Cross your fingers for Gaudralek,It is a fantastic aggro weapon,I love mine..</div></div><hr />
