<br />
But hey. There was a Hudson Bay Co. mapmaker in the 1800s named David Thompson who did a lot of exploring/map making in the Northwest Territories. On one trip he started out with a bunch of French Canadian fur trapper types very early in the spring to cross the northern Rockies. Every day they're slogging through snow, carrying these huge packs, etc. Thompson starts noticing with alarm that the guys are eating several times the amount of food that he planned on them eating. And they won't break camp until they finish eating. He runs some numbers and realizes that each guy is eating about 7 pounds of meat per day. Presumably, salted or jerked meat.<br />
Thompson knows that at this rate they'll run out of food about the time they get as far out in the wilderness as they're going to get--weeks away from anywhere they could re-provision themselves. So he talks to the head French Canadian, asking if they couldn't start eating less food.<br />
The French Canadian looks at him and basically says, &quot;We're doing damn hard work all day long in the snow, we're out in the middle of nowhere, we could be killed by accidents, illness or Indians at any time, and we're not getting laid. Eating is our only pleasure. No way in hell are we going to stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
They ate their horses before the trip was over.</div></div><hr />

Try a double steak and asked for the onions to be chopped before hand, add chepolee and horse radish sauce for taste.... damn thats good.<br />
<br />
Just a warning, our salads are changing to be a bit smaller and to no longer use iceberge, also we are dumping sliced nuts and horse radish sauce, as well as red wine vinigret.</div></div><hr />

Lemme splain something to you.<br />
<br />
Quizno's Toasted Sub = Toasted Sub.<br />
<br />
Subway Toasted Sub = Sub on dry bread.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No its toasted all right :P<br />
<br />
its 1000 element (500 degree chamber) toasting plus a microwave to cook the meat... lets just say getting close to pure water in there will result in an bang that'll throw the door open if you attempt to put something overly wet in there..<br />
<br />
hell they make you take a test before you are allowed to use the darn thing 0.o<br />

Red wine vinegarette sucks... glad we are getting rid of it but my horse radish? you corporate whores at the corporate branch can kiss my ass! *rant*</div></div><hr />
