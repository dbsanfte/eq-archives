Please go through this list and prioritize it in order for how you feel these issues are most important.  If you would also note whether the issue if something already in the game for your class that you feel needs to be altered or if it is a &quot;wish list&quot; type thing that you would like to see added for your class.  We are turning in top 5 lists on Friday so do this as soon as you can please.<br />

From what it looks like, the developers are actually reading the new eq forums pretty regularly, stop by that thread and toss in your personal prioritization for enhancements/features you want to see added/updated for the warrior class!<br />
<br />
This thread is probably going to be locked tonight, so stop by there TODAY and post what you want as your list.</div></div><hr />
