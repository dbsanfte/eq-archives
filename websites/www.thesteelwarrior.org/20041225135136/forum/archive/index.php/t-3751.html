<br />
<br />
Guess What?<br />
<br />
<br />
I think a Dev plays a beastlord because they are so powerful, and I think a Dev plays a knight also, that's why there's so many knight weapons, and I think the Devs play casters because the casters are incredibly powerful, and I think to balance out the game, we should have some Devs play warriors and monks and that would balance things out.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Scott Hartsman is really good with spells and casters. His caster &quot;rebalancing&quot; crusade over the past two years has been damn effective.<br />

Name me one person on the dev team that plays a warrior or a monk nowadays.<br />

<br />
Before the knight upgrade I was in COM helping a guildee kill the reavers. I forgot something and told a paly to kill me, so we dueled. I sat down and let him kill me. at 10% I decided to stand up and fight back think i would get in a few good hits before I died. I ended up getting him to like 20%, the paly then LoH'd himself and i still got him down to about 10% before he killed me. we where both inthe same guild and had the same caliber equipment. knights sucked hard before the change.<br />

ok now ill go read the link</div></div><hr />

And that is 2hs weapon dps. <br />
Supposedly it helps warriors as much as it does the knights.<br />
<br />
Except one small fact, <br />
<br />
we were supposed to dual-wield to gain dps - no longer viable.<br />
between gimp ratios, gimp damage, and riposting yourself to death...<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the only difference between a warrior and a paladin is..<br />
<br />
Offense  -- 252 vs 225  11% difference<br />
2hs         -- 250 vs 225   9% difference<br />
<br />
Oh, and the weapons, of which 99% of warrior usable 2hs are also knight usable, And the plethora of knight only 2hs weapons, which are all better than the warrior usable one...<br />
<br />
Is there a zone in the game that DOESNT drop a knight only weapon?</div></div><hr />

However, then as now they were not a class Warriors could dual. A 52 Pally can still hand a 52 Warrior his head. It's their &quot;terrible&quot; DPS, &quot;useless&quot; utility spells, and &quot;inferior&quot; HP's (10ish Superior Heals + LoH) that lull a Warrior into overconfidence.<br />
<br />
(At 52, dualing my son's 52 SK used to be entertaining. Pally 6  SK 0).<br />

<br />
Well thats not strictly accurate.<br />
<br />
Between original EQ and early Velious, warriors had a 10-15% hp advantage over paladins.<br />
<br />
Its now closer to 2-5% at the end game.<br />
<br />
While adjusting this gap is not the only thing that needs to be done, pretending the gap hasnt shrnk a  LOT is just not honest.  Its about 200-700 hp now.. it should be closer to 2500.</div></div><hr />

I wonder why Melee items (War,Monk,Rogue) have the same stats.  I wonder why there are Druid, Monk, Beast items with Vengence and Druzil's Distance.  What gives?  To many single class specific items are evil but making ALL/ALL with crazy stats and effects that don't make sense on a good chunk of the classes is just as bad.<br />
<br />
I still wonder: Why 2500 HP?  That level of extra HP won't result in much new mitigation.  Making Warriors more of a tank than they are now won't fix Warriors.  In fact I see more HP as detrimental.  Heals are fixed but HP still expands.  Druids are starting to lament that their big heal seems to be &quot;not enough&quot; on 10K Warriors (Shaman and Paladin heals are jokes).  Whether this is perception or not its still bothersome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
youre looking at it the wrong way.  we already had a HP advantage of this magnitude.  it was taken away.  the question you should be asking is &quot;Why was it taken away?&quot;<br />
<br />
Like I said, it wont fix the problem completely.  But its necessary, so that the equation:<br />
<br />
War hp/ac + war agro = knight hp/ac + knight agro<br />
<br />
will be balanced again.  It was once.  The knights cry when you even mention those days, but hell, I like hearin it anyway... Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OlavSkulcrusher</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find this interesting also:<br />
<br />
Over all we are trying to make sure that the melee abilities of all classes are in line with our intent for them.<br />
<br />
Obviously yours is not the only response we've had to these changes from players that have warriors as their primary characters. So let me try to address those concerns.<br />
<br />
After all of these changes, hybrids will not be able to deal out the damage of a pure melee class, with the possible exception of rangers, who might be able to get close. The warrior, monk and rogue will still out damage hybrids, and by a noticeable margin. That difference is in part what hybrids lose for the power of their spells.<br />
<br />
Also, warriors will always have the broadest selection of weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Warriors will still have a significantly larger amount of hit points.<br />
<br />
Their role as primary tank will not be endangered.<br />
<br />
Taunt has come up a lot with players in regard to this. It is not the warrior's job to control all the aggro of the group. It is the group's job to control the aggro of the group. I'm certainly misunderstanding what I'm reading, but I get the impression from the comments that have come in on this issue that warriors want to be able to ensure that the NPC(s) in question never decide to attack anyone but the warrior. Obviously that would make for a silly and boring combat.<br />
<br />
We'll watch these changes play out on Test. We'll see how things go. But right now we have no intention of changing the way that aggro and taunt work now. Think about what we've changed... we've given a few classes the ability to do more damage, but none of them have surpassed any of the existing damage dealing abilities of other classes. Aggro management may be a little more complicated after these changes, but it shouldn't be any more or less possible than before.<br />

Oh, how the times have changed...<br />
<br />
I shall reiterate:<br />
<br />
Warriors hold agro because everyone else allows them to hold agro.<br />
Knights hold agro because they don't allow anyone to take it from them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Yes, I know this is an old quote...it just surprises me that they took that stance, then ever since have taken actions that completely negate it for everyone BUT the warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the greatest respect for Shikarii and his efforts to maintain the Aggro Weapon Compendium, over 1/3rd of the weapons on the list are not appropriate to level 65's in the Planes or beyond.<br />
<br />
Warriors must use aggro weapons to MA at level 65. Since our aggro capabilities are significantly lower than Knights, we augment aggro Weapons with Anger or YKesha. We don't try to transform an Ornate Greatblade [why Boil Blood and not Planar Strike /bonk developer] into a BoW by slapping an Anger III proc on it (not that I'm not sorely tempted).<br />
<br />
Warriors do have a broad selection of DPS weapons, but since we are not a big-time DPS class it's not a big deal.<br />
<br />
However with regard to the weapons we must own to perform the function of MAing, aggro weapons, our selection is the narrowest of any melee class.<br />
<br />
We all know 1Hdrs produce lower DPS (and DPS contributes to aggro) and they subject us to taking more reposte damage. Given that we greatly prefer 2Hdrs, how many 2H aggro weapons worthy of being weilded by a 65 Planar warrior are there? 5?<br />
<br />
Broadest selection - hahahahahahahahahaha!<br />
<br />

<br />
Okay if this is true then I'm changing my position as far as what warriors need for balance.  If we're not going to be able to manage aggro like a knight then we need about a 2000-3000 HP advantage fully buffed compared to a fully buffed knight to allow for the slower to wait til the mob is at 80% or so before casting.  We also need our DPS boosted to more or less match SK damage including spells.<br />
<br />
I get the impression from the comments that have come in on this issue that warriors want to be able to ensure that the NPC(s) in question never decide to attack anyone but the warrior. Obviously that would make for a silly and boring combat.<br />
<br />
This makes no sense at all.  If it's fine for knights to be able to tank as well as us and lock aggro at will then how would giving warriors that same ability be any different?  If you're just talking raid content then just make raid caliber mobs immune to it.  Aggro on raids is pretty trivial already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if theyre not going to upgrade taunt, we need a 10k hp advantage and an AC advantage of at least 1k.<br />
<br />
This would reflect the difference in agro generation between knights and warriors more accurately, but warriors would still have issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, i wonder why they have worse stats. Look around at the caster gear, or hybrid only gear. See the level of difficulty to aquire, see the stat differences between the classes,</div></div><hr />
