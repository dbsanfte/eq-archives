<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy, Y'all,<br />
<br />
I could use some input on which of my slots to upgrade next. I'm 8 normal LDON wins away from buying my first piece of the 760 point Miragul's armor (Malevolent xxx of Suffering), and I am wondering what y'all think I should spend it on. Like most people, I have been chugging along under the assumption that I'd buy the breastplate first, but after playing around a bit with my magelo, I'm not entirely convinced that the chest slot should be the first item I upgrade.<br />
<br />
Here is a comparison of the three slots I'm waffling over.<br />
<br />
Current Chest<br />
Fine Heraldic BP: AC51; HP40; STA5; type 7 slot<br />
LDoN Chest<br />
Malevolent BP of Suffering: AC63; HP75; STR10; DEX9; FR/PR/DR9; type 1, type 2, type 3 slots<br />
<br />
Current Head<br />
Death Embracer's Helmet: AC22; HP20; DEX5; FR4; DR3; type 1, type 1, type 7 slots<br />
LDoN Head<br />
Malevolent Helm of Suffering: AC35; HP60; STA3; DEX4; STR5; MR/FR/DR5; type 1, type 2, type 3 slots<br />
<br />
Current Arms<br />
Champion's Vambraces: AC24; HP25; DEX5; STR4; CR2; type 7 slot<br />
LDoN Arms<br />
Malevolent Vambraces of Suffering: AC31; HP65; STA5; DEX5; CHA5; CR/PR/DR5; type 1, type 2, type 3 slots<br />
<br />
Other consideratons: <br />
1) I've considered Ornate for the arm upgrade, but on my server, the ornate vambraces mold sells for 40kpp, when it's available. I don't have 40k, and can't imagine accumulating that much coin in the near future.<br />
2) I don't even have the 1492 Tak in my dream profile because life is too short for me to spend that much time in those dungeons.<br />
3) I belong to a tiny family guild that raids effectively, but that has reached the point of needing alliances to accomplish anything really challenging. I therefore don't consider raiding a viable upgrade route for equipment. (darn it)<br />
<br />
So, with all that info as input -- which slot would you upgrade first? Would you buy two items and wait for those lovely type 2 augments?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the thought and input.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks like the helm would be the best straight upgrade. More ac, more sta, more hp than any of the other choices. Also, the helm can take a 36% haste augment, allowing you to upgrade your gloves in the future. <br />
<br />
  As for 2 pieces of armor vs 1 piece of fully augmented armor... It's kind of a toss up. I prefer super armors that are basically not replacable. If you don't think it's very likely at all for you to upgrade, however, just consider your gain vs points spent. Take it to a formula; that is, I'd say 1ac = 1 sta = 6hp = 1 upgrade point until sta capped, then I would consider the LDoN points spent for each upgrade point with the various armors vs that spent per augment. You'll probably find that more armor is better than the augments.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of the 3 Malevolent pieces I've gotten (Helm, boots, and recently gaunts) I got the Helm first simply because it was the biggest upgrade i could get from those slots i needed most.<br />
<br />
Plus, those 3 slots I don't have access to the zone where they drop (Sol Ro), and I simply can't afford to buy them in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I personally have been avoiding the cha/int/wis/mana heavy gear as much as i can (thus getting these particular pieces), but I'm also saving for a Takish bracer.<br />
<br />
Still gotta bust my ass for augs though. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korgo</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'd go for the chest.<br />
<br />
BP's w. High AC and hp are hard to come by.  Would I buy 2 armor pieces and skip the augs?<br />
<br />
No way.<br />
<br />
Buy one piece and max it (with at least a 40hp aug) then move on.<br />
<br />
Why get a pile of mediocre pieces that you will continually need upgrade for?  The best option is to get one irreplaceable slot, then work on the next  and etc etc other wise...well, who wants to be only medium good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick update:<br />
<br />
I unexpectedly picked up a Chestplate of Vindication this weekend (Die, Vindi, Die!), so I'm more convinced than ever to upgrade the head slot first. I also intend to max it with augs before moving on the next piece.<br />
<br />
As Mokor pointed out, it'll be interesting to see what OoW adds.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
