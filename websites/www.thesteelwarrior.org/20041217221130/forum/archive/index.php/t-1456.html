Well, to each his own, but that still is wierd as hell.  I just have one question though..... Why....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raychael</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do I have them? From doing alot of martial arts and I love my tats I want alot more. Tattoos I can consider art, but like I said my piercings are just for looks not for life :D That spliting your tongue crap though is explicitly for attention. My tats say something about who I am and where I come from.........</div></div><hr />

<br />
tattoo's...they're okay. i got enough of them and i kinda like 'em.<br />
<br />
splitting your tongue like a snake...wtf? .. that is just plain f'ed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My biggest question, didn't anyone read the last paragraph?<br />
<br />
But for believers in modification, a split tongue is merely a start. Split penises, sliced lengthwise in half, are not unheard of among aficionados.<br />
<br />
That gets the big &quot;WTF are you thinking?!! &quot; from me.<br />
I mean, seriously, WTF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking about split tongues there =p<br />
Piercings and tats I have no problem with, unless they go way too far.<br />
And I hadn't read that last part.... how can any guy go through with that.... thats one place I don't let sharp things happen to =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
My piercings are functional and c00t! Plus belly button piercing is for 40 year old women trying to be young........<br />
<br />
O_O did somebody say something about splitting penises?!?! That's just furking 'orrible!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As tatoos became more mainstream the &quot;freaks&quot; went to body piercing to remain freaky.  Now that a lot of piercings don't freak people out anymore so the freaks once again have to get freakier.<br />
<br />
I unfortunately came across a picture of one of those split wiener guys taking a leak and the thought of it makes me want to puke.<br />
<br />
Makes me think of that comic with the guy telling his wife &quot;I did it!  I finished the internet!&quot;.  I guarantee if you have been to every page on the internet you have seen things that would make Marilyn Manson wake up screaming in the middle of the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is just not right.  I've spent my whole life trying to keep sharp objects as far from the wedding tackle as possible at all times.  Anyone who would voluntarily do something like that has some deep personal issues that need to be resolved.  The tongue thing is bad enough; if nature had intended for us to have forked tongues, we'd have them already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I don't understand the appeal of intentionally &quot;modifying&quot; ones body in such ways. Even the simple ear piercing seems so strange to me.<br />
<br />
Then again, I know more than one person who was scared for life via malicious or accidental acts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you need to alter your body for? Tatooes and piercings go in the same boat... After mileneas of evolution you are out to destroy your own bodies...<br />
<br />
Tatoes are gross, piercing gross, tongue spliting is for someone who want to end up with speach empediment and have no taste of food... I have yet to see a tatoe or piercing that made person look anything, but worse. Especially those frolks who got them young and now older wrinkly fat taotoes are just fucked up... But go ahead keep fucking yourselves up. I wont stop ya. <br />
<br />
I say don't give those fuckers free medical thought. They after all did it to themselves. Make them pay for their mistakes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zumbuk_FS</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing wrong with tats in my opinion. I dont have any, but I grab a copy of Tattoo Magazine now and then because some of them are just incredible works of art. If youre talking about someone whos covered with those splotchy india ink tats you get in juvi hall, then yeah... those can be unsightly. <br />
<br />
I saw a simple black and white tat of Clint Eastwood as Josey Whales once and it was just unreal how detailed it was. I think its something that should be taken seriously by the person getting the tat though. Probably why Ive never really gotten one... yet. I just cant settle on what I would want on my body forever. Probably something to do with wolves.<br />
<br />
Piercings... Im not against em, Id personally never get one. I like women with belly button piercings, but thats about it. Any kind of clitoral piercings just &quot;get in my way&quot;. And hey... if you gots the skills, you don need no steenking piercing.</div></div><hr />

Don't see anything wrong with having one though.  Might not find 200 appealing, but one's ok. :)</div></div><hr />

Look at tribal people who still maintain ancient traditions, many some form of tatoo or piercing.<br />
<br />
Personally, I want to lose some weight before I get a tatoo.  I like the idea, and know what I want, just don't want to get it done somewhere, then have it shrink and skew =/<br />
<br />
That being said, I like nipple piercings.  =)  And if people want to stick needles in their skin with ink, or want to poke holes in their skin, rock on!  The nursing homes in 40 or so years are going to be funny as hell =)<br />

<br />
Between that and the ladies (i use that term loosely) that get the tats of miscellaneous squigly marks right above their asses, it's safe to say that tatoos are going to be the mullett of the new millenium.  Only this time you can't shave off that sweet 15&quot; duck tail and forget it ever happened.  You'll have that ink job until the day you drop dead.  <br />
<br />
I'll agree that some skin art is pretty cool, but for the most part the people I see with ink jobs are wannabes.</div></div><hr />
