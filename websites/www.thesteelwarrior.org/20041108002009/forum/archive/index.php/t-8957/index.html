<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meatman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just found the site, and so far I love it.  But, I found that every warrior here seems to adhere to a certain set of unwritten rules on warriors.  I myself blow every one out of the water:<br />
<br />
1.  I have been playing for five and a half years, and I am only level 33.  I really haven't had much time to play until about two months ago, but I keep hearing about people who get to level 65 in under a week.  WTF?  Is the person even having any fun?  And I assume he had extensive outside help, which I strongly disapprove of.  Powerleveling is not fun, for either player, in my humble opinion.<br />
2.  I don't like to use a lot of abbreviations or acronyms when I type.  I get tired of looking up every one I come across, so I just gave up.<br />
3.  I do not use chatroom-style typing.  That means no using numbers in words or in place of words, and other more unmentionable styles.<br />
4.  I don't like Magelo.  I much prefer Allakhazam, as they have ALL of the equiptment.  Magelo is missing some, namely the Copper Band, one of which I have.<br />
<br />
Now, gamewise:<br />
<br />
1.  I am an Iksar.  Not the most earthshaking announcement, but nobody seems to like the lizard.   :( <br />
2.  I use 2-handed piercing weapons.  Few people like either alone, and no one likes both together.  I like my Iceflame.  I wouldn't trade it for anything else, especially when the proc kicks in in two levels.<br />
3.  I have somewhat substandard armor.  While all you people have so much armor you could withstand a bomb blast, I have mostly weaker armor, much of it leather-style.  Then again, I do have scales.   :p <br />
<br />
Any words of wisdom for an old player?<br />
<br />
Note: 'Old' is relative.  I am only 18.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KermeyKhazi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Read thru the Library just about anything u read in there will be words of wisdom for you. Pick up two one handers that have procs.. maybe stun type procs. Not sure what is available to Iksars for armor. Make a magelo so that u can link it for us to give better suggestions on upgrades. Magelo is a great way for us to get an impression of your budget/gear needs. Yes Allakhazam has alot of info but there are some really knowledgeable warriors here who can look at ur magelo and give great info on upgrades</div></div><hr />

No offense man, but your humble opinion is biased by the fact that you only have a level 33.  Trust me, once you've got a 65, or multiple 65's, the LAST thing you want to do, is grind it all over again, seeing the same crap you've already seen.  I know you may not believe it now, but it's the truth.  There was TONS of anti-twinking, anti - powerleveling bitching going on 5 years ago.  The truth is that people were just jealous of people with more playtime.  Now that basically everyone has a high level character, and a decent bank account, the complaining has dropped off almost completely.</div></div><hr />

You're the trailblazer, maybe you should be enlightning all the slack jaws on this board about what we have been doing wrong for the last 5 years.</div></div><hr />

I like to think of myself as Emporer Overlord of Planet Earth.  Reality bites.</div></div><hr />
