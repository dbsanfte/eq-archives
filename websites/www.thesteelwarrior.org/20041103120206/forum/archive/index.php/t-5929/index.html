<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sevius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, at the moment I have a 1h slash, 1h blunt. I was just curious of what a level 15 Warrior should get as a 2h Slash, 2h Blunt, and Piercer.<br />
<br />
For 2h Slash I was thinking maybe that other Bloodsworn sword, or a Widebladed Greatsword. My friend dosn't like the WBGS because you have to be in the mob's face to actually hit with it. As for blunt I have no idea. Lol<br />
<br />
So far I have...<br />
<br />
- Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
- Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
<br />
So as you can see I have a decent enough amount of cash to buy very decent weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Find weapons that are pretty fast and go to town. Jarsath tridents are very cheap and pretty decent (11/22 1hp). A GSoT would probably do just fine for a 2hb, I think it has a reccomended level but no required level. If money is no object, then just find the fastest weapons possible for that type, preferably with dex. Dex will help with weapon skillups. You might want to even get a set of +dex gear if you just want super fast skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">GSoT has required 55 recommended 56</div></div><hr />

So true so true I am dying wanting to swing mine :) for 2hs for training get a Black Acrylia 2hs they are dirt cheap and light and fast for the damage I used one on my tank and my ranger in low levels. <br />
<br />
Black Acrylia 2hs (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13518)</div></div><hr />

the weapons them selves have nothing to do with the melee range of you or mobs.</div></div><hr />

Most weapons you can actually stand behind other people and still hit with it. The Widebladed GS you have to be in the mob's face to not be out of range.<br />
<br />
I'll be looking into those weapons. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the weapons them selves have nothing to do with the melee range of you or mobs. <br />
<br />
  Actually, not true. My friend did a bit of testing on his rogue, and he could actually melee while a pet tanked if he stood JUST the right distance. However, he could only do it with a spear type weapon and not a dagger. I've also noticed that using a 2hs on a mob like RZ, where you want to be at max melee, I'm always standing further away than nearly any of the other melee. It could be coincidence, or there could be substance to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sevius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've noticed it. With my Paladin I have to be pretty close to hit with my WMBS but with my War I can stand like 6 feet back and slash away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i'm not going to dismiss the fact that i could be totally wrong, but i think we need to consider alot more variables. for instance, what races/classes were used, what mob was attacted, how large/small was the mob, what weapons and weapon types, was duel wield used, was the larger weapon used in the primary or secondary hand. as of now it's just observation and speculation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">whitness of hate greatstaff 47 damage 45 delay decent stats. lvl recomended though so stats will suck for a while. at lvl 21 though you should crank out some big hits. about 1/10th the cost of a windblade seen it as low as 2k. http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=45129<br />
<br />
should take care of your 2hb needs for a long time later can stick a dps or agro aug on it and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have my witness of hate greatstaff it does rock for 2hb till i can use my GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">maybe the size of the weapon does have something to do with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Pahtoonya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For twinky weaponry, get the fastest possible delay for each type of weapon and use it to keep skill up.<br />
<br />
As far as actual damage dealing?  With that much $$ I trust you'll be getting powerlevelled anyways, so who cares? ;)  Jade Mace is a nice option for 1hb, 9/18 is pretty speedy and rather cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sevius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nah, not getting powerleveled. Pretty twinked, yeah, powerleveled, nah. I wont learn the character if I get him PLed.<br />
<br />
So far I have...<br />
<br />
- Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
- Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
- Great Sword of the Bloodsworn *Awesome weapon*<br />
<br />
I have a bow but he needs to be 45 to use it. *sigh*<br />
<br />
Now to get a 2h blunt and a piercer.</div></div><hr />

this really got me thinking, so i decided to test it. i (being iksar) went to cabalis and looked for an NPC that wouldnt attack back. the answer came easily enough when i saw the tribute master. i went to the bank and got a wide assortment of weapons. i started out with 2h weapons (GSot4W, nerandia lance, AotKK) i attacked the mob and slowly backed away until i got the &quot;you are too far away&quot; message and noted the spot where i was OOR (rather easy since the ground in cab is tiled). i then inched back into range, stopped attacking, and switched in 2 daggers. now if there was some range benifit from large weapons, then switching from large 2h weapons, to 2 small daggers would mean that i'd be out of range at the 2h range mark. i found out that every weapon i used on that mob brought me to the same point when i backed up to max range.</div></div><hr />
