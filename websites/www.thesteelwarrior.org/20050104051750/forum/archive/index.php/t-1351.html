<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghazad</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a frostbringer for secondary<br />
Get a wavecrasher, a barnacle covered axe or a playermade Yak for primary depending on your budget and preference - either will do the job of keeping agro<br />
<br />
Keep defenders lightblade for DPS and use that in secondary coupled with your other best DPS weapon in primary when you are not MT<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

Get a Greatstaff of Thunder.. my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I would sell the Bloodfire and buy a Frostbringer or a player made Ykesha blade.  These two should be the most affordable aggro weapons you can buy that put out decent DPS.  I had a Frostbringer for many levels and I think it held aggro offhand as well as the epic red blade for me which I replaced it with.<br />
<br />
At lvl 51, I would use Frostbringer/Yakesha in my primary hand and your Defenders Lightblade in secondary.  That should be decent DPS and Aggro for you.<br />
<br />
If you have lots of PP, you may want to look at something like the Great Staff of Thunder as it is good aggro and DPS as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoT is required level 55 so he has a bit to go.  That said, get one when you can, if you can.<br />
<br />
At 51, definitely grab a Frosty, there is a reason everyone uses them.  I'd also suggest getting a Tae Ew War Maul, decent dps and aggro.  There are some similar 2hs worth getting for the same reasons, there just tend to be more options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For 2HS, Stonebladed Axe of Dismay is pretty nice.  44 44, I think.  And not too pricey.  Or a Widebladed Greatsword, which costs a bit more.  Both kick the crap aout of the Tae Ew War Maul, and are halfway decent at holding aggro because they do so much damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok you may be tired of hearing about this, but <br />
<br />
1. Find a troll smith (180+)<br />
2. Get the recepie(sic?) for Honed Blade of the Ykesha off Allakhazam's.<br />
3. Get 2 Short Swords of the Ykesha<br />
4. Success in him making 2<br />
5. Rip up the competition with your new 12-22 weapons that proc a 75 dd and stun. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd main hand the frostbringer over the barnacle covered axe, such a bad ratio on the barnacle covered axe and I think the proc is basically equivelant to frostys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bag or sell bloodfire; buy frostbringer. you win :D<br />
that combo will last you to 60 easily; and than some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tae Ew War Maul tends to be fairly cheap and is a good way to work up 2hb for those warriors who haven't spent 50 levels ignoring 2hb.  Plus, unlike 2hs, which are pretty much a dime-a-dozen, there aren't too many 2hb out for a 51 warrior and TEWM is one of the better ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ggak</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have bought some new weapons, amongst other a TEWM which I got really cheap, and a baranacle covered axe. Am looking for a frosty but cant seem to find one.<br />
<br />
A guildie said that I should keep the Blood fire as its a great agro weapon aswell, but if I want a frosty I have to sell it to get the pp for the frosty.<br />
<br />
Why should I sell the blood fire, why is the frosty such a better agro weapon then the BF ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diggs</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if money's tight and your in a guild which can do it, and have faction, you can just kill the dragons outside of ToV for the head or whatever you need for the FB.  If memory serves its a &quot;greater&quot; head and forget the giant NPC.  The FB is really a great agro weapon for those of us who can't or don't raid.  I have not got the chance to use a bloodfire so don't know how the agro would compare but would assume it is fair being a DoT proc.<br />
<br />
BTW, how good is the barnacle covered axe for agro, was tempted to get one just to try out, they are dirt cheap, which fits my budget perfectly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">06-25-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently use a Frosty on main and Defender's on secondary, I have a Spiked Velium Mallet (120DD) on a bag in case I need more procs, but more than often, I just tank with those 2 and Frosty's proc is more than enough (sometimes it doesnt proc and it might get harder... but oh well, not like it never was).<br />
I read on some other post that for each point of a DD proc, you get the same amount of raw agro, if thats true, Frosty procs a 60DD + 15ac debuff, and barnacle is 100 raw agro, so I would say that Frosty's debuff is way more than the 40 raw agro difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GSoT is lvl 56 and up, I am still only lvl 51 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I currently have 4 weapons at level 52- Frosty, Def. Lightblade, Bed Leg Club, and Stonebladed Axe of D.<br />
<br />
Chosing a weapon steup depends on what kind of group I'm in really. Last night, with a cleric/wiz/ranger/rog/necro in group, I used frosty and lightblade, because there was no haster. Any time I have spell or song haste though, I switch to the 44/44, and hold aggro as well as, if not better, than dual wielding, and the extra DPS makes kills go faster. Besides, I like seeing big numbers ;)  ( 595 crip, anyone?)<br />
<br />
You've got a TEWM, that should work just as good, what it lacks in ratio it makes up for in speed. I've found that i need to use dual wield if there is no haster though- I tried using the 44/44 in that group i mentioned, and couldnt hold aggro. Ranger was using veksar 12/20 1hs in primary, and rogue had 14/27 poker I think. When I switched to dual wield, I held aggro *most* of the time, and if/when frosty procced, the mob stuck to me the rest of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
gotta love summon mobs, some learn not to get aggro, some never do<br />
