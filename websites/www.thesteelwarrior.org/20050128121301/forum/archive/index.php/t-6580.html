Have to say first off I like the site alot. Get alot of great suggestions from other powergamers like myself. Ok here my question. My first eq character ever was a warrior, I love being MT, but had serious aggro issues and I just felt I made mistakes when building him. ie. Half Elf's dont have the best melee stats and I didnt seriously research what melee skills to go with so I attained lvl 54 and only had 1hs maxxed big mistake on my part. So i benched Semyrhage and moved on to a Pally (This was pre Melee enhancements) Have to admit Pallys ruled aggro and LDoN pulls were a breeze.<br />
Now its post Melee enhancement and I had heard alot of good things about Warrior return to aggro control. So this time I decided that I would make a new Warrior and do it the right way. I am now lvl 50 with a Froglok ( I felt they had great all around melee stats) Now Im wondering were to go with my gear. I've consolidated alot of my alts and purchased almost all of the best droppables I could find. Here is my Magelo I was wondering if any  of you guys see any items I should look into upgrading. Also wondering since I dual wield SoD's which is better ang III aug or Yak<br />

Well I have a BP but at lvl 50 The regen seems to help a little. I understand AC will be more important as i get around 55+ lvl. Its a spare BP from my Pally. Would have liked Farwater Plate BP but its nearly impossible to find a GM Smith who sells it to non Guildies.<br />
