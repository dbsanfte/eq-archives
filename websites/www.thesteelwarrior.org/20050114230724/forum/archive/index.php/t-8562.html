<br />
Not uber guilded, do do open raids, but that wont really earn me gear. While I am not made of plat--at least for now upgrades are looking to be few and far between--so I think can save up money. <br />
<br />
Really want something that procs--and I think at this point I would rather DW.</div></div><hr />

He's easily 2 groupable by any decent group of 65's. BoC is buyable. Thats about as good as it gets without a raid guild IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have a few options, SoD, BoC, CHSD and GBoS.  <br />
<br />
Of the 4, you can buy the BoC and the SoD.  Both will run you some serious plat depending on your server.  <br />
<br />
Like Haas said you can work raids and get a GBoS, or maybe even a CHSD if you can find people raiding Xanamech.  I know that people are somewhat down on the CHSD, but you can spawn Xanamech every 2 hours, vs waiting some 8 or however many hours it is for the BoT guy to spawn.  (assuming he isnt up already =p) <br />

<br />
what am i not seeing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The stun procs are equal aggro, however, the CHoS is slightly better damage than the SoBS. The CHoS should then be more aggro than the SoBS. It's not really a choice to spaz over, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obsidian Scimitar of War is another weapon to look at, I know that VZ gets killed pretty often on the nameless, and can think of at least twice where the sword rotted =/<br />
It's aggro is in the same league as GBoS/CHSD (probably a bit better actually) and it has better stats/dps and a proc mod, so early procs happen more often. Plus it looks cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, If you already have the Copper hammer of striking I wouldnt recommend going for the Great Blade of Storms. It is marginally better at best.<br />
13/20 vs 14/18. Yes it is a bit faster and 1 more damage but I dont consider it to be that superior. They share the exact same proc. The thing is, the Great blade doesnt always drop, and if it is the very drop you are after be prepared to have to do Eindride multiple times. Additionally, since you would be doing him via open raids be prepared to have to roll against other melee types. By the way, yes he is 2 groupable but it requires 2 GOOD groups, IE if you are already capable of farming BOT tower nameds then maybe 2 groups of that caliber and it wont be an easy fight.<br />
I might be biased towards not bothering because I farmed the hell out of Eindride and it took me 60 tries ( yes I said 60 ) on him before I got my Great Blade of Storms. On the other hand I have seen a ton of Breastplates.<br />
Another option for you if you are capable of taking out Eindride:<br />
Cord hilted spike driver ( unresistable hate proc )<br />
<br />
Naralli Ironsmith</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMHO, GBoS is more than marginally better.  A .78 ratio &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a .65 ratio.  That an increase of 17% to 20% depending on how you do the math.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">08-21-2004, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GBoS is much better than the CHoS ... there really isnt much of a comparison there.<br />
<br />
The actual difference is much greater than 17% or 20% if you're talking mainhanded and capitalizing on the dmg bonus.</div></div><hr />
